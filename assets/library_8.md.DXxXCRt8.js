The original driver would randomly work and, following the advice of a reviewer, we installed the driver for the HP 9600. Our main problems with this printer are as follows:1. The print file will spool but the printer will not start printing or2. The printer will spit out blank pages.It seems to work marginally better with the 9600 driver and only fails to print on every third or fourth plot now. The only solution seems to be to restart the computer's print spooler but even then it is haphazard as it will then play \\"catch up\\" and start printing out whatever files are still in the memory.So, listen to all the negative reviews...we cannot all be wrong. I'll never buy another HP printer again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks:","review":"Bought the HP 9800 for 13X19 Prints. The printer printed two outstanding prints and after that it would only print a half page of totally black ink.

In talking with the folks who sold me the printer, they said under the warranty HP should replace or give me a newer model, however that is not how it works. In short the warranty was a waste of money and time. The company should be more responsible for their products. It is the same old problem that HP has had with printers, and they know that and they putting out products with the same results.

I put up with it for a while because I couldn't afford to trash it and buy a different model. It'll work fine one second, then another it will print dark on one side and light on the other. Frustrating especially when you are using high-grade, expensive photo paper for portfolio purposes. Now I'm without a reliable large format printer. I will never buy anything HP again.

Cancel = unplug!Set up to do the fancier things it is supposed to do is a challenge worthy a rocket scientist.Drivers are problematic -- you think you have it set correctly in the application, but the printer then goes its own psycho way and messes it up -- this is especially true with the paper orientation choice.Don't buy -- look elsewhere"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal on an 11x17 printer","review":"I've been using the HP Deskjet 9800 for a couple of months now and it's been terrific.

I primarily use it for AutoCAD drawings with 13\\" X 19\\" paper and it does a fine job. SLOW, yes, but if you're not in a hurry, the end product is fine for presentation quality architectural, mechanical or electronic drawings. I have not yet tried large photo prints, but the 8.5\\" X 11\\" photos I've printed look very good. For the cost, this printer is about as good as one can expect for generating \\"large format\\" drawings. I have had no problems with the paper jamming. The 13\\" X 19\\" sheets can be fed in from the front just like the 8.5\\" X 11\\" paper, so you only need access to the front of the printer. So far, both sizes of paper (8.5\\" X 11\\", and 13\\" X 19\\") feed and print well, but SLOW. Yeah, the printer has kind-of-a large footprint with regard to width, but that's not unexpected since you're probably buying it for it's wide-printing capabilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something went bad fast with this printer","review":"It started out great. I didn't even use it much as it was reserved for photos and tabloid size printing at work. Then suddenly it couldn't deal with the HP 99 photo ink cartridges anymore. The color photos are atrocious with too much green and black or everything blurry. I tried cleaning heads, doing realignments, changing ink carts. Nothing helped. The photos look okay using just the black and tricolor ink carts. Did something change with the HP 99 ink carts? Did I just get a bad batch? Also, it can't seem to center photos on the page, even if I check emulate laser margins."},{"rating":"1","title":"biggest waste of money ive ever spent","review":"I wanted a wide format printer for scrapbooking. the first one I was able to afford through ebay I think was this HP designjet beautiful printer I was never able to set it up as it was incompatable with EVERYTHING.

HP has not perfected home user wide format printers yet.I returned it for the Canon i9900 wide format printer which, granted, was $100 more but the quality is simply amazing. 91 positive reviews can't be wrong. I was so impressed with the Canon quality that I scooped up a PIXMA 780 All-In-One for myself. Also a tremnedous number of positve reviews there as well.

We're a branding/graphic design firm and so we need a printer that will print high quality prints on A3 for our customer to sign off.We have no end of problems with it doing it's own thing, picking up several pieces of paper at once, or spitting out thin card fed through the back without printing anything, it also adds strange squares like watermarks when printing images, the worst problem is that it prints everything skewed. We sent it back to have it fixed. It came back unfixed and covered in scratches.The best quality we can coax out of it never reflects the design and quality of artwork which are present on the A4 Epson colour laser printer. The colours are always flat and often accompanied by the run lines where the print heads have been, even on the highest quality settings.We have an HP9800, we have a sledgehammer , once the print cartridges run out we'll be introducing them to each other..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"My business ordered this printer specifically to print out 11\\" x 17\\" PDFs for architectural plans. Yeah, good luck with that, because all it did was give the printer a stroke, even at a relatively small filesize. The largest file we could print out at those dimensions was a JPG blown up in size. The instructions are sparse, and HP's website offers no more help in the Troubleshooting section than \\"Make sure the printer is plugged in and connected to the computer.\\" I would warn anyone away from this printer.

I am tired of begging, pleading, restarting my computer and printer over and over again to try and get this to print a freaking sheet. I have absolutely no idea why it is refusing to print right now. The software on this is just unbelieveably bad. This is such an exercise in frustration. I can't tell you how many times I have wanted to beat the thing with a baseball bat. It does a decent job in printing photos -- if you can get it to actually OBEY you -- but I cannot keep wasting half of my afternoon getting it to print one page of a floor plan so I can get on with my workday. I also had a terrible experience with an hp laptop. I'm never buying anything HP ever again. I don't have a lot of other software issues so it is not my system -- it is this piece of garbage printer/software. Don't waste your money on this -- more importantly, don't waste your TIME on this.

Strike one: Horrible paper handling. Bought it for printing 12x12\\" scrapbook pages along with ordinary correspondence. But not all scrapbook papers are precisely the same size. So if the paper is 11-15/16\\" instead of 12\\" it is stupidly rejected. It often chews up cardstock by twisting it sideways and doesn't like photo paper either; annoying in a \\"photo\\" printer.Strike two: Lousy ink formulation. My old HP 970cxi prints beautifully on vellum that I like to use for overlays and titles. I expected the same with this one. But after struggling to coax the paper thru, the ink just beads up and smears.Strike three: Shakes worse than an old dot-matrix even though it is relatively slow. They must have built it using an old carriage design. I finally moved the printer to a bottom shelf because I worried about my other equipment. You can imagine it doesn't get much use anymore.What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"driver got downgraded","review":"I used to be able to completely control quality, color, and resolution settings within the printer driver.

I note that this year, 2012, has been a very bad year for winter mountain climbers, with over a score lost in North America and Europe.

Also, the platform is nice, as you can start pedaling and not be fully clicked in yet and eventually find the right spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squier is underrated","review":"While it's true this compilation contains some glaring omissions, on balance, it has nearly all of Squier's most well-known hits. It's also true that, for casual listeners, Squier's Greatest Hits cd will probably suffice. For long-time fans, however, the gems here are the first two tracks from Squier's mid-70s stint with Piper. Material from Piper is unavailable elsewhere and, frankly, I'm amazed those two albums have not been re-released. Squier's work with Piper was a precursor to fine-tuning his rock-pop sensibilities obvious in his later more popular periods. This compliation would have been better served had it been a true career retrospective and included a few more Piper tunes. All in all, not a bad effort, just not inclusive enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wow from Winterson","review":"If you love her novels, you'll most likely love her short stories. What a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"the world and other places","review":"I thought this book was awful in every way. Extremely pretentious writing style, full of stilted and forced \\"concepts\\" and contrived points-of-view to display to the reader the author's self-image as incredibly witty, literary and superior. In short, it has all the hallmarks of a novice. I feel guilty writing such a negative review, because I really enjoyed one of her other books, \\"The Passion\\". Now I realize that her artificial voice, heavy-handed attempts at interesting word juxtapositions, and phony contrivances work better when she is describing a fantasy setting in which she obviously must invent a character and its imaginary inner life. I would not give this book away to anyone, much less recommend people spend money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good insight into the real markets","review":"This is definately a beginners book.

Well, I'll be selling Bloc Party concert tickets if that's any indication."},{"rating":"2","title":"S.S.E. - Solid Sophomore Effort","review":"I like both Silent Alarm and A Weekend in the City, though, while Silent Alarm seems to have higher highs and lower lows, A Weekend in the City is more level throughout, with a more cohesive and adjoined nature. While I don't think any one track has the instant-classic element that Banquet did, all the tracks on A Weekend in the City are solid and sound like they all could have been written solely in one weekend in the city. It feels like a genuine album, and while Silent Alarm was one as well, on that album it feels like the songs could have been written over a much lengthier period of time. I think the title on this newest release is fitting and symbolic of its feel. I'm real curious to see where Bloc Party goes next and applaud this sophomore effort, for it maintains their trademark sound that sets the band apart and leaves the road wide open for growth possibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Generation","review":"A very strong record from a great band. Each track is filled with emotion and despair, but also hope and life. Some might say better than Silent Alarm, but that is like comparing apples to oranges.

I would highly recommend this album to anyone wanting to get into a new type of music as you really should not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sense of disappointment","review":"To the same level that \\"Silent Alarm\\" was a refreshing burst of high octane original post punk rock n' roll \\"Weekend in the City\\" is a disappointing pyre of overproduced electronic ennui. I appreciate Bloc Party's artistic ambition in making such a radical departure from their previous sound, but not the art. Even the standout track, \\"Uniform,\\" which if taken as seriously as it takes itself, demands comparison to the much more subtle \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" and in that context it leaves one with \\"a sense of disappointment.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I don't like having to write negative reviews...however. I am pretty enthusiastic about much of the new music that gets played on alternative radio (such as the almighty KEXP in Seattle) and thus bought this CD based on the buzz around this band. Unfortunately, I didn't hear much to match the hype. The singers voice quickly grated on my nerves and repeated listens only verified my first impression. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Party pooper","review":"I was very disappointed with this latest album. There were only one or two songs I could find any redeeming qualities in.

I got an advanced copy of this album months ago... gave it MANY spins hoping to feel the same spark as with their debut. The song production is overzealous, and has none of the the grit, hooks, and thrive as their previous effort. Too ambitious in my opinion and nothing really sticks."},{"rating":"1","title":"big let down","review":"I need to throw in a desenting opinion. I'm a huge BP fan and pretty well wore out Silent Alarm, which I thought was the runaway disc of the year. Maybe my expectations were too high then because this disc is totally uninspiring. I don't doubt that the lyrics are timely, thought provoking, and occasionally poetic, but the tunes are just boring. I'm not a musician or music critic, but I know what I loved about Silent Alarm - edgy lyrics, unique compositions, great hooks, and damn catchy beats. Hell, it gave rise to a remix version. This effort loses me entirely and is more apt to put me to sleep than out dancing.I'll give it another try to see if I can drink the Kool-Aid like many other reviewers seem to have done.

But it is very clear considering that it is mono. the voices are so well caught that it doesn't affect the enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched sound!","review":"In spite of what a previous reviewer said this is not a good example of 1950's monaural sound. Since this is a live performance you expect to hear stage noises and distractions. But should everything have to sound so distant? The original engineers did not do a good job recording the work and you can't restore sound if the master recording is bad.The question is how good is the performance? Is it worth listening to despite the poor sonics? Not really. This may be a good performance, but it's hardly a great one. There are many better mono performances, let alone stereo ones. There's nothing wrong with the singers or conductor in this recording, but their performances are surpassed by other artists. These other artists are, of course, recorded in much better sound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great computer","review":"I love this computer.

The zippers open easily to get to the camera.I use the camera for work, so I needed something that didn't take up too much room on my belt - it isn't in the way when I'm sitting in the car or with my customers.

I buy thinly sliced smoked salmon from my local deli, the difference is that liquid from this is the dense salmon oil( the superior fat oil).as far as comparing taste and texture, seabear had a nice smoky flavor this was the only thing positive for me. Hands down my locally purchased salmon is way better, and it costs much less. This isn't about cost if I was offered seabear salmon at 75% off, I would pass. I'll never order this again I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"This is far too overpriced, you get three small filets that have a terrible smell to them, almost like day old tuna. It works out to about 12 dollars for a 6 oz salmon filet that really isn't even good. You can get it fresh, minus the horrible smell and not already precooked. To be perfectly honest, a can of bumblebee tuna would be better than this and it would cost you 35 less dollars, I only purchased it by mistake and the seller immediately hit the shipping soon button and would not stop shipment even after request. Worst transaction I've had on Amazon to date.I couldn't even stomach to taste it, that's how bad the smell was, huge waste of money, just go to the store and get a filet yourself, cheaper and better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Salmon","review":"Not everyone has the same expectations for smoked fish. Some people prefer it smoked to a crisp; other people prefer smoked fish that is nearly raw. The folks at Seabear seem to have found a good, in between, place.I've used this product several times and have always enjoyed it. The salmon is smokey and flavorful, flakey, firm, and tasty. The salmon ships in foils pouches, each containing a couple of ounces of salmon oil. You can pour it down the drain if you prefer a drier fish (but that's a lot of good omega-3 fatty acids to waste). Used in salmon pasta with a little olive oil, sundried tomatoes, and a little black pepper (let it sit over night in the fridge for the flavors to mix) it is a summer favorite. If you like your smoked salmon moderately moist, yet firm, Seabear is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright","review":"Nice company, will answer your emails.This fish is ok.

The loops shake with life, the voice of Plavka (who sang for Shamen on \\"Move Any Mountain\\") is beautiful and lush, the synthy textures and pads seem to run over your body like warm tropical water. This is a rich, heavenly CD that has a pinch of cold digital strangeness and dark, ethereal mystery. Very sophisticated and moody, but always a pleasure for your ears. Most of the CD is very ambient and trancey. The songs \\"Right In The Night\\" and \\"Find Me\\" use galloping euro-disco rhythms to support more traditionally structured songs, with the chanteuse Plavka's angelic, beckoning voice flying above. Nice squirty synths and other euro textures will ooze out of your speakers from this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"where's 2002?","review":"This is a very nice piece of music but only half of the project! If you can get your hands on 2002 the second cd of \\"fairytales\\", you will see how greatly j&s have influenced our music since their inception. Stella is undoubtedly the godfather of all trance. the version here is a shorter one than the complete stella (10:24) however, it fits nicely into 2001. All in all, this is definitely a journey worth taking. It flows nicely from one song to the next and somehow manages NOT to sound like 1993. Again, if you can find 2002, there are some gems on this one as well.

I have been satisfied for the most part, until this DVD collection.I truly expected a series of horror films staring M.C. Hammer. I expecting him to battle mummies and vampires with a certain Oaktown style that only he could.

This is a nifty set that brings out some of the films that were not released in the package that Warner Brothers brought out earlier--and some of these (especially \\"Night Creatures\\" and \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\") are films that haven't been seen for awhile and have been missed. (\\"Phantom\\" while not as elaborate as the latest version, is still better than the two TV remakes and the dreadful Robert Englund version.) If you pay careful attention, however, notice that the picture of the Phantom on the inside is not Herbert Lom but Claude Rains. They had the same problem with the Gary Cooper collection when the had pictures from Ronald Colman's silent version of \\"Beau Geste\\" instead of Gary Cooper's!

The characters and storylines are so wonderfully crafted, that the reader wants nothing more than to see what will happen next. It's almost unbelievable how much the main character, Tom Red Hawk, goes through in the course of his tale, but each one of his experiences lingers in the reader's mind so vividly, as to seem as though they had experienced them for themselves. This book has elements of nearly every genre: war, mystery, romance, humor, the mafia, and the unstoppable spirit and determination of a man who's been through everything.I was an English student of Robert Vasquez for my first semester of college, and I came to know him as a very intelligent and capable professor, and as a good person. Now, after having read his book, I know him to have been a very passionate and exceptional writer. The literary world should definitely mourn the loss of such a talent.

I bought numerous copies to support the Stop Children's Cancer cause, and gave them to friends who liked the CD's so much they ordered additional copies to share.

Hoffman's style is merely a crude caricature of the master's work. He would better serve himself as an artist by developing something original of his own. To do that, he would need to look at a broad spectrum of other artists and attempt to learn from them. It's doubtful that this will ever happen though. Hoffman, though a very minor figure in the fantasy art market, is known primarily as a malcontent who spends his time tearing down the work of others and spewing personal attacks against successful contemporary illustrators. It's unfortunate, because he has alienated the very people who could have helped him develop a successful career in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"But . . . but . . . but . . .","review":"But why are the rear ends on his depictions of women so huge?Some even appear to have cellulite on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"Bought this for my son for Christmas.

After trying to watch it last night I decided to give a review. I realize we all have different tastes in movies. I rate it on the following. First , the use of four letter words was a little over used. The sex parts seemed just thrown in for shock effect and served no real purpose in the story ( If it had one)The film jumped from b&w to color and from old times to modern randomly through out. Very disconnected. More like a Sci-Fi than any other kind of film. I found myself fast forewarding to try and connect the parts in the story, but had no luck. It's a long movie ,so I wasted a evening trying to make some connection with it. The acting was poor and over done as was the gory parts. I decided there was no one I knew who would want to see this movie so opened the lid and cut the tape and threw it in the garbage because thats what it is, GARBAGE."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read and historical reference for any Star Wars fan!","review":"This graphic novel is a great history filler for the time that lapsed between A New Hope and Empire.

The worst sign of a boring, bromide of a movie is when Larry King turns up in the first five minutes to offer his asinine comments. This movie is heavy on interviews of kneecap-kissing milquetoasts, and short of anything interesting. It's a talkfest among a wrinkle-room of blowhards pontificating about how powerful Lew (Who?)

It sounds like something from the future. Well, the future from 1979. With It's thumping bass, phat beat, and of course the funk it sounds like something Ice Cube would sample. Also, the live perfomances of ROCK 'N' ROLL JELLY, JAMAICAN BOY, (w/Jeff Beck), & HOT FUN are worth being played over & over again.

The CD is a nice swan song for the great soul man from Memphis who had a lot to do with putting the Stax sound on the American music map."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome yoyo","review":"the mag turbine is an awesome yoyo if you want long sleep times and pretty good looping. its bad for string tricks because of how responsive it is. but its great in every other area"},{"rating":"2","title":"timeless classic","review":"If you are a fan of Bob Hope or the performers of this era,this would be a great dvd to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and cozy, like it should be for a superhero!","review":"We wanted the costume that didn't have all the bulk in it. This was perfect. My son is 4 and it was a little big, but I just think- hey, he can wear it to play in for a good year or so. He'll get lots of wear out of this. It would be nice if the boot covers fit tighter, but they were good enough! Easy on and off...we actually had a whole outfit on under it to keep warm, so there's your muscle bulk, if that's what you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the sewing quailty","review":"Bought this, and was shipped super fast but the quality of the stitching was subpar for under 20 dollars the sticthes had to be reinforced the day he put it on and the following 6 days he wore it.

Day two, had my mother re-sew all the seams, fabric is still terrible but hopefully will last several more outings! Sad because this is a very cute costume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad quality, I doubt it will make it through Halloween","review":"My son really likes his costume, since it arrived 2 days ago he's wanted to wear it non-stop. But it's really poorly made. Since we unpacked it the superman logo on the chest was coming off on one side, I had to glue it back on. And several seams are coming undone (from the very first day), so I have to keep sewing them back together. Last year we bought a Buzz Lightyear costume that's still in perfect shape except for some fading from washing and my son has worn it almost everyday for a year. I was hoping this Superman costume would hold up just as well, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bible on DVD:Alexander Scourby","review":"My mother, Margie Crews, and I are enjoying this very much.

It pretty much follows the story from beginning to end of what it says about Paul in the Book of Acts (the only book of the New Testament that tells a historical account of what happened after Jesus' death), but includes archival and archaelogical history too. In the end credits it has the date in roman numerals as (1997). It is supposedly narrated by Ben Kingsley. I thought it was a very good telling of the story, with historical tie-in to other historical things we know about the time period. The DVD also has a Bonus feature that is 1-hour long, entitled 'First Martyrs in Rome'(1991) hosted by Joseph Campanella.

Their trademark sound is still there but presented in a more mature and refined form ! Some slight ska or reggae tracks are reminiscent of the groups'heyday when they were a part of the English Beat ( Ranking Roger being the lead singer). The rest of the tracks are of a soft-alternative nature with nothing displeasing to the ears.It's pop at it's best for the mid 90's.As for the pictures and photography,as one previous reviewer pointed out, are surely questionable ! This is truly a hidden treasure that never received any proper airplay,advertising, or recognition.This is one title not to be missed just because it never saw the light of day.

While the movie is OK, the problem is Warner Brothers consistent strategy to provide digital copies through Ultraviolet. Cheapness beats quality every time. Ultraviolet replied to my question as to how to move to iTunes this time with a \\"NO\\". In the past they offered methods of downloading the file into iTunes.

This movie made me feel sad and a little dirty. It tried to be more than it needed to be, or was, it wasn't fun. It never found it's footing and it was just depressing. There aren't enough half naked guys in the world to make it worth watching. And really, I don't get that grinding stuff anyhow. I think Gilles Marini was hotter in a few seconds of washing himself than all those guys were in the hour plus of torture this movie was. You won't listen to me and you'll still watch it, but don't say I didn't warn you.And maybe it's my age or that I'm a Mom, but the fact that one of the main strippers is 19 really bothered me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot","review":"I really like Channing Tatum.

Acting was poor, scenes were sloppy and not very believable. If you're looking for whatever, it's not there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I saw countless ads for this movie, and it looked entertaining. Matthew McConaughey's sly little grin and quip about all the \\"law-breakers\\" in the audience looked promising. Joe Manganiello was very handsome and witty in interviews, so I ordered the dvd. I thought it would be light-hearted and fun to watch. It wasn't. It turned out that that brief clip of McConaughey was the only good part he had in the movie. And Joe Manganiello? If you look closely, you might spot him in the background occasionally. I do not find Channing Tatum at all attractive, and it was his beefy bod that was in most of the scenes. The plot, such as it was, seemed more a chronicle of a character's descent into addiction than anything else. By the end of the movie, I really didn't care what happened to any of these people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic Mike","review":"The acting was bad. I think the actors that played in this movie forgot how to act.

Otherwise, a very boring waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Magical About This Movie!","review":"We were tricked by a trailer of Channing Tatum dancing, but this movie was awful. I still watched it...but that's just because Channing is so great to look at, but apart from him the movie was awkward, out of sync and sleazy bad. It was filled with sadness and despair and if that was the moral, then great I got it! This is not a desired lifestyle and there is always someone trying to scam you, someone younger waiting to take your place, and we're not getting younger --- go it. I would have rated the movie higher if I was just rating Channing, but overall the movie stunk bad! It is not a movie I'd watch again - the dances are so few and brief in this movie and that's probably b/c outside of Channing, no one else could dance. It was not nearly as good as the trailers made it appear. I'm underwhelmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely worth watching","review":"The story line, acting and script writing was absolutely horrid.

What a disappointment. I was almost uncomfortable watching it all. It seems like the best filming was during the stripping/dancing, and then the rest was low budget, fairly poor acting. I like C.T., I think he has skill...in this movie, he is just the meat. Matthew McCaughnehey was over-acting the entire film. Storyline was extremely predictable, and the ending was...well, what ending really? It's almost as if the writers just threw in a \\"love story\\" plot without taking the time to develop it, then the end comes and all of a sudden two people end up together? I could've skipped the flick. I've never reviewed a movie until now...just wanted to forewarn people.

I wish I'd listened to what many of the other reviewers said and saved my five bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not a good movie.","review":"Even the stripping wasn't that great.

The movie production company that thought this was a movie worth producing? Just plan horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic Mike not very magic","review":"I was very disappointed with this film.There had been so much hype that I expected something better and was very disappointed.

I liked the dance moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"My wife convinced me to watch this movie because of good critic reviews. That was a mistake.

My wife did not like it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"I See How He Got His Name","review":"I only had to watch two minutes of Magic Mike before I saw Channing Tatum's butt and Matthew McConaughey shirtless. That right there is enough to make this a must-see for women and gay men. Okay, this is not a great movie. Not even close. For a movie about male stripping, there is probably only about ten or fifteen minutes of actual stripping. There should have more stripping, and less drama about drugs and stuff. But is it worth seeing? Definitely. And Matthew McConaughey might give the most entertaining performance of his career in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"This movie was not what I was expecting, it actually had a pretty good storyline.

If you appreciate the male form, you should definitely watch this! If you're shy about guys and think only women should show off their bodies, this movie is NOT for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and a complete let down","review":"The film style was lacking. There were not many close-ups so it was hard to get into the story without that effect of \\"being in the moment\\" with the characters. I was expecting a cute love story, but there was no chemistry between the Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) and Brooke (Cody Horn). Of course there were sexy men in the film, but it's not enough to keep you interested in the film. Overall, it was money poorly spent and it's two hours I'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awefull !!!!","review":"The story content was very weak.

I expected to be entertained, turned on, or at least it should have given me something to laugh at but, the plot was very weak, and I'm not convinced the girls brother was ever a football player.

I sat through all 111 minutes of it and not once did I see a single magic trick. It was just a bunch of boys with their shirts off flopping their genitals around.

It was so bad that at times the lack of a storyline and the complete and utter terribleness of the storyline overshadowed the dance routines. I gave this two stars (as opposed to one) because anything with a shirtless Channing Tatum is good... to an extent. Rent for fun with your girlfriends, but don't go into this expecting to be entertained in between the dance routines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"The movie was not what I expected.

Then again, I wasn't expecting much, but was hoping to be entertained. The actors themselves are accomplished, so I'm befuddled why any one of them would add this [insert word] to their established repertoire... Every one of them are buffed to the nines and yummy eye candy.

Florida has it's own beautiful light, take the yellow filter off, it makes everyone look jaundiced.Script...?? There isn't one, just some filler, in-between some average stripping. Channing's bum wobbles like jello, Matt Bomer looks great, but even that doesn't redeem this movie for me. Plus is it just me or is there something not right about Matthew McConaughey ?Anyway, if you want to see Male Strippers go to Chippendale's or a gay strip joint...maybe even rent 'The Full Monty', any of those options would be a lot more fun than this !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not able to view!!!","review":"After it was downloaded it would not open!

You can get the EXACT same effect by google'ing the stars names with the tag \\"shirtless\\" and it would be a MILLION times better. CRAP!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What' with the annoying yellow tint?!!!!!!!!!","review":"I can't believe I'm the only one who was bothered by the annoying yellow tint to the lighting throughout the entire movie!

Why would they do that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extras NOT on DVD!!","review":"Anyone who buys the DVD is in for a disappointment. The deleted scenes, particularly Matt Bomer's Ken Doll strip sequence, is ONLY ON THE BLU RAY! It is nowhere to be found on the DVD. Don't waste your money on the dvd. I don't own and can't afford either a HD TV or a Blu Ray player. This was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Not all of us has a blu ray. Some of us can't afford one. Why would the powers that be market it this way? Frankly, I'm not even sure that the Blu ray has the Ken Doll sequence at all. At least not in it's entirety. THIS SUCKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Channing Tatum saves this awful movie","review":"First let me say, I watched this movie for the obvious reason, to see Channing Tatum! Aside from stripping, he's an amazing dancer, really impressive. That being said... there was no supporting acting going on. Channing and the lead woman had no chemistry, the acting was sub-par, at best. The story line was really weak, and some of the stripping scenes were actually cringe-worthy. Matthew McConohay is a greasy weasel, Tarzan is just plain gross, and the other men are such bad dancers who can't compete with Channing. Don't waste your money on buying a copy of this.

We are not rating a dance scene here but a whole movie...and that whole movie SUCKS. The lead female has to be the worst actor I've ever seen. This movie is just beyond bad. And I'm not hard to please as far as movies go. But, no one will listen. So, go watch it...and then kindly review it. Everyone in this movie needs an acting lesson. McConaughey, too. Things must be TOUGH for him to accepted this role. As for Tatum - the guy can dance...but this is one movie to not be proud of. Of course, it's all about the money, and he made it. So, I guess the last laugh's on him. SAD what the public accepts these days. Even sadder what the industry is passing off as a motion picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and Disgusted","review":"So love Matthew McConnaughey -can't believe he'd stoop so low.

OK so its cool today and I am off so I dedided to curl up on the sofa and have a girly afternoon. Good grief this was the dullest, most monotonous, dreary movie ever. The acting was sloppy the plot predictable. The whole thing was second rate and pointless.

I mean seriously did the actors even read the script when they agreed to be in this ridiculous film. I am grateful that I didn't spend my money on this junk. I watched about half of the movie with a friend and couldn't take another minute of it. It's just SO bad on SO many levels. Actually saying it's bad is a massive understatment. It's awful. It actually deserves no stars, but that's not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I missed seeing this in the movie theater and wish I had as I wouldn't of ordered it. I was totally disappointed as the dancing, the story line, the whole movie itself made no sense. I didn't even know who the girl was that he supposedly gave up stripping for.

The acting wasn't that great and from all the reviews it got when it was in Theaters I really expected more than this. The dancing was probably the only good part in the movie, the drama was sub-par and the female lead... um yea ok.Don't waste your money buying this movie.

Although I love to look at gorgeous men and I'm a huge fan of Matt Bomer, this film was awful! There was barely any storyline and the way the movie was written they made it sound like all male dancers are drug addicts who sleep around a lot and use bad langauage. I personally know a male dancer and he's a sweet wonderful man and nothing like the guys in this movie. I hated all the drugs and bad langauage. I was hoping this movie had some romance in it but it was nothing about hot young sexy guys romancing. It was about hot young guys getting high on drugs, thinking they are the world's gift because they are young and hot and about them sleeping around a lot and I don't mean in a romantic way.

They take money for their performances and have dreams beyond the week end \\"bump and grind.\\" This movie is a poor excuse for some soft porn with no compelling tension or plot to tie it together. The end is predictable, the middle is too long (where is a good editor when you need one) with the salacious left in long and hard to grab the middle aged over weight lady demographic??? I don't know. Either way, it could not be considered anything but, as other reviewers have indicated, BAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought.","review":"The previews were incredibly deceiving. They marketed this movie toward women, with promises of a romance-comedy with reversed male and female roles than the typical romance-comedies. It was a full-on drama, which i do not usually watch. I, as a woman, was also promised eye-candy. Not the case. Sure, there were beautiful bodied men dancing about, but the story line just felt forced therefore completely outweighing the fun of seeing Chippendale-like shows. I'm sorry, but once there is substance abuse, betrayal, and death...you lose the fun in it. I just don't know what the producers where thinking. I do not recommend it to my friends and i do not recommend it to you.ONLY WATCH if you have a firm understanding that it is a DRAMA, not a romance-comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor story line","review":"Okay so based on the fact that this is based on Channing Tatums life it makes the story kinda interesting. Not to mention all the scenes where they're dancing is amazing. However would I buy this? NO. The story line was really weak and boring.

But then, I thought, \\"what better way to show off your OTHER assets\\"??? Oh my...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I walked out of the theater","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was absolutely horrifying and a drugged out stripper could of wrote a better story. I relied on the dancing to make up for the rest of the movie, but trust me it didn't. Just when you think things are going to get good (if you know what I mean) it skips to the next scene. I saw this movie for free and I can't imagine how angry I would be if I had to pay to watch this. Stay Away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"The dancing was weak. Matthew McConaughey was cheesy. The best part was in the beginning when he is talking about what the audience can touch. Channing Tatum is a skilled dancer, but he basically did the same moves over and over. The story line was predictable. I know really we ladies watch this for the stripping but that was pretty lame too, with very little cloths coming off. Overall just a lame movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie EVER","review":"this has to go down as one of the worst movies of all time.

Certainly was not my cup of tea. DVD had odd coloration on our TV set (which no other DVD has had). No plot to speak of, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This had little to no plot and was not even worth the guys dancing on screen...when there was actual dancing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too fun","review":"Just a simple, silly, guilty pleasure to watch with your girlfriends!

He is too good of and actor to play a role like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic Mike","review":"I love Channing Tatum! I loved Dear John! That was a very good movie. Watched it several times. I liked The Vow. But Magic Mike was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST ACTING/STORY EVER","review":"Acting was beyond awful.Not that I expected much but with all the hype and actors who have somewhat decent reputations I thought there might be some \\"surprise\\" to it..it was horrible! The story itself was lame,predictable,lame,slow,boring should I continue? But the acting...will give Channing Tatum credit considering his talent....he was the best actor in the film. Mathew gave his good\\"southern dude swagger\\" same one he does in beef commercials and ...well everything else. The girl(?name) sister of Alix P character was possibly the worst acting ever...I thought there was something wrong with the streaming her timimng was so off...says something about the director there too..too bad I wasted $4 and a few hours of my life for this.How did this get so much press? Makes Ben Afflecs Gili look good"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was bored, sorry","review":"I had been looking forward to watching this film because it received decent reviews and a good box office so I thought \\"Hey, maybe it's good\\" ... the dialogue was awful, the acting not much better. The only entertaining parts were the actual strip shows but everything in between was clunky and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah seriously 5 stars!","review":"Okay seriously, I refused to watch this movie for the longest time.. I was like oh no, this is so silly. But I gave in cause it was steven soderbergh so I had to watch it, twice ! ha.. I liked it a lot. Really enjoyed this film. From the acting, to cinematography, the look and feel. And holy smoke the performances of these 'strippers' where really nice to watch. Magic Mike blew my mind, he really danced amazing. I thought it was a great film. Its nice to see finally men taking off some of their clothes instead of women.Yep, I can recommend this film !"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Wife's Eye Candy","review":"This is my wifes movie..

I mean my expectations weren't that high as far as plot goes (movie about male strippers right?) but they were high as far as what I want out of a romantic comedy. Boy, was I disappointed. I don't know how a movie that had a near constant half-naked Channing Tatum could go that wrong but I wanted to turn this dark untoned movie off about halfway through. But, if you're curious like I was and need to see it for the sake of seeing it, go to Redbox or something, don't pay full for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless movie","review":"I knew this movie would be eye candy for girls but I was holding out hope that there might be a decent if somewhat cliche story. Yeah it was very predictable and you could see the plot points from a mile away but hey it had enough to be a serious movie.Ugh what a complete joke. The movie had no direction what so ever. Stories and characters that lead to nothing and have no resolution what so ever. It was a joke really. It's a pot of different ideas with no where to go or tie them together and it's all left unsolved. Almost like a rated R Chayote Ugly but with dudes. I think Strip tease might have a better story than this.So in other words. Unless your a girl, gay or a really really unlucky guy who got roped into seeing it by his evil wife/gf/friend then please avoid at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy with digital download!","review":"Digital download can not be used with iTunes!

If you have a thing for men in banana hammocks, this is the movie for you. As for me, I couldn't wait for it to end, and nearly fell asleep on it. It was so bad that my daughter walked out of the room in the middle of it. I thought this movie was an embarrassment with a very thin, and boring, yet predictable, plot. I'm glad I had a credit to use to see this, but even with the credit, it was a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to watch","review":"This movie has no story and its ponitless to watch.

Don't waste your time or money. Story is poor, writing even worse. Character development and engagement was also lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever!","review":"Never in my life had I walked out of a movie, until this one. Hands down the WORST movie I have ever seen. Aside from the fact that it's a movie targeted are dryed up, horny, old women, the movie's plot and story was terrible. Some people I was with stuck around and finished watching it (dont know how they did it) and they filled me in on what I missed which was essentially nothing. Kid becomes a stripper, kid begins selling drugs and ruins his life, while Channing Tatum's character quits stripping. What a waste of money!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brokeback without the Horses ?????","review":"Really?????????????????????5 Stars???????????????? Are you kidding me.....maybe for undersexed women this maybe the end all to end all coyote ugly movie, but to be sure I'm pretty sure it's not going to be Channing's \\"Brokeback\\" breakout movie he was looking for.PLEASE.........................."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I saw this move when it first came out and liked it. I wanted to see it again so I purchased this download. The download took almost 2 hours to complete but it was worth it. Channing Tatum is so cute in the movie and the ending is the best part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even good fluff.","review":"Absolutely no context of value. I don't even think it was scintillating for the womenI watched it with. Extremely boring at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"First, if you don't enjoy watching male strippers, this isn't for you. The dance scenes bring much of this film's energy to the front so if you find male nudity to be tasteless or boring, you'll miss much of this film's charms. That being said, the film's script and direction are just deep enough to keep this film from being eye candy alone but never so deep that the viewer who is watching for the eye candy is disappointed. Sure, the film fell into some cliché with its plot. (I could have done without the drug subplot). But the performances and the film's energy kept me interested until the end. Like one could discount Saturday Night Fever by calling it a \\"disco\\" movie, one could easily discount this as a \\"male stripper chick flick\\". But if you \\"get\\" what the film is trying to say about family and growing up, you might just enjoy this film on more than an aesthetic level."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"Story line was ok. Obviously people are going to watch it because of Channing and the stripping buuuuuut I loved the choreography and THAT is why I bought it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the fuss about?","review":"My wife wanted to rent this film since she had heard nothing but good things about it.

Sadly the other 10% ruined the 90% for me. This movie is dull. Terrible acting. And the storyline sucked. I get your brother involved with drugs by proxy and fall in love with you. So, sorry about your brother but you take me anyway. Mkay. What a waste of time. I want my 2 hours back. If you aren't offended by the language (which I expected some of but not as much as there was), and the terrible plot....if you can look past it, the eye candy is nice. But you see most of that in the trailer so just save yourself the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great eye candy!","review":"This is a great movie for ladies. There is a man for everyone in here.

The story line was so boring and i felt like they talked so slow to keep the movie going. I love Channing in Step up. But in this movie he was okay. I wish there was more than just the stripping because it seemed to be the only thing in the movie that had some action and nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie was terrible!","review":"Eye candy is only good for a little bit.

Then it goes to female strippers dancing in cages. Typical. I couldn't tell you what happened after the first 15 minutes because we shut it off. The acting was lame and the dancing wasn't enough to keep my attention or make it worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"magic mike","review":"quality was great. Channing Tatum and his moves, awesome. if you add all his dance scenes up you probably get around 10 min of him and his stripper moves. story line and movie plot, horrible. matthew mcconaughey was more annoying then ever. 10 minutes of Channing and his stripper moves isn't enough to watch this movie ever again. one time viewing in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"I decided to rent this movie after several friends raved about it. First of all, I feel is was misbilled by the trailers which portrayed it to be funny and somewhat lighthearted. The storyline was choppy and disjointed and the content was much darker than I expected. All in all, Channing is pretty to look at but this movie is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic Mike movie","review":"I choose two stars because this movie was predictable and badly acted.

The movie is largely plotless. The acting matches the plot, in that it's missing too. If you like looking at male bodies, my female relatives say the first 20 minutes is worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard","review":"Poor movie, not worth the money and I am I big fan of the star of the show, but a very disappointing movie, not worth $5.00 in my view, maybe $1 at Redbox if there is absolutely nothing else to watch. Really a surprising letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very big fan of Channing, but this movie falls flat on its ass.","review":"I have enjoyed just about every movie Channing has done, but this one is a total stink bomb. The movie just dragged on, coming in just under the 2 hour mark. The acting was really good, the story just wasn't there for a 2 hour movie, it would of probably still fell dragged out at 1hr & a 1/2, so to push out as far as they did was a very horrible decision. There were a few funny moments, mostly in the dances, but that is it. My advice is to rent this first to see if you like it or would even consider watching it again.Hope this helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy","review":"While the plot isn't that great and the ending is downright stupid, I still love this movie. Who wouldn't love hot men shaking it!? I figured the plot would be mediocre at best so I didn't have high hopes. I just wanted to see some sexy men on my television! Also, the bonus scene is NOT on the DVD it's only on the BLU-RAY which was not stated clearly when I pre-ordered this. I was very disappointed about that because I thought I was getting the steamy bonus scene!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to love????","review":"The story was average at best, but the dance numbers were incredible!

When i saw the previews over the summer it was on my must see list. SOOOOO glad i did not waste 10 dollars to go see this crappy movie. The dancing (channing tatum's only because all the other \\"strippers\\" did where the 1,2 half step) was the ONLY good thing (well...and the fact that most of the men had bodies u can drool over) about this movie. And to think they have a sequel coming out. I ask FOR...WHY?? an hour or so out of my life wasted"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated the story line","review":"The dancing was fantastic, but the story line stunk.

You will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second worst movie of 2012","review":"I must admit I knew this movie would be a disappointment but I was bored. Alas, I am even more disappointed as now my suspicions have been confirmed. This really is a bad movie. If there is a record for the number of times the F word has been used in a movie, I am quite sure Magic Mike would be the frontrunner. Is it called writing when ever other word is profane.

There was little review dancing, a lot of single dancing (where I could tell there was a stand-in), a lot of crotch grabbing and the story was pretty sad.A much better movie is \\"Dear John\\", which could have turned dark in a number of places, but didn't. I was surprisingly pleased with THAT movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This movie was really bad.

The strip scenes are mostly funny and (thank you, director!!) decent enough. The \\"drug me so I can take this life\\" topic has been knitted into the script nicely - the viewer never gets to misunderstand the life behind the facade and that quick money is not everything.To all the Channing fans: you'll enjoy it, cause the man has the smoothest moves and he can cry so lovely, you'll never doubt him.To everybody else: a \\"can see\\" but not a \\"must see\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot","review":"So Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfer (I'm sorry I'm not sure how to spell it) are super hot but seriously this film had absolutely no plot and I got really bored after like... 45 mins but the dancing made up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Kind of a stupid movie, I love the actors but this work is not their best.

This movie has great entertainment value and I would watch over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic Mike","review":"For all the hype, not a particularly enjoyable movie.

I found myself wandering away to do other things, like checking to see if any dishes needed to be washed. Boring, boring, boring. I haven't seen such bad acting in a long time, and the whole movie seems to comprise a bunch of guys wandering around making up the script as they go along. The whole thing just drags. And the supposed love interest? She's the worst of the bunch. I hope she doesn't quit her day job, as Mike says at one point. I thought the dance sequences might be a saving grace, but they aren't.

The chemistry between Mike and his 'love' interest was non-existent. Although Channing Tatum did look like an acting rock star next to whoever that lady was. The ending was lacking...i'll just leave it at that. Another indicator that an actual story line was not important in this movie. Also the Matthew McConaughey strip scene at the end was soooo awkward, but to be fair I was praying the movie was over by that point, which thankfully it was, so it might not have been his fault. I was just cringing throughout the whole thing. I'm a female...I love hot naked guys, but I guess I need a little story time to go with it (Unless I am literally at a male strip club!!!) because Magic Mike was a disaster for me. Disaster......."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get more than you expected","review":"If you expected sexy, hard-bodied actors ripping their velcro pants off, then you came to the right place. However, if you expected Channing Tatum to show how much he has grown as an actor and Matthew McConaughey in one of his better roles, then you also came to the right place. This movie is carried by Tatum in a role loosely based on his early career as a stripper. But the movie is not just about strippers, it's about a young man doing what he has to do to get by while working toward a dream of owning his own business. He deals with women not taking him seriously as anything other than a pretty face, the seedier side of the club industry, and the pains of never feeling like he's going to realize his dream. Don't get me wrong, the stripping scenes totally pay off and are downright hilarious, but the movie is so much more. There are even scenes for the men who are being dragged by their women to see this movie. Give it a chance, it's worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really????","review":"This went from being a happy, fun, wish I could be there movie, to what the hell just happened movie.....

After all, a few of my female co-workers stated, \\"Everyone in the theater was screaming!\\"I was bored. Channing Tatum was in fine form. However, for some reason, I kept thinking about Chris Brown during his dance performances. The lead actress was terrible, and had absolutely no chemistry with Channing's character. I kept thinking, is this an actress fresh out of acting school.The dance scenes were too few. Alex Pettyfer played his role ok. Matthew McConaughey fulfilled his obligation looking spectacular I might add. The rest of the cast was under used.Would I recommend Magic Mike? Only if it was offered on Amazon Instant Video for 99 cents or free on Netflix. Hard to believe this film made over $100 million dollars. Women/Gays! We deserve better!P.S.

I watched it and found the story a little weird and quite dull. The dance scenes were like nothing I've seen before but they were randomly punctuated into the story and it didn't feel cohesive.

Get off my lawn!\\") but I see by reading the reviews that age didn't factor into it much.How and why this even got made in the first place, how and why it even made money at the box office and how and why I decided to PAY to rent it are unsolved mysteries for the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"Aside from some cute guys pulling of some cool dance moves, there was nothing enjoyable about this movie.

Take the costumes for example: just because guys think girls in thongs are hot, doesn't mean the reverse is true.Sadly, the men who made this movie think women are as obsessed with their p-e-n-i-s-e-s as they are.

I've seen documentaries on strippers (where there is no plot or story at all), which were much more engaging than this movie.

But wow this movie was really raunchy but it did have really funny scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magestic Masterpiece","review":"I choosed this rating because the storyline was about guy that had a vision and went after it. As I anticipated, the movie was not all about male stripping but was about a young man that love the fast life but had personal goals in mind. I believe I like the lady that played the sister the most in this film because when Mike(Channing Tatum) runs across her it was love at first site. She is a bright, strong and sophisticated woman that is concern about the welfare of her younger brother which couldn't find himself. Moreover, she is a responsible woman which Mike was inspired by and it didn't hurt that she is cute. I would recommend this film to anybody that is a movie buff because I definitely think they will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Channing Tatum saves this movie...","review":"Channing Tatum is trying his hardest to prove he can carry a movie, pretty sure he can stop trying - the only reason this movie works is because of him. Lots of hot looking men can only take it so far, but Tatum's charisma and over all likeability saves the show. I read a lot of advanced press about this movie and was excited to see Riley Keough, as well as Alex Pettyfer... kinda underwhelmed by both of them. Keough was in the movie for a total of five minutes (seems like some of that part may have ended up on the cutting room floor) and Pettyfer is way more stiff than in his other efforts.The worst part? I wanted to knock this down a star just for the terrible acting by Cody Horn. This girl has less expression than Kristen Stewart on a good day! I get that the awkward, hard, girl next door thing is popular among directors these days... but come on, she was terrible and had zero chemistry with Tatum.It's a good movie, just not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea, Bad Story line","review":"It was worth adding to my collection, but the movie plot was kind of lame.

The only redeeming quality was the male bodies and Channing's dancing. The rest was trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storyline was a complete downer","review":"I do not get the hype over this movie. My husband I rented this last night thinking it would be kind of cheesy and fun and get us in the mood for date night. Boy were we wrong. The characters were unlikeable, and we didn't really have a reason to root for any of them. The dancers were all drug addicts. The acting was horrendous. The dancing was upbeat and fun, but all other scenes were completely depressing. This was not the fun movie we were expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic Mike - Meh","review":"They should have written the script AND THEN added the stripping aspect. Instead the focus is on the stripping aspect and the story is an afterthought - like, oh yeah, we need to write dialogue for these people. And I heartily agree with those who say this is a re-heated Flashdance remake.That being said, Channing Tatum is not to be missed and can dance for me anytime. OMFG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dialogue? What Dialogue?","review":"I rented this \\"On Demand\\" and really wish I had waited for it to come to cable television or something else that is free. It's like the writers didn't even try to come up with any kind of dialogue at all, let alone a plot that wasn't so riddled with holes it looked like Swiss cheese. If all you're looking for is Chippendale's with popular current actors from stage and screen, then this is your movie. I would compare it to \\"Showgirls\\" but I'm pretty sure that one at least had a plot that made some sort of sense. This movie jumped around so much it was hard to follow anything but the dancing. The scenes that didn't revolve around dancing were almost \\"Blair Witch\\" grainy, the dialogue was horrific and there is not one single solitary part of the plot that gets fully developed. I'm incredibly disappointed and for the first time in years I feel like writing to the studio and demanding my $4 back."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies ever.....","review":"Iam a fan of several of the male actors, but from the poor sounds, poor shot selection, editing, complete lack of plot and poor choice of female lead, I wish I could request a refund. I feel badly for the A list actors who will forever have this as part of their resume....yikes !"},{"rating":"1","title":"not to impressed","review":"I watched this as part of my bachelorette party and well the story was pretty lame and the whole stripping thing just made me want to close my eyes the only decent dancing was done by the main character and all of it was before he had most or any of his clothes off. Basically if you like watching male strippers this is the movie for you but if you are looking for a decent story look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"endless.... even the video quality was painful to watch.

Wish I would have rented almost anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I pre-ordered this movie and was very disappointed in both the video quality (made in Mexico) along with the movie. Too much use of four letter words, the dancing was mediocre and repetitive. I am shocked that Matthew McConaughey, the fine actor that he is, would appear in this type of movie. True story? Maybe, but tough to follow. Don't waste your time and money on this movie, sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic Mike","review":"What a tragic waste of hot male bodies, a story, celluloid, DVD materials, artwork -- and 20 minutes of my life that I will never get back (thank God for eject buttons!).

Good dancing by Tatum - horrible story- falls in with Showgirls bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good dancing, but weak characters and story","review":"My fiancee convinced me to rent this film with her, and we both ended up with a similar impression of this film.Basically the film is about a group of male strippers who are attempting to move up into the \\"big time.\\" One of the most successful members of the team, however, is more interested in trying to grow up and move along. In the meantime, he is bringing along \\"The Kid,\\" as a new member of the show.Overall, the dancing and acting is quite good. Channing Tatum in particular shines in the dancing scenes.However, the story/character development is very minimal (non-existent for most of the cast). Very little time is spent outside of the club scenes, and when you see the daily life of Mike or the Kid, you catch only a glimpse.Ultimately, you may enjoy some of the dancing and club scenes, but you will leave the film feeling rather unfulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting more","review":"There wasn't enough Dancing.There wasn't enough Joe ManganielloThere was too much Matthew Mcconaughey - dude is creepy.I didn't expect a blockbuster but man this was boring. It was just over all lacking something. Why have a movie about strippers/dancers when only 1or 2 can actually dance? This really could have been cast better probably. The only real casting complaint I have though is Kevin Nash. Come on, really? Ex wrestler? He didn't even put in effort during the few routines. Maybe that is supposed to be his character, I don't know.Maybe I'm just being picky but I wanted to enjoy the movie, not be bored to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good souvenir !","review":"This CD, with this musical score is a very good souvenir from this remarkable film \\"WOLF\\".

This score was composed later in life, and it is still very well done. He combines the right amount of beauty and suspense to create the mood for this horror-esque film. The addition of the recurring saxophone solo gives it an added creepy feeling against the drop of the slowing moving string background. The only complaint I have, is that, once again for a movie soundtrack, none of the musicians are listed.If you liked this movie or are interested in checking out Morricone's scores, I would suggest checking out some of his work from the 60's, like The Good, The Bad and the Ugly or Fistful of Dollars, and later works like the Untouchables before buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shure Mike","review":"This mike works pretty well.

As another reviewer noted, the letter depicted on the left page is in Capital Script, and not in printed form, so this book isn't ideal for teaching the alphabet, and is instead more useful for practicing the alphabet or as part of a thematic exploration of the alphabet and nature.I would note that the photo of the butterfly itself, on the left hand of the page, is quite small, about 3\\" x 4\\".

OCEANSIZE is a talented band that knows how to use their instruments to create sweeping, complex tunes that flow nicely into the next without being confused with the last. The occasional screamed lyric aside, these fellows write good songs with decent hooks. EFFLORESCE is a nice lauch pad from which this band makes a impact on modern rock; this album swings somewhere between prog and alternative. Any fan of TOOL or PORCUPINE TREE should enjoy this CD, for OCEANSIZE is a band that doesn't give up pop sensible melody to tune down and rock hard.

Just the thing to practice on a long ride! What binds the album together besides the theme is excellent production, as in all the Wee Sing albums. The creative arrangements make a potentially tedious song such as \\"The Wheels on the Bus\\" into a treat. The adult voices on the album are good without being overbearing, and the children's voices are perfectly average--making it easy to sing along.

I feel that the wording is very peculiar at times, and even though it has interpretations of so many different dreams, a lot of the major and most common dream issues are not even mentioned. Still, I have enjoyed the book, and I'm going to have to buy a new one because mine is literally falling apart. It's not bad, but it's not the greatest dream interpretation book either. It's important to remember though, that dreams are people-specific, and the same dream will mean something totally different to different people.

Okay, maybe \\"love\\" is too strong a word. Let's call it a sympathetic bond.As a story about storytelling DUST is much more successful than it is as either a period western or a modern crime thriller.

You can get the basic storyline for this film from the Amazon review. Sounds intriguing, right? Well, the filmmaker desperately wanted to make a different kind of movie, and the desperation shows. This film tries so damn hard to be full of \\"interesting characters\\" that everything comes off like a student film. This is most obvious in the flashback storyteller, an old woman named Angela, who we are supposed to think of as cool and vaguely hip because she can talk trash with the black kid that breaks into her house. Good Christ, this was a bad movie. Obvious and superficial. The director's so-called \\"homage\\" to various film genres are just simply poor rip offs.

This book fails. I had learned Pascal and C and already had an understanding of basic object-oriented concepts before starting this book and it was still very difficult.

It's not that they prefer small bodies of water, but that they can survive in them for a few months. Otherwise they live in vast amounts of water.Additionally, while wild bettas may be able to survive in small puddles for a small time, fancy bettas are not similar to wild bettas in this aspect; they need stimulation (like plants and hiding areas) and prefer larger aquariums (personal experience as well as research).I understand the appeal of this aquarium, but I'd only keep a plant in here. Otherwise, I don't consider this a suitable living space for a Betta. It's affordable, so if you need a temporary aquarium while setting up a real aquarium (waiting for the good bacteria to set up and all of that), this is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a suitable home for fish","review":"This is in no way a good home for any fish, let alone a betta. Bettas only live in small puddles in the wild for short periods of time during the dry season. Other than that, they live in rice paddies. The bettas that we buy in stores have much larger fins than wild ones do. They need a minimum of 2 gallons to swim in. Being tropical fish, they need a heater. These are lively, active, curious animals. Putting them in such a small home would result in illness and, ultimately, death. Properly cared for, they can live upwards of 3 years.

When you clean it you have to put all the little pebbles into the square in the middle, then anytime you pour in any water (or even if the fish swam by too quickly like when startled) pebbles would fly out of the inner square making you have to dig in there to fix it. It wouldn't look right if you left the pebbles/sand in there wherever. Also after about a day it would look dirty again because ANY poop the fish left would be on the floor would take away from the whole 'zen' look of the thing. It's a neat idea for a (tiny) fish tank, but because of the amount of work that you have to put in to keep the tank looking good/clean it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont care for it","review":"Ok i have one just like this 1 but mine is a red color, we bought it at a pet store but my Betta dont seem to like it & he has been in it for about 5 or 6 months now & he seems sad i think cause there is to much space or to much water but no where for him to hide. you can put plants in it but you cant fit a hide away home for your Betta. i have one & if i was you i would not spend the money on this tank kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small","review":"This may seem like a good \\"aquarium,\\" but it is not.

Instead of using the gravel which it came with I opted to get an artificial plant, by Marina, that fits in the little square perfectly.

This \\"aquarium\\" is way too small, betta require atleast one gallon of water and that needs to be cleaned 1-2x weekly atleast. This is probably 1/2 gallon or less meaning you either clean it every day, t hus stressing your betta out and killing it or let is die a slow death from ammonia burns and other ills. This also has no lighting leave betta looking dull and boring, no heating or ability to heat so your house must stay warm where your betta is and it just isn't good.

I quickly found out that it wasn't a practical living container and moved to a 1.5 gallon tank with a filter and a small heater pad.

It is a wonderful story for any child with or without a disability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Until there is a better term, it's a great book anyway","review":"Until there is a better term for Attention Deficit, that's the name kids have to deal with. This is a great book anyway because the child uses his \\"problem of paying too close attention to minute details\\" to find his way out of the woods in order to rescue his dad. He is the hero and not a problem child as such. We learn some about his problems and some solutions but this well written story puts us in his shoes in a very understanding and kind way. This reminds me of a new book, Whoa Wiggle-worm by Betsy B. Lee. It discusses kind and unkind nicknames in an entertaining story showing a child learning self-control. A diagnosis is not given.

Yes, I did get my monies worth before it died almost 20 years later. So I knew the Bunn quality and did not hesitate purchasing another Bunn product. The NHB makes excellent coffee. It has a stainless steel tank that keeps water at about 200 degrees, the perfect brewing temperature for coffee. With the tank keeping water hot and ready to go you will find many uses such as making hot chocolate for the kids or for anything else that requires instant hot water. After purchasing my new coffee maker I decided to take my coffee enjoyment to the next level and purchased the Bunn BCG coffee grinder. My wife and I now enjoy fresh ground, fresh brewed coffee every morning. What a way to start the day. I recommend both products as they are quality made and should last for years. Remember you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super coffee","review":"I had an older version of the Bunn NHB that had a plastic internal hot water tank.

You can't buy anything better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Coffee","review":"If you like strong coffee dont buy this machine. Yes it makes smooth coffee but its weak.

VERY dissapointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When only the best will do!","review":"This is our second Bunn. The first lasted over 20 years, finally wore out. We got a good price, although Bunn are more expensive than other models. This one is a beauty, takes up less space, has two features that are new for us. You can switch off the water heater when going away for awhile, as we do. The top cover also slides, and when it is slid open holds the water poured in so that it does not start sending the coffee into the caraffe until you are ready.It should do us for another 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Coffee Maker","review":"We have been using the coffee maker that our office provided the last couple of years.

The manual says you have to brew at least 4 cups. Nope. The machine wouldn't work after a while. A call to the (friendly) customer service at Bunn, and I learned you really have to brew at least 6 cups at a time, or the water eventually runs too low. My wife's the only coffee drinker at home, so we waste a lot of coffee.And the machine has to stay on the whole time. The power switch is on the side near the base, easily bumped by mistake. It's no fun getting up in the a.m. and finding that your coffee pot's off by accident, and now you have to go through a rigmarole and wait half an hour to get your coffee.I'm going to buy her a plain old Krupp drip machine for half the price. It won't get the water as hot, it won't make coffee as well, but it will WORK. Maybe the more expensive Bunn models work well, but avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Jill Rosenberg","review":"If you enjoy rather thin, weak coffee, this is the machine for you.To brew a robust cup of coffee with my new Bunn, I find I must grind my beans extremely fine and use double the amount I used in my old Cuisinart.This gizmo will become a gift for my sister-in-law who prefers translucent coffee, quickly brewed. I'm buying another Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee - unreliable coffee maker","review":"We owned the Bunn NHB for only 6 months before the burner stopped working. A call to the customer service yielded a pathetic repair policy that demands the owner personally swallow the cost of shipping to the repair facility in Iowa - this on top of the fact that the owner will have to wait upwards of 3 to 4 weeks for repair and shipping without a coffee maker.

After doing all of the recommended maintenance 3 times and trying every possible configuration, I finally just threw it in the dumpster. I notice that my brother does not use his, although I have not asked why.

It keeps the next pot of coffee water hot using a low power heater in the tank in waiting for you to start the next brew cycle. The coffee basket is so easy to access, the basket filters are easy to fill (unlike some cone or swivel baskets) and easy to empty. I just pour in the new water (I do 5 cups at a time), put the carafe in place and activate the warmer plate ... in less than 2 minutes the coffee is completely done. Bunn's customer service is excellent, I called for a restricter to slow down the coffee brewer so I can get a stronger result and it arrived within a few days no questions asked.One more thing, this machine makes coffee well, that's it.

The flip cover is not as easy to use as it should be and if you don't poor perfectly straight it will leak to the side.

The brewing is quick, but as others have posted, you will always get the same taste. Making stronger coffee is not possible. To me, the unit is overpriced. We have used Couisinart for several years and decided to try something different. The Couisinart requires little or no cleaning and you can vary the strength of the coffee. You can also poor coffee while it is brewing and the filter holder won't drip when removed due to a spring loaded stopper on the bottom of the holder."},{"rating":"1","title":"bunn","review":"This thing no time started leaking around the seals and the pot never would stay hot.Just went back tomato coffeepot thanks anyway"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Masterpiece","review":"This is Mercury Rev's greatest work and an all time classic, This album trancends all genres.

Personally, I really enjoyed it; it has been in my collection for five years or so, and I haven't gotten bored with it. That being said, it is fairly low-budget (as many awesome short films are). Do not expect fantastic dialogue or acting (it isn't BAD- just nothing special). The genius of this piece is the plot (and the plot alone). Still, that has been enough to keep it in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Thomas Fans","review":"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 15-month-old nephew.

He highlighted the role of the University much more than an objective account called for. A New Haven Native and amateur Historian I was chagrined to find incomplete or otherwise flawed discriptions of events I lived through. There were a variety of petty errors that cast doubt upon how well this book was researched or proofread. For example, the reference to \\"Giant Shirt Co.\\" should have read Gant Shirt Company. The significant role of Firearms manufacturing in and near New Haven, was all but ignored (Winchesters, Marlins, Mossburgs, Dardrick, High Standard) was not adequatly explored. Events that changed New Haven forever again were not enumerated as one might expect i.e. The Franklin Street Fire. This book will go to the first charitable book sale.

I found it was really in touch with pop culture, and I could relate to the characters, even though I don't have supernatural powers. Their lifestyles seemd very down to earth and real, right down to the way they speak, and the banter between friends.

Cam, her best friend and her family are just visiting Montana but Alex lives there. Alex lives with her Mom but later her Mom dies. At the funeral there is a pasty, white man standing near her grave.

I loved it! At first you will get confused but later on in the book you understand. It starts off when Apollo and Artemis parent's died which was 14 years ago. Then they are both separated from their guradian who protects them and they both have different families. They also have new names:Apollo is Camyrn and Artemis is Alexandra. They both meet one day and they find out they have secret powers they never knew of. Also Camryn finds out a secret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard!","review":"I've read this first book from the series and I find it is not all it's cranked up to be. The authors try too hard in using common \\"slang\\" terms, and most of the time just end up confusing the reader. The plot is a bit chiched however it is a good plot line to follow and it helps the reader interest in reading the book. I would recomend it for pre-teens 11-14, but nothing older than that because it would bore the teen mind. However, if you find yourself desperated and in the wait for a new good book, like Harry Potter, for instance, read it just for fun and check it out of your public library. It's not worth buying the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"T*Witches The Power of Two","review":"In the story T*Witches the power of two there are two witch characters who are separated at birth and reunited at an amusement park. They have the powers to save a family or even to melt solids into liquids! It is a very nice book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this","review":"This book is not worth reading. It has a sappy plot, the dialogue sounds unnatural, and half the book is made up of descriptions of the characters clothes. As a teenager, I get enough of that every time I go to school. When I read this book I can almost see a blond cheerleader at the typewriter. The characters are exaggerated stereotypes. The perfect middle class girl and her degenerate, jaded twin sister. The author's clumsy attempts at making the characters endearing left me gagging."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book!","review":"I thought this book was excellent. It made you think about something and left alot of foreshadowing, a word that means clues. I love it and would read it again. I reccommend this book to anybody who loves mysteries. This is defietely a book for you. Also you should check out their second book called T*Witches ( Building a Mystery)! I will definetely be the first one to buy it! Well go out and read! Any 13 year old like me should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"T*Witches: The Power of Two","review":"Camryn Barnes and Alexandra Fielding are so different that it seems impossible for them to be related. But they are twins. Cam is a popular, peppy soccer player. The jem of her school. Alex is a party girl, punky and has a flair for sarcasm. They've never met... that is, until now. Cam and Alex are really Apolla and Artemis- Two very wanted witches. Their parents were killed the day that the girls were born. The girls themselves have no clue that they are witches. So, what'll happen when they meet and their powers increase? One thing's for sure- Montana will never be the same again.I loved this riveting book. The characters are so real that it's like you go to high school with them. The tantalizing combination of teenage drama and magic unite to form a bombshell script. This book truely shows you how important family is and that people can always learn more about themselves. All in all, this is a definate must-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book series","review":"I bought this as a summer reading book two years ago and I have been hooked ever since. The story involves twins separated at birth. The catch is, the twin girls are from a line of witches and when they do meet the magic starts. Both girls are very different, one is from the popular group, the other is the dyed hair misfit. This causes a lot of friction at first, but the girls eventually grow to tolerate, respect and eventually love each other like sisters. This first book is the longest of the series and spends a lot of time introducing Cam and Alex. You also meet their guardians and get some hints of the magic to come. I highly recommend this series. They are fast moving, fun books for girls and the series doesn't appear to be stopping anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!!!!!","review":"This book is totally great and I really advise you read it!

It then uses scare tactics including examples of gross substance abuse and untimely death to pull the reader in. The solutions of \\"spend quality time with your kids and as a family\\" are just as obvious as the problem given in the first place. To top it off, the book lumps and stereotypes current and past generations. One example in the book states that previous generations loved school because it freed them from menial chores while the current generation dislikes school because it's harder work than is expected of them around the house. The authors must assume that all parents / readers are ignorant of history, lack personality traits, and have no innate parenting intuition."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unbelievable insight into American-German relations","review":"Engaging into American-German business ventures without first reading this book is like trying to pass a math exam without knowing the difference between subtraction and addition!

It has lots of side jokes and looks as though the author tried very hard to make the book \\"cool\\" (which could be expected of the Complete Idiot's series). The seemingly \\"cool\\" style really distracts the reader from the subject at hand and the sort of seriousness and maturity that should accompany it.I also orderedSex Bible for Women: The Complete Guide to Understanding Your Body, Being a Great Lover, and Getting the Pleasure You Want($19.80) at the same time and the two books cannot compare.

No more HP printers!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful paper feed an poor drivers","review":"On the plus side this printer can handle A3 paper, large ink reservoirs and has a duplex printing option.On the negative side it very frequently jams when feeding from the optional second tray, is very slow when printing duplex and now the paper feed from the main tray has totally failed. In addition the drivers are poor and of the 3 supplied only one seems at all reliable; except under Vista where it repeatedly forgets the options fitted and your personal settings. Its worth noting that HP have never updated the drivers since release so I suppose even they have given up on this printer.Avoid at all costs.

Keep in mind that this is an FM modulator andalthough the sound is good it doesn't compare to CD quality. I have not experienced iPod rapid battery loss when using the iTrip.

My mom gives me good advice and she says do not buy something just because it is cheap, buy it because it is good. I should have listened because instead of getting the ciggarette lighter adapter that my friends have and say it works I bought the cheap piece of crap.

You have to keep your iPOD right next to the reciever for it to detect the signal at all, and even then it is static filled and distorted. It looks really cool, and it integrates beautifully with the lines of the mini, but its performance in no way matches its looks.

It worked great where they live in Kansas. However, when I got back home to Los Angeles I discovered that it was nearly useless. The problem - there are just too many radio stations in the LA area, which means that there aren't any clear channels for your itrip to broadcast on. I even downloaded Griffin's program that recommends the \\"best\\" stations to use in your area. For the entire LA area there are 3 recommended stations, while in most other areas there easily 15-20 at least. Using the recommended stations, the itrip will work ok in my apartment. However, driving in the car the itrip simply doesn't broadcast a strong enough signal. I ended up going back to my casette adapter, which is a much better solution if your car stereo has a tape player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money on charity.","review":"Honestly, a waste of money.

Everything was peachy until I bought a new car that didn't have a cassette player. So, I made the mistake of buying the iTrip to compensate. At first, the iTrip seemed to work OK, but it sometimes needed to be reset. That was on the first day. On the second day the iTrip was even more sensitive and required more resetting. On the third day it had to be reset every other second and refused to work in some parts of town. Then it just quit working all together. In a misguided belief it wasn't connected properly, I pushed down on the top of the iTrip gently exploiting a weakness I wasn't aware of in my ipod mini's headphone jack. It took me a few days to realize that my iPod was now broke and pretty much useless to me. So, not only did the iTrip not work, it caused my $250 dollar iPod to brake just as it's warranty ran out. Avoid the iTrip and the iPod like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I've tried this with several radios, and all of them either didn't work at all, or were so awful and staticy it made the transmitter worthless.

Barely functions.","review":"Doesn't work at all in two of our three cars. Actually works fairly well in the other as long as you sit the unit right next to the in-glass antenna in our highlander. Too damn bad the antenna is in the REAR OF THE VEHICLE. Also doesn't work on our home stereo unless I put it behind the reciever right next to the FM antenna. The stupid thing only tunes to some of the stations in its playlist so I thought it was broken until I found a station it would tune to and its so clumsy to tune it by playing little songs half way through and then hitting pause.With the right playlist, and some duct tape, we might use it on trips, but I tend to think its easier to just bring a case of CDs since I have to climb in the back of the car to change songs.Pros - thank god it was cheap, and it has really nice ergonomics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I bought this so I could listen to my iPod in my car in the city. The first couple of times, it worked great, but after that, something happened. It just wouldn't work. All I heard was static, no matter what frequency I tried this on. I have yet to take a road trip with it, so maybe that will work better, but right now, I am not happy with the product. Maybe the fact that I live in a city with radio stations on virtually every frequency has something to do with it, but it used to work on some frequencies, and now it just doesn't anymore. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked!!!","review":"I was happily surprised when I pluuged in the fm transmitter and....it worked well!!! I live 15 minutes outside of Boston on the North Shore and have found that this item works exactly as described. I used 87.9 (it is pre-programmed to this station) and have not had any issues. Just watch the level of volume on the ipod itself as this is a MAJOR factor on how well the reception sounds. It just sounds like you're listening to the car radio....so don't actually think it's going to sound like some amazing stereo system or anything....but if you just want to listen to your music then this is money well spent!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is junk","review":"My experience seems to be different than many others. Basically this is a very cheap piece of junk. It works much of the time, but I suspect you won't find it easy to change stations and you're susceptible to interference at any time. I also found that it would simply change frequencies for no apparent reason. I finally broke down and bought an inexpensive in-dash CD player with an auxillary input and just run that to the ipod. It works way better and it's just not as hard or as expensive as you might think.Otherwise, if this is your only option, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down","review":"The product is just not worth the money.

I find the sound quality to be no different than the radio. Friends have found it midly annoying that when travelling across country you need to constantly look for a new \\"dead\\" station if the frequency is used by the locals. But for my purposes of driving to and from work it's great and spares me from the mindless morning DJs. For me, that is worth the price alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drove me to Drink","review":"I hated this thing. I hated connecting to a station. I almost drove off the side of the road on long trips when I had to change stations. And, even when I found one the sound quality was mediocre at best. I just didn't use my iPod in my car unless I could use the tape deck attachment (who has a tape deck anymore?). In my new car (MINI Cooper) I paid $150 to have an Apple dock installed directly into the stereo. VERY WORTH it - although almost as expensive as the iPod... The sound quality is incredible, the stereo controls change the songs and the playlists, it charges at the same time and is located in the (air conditioned) glove box. I am so glad I don't have to use an FM transmitter again. Bottom line - get your car hard-wired if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woefully underwhelming radio tuner","review":"The Griffin iTrip Mini for the Ipod Mini is a quite a disappointment. Originally, I had hoped to have the ability to listen to my Ipod Mini over the radio and enjoy the great music I have on it. Alas, when I used it, I only was able to listen to it on the default frequency, 87.9, first and was profoundly disappointed by the static-laden sound quality that came out of the radio. Honestly, I've gotten better sound out of an old portable AM radio. Sure, there seem to be ways to program it to access other stations and hopefully get better sound quality, but I've spoken to others who say that they get equally bad sound quality on other stations. Sometimes, it doesn't even work at all. It's just simply not worth it. It should also be noted that the radio station files emit and unpleasant sound when you come across them in the Ipod Mini's shuffle rotation (why are they even in the playlist files????).

Much to my dismay, the little thing is entirely too difficult and needy. When in the house, I had to place the iPod on top of the stereo in order to lessen, not eliminate, the static. Furthermore, it was hopeless when placed in the car. The overall sound quality is poor compared to the sound that comes directly out of the headphones. Perhaps there is too much interference in a big city for the thing to work properly, but I really don't think it is worth purchasing the little guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!","review":"I got this when I got my ipod mini. The product worked fine for one day. I tryed to use it today in my car, and the static was all I could hear. This device also drains the battery.

It flat out did not work in Los Angeles and will no doubt be problematic in any major urban area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory, not in practice","review":"I bought one of these with high hopes of getting iPod music in my car, but it did not work. No matter where I tuned it, static drowned out my music. In Los Angeles where I am, there is no open spectrum, so no matter what FM frequency you choose for the Griffin, the transmitter has to compete with radio stations signals in your area - and it always loses. The signal transmitted from this device is very weak and has to reach your car antenna (it does no good sticking this thing close to your stereo). So if your car antenna is at the rear of your car, it's not going to make it. This might work if it is placed right next to the antenna, within one meter maybe.The whole theory of broadcasting music over an FM frequency fails in practice unless you live in an area where there are portions of the FM band that are totally unoccupied. Even then, it's a mediocre solution at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"I had similar products of these FM transmitters from 5 years ago. It was filled with static back then.

My suggestion, spend your money on other accessories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality in urban areas","review":"I bought the iTrip hoping that I could sit on my couch with my iPod and transmit to my stereo receiver across the room (about 10 feet away). My high hopes for an elegant wireless solution ended in disappointment. Despite that I have a nice big antenna attached to my stereo receiver and was only about 10 feet away, the sound quality was completely terrible - like listening to a weak FM radio station. The subtlest tilting or moving of the iPod would create more or less static. I live in an urban area and there are few available FM frequencies. I tried a number of different frequencies but to no use - they all sounded very poor.My friend has used the iTrip in her car on long drives and mentioned that she was happy with its performance only in rural or less-populated areas where there were abundantly available FM frequencies.On a positive note about the iTrip, it is easy to use. Also, you can leave your volume all the way down and it will still transmit FM signals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Griffin iTrip is a waste of money","review":"Before I purchased this item, I knew it was probably too good to be true. The FM transmitter looked really cool because it integrated with my iPod mini so well aesthetically. That's where the positive attributes of this item end.Here is a summary of the negative attributes:- Programming this thing is terrible. You have to load radio stations on the iPod as songs and it is a huge pain to set up.- This thing uses up your battery power very quickly on your iPod.- Because this thing works off of the iPod battery vs. a car charger, the reception is terrible.- Changing radio stations on the fly is not user friendly at all.I got rid of this within a week of purchasing it and upgraded to a Kensington unit that plugged into the cigarette lighter, lets you pick the radio station on the unit with a little lcd display, and charges the iPod while it is plugged in.Do not get the Griffin iTrip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use and iffy sound","review":"The basic Idea is very good. However, there are two problems with the product. First, to change the FM station it uses, you need to stop what you are playing and 'play' a short 'song' that is encoded with the right frequency. I found that to be a bad design. Second, the quality (or strength) of the transmition is poor in some cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"it does what it says","review":"The itrip does what it says it does. It plays your ipod on an FM radio. First, you have to download the stations onto your ipod, it comes with clear, step-by-step directions that have pictures. You read the directions on the computer with the disk they give you.What you have to do is find a fuzzy staion then go to the itrip playlist and play that station. It starts beeping and you have to press stop. You can tell if it worked if the light on the top blinks three times. Then you can play all the songs you have on your ipod on any FM radio you own.It is an extremely convenient replacement for the $150 speakers that you can get instead. Its small, simple, and it works. But it is sometimes interupted with static especially if you use it in the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you like AM radio!!!","review":"What a cool design I thought!

I have tried three or four other transmitters and have had nothing but trouble: batteries die, very weak signal, awkward configuration. This has none of those problems. Of course, there is no way a transmitter will give you CD quality sound. However, I live in one of the top five most populated cities in the nation and I had no problem at all tuning in to the default station. Plus, the design is aesthetically pleasing when paired with your (my) beloved iPod mini. It really does allow you to take your music with you. My one issue (thus the 4 stars) is the battery drain. This does not impact me since I am primarily using this for a thirty minute drive to and from work. But, I could see how on long drives this would be a real problem and necessitate some sort of charger in addition to the iTrip. But for my money, this is exactly what I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suddenly stops working","review":"I've owned two of these and both stopped working about 40 days after purchase. I tried everything on online forums and at griffin's website to no avail. Neither were damaged but they refused to transmit. I recently bought a similar product by iRiver that charges itself from your cigarette lighter jack and noticed the signal was stronger than iTrip's. The interface is easier to use too and you don't have to fumble with playlists trying not to accidentally reset the transmitting station like you do with iTrip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best for rural users","review":"I live in a very crowded area in which a black radio station is hard to find. Even when I did find a station that sounded like it was void of talk and music I found that the music that came from my iPod had a lot of static and made listening hard.

I would recommend this if you live in an area where you can actually find a blank station."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't meet the expectation","review":"In the wide open spaces of Wyoming there are plenty FM channels available. The itrip looks great, and this product worked....just barely. The issue is transmission power. My Sirius Starmate has little to no static on their FM transmitter (4.5/5)and with that as an expectation this was a disappointment. Even in close proximity to the antenna or head unit there was poor reception. While this is a superb value for ~$22, the sound quality and volume holds it back. I have gone to an aux input scenario (6/5!!) but I really hoped for no wires attached. It was too good to be true. On 2 other notes the process to select stations is clunky at best and adds \\"tracks\\" to the ipod which requires another playlist. Not the worst, but clunky. Also, when you pause the ipod to take a phone call, the itrip shuts down after a short time leaving you with a static background and making pause a 2 step operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE product & CRUMMY service","review":"Bought one of these because our car stereo is factory stock and has no input or tape player for a hard-wire connection for my iPod Mini.

Emailed the company and all they did was re-hash the exact same instructions I had tried for several attempts. When I asked about what I do to value the warranty, they said go to the store I bought it!!Don't waste your time w/ this product.

If you are picky, Monster Cable iCarPlay iPod Wireless FM Transmitter is the BEST I've found, but only useful in the car!If you are looking to use this on just any radio, then you must have a good antennae, if you don't have a good antennae your sound will be CRAP.

Think they want you to upgrade to a better shipping method. Even though when you order they say \\"ships within 24 hours\\" they didn't ship mine for a week. And the reason they gave me was that I choose super save shipping and it might get delayed because of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple Recommends a Different Brand","review":"Reps at the Apple store in Soho, NYC strongly encouraged me to get the FM transmitter made by XtremeMac instead of the Itrip. Yes, even though Griffin improved the Itrip and did away with the software hassles, it still seems to be an inferior device. With that said, I wouldn't recommend ANY of these transmitters for use in a city. In the city and even 60+ miles out of NYC (LI and NJ), I had a frustrating time trying to pick up reception. Now I only use it on vacation. It was a waste of money for me.Important note: Neither the itrip or XtremeMac versions work with the NANO. The transmitters require a dual plug (look at the pictures) which the regular ipod and the mini have but the Nano does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Product","review":"The sound on the ITrip is actually quite good. I use it in a BMW X5 standard car stereo and it sounds better than FM, nearly as good as CD's. The problem Scarlet cited in her review was likely due to operator error - the ITrip clearly instructs you to turn the IPod volume to midrange (40-70%) and if you are very low or very high in volume the sound can be very distorted. As long as you follow directions, that is not a problem, and you'll be very happy with the quality. And it is exceptionally easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"how about ZERO STARS...","review":"Terrible... Although finding an open frequency is tough in Dallas, I think the iTrip's signal strength is the problem. I have an exterior antenna ('94 Ford Explorer), and the sound quality is only halfway bearable if I put the iPod/iTrip on the corner of the dashboard as close to the windshield and antenna as possible. I've switched to a cassette adapter and am MUCH happier with it. Please don't be fooled by the four- and five-star reviews - these must be from people who are too ashamed to admit they bought such a piece of garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"This was awful, my radio did not pick up transmittal of this device even when the ipod was right next to the radio. I bought this b/c my husband's car only has a cd player and I wanted to be able to listen to my ipod in his car, forget it, I returned it and bought the tape cassette converter for my car."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk!","review":"I would strongly recommend you NOT buy this --- contrary to the rave reviews you will see on this site.I have a Honda CRV and the unless I place the ipod on the dash next to the antenna, I have no reception. Like most people you would want to keep in on a console or in a cup holder, well that won't work with this. Also, tuning the iTrip is close to impossible, unless you pause the song at just the right moment, it moves to the next station. There just has to be a better way.I wish I could return this, but after paying return shipping and Amazon's restock fee, it isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"Despite the bad critique that caused me some alarm I bought the griffin itrip. First of all it does not work almost at all on my sony mp70 in my car. I have to stick it on the mp3 player to get some poor quality broadcast. If I leave it anywhere else (on a seat, or on the dashboard) the radio doesn't receive anything at all. I have not checked it in rural areas but I don't think there will be much of a difference since the signal seems to be too weak. So save your money to buy something else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible product","review":"Spare yourself a lot of time and hassle and don't buy this wretched product. If you do not have the pre-programmed station available you will have to - try - to reprogram this device to select an available station. I tried and tried but it simply wouldn't select a station. Electrojunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT to like it... but...","review":"The itrip mini does what it advertizes: fits the sleek lines of the mini ipod without adding much bulk at all, and transmits your tunes to a radio tuned to frequency (defaults to 87.9, but you can adjust that by installing the simple software provided with the itrip).Living in LA, there are VERY limited options insofar as stations not in use. 87.9 is actually one of the few options. The sound quality was awful. I tried using this device in my car, in my room, in my home stereo - all with the same lousy results.I should have listened to the advice of the salesperson at the Apple store and gotten the cassette device to play my ipod music on other sound systems.Bottomline: it works, but sounds like music playing on a radio station that doesn't quite come in clearly - static. Poor volume, and very poor sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Soooo Wanted to Like It","review":"I really, really wanted to like this product. I read all the reviews before buying and thought I'd take my chances despite numerous complaints about static and interference in metropolitan areas. But my experience has been just the same.I downloaded the frequency finder and tried every station recommended for the NYC area. Still, the sound quality was mediocre at best - no where NEAR the fidelity of a normal FM station.Went out yesterday and bought an RCA \\"Y\\" adapter and now use that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and price","review":"I have a lot of \\"windshield time\\" and one of the main reasons I purchased an iPod was to use for books I download from Audible.com (I was tired of burning 10-20 CD's per book), as well as giving me the capability to download music from iTunes. No, it doesn't sound like my Infinity speakers at home, but (1) I didn't expect it to, and (2) the sound quality is surprisingly very good for the most part with both books and music. There is only one city that I travel to/through where I get a little interference with the FM setting at 87.9, but 90% of the time it is not a problem. The Griffin iTrip Mini does a terrific job for a superb price and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Functions As Specified","review":"I was overly excited to have bought this product. Not only would I not need to purchase a separate head unit that plays MP3 files, but I wouldn't need to burn music CDs anymore. Well, IF this iTrip thing would function properly. Griffin says that you get the best sound quality on a station that has nothing but static. You won't find many living in L.A. Once you do, however, there is so much static that you hear during songs that aren't very loud. Louder songs will mask the static. i.e. a slow love song versus rock. Not only that, and I don't know if this is just a defect of my iTrip, after a couple of songs, the intended radio frequency will take over and shut my iTrip out. Its not my volume level because I'm not even touching the player. Nothing but disappointment for a product I very much wanted to enjoy and give a good review for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!","review":"This product sounds great in concept but doesn't work. I bought it despite some horrible reviews thinking that in a smaller sized city, there wouldn't be as much interference. Even with many \\"empty\\" stations to program from, it was not do-able. The preset station comes through with a lot of static and none of the \\"programmed\\" stations come through any better. Please invest your money into some other product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a problem here","review":"Over Christmas I drove cross country and this device worked the entire way with the same station the whole way to and around L.A. (the default station). As long as your ipod is in a secure spot that doesn't move around a lot, I found the reception and sound quality to be great. There were a few times when I did have to move the ipod around a little and then the reception would work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"While others (particularly those in large cities) have complained about the static and lack of broadcast channels, I have found several channels that I can broadcast to successfully. This item works AS ADVERTISED. If you live in a big city with no clear channels, of COURSE you won't find one that will allow the iTrip to broadcast to without any interference. If you have at least one clear channel, though, I think you'll find it works just fine. I've had no problem with the transmit capability from my car (whether the iPod is in the cup holder, the ashtray, etc) to my antenna (back center of roof). The sound, of course, is not the same as having the CD IN the CD player--you don't get the stereo capabilities and sounds. Even still, this eliminates the need to carry every CD that I want to listen to and it's easy to use. I do plug it in to charge it while I transmit since the iTrip uses some power. I've also found this device to work very well at home. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, discription sounds good - doesn't work in car.","review":"From my experience it seems clear that this product does not work in an automobile. I spent several hours trying to get clear sounding music sent from my iPod Mini to a car stereo.After several hours of trying \\"clear\\" station after \\"clear\\" station I could not get the unit to ever transmit a good signal.I attempted this in a Jeep Grand Cherokee, a Honda Pilot, and a Mercedes SL500 (with top down).The iTrip works in our house, but it is useless if you want to listen to your iPod music in a car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Icky Thump","review":"I had to warm up to this a bit but now I think its really good. I actually think its one of their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something new I like, finally","review":"These two keep getting better. I really think this is their best. If you've liked previous recordings give this a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"I've been a huge White Stripes fan for the last 5 years and this album didn't dissapoint. They break some new ground for the band and the ventures into synthesizers and bag-pipes are done well. Although there are some gems on this album (icky thump, conquest) there are some forgettable songs and it is not as solidly good from top to bottom as some of there recent albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but ...","review":"The White Stripes have never made a bad disc, but I don't find anything hugely groundbreaking here. After Jack White's diversions with The Raconteurs and Loretta Lynn, I thought the Stripes might start taking some more chances, and there are a few here such as the bagpipes and the \\"ancient\\" synthesizer. Any other band and I would have given this CD 5 stars, but knowing how much the White Stripes are capable of vs. what appear here and four is the most I can give."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Behind Me Icky!","review":"I was a huge fan of \\"Elephant\\" and \\"Get Behind Me Satan.\\" I have constantly defended these albums against those who criticize the White Stripes. But this album left me feeling icky. The first three songs were really good (especially \\"You Don't Know What Love Is...\\"). But after hearing those three songs, I was expecting even better songs to come. Unfortunately, they did not. Jack's signature guitar licks are great and his voice is awesome and Meg's constant drum pounding is...well, it is what it is. However, the songs were mostly just odd with lyrics that felt freestyled and unimaginative. The music is very, very bluesy but it doesn't really go anywhere. This is nowhere near The Stripes best material. If they made a best of album, only about 2 songs on here should be included. Tracks six through nine were just terrible and needed to push the \\"next\\" button on. I am so disappointed, but will not give up on the Stripes. There is always next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Return of the Vampire Orphans!!!","review":"Hello World,Get some sun and get some lessons you two. Get out and go for a hike or a fishing trip.

Where the White Stripes self-imposed restrictions used to work for them previously, it works against them this time. Jack tries to be more ambitious in his songs but find himself stuck within his own formula. Meg's limitations are more evident than ever and it's obvious that she can't keep up anymore. Jack still has the talent but it sounds like the White Stripes have run their course. Find yourself a band and a real drummer Jack and come back to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily their worst album","review":"Not sure what happened - this album just isn't on par with their other releases. Doesn't have the feeling of the other albums, many of the tracks cause me to reach for the skip track button as soon as I hear them. Not innovative, sometimes barely musical.

Why are people so drawn to a Bass-less band with a Bass-ic (he he) drummer? The last few albums were so much better. This is just annoying and Black seems to love other bands riffs.....maybe this album will grow on me? I dont know? I can say that I am really disappointed as of now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Entertaining","review":"I am going on my 15th or so listening of the CD and it has not yet become boring. The different tracks are different in style enough so that you don't feel at all like you are listening to the same song over and over and yet it retains that White Stripes magic throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Candy Coated Infectious Confection from the White Stripes","review":"I don't believe Icky Thump tops the previous White Stripes release but in it's own right, It is a great CD. New listeners and established fans will find themselves singing to song genre's they would not otherwise have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I am a boomer who usually sticks to Van Morrison, Beatles, Stones, Hendrix, the Band, Dylan etc. I had heard a great deal about White Stripes. I tried this CD, and I really like it. It is interesting and different in many ways, but each song is good; each song catches your ear. Some reviewers thought bagpipes or other sounds were a bit of a joke, but I think each song works very well. (I also liked Radiohead, Hail to the Thief, in the kind of way that you know it is different, but everything is good in its own way.) I would recommend this CD to anyone of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Led Zeppelin fans!","review":"This album is definetly one of this year's greatest releases. I was never really much of a big fan of The White Stripes, but Icky Thump is pure hard rock. There's some amazing progressions from folk to hard rock. It sounds like they've put a lot more heart and soul into making this album than the others. If you're a fan of Led Zeppelin or The Doors, check this album out. It's not flawless, but it is definetly progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eccentric Rockers Triumphant Return","review":"Despite the quality of their last outing I was still leaning towards Elephant as their best record as it had certainly spoiled me as to what to expect from this exceptionally gifted band. However, I can say that this time out they have outdone their best efforts and Icky Thump rises to the top of their artistic exertions. I mean come on, how can anyone say differently after you hear the bagpipes kick in on track seven?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the Best Music on the Market Today","review":"Very simply put...this is some of the best and most unique music out there today.

Nobody else sings the rock'n blues anymore like Jack while Meg pounds those drums like nobody else I have ever heard. She is a precision drum machine don't ya know. Almost mechanical.Also as a Led Zep fan I always hear their influence and love it. Jack also has a touch of Bjork in his voice at times & is equally as quirky & theatrical to boot.You won't be disappointed if you love the WS. Another fun loving & bizarre CD with some international flavor (Tijuana brass or Scottish bagpipes) added to the mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"ah, the stripes","review":"The White Stripes provide a great feeling that music can still mean more than all the Top Pop out there. The Stripes reinvent themselves with every album. Thanks goodness we have them. Grab this disc and enjoy. Better yet, go see them live and breathe in the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a perfect title!","review":"Not since the Rolling Stones put out \\"Sucking in the 70's\\" has an album been so appropriately titled. \\"Thump\\" is a perfect description of Meg's drumming \\"style\\" (such as it is), and Jack's vocals, guitar, and songwriting are the epitome of \\"Icky\\". There's been some great rock and roll over the years made by marginally talented musicians (The Stooges, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, and so many others), and there's been some great music put out by bands that were completely pretentious egomaniacs (Yes, Genesis, King Crimson), but combining pretentious egomania with marginal talent (ie: Jack White) or none at all (guess who?) just produces a blinding headache of a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zep Without Zip","review":"When I first heard them I liked the White Stripes because of their Led Zeppelin sound but after a few listens it's apparent the Stripes are not up to par with Zep. Maybe they are aware of their limitiations and that is why they maintain that playful aura or maybe that is the realm they prefer to play in. In their early years, when Heart would channel Led Zepplin they really rocked. I don't see that here. But I do give the Stripes credit for not doing a straight rip-off like Lenny Kravitz does."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like it - and i am a HUGE fan","review":"i like all previous white stripes albums. i have seen them live a couple of times - but i don't like this album even a little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"icky is right","review":"I only liked the first song.

There is really only a couple of works that are worthwhile, with the larger portion being there to satisfy the freaks that are satisfied by weirdness for being weirdness. I would recommend caution purchasing this...it will not remain in my collection. Jack should put out fewer albums, with more quality creation...he is obviously capable from the good stuff...what little there is...Jack White, or Jack WHAT?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sold on it yet...","review":"Maybe I just have to listen to it a few more times... it kind of loses me after track 3... I had nothing against Get Behind Me Satan, only that it wasn't as good as Elephant.I MISS the catchy stuff... and other than Icky Thump (title track) nothing is catching my attention off this one just yet.There is some killer guitar work, but I miss Meg's ballads...It'll happen again, I suppose. One reviewer mentioned GBMS as their possible dud.So far for me, this may be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"This band hit their peak with Elephant, but ever since I feel like Jack has been tossing us gimmicks to keep albums coming out. He has run out of riffs and song writing ideas on this one. This sounds like a parody of the White Stripes. Personally, I'm tired of bands trying too hard to make an album sound like it came out in 1969. Be original, move ahead, and try something new. I can't wait for all the 19 year old kids who are about to start a new music revolution. We all need it badly because garage rock has seen better days. What a boring album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack White= the Keith Richards of GenX","review":"Mark my words, people will be playing the riffs of Jack White for generations to come.......Stripes CD's are perfectly written and produced, where Jack has proven to be a genious....the Lorreta Lynn CD he did was probably one of the most brilliant musical projects released in the last 30 years. With Icky Thump, song after song of great catchy riffs and big hooks are abundant. A true genious, and sure rock and roll hall of famer when the time comes. I'd also highly recomend the new Poi Dog Pondering '7' CD, almost a polar opposite of the Stripes, but somehow very similar in the enjoyment equation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The White Stripes Masterpiece!

If you likes the White Stripes work so far, then you would love this. Its more of the same, nothing Groundbreaking, nothing revolutionary.2. This is one of those \`flavor of the month' albums that garner a lot of blog praise, but later in the year no one will even remember it.3. Though some of the rock tunes here are good (in an \`averagey' sort of way), none of them are memorable (even after three listens)4. Theres this OVERWHELMING feeling of \`been there, done that'. In fact, the entire album sounds very tired to me.5. You could do much better than fall for the hype.I would highly recommend the new Smashing Pumpkins album, or even the Sara Bareilles album over this one, anyday.Two Stars. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumping Icky","review":"I love the White Stripes and this album is up there.

Others, despite mullets throughout, stay somehow timeless, such as Lost Boys. This movie has neither working for it. It's got almost zero style. The soundtrack is nearly non-existant except for some notes here and there which set the mood that you are watching one of the rare bad episodes of Columbo. The plot is very clumsey. Worst is the cutesey, overly forced-sassiness of the females efforts in seducing the moderately good looking male. Or maybe the male's terrible attempts at acting like he's on a phone call, repeatedly yelling \\"No-\\", and \\"Bradshaw\\" (such a cliche' boss/investigator's name). Just a horrible movie I regret trying to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally something useful","review":"I've read a lot of barefoot stuff. That's what I expected this to be. But it's not.

Well done, Mary Chapin Carpenter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last word on my favorite Mary Chapin Carpenter album","review":"Stones in the Road is by far my all-time favorite album of hers. To prove that I had to replace my first copy of her cd because I managed to scratch two of my favorite tracks on the cd \\"Outside Looking In\\" and \\"Jubilee\\". In comparison to her previous cds, Stones in the Road is a departure from the optimistic outlook she portrays. Mary took a drastic turn with Stones in the Road by turning it into a darker, bleaker album which I thought she succeeded in doing. \\"A Keeper for the Flame\\", \\"The Last Word\\", \\"House of Cards\\", \\"Jubilee\\", \\"Stones in the Road\\", and \\"Outside Looking In\\" are my very favorite tracks but all the songs on this cd is a winner with me.

What a gem of a recording. The whole album is eminently listenable and soothes the soul nicely. She carries off a very nice clear vocal delivery juxtoposed with rich narratives of self-empowerment as well as various facets of the human experience. Overall, it uplifts and soothes in a most inspiring manner.The title track, \\"Feel So High\\", \\"Living In The City\\", \\"You Gotta Be\\", \\"Crazy Maze\\", \\"In My Dreams\\" are my favorites.If you're only familiar with \\"You Gotta Be\\", you \\"gotta be\\" missing out on some good stuff here."},{"rating":"2","title":"i really dug this album","review":"i really dug this album by Des'ree.her voice goes rather well with the music.the lyrics are good as well.she is a very talented singer.i first heard her on Terence Trent D'arby's Delicate.You Gotta Be has had an Influence in the states on alot of Records that i have heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great listen!","review":"This is one of my favorite CD's.

The themes are familiar: courage, love, loyalty, obsession, greed, treachery, et al, but it feels to the reader as if one was encountering them for the first time in literature, by a master of the language, and the effect can be almost overwhelming: many are the passages that will effectively halt a reading until your tears are dried: Yavanna lamenting over the Trees, Fingolfin's hopeless duel with Morgoth, Finrod Felagund's \\"First Contact\\" with the Fathers of Men and subsequent death saving Beren, and Hurin's last stand at the Fen of Serech are just a few.

Also, since I pretty much sweat all over while at the gym (including my hands and palms), this material became even more difficult to hold onto lift after lift. I guess the gripping material provides more friction against the bar than other straps I've used, but what good is that when the straps slip against your fingers?Save your money & look elsewhere.

Nice material, no slipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"unwieldy straps","review":"I bought these based on some of the good reviews and ratings, but after using them, the negative reviews were probably more on target than the positive ones. Whether you are a novice or a veteran workout buff, you will find that the basic harbinger or valeo straps will deliver a nice grip without the cumbersome adjusting and higher price tag.

For the past 10 years, it remains one of my favorites -- as my life changes, and I get older, I never tire of it. And while I haven't gotten into the group's other albums so much, I can say that this particular work -- Songs for a Blue Guitar -- is about as close to being a perfect album as they come. It evokes a melancholy so pure, so powerful, it shakes your soul to the core. The tracks breathe, not being overproduced with too much instrumentation. If I had to take 5 albums with me to a deserted island, this would have to be one of them (and I own a lot of music!). I was hoping other RHP stuff would do the same for me, but nothing comes close. That's OK. The group should be proud to have produced something so extraordinarily divine -- Brilliant.

Looking at the price, one might think it is a bargain; it is not! No words come close to describing how bad the remake is; the acting (Except for Mia Farrow & Pete Postlethwaite) was nauseating. Damien 3 was a very cheaply done film, which has a Monty Python feel to it. The Omen IV was plain stupid and boring. The Omen II was somewhat watchable with decent acting, but it lacks horror, suspense or anything that makes it interesting .

Part II had so many predictable deaths, I felt like I was watching \\"Final Destination,\\" which is a decent series unto itself, but with \\"The Omen\\" being about mankind's end of days according to scripture, I expected more of a supernatural feeling and events foretold in the Bible.

They make a great deal of bold assertions, yet fail to cite the sources of these assertions. Additionally, the book makes sharp attacks to those on the political right with no real rhyme or reason.

While I am not a horror fan by any means, and this movie has frequently been described as a \\"thinking man's horror film,\\" I found it engrossing. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who is willing to take a dark, hallucinatory journey into the world were biology and technology quite literally become one. On the surface, this film which stars James Woods and Deborah Harry, involves a sleazy cable TV owner (Woods) becoming increasingly addicted to an ultraviolent snuff TV program called \\"Videodrome.\\" Woods' degenerative journey as addict and victim of \\"Videodrome\\" is particularly relevant in our society of every-increasing technological reliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why would anyone watch a scum show like videodrome?","review":"The answer: because it is absolutely mesmerizing. Of course, those of you who are familiar with this very unusual tale will recognize that line uttered by the diabolical (SPOILER!) Barry Convex is actually a very well placed pun.I haven't yet seen the Criterion version of this film yet but if it is anything like other Criterion discs that I've seen it will be great. In any case, the movie, while extreme, is definitely worth seeing if you can take the violence and the lurid atmosphere. Not recommended for kids though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Cronenberg...","review":"This is Croneberg's best film (and that's really saying something). Filled with intriguing ideas, slick direction, fine acting, and special effects that are just cool. This (along with Brazil, Robocop, and Full Metal Jacket) is one of the best movies of the 80's. The plot isn't confusing, but it will go over some people's heads. Some people will mistake this as being stupid. Like all of Cronenberg's movies, it's original to the point of being bizarre. There's a whole lot of stuff here that some people might not want to see. Like hallucinogens, Videodrome is for those who can handle it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Criterion misses the boat on this one","review":"I'm fairly certain that most people who have seen this movie have seen it because Debbie Harry is in it. It is a thought-provoking movie which leaves a lot to the viewers' discretion. Is Debbie Harry real or is she just another \\"Videodrome\\" hallucination? I definately wouldn't say this is a \\"fun\\" movie either...after watching it I felt dirty and sleazy, like I needed to take a long hot shower. Anyway, since this is the big fancy \\"Criterion Collection\\" DVD, one would think that they would serve up the extra scenes which can be seen on the TV version of Videodrome shown on on Sci-Fi etc.. But no, instead they give us the same version thats been in circulation since the days of VHS! They don't even include the extra scenes as bonus material. What a waste! Unless you are really anxious to hear James Woods commentary (Debbie's on there too, but doesn't talk too much) then I would save myself the extra $25 and just buy the old DVD version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This brutal Cronenburg film began with an intriguing story. The hallucinating effects are brilliant, as is James Woods performance. But as the story unfolds it becomes boring, trivial, and lost. For a good Cronenburg film, check out Naked Lunch or Crash.

His acting is never anything less than superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Short...wowtf!","review":"i just don't know what to say about this movie...It's good, don't get me wrong, just that it's one of those movies that messes with your head.watch this if you need to feel normal..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want this DVD!!! But...","review":"I have owed a VHS copy of VIDEODROME for years. It is an extremely creepy, atmospheric movie. James Woods, as always, is amazing. Debbie Harry is actually pretty good, considering this was her first major motion picture. The soundtrack is good too! The reason I won't buy this on DVD is because it would go against everything the movie is about (what is it about?). Just keep in mind that this movie was made during the advent of home video (i.e. VHS & Beta).

Im not a Cronenburg Fan but what he portrays is a techno mind twister that will keep you at your wits end. Although people say its weird and disgusting, the whole idea and story is pretty incredible! I was a little shaky if this would be good or not. It's awesome! The transfer was brilliant. The image is crisp, clean, and debri free! Sound is crystal clear, and takes you into the strange world of Videodrome! This purchase was worth it. Great extras as well. James Woods is an extrodianary actor and fits the film well.

Of course \\"Mr Pants\\" is not my real name, it's my internet name ...Had Cronenberg been able to forsee the advent of the Web, he could have made some very interesting insights about it with Videodrome. But in some ways I think I appreciate it more without its connections. Its dated aspects only serve to make it seem all the more prophetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Terrifying!","review":"This is probably the most troubling film that I have ever seen. I have watched it at least 10 times, and each time seems to frighten me more than the first!James Woods is brilliant in this film, while some of the other cast members were a little limp. It's low-budget feel seems to add even more to Woods' performance. I recommend watching this movie in the dark and late at night - you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad.","review":"Probably the worst Cronenberg film I've seen, and I am a fan. An incoherent, pretentious mess. Sorry I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what all the noise is about","review":"Very weird film with a dark message about TV watching, I guess. I wasn't entirely sure where this was going, and I wasn't terribly impressed with the swamp monster special effects. This has gotten all sorts of cult worship over the years, but I really can't see why. Debbie Harry gives an interesting performance, and James Woods does the same hyper-schtick he went on to give throughout his career. I did like the ominous, spooky organ soundtrack, like something out of \\"Phantom of the Opera.\\" For Cronenberg fanatics only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"I can safely say that this may be the best science fiction film ever. Now, that is alot of commitment but you have to see the movie to truly understand the experiance. True, it will never rival Naked Lunch, but it is fascinating in its own uniqueness. I have honestly never seen anything at all like this. Of course, all of Cronenberg's movies are different in their own respect.This aside of Crash, is Cronenberg's most visually disturbing movie. With all the gory effects, it makes the bathtub scene in The Dead Zone seem petty. if you rent this movie, do it on a relatively empty stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cronenberg's masterpiece not given enough justice","review":"This film, like many of Cronenberg's, was way ahead its time. I think the other reviews give it plenty of credit, however I wish to warn any potential buyers that there are more \\"complete\\" versions of this film in circulation. Like many of Cronenberg's celluloid, it fell under the knife. This is the re-released \\"uncut\\" version, but there is almost 30 minutes of additional footage out there, much of which has been seen on cable TV and foreign bootlegs. There are scenes which take the storyline even farther into madness/TV un-reality, which enhance the perceived confusion immensely. This film really deserves Criterion treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"One of the best movies ever made. Cronenberg hit top form and top weirdness with this one. This is not just another hole in the stomach for inserting video cassettes film?!, this is the one that worked. The best way to watch this film is to have very little knowledge of what it is about before seeing it. So all I will say is \\"buy it now\\".Apparently it didn't do to well at the box office and if you watch the trailer on this disc you will see why(whoever came up with it should be ...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most creative movies ever.","review":"This movie opens up a world that was startling 30 years ago, and is astounding now. I never understood why it ended at one movie. The most original concept to actually see production in the last 50 years. Magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cronenberg's VIDEODROME: one of his 3 best movies","review":"David Cronenberg's VIDEODROME, his 6th movie, was the first of his \\"great\\" films. (The other two being THE DEAD ZONE and DEAD RINGERS). This is the first movie where he gave up on b-grade horror gore and started to get under our skin by being a very smart and mature film maker. (Not to say that his previous work wasn't smart, this was his first \\"thinking\\" movie). Fans of cronenberg a must! Fans of sci-fi, action, and drama will not be disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick","review":"I didn't like it. I suppose if you are sado-masochistic by nature, you might enjoy it. The plot was too broken, and I was disappointed with Howard Shore's music. His modern movie scores are much better. I just kept saying \\"Yuk!\\" and then laughing where it wasn't supposed to be funny. Sorry, but this film was just b.a.d. in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Hell Was Videodrome?????","review":"This movie is really stupid. I bought it because I'm a huge fan of Debbie Harry's. This movie is like, wicked slow. I got soooooo bored, Debbie's not even on the screen 99% of the time. If you like Cronenburg, I suggest that you DO ADD THIS FLIM TO YOUR COLLECTION, for I think if you're into blood, gore, and tons of nudidy, this is O.K. If you're like me, and a Debbie Harry, Sonja Smiths, or James Woods fan, I think you should just rent it, and see how you like it. But if you want it NOW, this movie is alright to buy, I guess.RATED R, LOTS OF NUDIDY, and the movie revoles around a new \\"underground\\" TV show, in which these men in black leather, wipe and kill naked women, chained to a clay wall, so don't watch this if you can't handle that WEIRD stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - NO DOLBY 5.1 OR DTS TRACKS!","review":"Yeah, the box, extras and picture quality are amazing. BUT, the audio track is Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono(not even the 2.0 listed on amazon) - NO Dolby 5.1 or DTS at all! Guess Criterion said \\"let's preserve this the way it originally aired\\". All well and good, but they COULD have included an alternate 5.1/DTS track. And, yes, I did read the item description on amazon but there have been times where the description was lacking. Especially on new releases/special editions. Awesome image quality but would have been great to have sound coming out of all of my six speakers. Very sad and disappointing since this could have been a true '5 star' release. We'll probably not see another release of this classic and we're stuck with this mono version."},{"rating":"1","title":"WIERD, WIERd, WIErd, WIerd, Wierd, wierd.............","review":"Confusing, silly and boring at times. Not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU'LL EITHER LOVE IT OR HATE IT?","review":"Well, I hate it. This movie made no sense at all. I got this movie based on the reviews on [amazon.com], plus it had to be on at least five or so lists as, \\"the most disturbing cinema I've seen\\". Most disturbing? More like most confusing. I guess some of the people that make up these lists are kids. The fx were not that great and I was expecting to see a little more of Deborah Harry(preferably naked). She was hardly in the picture. There were scene's of endless discussion and the only good stuff in the movie was shown on a fuzzy t.v., that you could hardly see. Don't waste your time and money on this, instead go get an Ilsa flick. I've seen Troma movies that were better and more entertaning than this. The reason for two stars is that I do like James Woods and think he did a great job with a boring script. If this is the best Cronenberg flim(as some other reviewers wrote)than god help us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guaranteed to bring up your tv dinner!","review":"In the event of an emergency when watching this film, your empty popcorn bucket makes a useful vomitory aid. Your couch cushion can be used as a floatation device, when the bucket overflows, to drift yourself out of the living room and as far away from the tele as you can possibly get. You'll be sick to your stomach for sure knowing you've wasted good money on bile such as this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric and Dated","review":"This movie has a preposterous and dated plot consisting of mostly half-understood McLuhan, The acting is very poor. The script is worse. The special effects are ludicrous (watch James Wood push his head into a TV screen made of back lit dental dam material - Gee, How did they do that?).This is my nomination for the world's worst movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"YYYYAAAAAAWWWWWWNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!","review":"The only reason this got one star instead of none was the fact that James Woods was in it (plus you can't rate items with less than one star...). I felt like turning it off after the first ten minutes because it was so boring, but I decided to give a try. I would rather have my time back then say I watched that dull bit of movie making. I can't believe any of you would call this a classic. It's a classic piece of boring trash, and thats about it. Besides Woods, the acting was terrible, the storyline mundane, and what little special effects there were did not really impress. But I guess some people need to cling to a movie that stinks like this, just so they can tell people they think its a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"After all these years...","review":"I still can not froget this book. It's about two friends Tracy and \\"Manna\\" who start writing to each other as pen pals. It starts of as kind of joke but the two girls become real frineds. Espically after Tracy tells the truth about her life.The more they write the more they are pulled into each other life, which not as near as perfect as the other thinks it is. This book is great at showing you that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. That no one has a \\"perfect\\" life or family. I think the most unforgetable thing about this book though is the ending. This is what made me never forget this book. Thought you can pretty much figure out what happens it'll still keep you up at night thinking about it. If you want one really great unforgetable book, by this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read...","review":"SAFE INFORMATION TO THOSE INTERESTED IN READING THIS BOOK:I thought this book was great, the letter format was unique. It started a bit slow/boring but picked up about a 1/3 of the way through. I would recommend it to people over 15, though; some issues are hard to handle and there are some questionable situations. Also, this book is set in Australia, and their English is different from ours, in America. It's still understandable, but sometimes annoying (sorry!)<P...OVERALL COMMENTSThis book was well worth the [money] spent on it. I finished it in one sitting. Enjoy it, laugh with it (and some parts *are* cute), and even cry with it. But most importantly, learn from it about the true power of friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay but not too special","review":"I just finished reading it, and I GUESS that the book was good, but what is up with the end? Did John Marsden get tired of writing? I really liked parts of the book. I could relate to Mandy and Tracey in some parts of the book.I wouldn't reccomend buying it, go check it out at the library if you really want to read it. It's also kind of hard to understand without knowledge of autraillian slang but I like the slang part, makes it more realistic. Maybe a glossary or something of the sort would help readers enjoy the book better? Hope the next book I read is better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but with a horrible ending","review":"The book started out OK. You got to know a little more about each charater with each of their letters. I hated, though, that you NEVER found out some things like exactly why Tracey was in jail. The ending was very abrupt and left you with little idea of what had happened. To enjoy this book you are going to have to have an active imagination to fill in what is missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"This book was totally not worth reading. It was basically a bunch of pages full of PenPal letters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible Book!","review":"I can't understand why this novel was recommended to a friend of mine, and why it was a notable book for young adults per the ALA. This book is near ridiculous! The ending is a complete waste of time, making me wonder why I bothered in the first place, because the novel took the reader absolutely nowhere. We never get an insight into the reality of tracey's situation. Also, it's written in Australian slang, with no index, so you hav eno idea what a lot of the terms and abbreviations are. I do not recommend this book to any reader of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book of letters, loved it","review":"I think this was a really good book. I read another one of John Mardsen's books b4, \\"So much to tell U\\" I think. That book was a book of letters too. Book books were very good, esp this one. At first, it was quie confusing and hard to follow. But if u go on to read it, u'll find out what an amazing book it is. Two girls juz writing letters together, seems so simple yet so complicated. The author has put the characters forward as if it were true in actual life (whihc may even occur!). It was quite touching too. Read it. And don't be too bored by the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written!","review":"This book was wonderful....it was a book that I couldn't put down!! They ending disappointed me though. I want to know exactly what happened to mandy...if anyone knows please e-mail me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marsden's Selective Details Paint Vivid Picture","review":"What I most enjoyed about this compelling book is the way Marsden chose very specific details to illuminate the characters and their situations. The ending is disapointing at first -- it always is when you want to know exactly what happened. The book is so strong because Marsden knows exactly what details to leave out. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK! I DID AND I LOVED IT.","review":"THIS BOOK IS ABOUT TWO GIRLS WHO STARTS TO BE PEN-PALS. ONE OF THEM, TRACEY, WRITES A LOT ABOUT HER IDYLLYC LIFE WHILE THE OTHER GIRL, MANDY, WRITES MOST ABOUT HER VIOLENT BROTHER. WHEN THEY THOUGHT THEY NEW EACH OTHER A HORRIBLE LIE REVEALS...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"This book is so cool and filled with a lot of info on all the dillinger members. Stuff that I didn't even know, and I have like 5-6 dillinger books. Before I read it and always liked John Hamilton the second best, but after reading Homer Van Meter made a big impression on me. Dillinger actually looked to Homer for advice on alot of things. Also I love how him and Baby face are always fighting, came close to pulling guns on each other a couple times. Read this book in less than a 5 days, usually I only read at work on breaks but this was hard to put down every chapter is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Disappointing-feel short of its potential. At best, this may be useful as an introduction or for pre-high school (which is its target). However, there are no maps and no charts, etc. The battle entries are very incomplete and not well organized. Additionally, the battle entries do not (generally) identify the campaign or conflicts in which they occurred. Additionally, the conclicts or campaigns have no comprehensive list of battles which occurred therein. The book provides certain facts but there is no attempt to help the reader organize those facts-so you get facts without proper context-a good encyclodedia should provide facts and context for those facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor value at 12 tracks only","review":"Potential buyers should note that there is another CD, Christmas In Vienna, issued a few years later, that seems to contain the meagre number of tracks from this disk, plus an additional 6 tracks, making for rather better value.There is also a VHS tape, very cheap at the time of writing this, also titled Celebration In Vienna and apparently containing the same performances, which may contain 75 minutes of playing time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful texture","review":"I love most jerky products, but the texture of this was just gross.... I couldn't eat more than a bite, and had to discard the entire pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a meal","review":"These are really good, almost good enough to call a lunch. I almost feel if you wrap these with a tortilla and add a few toppings and perhaps some salsa, you would have yourself a lunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty scanning of first time derivative dots.","review":"I regret that I must give a 1 rating because the x and y components of velocity, which are represented in the book by dots over the x and y, are not distinguished from the coordinate variables, in some cases. That is, the dots are omitted in some but not all instances. This became apparent in a sentence that stated that the variables were (x, y, x-dot, y), where x-dot was written with a dot over the x. The second y should have read y-dot, which revealed that the process of converting the book to digital content had either failed to detect the dots that represented a first derivative, or else a filter had removed some of the dots as apparent visual blemishes.This review is intended to apply only to the Kindle version, which is defective. (I would give zero stars if I could, since equations that can not distinguish between variables and their first time derivative can not be understood.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Horse Movie & Russel Crow","review":"My kid loves this movie and rented it so many times that I finally purchased it. I believe it's a bit autobiographical--the mother writes the \\"story\\" for her daughter, only somehow the story turns out to be true. Russell Crow plays \\"The Man\\" (I read that he did the film for his horse-crazy niece) and does a fine job at it. The horses are beautiful, although I've never thought of a creamy palimino as silver. Oh well. As a parent, you can sit through this movie and not be bored to tears. Beautiful scenery, horses, nice story."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!!!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies!!! The story is great, the actors are great (especially Russell Crowe), the music is fantastic, the horses are gorgeous, and the plot is interesting. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasurable Jaunt in the Country","review":"I just saw this movie for the first time and definitely watch it again. I am sorry it is not out on DVD. The scenery in this flick is georgous and so is Russell Crowe. The horses were beautiful and wild. As a breeder of horses I was very disturbed at the fight sequences between the stallions. Since this movies is supposed to be a \\"family oriented\\" film I was surprised they showed such violence. Crowe again proves he doesn't need lines to project his masculinity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor movie","review":"The making of this film was poorly done.

Russell Crowe is great as usual. There's no vulgarity, which is more and more a rarity even in \\"family\\" movies. There's some fantasy elements as the main horse seems to have unusual intelligence and power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good and Clean Family Show!","review":"This is a very good Horse show about a wild stallion which both my mom and I loved watching. Everyone in the family should like this show it is clean and keeps you glued to the TV wondering what will happen next to Thowra The Silver Stallion. I wish they made more clean shows like this one that everyone in the family can enjoy without worrying about foul language. GOOD SHOW GET IT AND WATCH IT!Excellent show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid Flick","review":"Enjoyed this film, even though it is more of a kid flick, not alot of dialogue, but Crowe proves once again that he can say a thousand words with just a look on his face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking cinematography and beautiful horses.","review":"I read the book many years ago in 6th grade and it is still one of my all-time favorites. Unfortunately, it is out of print and very hard to find, even in Australia. This movie follows the main story line of the book, but from a more human viewpoint. It chronicles the writing of the book with scenes of the author, Elyne Mitchell, and her daughter interspersed with the scenes of the story and the horses it chronicles. I would have preferred to have more of the horse story and less of the human one (hence the 4 star rating.) If you liked \\"The Man from Snowy River\\", also based on the book by Elyne Mitchell, or just like to watch gorgeous horses running through beautiful scenery, you'll love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"THE BEST MOVIE EVER.

I'm still scratching my head wondering how in the world he was talked into doing this sorry, no-count flick.If you know horses and horse people you'll hate this movie. Nothing remotely resembling real horse behavior,training or care for that matter is apparent in this movie. Horses don't act or do the things that this movie portrays.There is little to no, meaningful dialog throughout the movie. Even the Silver stallion isn't . . he's a Palamino. Pretty common looking horses throughout the heard scenes. All the way around, nothing special to say about this sadly portrayed movie about one of God's most magnificent, noble creatures.The Silver Stallion"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD's","review":"Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about The Book of Eli.

I thought there would be more beautiful scenery. Maybe Snowy River just spoilt me. That had the scenery. I felt it was a little dull. It was not an entire waste of time and for those who like a quiet movie it might be okay but I would not view it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impress Your Japanese Friends","review":"The Japanese language is full of fixed expressions. In fact the knowledge of fixed expressions (kotowaza) is considered so important that they are often included on school exams. This book introduces 101 of the basics in a comprehensive, but easy to understand, way. Each expression is explained with a full page of text that includes an sample usage and also a full page illustration that often helps you to understand and remember the expression. For more advanced learners, I recommend checking the Power Japanese series for appropriate titles (there are several). If you're like me, you'll appreciate that this book allows you to express concepts in a way that native speakers will understand. Once you can seamlessly integrate these expressions into your everyday speech, you will be well on your way to fluency."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I liked Enamored better than Mystery Man. Diego Maremos is a highly delectible guy, and the story of him and Melissa has elemnts of suspense, romance and intrigue as well as some very satisfying love scene.

Some chapters may even appear to say exactly the same as previous authors. But in some aspects this book is quite original. It starts with an outburst of patriotic praise of the English language.You get the message that the world speaks English and we must teach the very few who are so unfortunate not to so so yet. What about them, your students? You are advised not to be preconceived, to avoid stereotypes. Unfortunately the book does precisely what it tells you not to do. It says that the Arabs are too demanding, the Spaniards get too excited, and so on, complaining about different nationalities. In my view this book is rather trivial and too unfriendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I took it back","review":"This book starts with an outburst of British patriotism, everyone speaks the language, but on reflection we are trying to teach it to the poor folks who dont speak it yet.

The picture is a bit shaky at times, but that's what the original was like too, back in 1987.I would totally urge any Turtles fan old or young to pick this up.

I'm glad to finally see it on dvd, I can't stand the new series.This cartoon takes place in what I think is the greatest era of cartoon making and animation the mid 80's early 90's. It is about time They start apperaing on dvd.The early TMNT is a 5 star quality show, the reason I give it a 4 is the DVD itself isn't the greatest. This dvd should have came in a 1st and 2nd season box set. the dvd contains all the 5 episodes of season 1, and 4 bounus episodes of season 6 I belive.This DVD would be a sin not to own, for any cartoon fan!!

Home of the nice slice!\\"","review":"Don't be fooled by the extremely kid friendly cover on this dvd because this is actually a rather healthy introduction into the world of the original TMNT cartoon. This is the five episode pilot that later launched into the mega hit cartoon that made these characters household names. There's familiar characters, some new, & some re-imagined, & despite the show being very different from the comic books this pilot is arguably the best of the entire show in terms of story, animation, & action as it later went into a much more slap stick comedy direction with lower quality animation. If your a fan of the TMNT 2K cartoon series this one is a good prequel even though both shows are very different from one another. We get no special features here but included are 4 never aired episodes from the last season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh the memories","review":"Great throwback for 80's babies.

I started watching them with a bit of hesitancy as I didn't want them to seem too dated or painfully bad as so many things from my childhood look to me now. But they were actually really good, funny and only a little cheesy. If there are any complaints about this, it's that the bonus episodes are out of order, but that's really only minor.

It's easy to read and easy to use. However, as it's usually the case with all-in-one books, it doesn't excel in any of the subjects it covers. Also, the index could be better and some significant animal species you'll encounter in Florida are missing from the list.Overall, it's worth owning one as a field guide to Florida, but since it was published about 10 years ago, some info needs to be updated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of its type","review":"On moving to Florida I made a thorough search for a compendious book on the state's flora and fauna. This turned out to be by far the best book of that nature.

The speeches make for good reading, but this book is not a reference work for one's library. Good speeches must be relatively simple and entertaining. These are. But one should not expect a rigorous investigation of regulation (nor of derivatives regulation) in this book. The advertising on this book is misleading. This is not a book written by Merton Miller. It is a good collection of speeches given by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A general book on derivatives designed for the casual reader","review":"This book was very dissapointing to me. I consider myself well read but a novice at derivatives. This is a book of speeches made by its author and is focussed on making the point that derivatives are a cheap insurance tool for certain situations and like all tools can be misused. There is the usual polemics of why a mandarinate government like Japan cannot manage a twenty first century country and why China should reject this form of development. I found the book lacking in rigor, insight and relatively low on substance. This book compares roughly to a sunday newspaper article from a not very good newspaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breezy, Brillant, Refreshing.","review":"I agree with vcpnttp@aol: \\"a collection of speechs ....comparable to a sunday newspaper article\\". Each chapter was breezy and easy to read. But I completely disagree with vcpnttp's conclusion. Miller is obviously brillant and knows derivatives well. Miller's view is of the forest, not the trees. There are too many techno-nerdy how-to books on swaps; this was a refreshing, insightful read. His understanding of the regulatory environment you'll find nowhere else.

If all you are looking for is a pretty \\"flyover\\" of an unrefined house design, this might work. As far as creating a working drawing with enough detail to build off of, this is not the program.My biggest problem with the software is that you have to export the drawing from FloorPlan to an included CAD program (TurboCAD) and then mark it up with dimensions, etc. If you want to move a window 3 inches, you have to go back into FloorPlan and move it, and re-import and start all over again with dimensioning.I was probably expecting too much for a cheaper CAD program but this one isn't even worth the effort.

I was pleased to see that \\"Hop Frog\\" also made the cut.His included poems numbered 31 and included: The Raven, Lenore, To The River, The Sleeper, The Haunted Palace, and Dreams. I believe the collection is well suited for a \\"Selected Works\\" book.The book itself is hardbound, the edges of the pages are gold, and a yellow ribbon book mark is built in to the top of the spine.

He is a hardened man who takes a job protecting a lovely child due to an enormous rash of child kidnappings in the area. I don't really want to say too much because the movie is too good to give away. But I can say the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with the action, explosions and yes, there is some rough scenes but overall this is an excellent movie.The plot is wonderful.

When he is crossed and double-crossed, he prepares to do his worst: interrogation and revenge on a large scale.The ending provides twists and turns but the strength of this film lies in its unabashed primary motive: revenge. And it is dastardly, effective, and sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I was not able to see this movie while it was playing in theatres and I just got the opportunity to do so last night on cable.

The acting is good, but it would better if we could bring back Charles Bronson to play the lead. He was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I had more time to write this review","review":"The movie was great. It started off rather slow and boring, but the plot of the movie developed as the film went on although the beginning was a little stretched out. It takes patience to get to the action. After that, the movie takes off and doesn't look back. Denzel goes on a crazy killing spree to get rid of everyone that was involved in the kidnapping and eventually figures out that the girl is still alive, which would have been a great twist that would complement the twist on the involvement of the father, if they had not made is so obvious. The only problems with the film are that Denzel recovers too fast from some very serious wounds and kills all the people without much trouble although they are supposed to be well protected. This made it a touch unrealistic but they made up for this by not including the happily ever after ending. Denzel does die and not all the bad guys are killed which makes the ending unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't stop watching it.","review":"The clerk at the video counter suggested it instead of the three others movies I already had in my hand.It was 12:30, and I was dead tired.......

The story does not drag at all, it seems everyone involved in the kidnapping is corrupt, even our hero Creasy, but it is also surprisingly touching at a couple of points. The action sequences are really well done and I like the overall dark, gritty feel. Denzel Washington gives a superb performance, as does Christopher Walken, but young Dakota Fanning absolutely shines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Better Movie","review":"Saw the movie, thought it was amazing... a different type of movie, a little slow at the begining establishing plot and story.. really getting a good feel for Washingtons character and Dakotas character.Just recently saw the book in my Dads collection of 20 years ago and read it.

I only gave it the high rating that I did for the violence (im a horror fan). Otherwise the movie was slow. You know what kills me? The conservative hypocrites that wont watch violent movies and then review and bash violent movies, but as soon as Denzel Washington stars in a violent movie, they praise it. People are dorks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow for a revenge flick; fast forward to the revenge","review":"It's a slow burn for the first half, and it's half an hour too long, although when it kicks into revenge mode it gets more satisfying - if you can stomach people losing digits and such. An interesting challenge to opponents of the death penalty, if nothing else. Good performances all round. Weird captioning thingy going on (you'll see).Much too slow and ponderous, but maybe this movie'll give Mexico a black eye regarding its corruption and kidnapping rackets. It's hard to believe Mexico City cooperated in the making of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"I am shocked at the number of people who actually thought this was a great movie, but I guess that it just a sign of the times. It was certainly a waste of Denzel Washington's talent. Creasy is a very unlikeable character, particuarly in the beginning of the movie. Who in their right mind would hire a psychologically unbalanced man with a drinking problem to guard their young daughter's life anyway? Then the never-ending violence is way over the top!!! Maybe it's just me but I cannot bear to watch someone be tortured (even if they did commit a horrendous crime) which occurs repeatedly throughtout the film. If you are a sensitive viewer stay away!!! This movie will haunt you....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that hot","review":"Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington do their part but this movie is not very good. It's been done and better. The style is kinda interesting but the story is so weak and unbelievable. Don't read any more or you'll learn about the plot. Denzel would have been dead waaaay before they have him tilt. Pita's story was unbelievable, no way would she just be held in a room unsold. Revenge is why we end up is stupid wars. I really wish civilization would stop glorifying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. Buy the Pelican Brief instead.","review":"The only thing that gave this DVD any value at all was that it starred Denzel Washington. Without him it would have been almost totally worthless. It was poorly written and didn't flow smoothly at all. The beginning dragged on and on and on. The plot was interesting but easy to figure out very early in the movie, i.e. police/government corruption and all the bad guys were tied together in some sort of gangster brotherhood. Lots of gratuitous violence, but I've spent time in Mexico and unfortunately, much of what is portrayed is very realistic as is the corruption/payoffs among government officials and the Mexican police. Save your money or buy an old copy of The Pelican Brief. Denzel Washington was awesome in that movie and it had a great story line that flowed smoothly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate that girl","review":"Well not really, but she made me want to die when she tries to be smart.

This sickening film has little to recommend it. A bodyguard's momentary inattention allows kidnappers to grab the little girl he is in charge of. Instantly--because of a turn in the plot--the police, the parents, the press, and the bodyguard assume the child has been killed by the kidnappers. The movie is hawked as a \\"revenge\\" movie, an excuse for Denzel's characer Creasy to mutilate, blow up, torture, slice off human parts as a way to asuage his anger at--I guess--having done a lousy job of being a bodyguard. Unadulterous trash. The people who put the talented little Dakota Fanning in this should be subjected the treatment Creasy dealt out to his victims."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will be her father now...","review":"Just a quick note to say that I love this movie. I cry at the end every time and I have watched it over and over to fully understand all the implications of Creasy's journey. The music is amazing and I have purchased the cd. The same composer was used in Spy Game so you can recognize the music.There is a double dvd of this movie that will show you all the deleted scenes and how the movie was made. Be sure to get this instead of the one dvd.Dakota really held her own against Denzel. Great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-wrenching fast-paced thriller","review":"I viewed this on a 42\\" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Player. Transfer is a 4/5 on PQ and 4/5 on AQ. This will probably take its place among my favorite Denzel Washington films. While it is highly stylized in shooting style, the story and relationship between him and the little girl and his redemption made this an above average thriller. Dakota and Denzel are outstanding, and this film is a nailbaiting rollercoaster ride to the end.

It is tephlon, so there are some specs where it's come off, but no biggy. The hardest thing about using this pan is actually getting the pancakes flipped.

This performance, from Russia, is one of the finest Mozart piano concerto recordings ever made, in my humble opinion. The music seems to simply fly. I always thought the Serkin/Szell recording of this work was the best but this one is even more exciting. Unfortunately, the 24th, with a different pianist, never really gets going.

On the other hand, there are endless (and unexplained) scenes of laser fighting, explosions, etc...

We've watched this together many times (many, many times...parents, you know what I mean) and I still haven't gotten tired of it. The script is funny and well written with lots of great one-liners, especially from Zurg. There are plenty of laser blasts and action, but it is pretty tame any my two year old didn't find any part of it scary.

It is a cartoon and not computer animation like the Toy Story movies, in case you're wondering. It's interesting - how they kill off Buzz's sidekick and gives him a new one. But it really is a bit much for the younger toddler set. I guess I wouldn't recommend this much before age 6. It really involves a plot that is quite long and gets a little boring. I'm not sure that I'd watch it again and my little guy actually wanted to watch something else. He LOVES Buzz but this movie just wasn't up to par. The story basically served as an introduction to a series, but still, it could have been better and more appealing to the younger crowd as well. Again, I wouldn't get this for a toddler.

I would recommend it if your kids are as in love with Buzz as mine are!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful--makes Saturday cartoons look like masterpieces!","review":"If you liked Toy Story or Toy Story 2, don't buy this tape, it stinks! I'm really upset to be out the price of the video, as I would mostly like to trash the thing and feel awkward about passing it on as anything more than bio-degradeable garbage. No story line, no characters, makes the use of multi-dimensional Disney characters for selling toys, books and clothing look praiseworthy by comparison! I couldn't wait to get it out of the video player and hide it so that it can never be found again. If this is the best Disney can do with direct to video animation, I'm giving up on Disney too. ENOUGH already with the cheap crap--I'm going to have to start reading cartoon reviews to protect my family from wasting our all too precious and minimal time together--there's no reason to pay good money to rent or buy stuff like this. Even the commercials on TV that interrupt the Saturday cartoons are more interesting than this junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"First, be alerted this is nowhere near the quality of animation or storytelling you would expect after seeing Toy Story 1 and 2. The animation & story are very poor. We (my husband, me & 5 year old) were so disappointed with this video we didn't even finish watching it. I expect more from Disney, even if this was a direct-to-video; I think most people do. Don't waste your time with this one--it seems to be little more than a \\"commercial\\" for the future Buzz Lightyear cartoon series which I read will be on TV this fall season. I give it one star only because I couldn't get the rating field (above) to accept zero!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TooViolent","review":"I was very surprised when I first put this video on, after enjoying the Toy Story movies to find that it is nothing but shooting lasers and blowing people up. For parents who don't want their children exposed to violence on televison, this movie is definately one to skip. My three year old watched it one time - After I saw the content, we gave it away. I was very disappointed with Disney for not offering entertainment for children with better values than it's heroic to shoot, kill and blow people up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must miss. Quick bucks for Disney with little effort.","review":"This DVD is a excellent example of a big company's desire to make some quick and easy money. This DVD contains flat animation and a flat story. Could have easily been shown as a Saturday morning cartoon but should have been left on the cutting room floor. If you are a Toy Story Fan you will be disappointed. With the exception of the first few minutes this is not computer animated. My kids did enjoy it but have not returned to view it since we saw it the first day we opened it. With Toy Story, Toy Story II and other great animated titles, why would they?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment.","review":"I didn't hesitate to purchase this DVD for my 3-year-old daughter. I enjoyed the color and quality of the film for the first two minutes then was really turned off by the lack of depth this film has in detail, background, music, pacing, character...anything one normally associates with a Disney film. This movie reminded me of crappy Saturday morning blow-em-up cartoons, although the Saturday morning toons are better than Buzz Lightyear."},{"rating":"1","title":"ROTTEN...JUST ROTTEN","review":"This movie is so bad I don't even know where to begin.

I cant believe that after the excellent quality of Toy Stories and other Pixar movies, they come out with this 4-color cheap feature of Buzz Lightyear. I really dont understand what happened.

I cant believe it, I cant believe also all the high ratings above!!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young kids","review":"Not for kids 6 & under. Very male oriented, faced paced, intense movie with a good share of violence, scary creatures, death and destruction of good guys. More action than story. Last minute happy ending does not solve the problem. Boys 8-12 will like it best.Disney cannot work at Pixar\`s level.

Well, I loved the way they felt when I put them on and also how my clothes looked....but I had only been at work 2 hours when I was showing them to a friend and noticed a RUN right down the front!!!!!! I was so disappointed to find that they aren't made any better than regular panty hose even though they cost more....they would really be a great product if they were made of stronger fiber to resist runs!

I will admit to being a heretic and say that this is my all time favorite film.No I have'nt read the book, but I'm not reviewing the book, I'm reviewing the film. I have viewed this film at least a dozen times and I still don't tire of seeing it again.At the most supperficial level it is extremely entertaining and displays mastered story telling techniques that are widely used today, such as non sequential chronology. If you want to scratch beneath the veneer, then there are many issues covered and many stories told.I suppose there are faults with this film as there are with all films, but I view them through rose coloured glasses. My compliments must go to the director firstly and the cast secondly (a fine ensemble).For those like-minded viewers out there please enjoy. For those who don't enjoy this film, I feel saddened that you don't get the same joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie--Honestly!","review":"Contrary to popular understanding, this movie is not about a man unstuck in time. It's a movie about a man at home alone recovering from an airplane wreck in which he has suffered a head wound. A man who is trying to make sense of his life experience while convincing himself that he has become unstuck in time. Except for two short episodes where the man's daughter and son-in-law confront him, the camera is first person, his person, seeing what he sees in his now somewhat deranged mind. Everything that takes place before the confrontation with his daughter is memory; everything after is fantasy. The memories construct a miserable, depressing existence; the fantasies a comedic, hopeful counterbalance. In this film, the camera literally is the mind's eye. Have a nice dialectic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"scifi I loved this movie the wife thought it was weird but entertaining. this is absolutly a classic great great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure magic","review":"I had first seen this film back in the early 70's and I ordered it immediately when I saw it was available on DVD.The magic and the thrill is still here after three decades.

SH5 is one of those rare films. Billy Pilgrim's picaresque (look it up) and occasionally bizarre & horrifying encounter with the past and future overwhelm the nobility and heroism of his understated character.

Once again K. Vonneguts character description of the lead (Billy Pigrim) can be related to by less than 40% of us. But those that do will have a life long friend and confidante within Billy.

No good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Made But....","review":"One person gave this film 5 stars because he said it was so faithful to the book. Another gave it 1 star because he said the film left the book \\"short changed.\\" I gave it 2 stars because though the movie was well-made & well-acted it is socially insignificant & philosophically bereft of meaning. Kurt Vonnegut apparently feels that life is nothing more than a series of random moments strung together. He could not be more wrong, as I'm sure he's aware of now in his afterlife.The Bible has the correct answers about life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible adaptation","review":"Vonnegut is quite hard to translate to film, but it doesn't seem like the producers of this movie even tried. The production resembles something a talented middle school theater group could pull off. Some of the most important scenes in the book are either breezed over or completely left out of the film, basically removing the very aspects that have made this book endure. I was hoping to see a film that lived up to the book for once, and was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dullsville","review":"This is one of those movies, like \\"Citizen Kane,\\" that people think is a classic and I don't understand why. I turned it off after a half an hour--utterly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like Torture House","review":"This movie is extremely weird, many things don't make sense. Why did this movie have scenes where Pilgrim would be doing something during World War II then would be doing something similar in some distant year. Those sequences would jump for example. It would go W.W. II, Now, W.W. II, Now, etc. Events in this movie don't follow chronological order, instead they jump around. Since I don't know how to put the half on stars yet I will type this. I give this movie * 1/2 stars. Some of the normal World War II things save this movie from being BOMB.

Eugenie Fraser returned to school in her 80's to take a course in creative writing -- and what a good thing she did! The story of her childhood - spent between Archangel, Russia and a small Scottish town - is absolutely amazing. Her reminiscences of pre-revolutionary Russia and Edwardian Scotland are extraordinarily clear. Fabulous accounts of the cold winters, warm summers playing by the River Dvina, Orthodox Christmas, traveling on ice breakers and trains, stealing out of Russia for the last time following the Revolution... Makes a lovely gift around the holidays -- with its emphasis on family and holiday celebrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Cookies","review":"These cookies are very good.

Amazon announced that on one day just before Christmas they had averaged approximaely 30 orders per second. A minute of down time on their system would then have resulted in the loss (hopefully just a delay) of about 200 orders.This book is concerned not with the basic processing elements of a system, but with the edge and core routers that connect between the external communications system and the processing elements. It describes the theory, the accepted standards, and the practical aspects of designing a system that will continue to function despite failure of hardware or software components in the system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Early Beethoven Performances","review":"Perahia performs these three works beautifully.

Although short and mildly interesting and nearly gripping at the end, it is mostly boring for a person who already has good Revolutionary War knowledge. It also lacks many redeeming qualities. For example... the pictures are of low quality and are not historically accurate. In fact, the picture on page 42 just screams out, \\"Deborah was with the British and was shot by the Continentals.\\"-- not the opposite. The problem is that the illustrator mixed up the hats of both sides. But most importantly ... WHY IS RED THE ONLY COLOR?!

Puzzled by others' comments.","review":"I am frankly a little puzzed by others' comments about the image quality of this camera. I have shot digital exclusively since 1999 and this is by far the best point-and-shoot I have owned. I usually shoot with a Canon 5D or 1DS Mark II and this little NV10 holds up really well against these and certainly beats all the compact cameras I have owned (Canon, Casio, Sony, Contax). I have printed 16\\"x20\\" prints from the NV10 after almost no editing in Photoshop CS2. There is a little noise (I shoot the NV10 at ISO 100) and a minor application of Noise Ninja's filter removes any noticeable noise. It is possible that there are manufacturing irregularities that cause one camera to be different from another. If this is the case and yours seems very noisy, send it back and exchange it for another.

Kudos to Samsung and their user interface. Much easier for new camera users to access the many options this camera has.Battery life is surprisingly good for such a small battery and the USB charging option is very nice.Cons: the flash is very strong, which is great in a dark room but has a tendency to overexpose shots taken up close (inside 5 feet). There is no EV compensation for the flash, just for overall exposure.Videos taken with the camera are of good quality with poor audio (what can you expect?) and require conversion if you are going to edit them (most people don't). Caveat: when taking videos while skiing this winter, there was purple streaking in many sun shots.

The story of drug corruption south of the border during the seventies and eighties is an epic of near mind- numbing detail, with dozens of story lines and characters intersecting at multiple junctures. This is, admittedly, no easy read, nor, for that matter, is the violence and corruption the book describes easy to stomach. But if we are to understand anything about the drug wars, aside from our government's own culpability, we must recognize how the US's unending appetite for narcotics is an integral part - if not extension - of our Cold War legacy. Forget the sanctimonious anti-drug bumper sticker slogans.

I think few people realize how incredibly corrupt the CIA has been throughout its history.The authors ordered chapters logically, with several sub-sections to break up the reading. The research is impeccable -- there are extensive notes referencing authoritative sources.The only significant flaw is the writing style which is hard to follow at times.

Nowadays, other bands are covering songs of the Devil Makes Three. Their music is so good and their live performances are so fun that they've gone from playing small clubs to playing large clubs (800 people or so).

In short, they sold out to their advertisers at the cost of their audience. $4-5 Trillion dollars went to money heaven and no one who watched CNBC got any help from the guests THEY CHOSE, or their \\"questioners\\" in understanding the debacle as it unfolded. This book is just more of the same. NOT ONE source she lists in this book were among the many who warned -- well ahead of time -- to take the once in a lifetime profits and run.

As far as I'm concerned this book is a clear example of shameless self promotion. If Maria could dissect the news on her own do you really think she'd write a book about it? Think about it, she reads from a teleprompter or pre-written notes when she reports. Much like any of the other reporters at CNBC, all she does is read from something that someone else has written. So who is the ghost writer for this book? Dissecting the news will absolutely not make you money in any market, anyone who falls for that deserves to take massive losses in the market.

Forget about those complaints in your decision making about whether to read this book or not.Some reviewers complain that Maria is not qualified to give an investment advice because she has no experience as a trader.

But what went wrong in the studio ? One of the most godawful examples of record production in history. I don't believe that any major label album (Casablanca I guess was sort of an indie at the time)was ever recorded this poorly. Bad EQ, weird can of bees/electric razor guitars, and trash can drums.

At the time, Kiss were looking for their sound and they stumbled into grunge 20 years before anyone else. This record is raw, stark, distorted, strange and heavy. It features some of Ace Frehley's finest song writing contributions and some solid songs from Gene and Paul. The band was still lean and hungry at this point and the music comes across as loud, evil and nasty.Best tracks: \\"Parasite\\", \\"Watchin You\\", Strange Ways\\" and \\"Got to Choose\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor Production???","review":"This album is one of Kiss' best. The songs are well written (for the most part - barring the usual KISS cheese factor) Ace's solos are some of his best, the emotive quality of Gene's backing vocals (check out \\"got to choose\\") will bring you to your knees. There seems to be a general consensus about the production and that it is somehow of inferior quality. I can't help but wonder with what template these people are measuring? I can, to some degree, understand why people might say this but ultimately this viewpoint is the sentiment of the amateur audiophile.There is a lot of production gold to be extracted if you know how to listen. The quality is very unique (vs. poor). It was probably done on the cheap, sure BUT if that is the case, what was created - by most probably overlapping demo tracks with \\"cleaner\\" tracks - manifested one of the MOST unique sounding rock albums in existence... nothing I have ever heard sounds anything like it. And whatever \\"it\\" is, I want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOTTER THAN HELL","review":"kiss' sophmore effort takes up where the debut left off.in 1974 there was nothing else like it. don't really understand the reviews about the sound and productionthough. the 96 remasters sort of took care of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better atempt","review":"The second album still sounds like the first one, but you can tell that Kiss' songwriting skills were sharpening.

El disco no es que sea una maravilla, pero con bastante buen material: \\"Got to choose\\" incluida en el MTV (importando) y en Alive, \\"Watching You\\" de Gene Simmons, de lo mas pesado del disco (incluida tanto en el Alive I como en el III), \\"Let Me go Rock and Roll\\" mi favorita, un Rock and Roll muy pesado, corta en duración pero te encantará. No te des mala vida con la critica especializada, compra este disco.-"},{"rating":"2","title":"The secrets of Blackmoor unveiled at last!","review":"This is probably the strangest, most completely unknown Greyhawk adventure ever made. Dave Arneson's legendary Blackmoor (the first D&D campaign, predating Greyhawk itself) is infamous as the dreaded lost land beyond the icy realm of Iuz. Here, its secrets are revealed as the heroes (levels 10-14) travel through time back to its vaunted golden age, when technology and magic brought unbelievable wonders to life, leading to the Cataclysm that ended it all thousands of years ago... oddly, TSR decided to uproot Blackmoor from the World of Greyhawk (1986 was when Gygax & Co. were in extremely ill favor), and shoved it into the world of Mystara. It works there, but this was truly intended as an adventure series for AD&D! Easily converted, and definitely worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified Cardbord Junk","review":"I purchased this item several months ago and never got around to leaving feedback.It is not nearly as sturdy as it looks. It is constructed of panels of some kind of fiber board that is about 1/8 inch thick, each framed by 2\\" by 1/2\\" slats. I had to reinforce the inside corners with scrap wood, as well as glue it back together - parts of it were falling apart when I got it.The paint job was negligible, barely a primer coat - I could see the base material through it. I had to apply three coats of paint to make it look right. Considering that the product is made in China, I'm probably better off having sealed it up in fresh paint that I KNOW doesn't contain lead or who knows what else.I will NEVER buy furniture online again. Over and over I have read reviews by others for other furniture that is similar to mine. This piece of junk may be worth $20 (shipping included) - but nowhere near the $60 that I paid for it. What a rip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much for the money.","review":"I ordered one of these knock-down hampers. It arrived as described but I found it to be smaller than I imagined it and the construction leaves something to be desired. While it is nominally made of wood, the wood is a very weak strain and doesn't seem sturdy. The panels are like beadboard but aren't very heavy duty either. The lid hinges look to last about ten uses.I put it together but am going to add some reinforcement at the corners, heavier hinges and a strap to prevent the lid from opening past 90 degrees.There isn't anything I can do about the limited capacity though except try to find an alternate use for this hamper so I can get another larger one."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I should have read the reviews before purchasing this product. It was easy to put together but I got a shock when I saw how small the box it came in was. It was much smaller than I expected. If you are using it as a laundry hamper, it will be full with a few socks! Also, most of the similar products online had a cloth liner. This one doesnt come with one. I am very disappointed but kept it as it would cost too much to ship it back. Hopefully I will find another use for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE, STILL WAITING FOR REED & BARTON TO CORRECT","review":"I purchased a 65 piece set of Reed & Barton Radiance as a gift for my sister over 2 months ago through Amazon from one of its affiliates. Decided to look at the pattern in person before shipping it, so untaped the boxes and discovered that a dozen pieces were defective - the pattern had not been stamped or molded on one or more corners. Called the dealer, who put me in touch the next day with Reed & Barton, reportedly at R&B's request. Many voice mail messages (it seems they never actually answer their phones), emails and phone conversations later, I am still waiting for them to replace the 7 replacement pieces that were still defective in the same way. Thought such an old and established company could be trusted. No more Reed & Barton for this family, ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Portrayal","review":"This movie is deep and sometimes it seems to have a bit of trouble capturing it all in such a short time. Perhaps this was intended as it seems to favor letting the viewer make their own judgements about the story.Controversial with many, each viewer will see a different side of the coin, but all viewers will see the genuine and well integrated emotional rollercoaster that each of the characters must enture.Overall, one of my favorite foriegn films for it's honesty and fearless willingess to portray reality without inserting extrenal judgements and cues for the viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way outta line","review":"I remember well being a young, hurt and wounded young man. My parents divorced, my father a raging alcoholic that could care less about me, my mother displaced by mental illness when I was 14. I longed for some form of intimacy from anywhere, and I could easily have caved to intimacy from another male. I was lucky to have had a chance to align with my normal heterosexual being later in life. I have a lot of gay acquaintances, and perhaps some are a true genetic tendency, but one has to wonder how much a young man's environment can play on his sexual and emotional tendencies. I see this soldier as nothing more than predator of this young man's pain, and a possible predator of young boys in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedophilia is not romantic","review":"This movie, although intentions may have been good, is patently false in it premise that an adult can have a sexual and romantic relationship with a child, period. Children, however mature they may seem, cannot grasp the fullness and extrapolation of both sexuality and romantic or passionate love. It is wrong to take this film as anything other than a cultural farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"We need responsibilities!","review":"For a movie, the message it carries should overweigh all other elements. I hate to say that the movie is confusing. I never doubt the soldier was in deed love with the boy. However it was never to the best interests of the boy. As we are adults, we have to be true to our feelings, but I find more reasons to be stronger to protect the ones that we love. It happened that the object of affection in the case was a boy, inevitably the adults should take the sole responsiblities.Believe me, if you abandon yourself to such a love, you confuse the child. You leave the child little if not no choice at all for his future preference. It is irresponsible for an adult no matter a man or a woman to violate a child when he is starting to see the world. We must honor their basic rights of making their own judgments when they are up to it.Love is not only lust, and love is not selfish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the completely prudish or timid","review":"While the movie was done with a lot of sensitivity, there is one particular scene that intimates quite a bit. However, I applaud the writer and director for leaving it in. The movie slowly touches on a very tough and sensitive topic, but succeeds at doing it in such a way so that you are left to make your own decisions. That takes skill. Acting was fairly good by the youth. Adults were less impressive, but not enough that it diminished the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"good film","review":"It arrived on time and it was in great quility and packaged well.I dont know what else to say so best wishes for the New Year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book doesn't quite sink.","review":"Dedicated Titanic collectors will want to add this book to their collections.

And that place is a Study in Scarlet, Arthur Conan Doyle's introduction of Holmes and Watson, who are already remarkably quite complete in terms of all their personality tics and quirks. The book's beginning is quite fascinating as the mystery is bloody and mysterious, chock full of clues and red herrings, lacking only anything resembling a suspect. The actual solution is, sadly, quite long-winded and hopelessly silly and the way in which Holmes solves the case is also fairly preposterous with much actually left unanswered. Still, much can be forgiven as this is the story that gave birth to the legend of Sherlock Holmes and there were many stories in the future that would live up to that great myth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy - its free","review":"You can down load this book for free (eveni onto your Kindle or Kindle app) just go to Project Gutenberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Study in Scarlett","review":"Fianlly!

I won't give plot spoilers, but Holmes investigates a murder, study's the crime scene, and effortlessly shows he's more creative thinking and superior methods to the other investigators of the case, and so begins his search for the truth. Early on, the mystery is so well set up on so many levels, but unfortunately, somewhere in the middle of the book, Doyle lost me, I began counting the pages, it got boring and I wanted it to end, it just lost its momentum. I think because the book is sort of 2 stories in 1, Holmes has a long flashback and it kind of felt disjointed to me. I would suggest you read a different Sherlock Holmes book, there are better ones. \\"The Hound of Baskervilles\\" is much better than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"12 inches?","review":"Do you know what is 12 inches regarding this ball?That's how high it bounces when you slam it to the ground pissed off that it is actually 8 inches!Lying scummy dishonest seller.(plus it's about as cheap a ball as you can find.....)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small beach ball","review":"This ball if very small.

Secondly, the beach ball was supposed to be 12\\". Well, it was more like 8\\". Thirdly, there was no check valve on the air valve.

Check out other financial software. Maybe after we all convert to Microsoft Money Intuit will see the error of their decisions. Why would a company remove working functionality from their product is beyond my comprehension. Quicken user since 2001. I doubt if I upgrade on the Quicken path again unless they fix this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this product if you import financial histories","review":"Intuit disabled the QIF import feature that has long been a part of quicken and MANY MANY financial institutions will no longer support downloading data into quicken 2005 or 2006 because they are being forced to license the new download format from quicken. If you have versions prior to 2005 keep that and switch to something else before upgrading and finding out later you cannot download histories or worse export to Money or other software after the upgrade. I upgraded and now am trying to manually recreate the accounts into MS Money as I will not bow to this kind of greed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quicken no longer supports my bank's data format?!","review":"It seems Intuit recently decided to stop supporting the QIF data format in order to promote uptake of the newer OFX format. Unfortunately, a significant number of financial institutions still use the QIF format (and only this format), including my company's corporate credit card.Most frustratingly, Quickens website claims that my financial institution (Citi Cards) supports OFX ... if only someone had told the Diners Club MasterCard division.Since I can't exactly change my corporate credit card, and I am not willing to manually enter each transaction, this software isn't all that useful to me.Looks like I'm going to have to use Microsoft Money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfaction","review":"Frankly, I couldn't be more disapointed in Quicken Deluxe 2006.

They crippled my copy of Quicken 2002 in April 05, and I refuse to upgrade. This is extortion, pure and simple. Also, every time you click on \\"update,\\" Quicken contacts Intuit's server, even if you don't use any of their online services. That's how they are able to cripple the software. I wonder what sort of information they are gathering on me. After all, I have all of my financial data in Quicken, and I don't trust Intuit. What's between me and my financial institutions is no business of theirs. I had been a satisfied user of both quicken and Turbotax for many years. No more.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be sorry","review":"I have been using Q for close to 20 years. Once you have that much data in it, it's hard (or at least scary) to switch to a new program. Everytime I send Q upgrade money I keep hoping they will fix the bugs. The worst ones being data corruption. Q stores all your data in a database. Unfortunately there db design is also about 20 years old and gets corrupted. When it gets corrupted it's bad, you can loose data, funny things will happen (transactions lost, bad totals, duplicate entries). It happens to me about every 4-6 months. Being aware of this I backup Q every couple of days.Tech support very bad. Intuit uses it as a revenue stream. You get free online and email. But the answer usually is \\"this is to complicated for email please call 1-800-India\\"; Have your credit card ready $25/each.I don't like the MS Money interface; I hate the Quicken bugs but I am still using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had not upgraded","review":"I got this upgrade to better track my 401k and I wish I hadn't.

I have a business degree so I understand the basics of accounting, but you'd have to be a CPA to understand this. Either that or it's just bad programming.

(However, every two or three years they will require you to buy their latest version -- whether or not it works -- because the one you bought will no longer function properly.) I wish I did not spend so much time learning and using this product. When I needed it most, at end-of-year tax-time, Quicken killed me.

I've had to restart the software numerous times for no apparent reason.2) The ads. I really, really resent paying them money to be bombarded with ads for their products.

Until recently I was using Quicken 2002 and decided to upgrade. I bought a 2006 Quicken software package and discovered that starting with this edition, Quicken FORCED you to use the internet and go thru their internet access to retrieve your own data from your bank. For security reasons I did not want to use my new computer on the internet but Quicken offered no other options. One is forced to supply Quicken with personal financial information instead of using a simple file download from one's bank. I felt this was outrageous and found other means, outside of Quicken to do my banking business. I will not buy Quicken products again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time user with long time problems.","review":"Don't let the review title fool you. I like the product and have used versions of it since the late 1980's. It is the leading product and I would not recommend any other. My pet peeve is that the Retirement Planner refuses to believe the retirement date I give as input. Therefore, it does not compute 'growth' and starts tapping my retirement savings 'Today'. Support says it is a data driven error and they recommend useless things like rebuilding indices. My data file passes all tests but the retirement planner produces garbage for the past three releases I have used. (It worked a few years ago). The second useless suggestion was to start with a 'fresh' data file. I refuse to lose over 15 years of data to fix bad Quicken code. After reading other internet sources, I am not alone in having problems with the retirement planner. A sad failing in an otherwise excellent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No QIF Import?

Without permission, it accesses the internet and downloads new ads. It hangs my computer. I can only use it for about half an hour before I have to reset. If that's not enough, after three years, it will automatically download an \\"update\\" that will disable major portions of the software. The \\"fix,\\" according to Intuit, is to buy a new version.

The writing, while not great, is steady and constant. The art by Chris Gosset also helped make the comic, and his prescence in the last issue is sorely missed. The story is pretty good, especially for one that mishmeshes as much as this does. They do form an interesting parallel nonetheless, one enhanced by Goesset's artwork.As I said, this is probably the strongest of the TotJ series. Its storyline is the best defined by far, and Gosset's art is very effective. The follow-up is a bit dissapointing, as is the rest of the series in my opinion. Still ,its a nice history lesson and a view into the ancient Jedi. Reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Star Wars Comic","review":"Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith is the best Star Wars comic. It details how Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma join the Dark Side. My favorite parts are when Exar battled Master Vodo, Sylvar, Crado and Ulic. The writing and art in issue 6 are terrible. Cay Qel-Droma talks like a hillbilly in issue 6. He says things like, \\"Me an' Toq are usin' the Force to hold him.\\" The art detierorated as the story progessed. The first issues had great art. Those are the only flaws.

I found success with a much more superior product that focuses more on the support and smoothing elements I was looking for, plus it's worn over pants or my maternity jeans kinda like a belly band, so it's much easier to wear everyday with my clothes.

I agree with everything that reviewer said, except that this is the wrong album. This appears to be some greatest hits collection of 80s Kool stuff, not the great Ghetto Jazz of the early 70s. So buy the original Kool & the Gang, not this greatist hits knock-off"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, original romance!","review":"I loved the clever humor and the strong characterizations.

Dorothy Stratten, as the lovesick android, shows she had a bright future in Hollywood, had it not been for her tragic murder by her ex-husband. Groan everytime the words \\"Blue Star\\" are uttered with the resulting heavenly chorus, laugh at the Rock Eater and the Batboy, and enjoy. This one is supposed to be silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Barbarella or flesh gordon instead!","review":"I love bad trashy films and i have an affinity for space themed comedic sex romps. This is neither. Stratten keeps her clothes on- its not funny or sexy in any way and despite the occassional cool lighting and cheesy special effects that are so bad theyre good, Galaxina is a spiralling space dud not unlike a dead sattelite floating in space. Check out Flesh Gordon or Barbarella or even cherry 2000 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dorothy Stratten deserves better.","review":"I really LIKE this film. But Rhino has done it a real disservice with this pitiful release on DVD. It is NOT, as was advertised here, in widescreen format. The print used is terrible, and you can even see the telecine operator adjusting (squeezing) the image to get the crawling text (Star Wars style) on screen during the opening sequence WHILE THE FILM IS RUNNING! The \\"hilarious Easter Egg\\" computer animation is just plain stupid, and the Andy Kaufman soundtrack over the \\"previews\\" is simply annoying after the first time. I only purchased this DVD to finally get the Widescreen version of this movie, and I am terribly disappointed in the product. Now that the movie is out on DVD, I suspect there's little hope of a remastered widescreen version anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I finally bought this film after years of curiosity about it. I'm a long time sci-fi fan and read some interesting things about this movie back in the day. I was hoping for a cool sexy late 70's early 80's sci-fi movie. I dug up an old article that interviewed the director. He talked about using some special kind of film stock to film certain scenes giving it a unique and futuristic look. He also talked about the sexuality and nudity that would be present by having the undeniably beautiful Dorothy Stratten. Well, I took the plunge and bought it-take my advice-don't waste your time. Their is no nudity, the plot is unitelligible, and the so-called special filming is nothing more that a distorted hue. If you're a fan of Dorothy Stratten, she was on an episode of Buck Rogers that's way more sexy and interesting. Don't even rent this, there is just no point. I'm selling my copy back to the video store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever!","review":"She's pretty and all, but absolutely no skin showing!!! Best to \\"borrow\\" this movie if you absolutely must see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Dorothy Stratten plays a robot who overcomes her own programming to return the love of a human crewman on her starship. Her character is lifeless, boring, stiff, and has bad posture. I kept waiting for her to do something exciting and sexy. Bad puns substituted for interesting writing. I felt no attraction to the robot at all. I was more inclined to boink a microwave oven than fall in love with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Bad Scifi","review":"I remember watching this movie when I was a teen and ROLLING with laughter after about the third mention of \\"The Blue Star\\" It spoofed scifi movies before spoofing became popular.

If you enjoy scifi spoof movies like Space Balls and Ice Pirates you might want to give this a watching. But also realize there is good reason it is amongst the cheapies.The eye candy interest is Dorothy Stratten as Galaxina, a robot that is designed to look like a woman and \\"has feelings\\". A sexy woman at that. Just the sort of appliance you want serving on a Police Starship manned by low class bachelors. But don't get pulled in by the \\"R\\" rating and \\"Playboy Playmate\\" tags. Other than her poorly fitting white spandex outfit, her parts are mildly sensual at best. Things do head towards sleazy in the space bordello scenes which she isn't in, but again, not very much.Low quality? Cheesy? Cheap gags? A script that is mostly short setups and one liners? Definitely! What could be better for light mindless entertainment. The kind of movie many of us would make if we had a sexy centerfold who insisted on staying dressed and no budget..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most interesting story","review":"Documentary about a wagon train in the Mountain Meadow area of Utah. The party were killed by the settlers of a nearby town. All were shot except for a few children.There have been several monuments to the fallen in this area and this film includes the controversy over the monuments and the events after the killings.To me this was always a footnote in history. I have found limited information about the topic. Now I can see more of the story. This story is told in an even manner. There are still many living relatives of the slain party. There story is included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped Off One More Time","review":"You will notice that Amazon does not tell you the length of this DVD. That's because it's so short probably no one would buy it. Also, they do not tell you this is a home-made DVD that is made for Region 2 so unless you have a all-regions DVD player you will have to buy one to play this program. It's sad to say that it appears Amazon is getting more and more deceptive in their descriptions or else they need help getting employees who will describe DVD's accurately. I can't believe so many DVD's they sell are actually different from what is advertised. How can one company have so many errors for so long a period unless it is part of a larger plan. To get a refund is more costly and trouble than it's worth and I've never received a refund for the many DVD's I've returned unopened that I know of. If you can, buy elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star for the Video - 5 for the Film","review":"Once again, thanks to New Yorker Video, we are offered a priceless foreign film.

I thought this was the coolest watch I've ever had. I wound it gently to get it started . . .it ran for a couple hours then STOPPED, I wound it again, and 10 minutes later, stopped again. Then I thought, I'll wind it and wear it allowing the self winding mechanism to do its job. So disappointed, it stopped two more times, so I sadly placed everything back in the orignal packing, and am going to drop it off at UPS Monday to ship back to Amazon. Too bad, as the look is impressive, but I really need it to run too!!!!! Now, I'm afraid to order another Stuhrling watch for fear of the same experience. I will say Amazon is always great about returns, but I want a Skeleton watch that runs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING STYLE","review":"This watch has an outstanding style it would have been better if it came with a metal band rather than leather.

The automatic wind feature never worked. I had to wind the watch daily. It ran several minutes fast per day from the day I got it. A week ago, it just stopped. Nothing appears broken or loose, but the watch will not run anymore. It has drawn many compliments, but having to rely on my cell phone for true time has been more of an inconvenience than I thought it would be. I did not buy the watch on Amazon, but from another dealer. Sturhling Original customer service has been less than responsive. Rather than spend another $150 or so (including shipping) for a replacement that has not changed and may have the same fate, I've purchased a new two-tone (gold/stainless) automatic skeleton watch by Armitron from the Kohl's online store. No transparent back crystal and not as much edge detail, but luminous hands and a better reputation than Sturhling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three stars for the restoration, zero for the butchering","review":"Be warned, this edition is cut!, almost at the end of the movie, almost five minutes of the film are out of it...The image is better than the other edition that you can buy, but don't expect a Citizen Kane restoration...The only pro about this edition is the restoration of the original opening credits (the other edition has a collage of pictures instead of it)I hope Vanguard Cinema exchange this DVD for one uncut."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie, problems with edition, though","review":"I love this film, it is one of my favorites!

I knew how good the remasters sounded, but I guess i figured they couldn't improve the first two albums that much. Man was I wrong. I listened to it with headphones and was amazed to pick up on things i hadn't heard over countless listinings. The main thing I picked up was Gene's bass. I almost felt like I was hearing songs like Let me Know for the first time. I definitly recommend the remasters. It's worth the upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I feel that the first KISS album is a classic. Several songs remain in their live show set list. A handful of classic tracks make this a great metal album. I got it at Wal Mart for [...]. Rivaled by Destroyer and Love Gun as the best KISS album. Key tracks are: Strutter, Deuce, 100000 Years and Black Diamond."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fade Out On \\"Black Diamond\\" Still Bugs Me....","review":"This would be a 5 star album if it was not for the ridiculous fade out on the last song \\"Black Diamond\\"....It serves no artistic purpose and ends the album in a terrible whimper instead of a bang. If they needed to make the album longer why didn't they just add another song! Now that I have that off my chest, every single Kiss penned tune here is a rock and roll classic. \\"Strutter\\" & \\"Deuce\\"...need I say more? And even though the production is sparse and \\"cheap\\" sounding; the songs are so good and Ace's playing is so killer...it doesn't matter.This is the album that started it all and is a required purchase for any rock fan, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss album","review":"The image shown here does not show the red sticker in the top left corner of the album. Very deceiving and I was quite disappointed. Can't take the sticker off and as I am using this album as framed art, it doesn't look as I expected. In fact, I don't care about the condition of the album, it was the cover I was needing and this image is not what I received.

It reminds me slightly of gary glitter in feel and style. And that's a fun style of hard rock music , they took their songs slowed them down in playing style and made the songs crisp and bouncy which is great glam rock. By their second disc they were less aiming that way and songs like 'kissin time' would gone for good. But even true rock classics like 'black diamond' and 'nothing to lose' sound glammier here and that's fine. This is a band that was out to conquer musically and this record was a fine start to that. By their third disc they really hit on their sound but this one is a good place to start listening to early kiss songs. And you can just sit back and enjoy the unpretentious fun that kiss was aiming to create with this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pure classic","review":"This album is my 2nd favorite Kiss album (Love Gun is my favorite). it has all the classic Kiss songs - Strutter, Firehouse, Cold Gin, Deuce, 100,000 years, Black Diamond.the only bad moment in this album is Kissin' Time, which is really embarrasing to listen to, other than that, this album rocks. you cant go wrong buying this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it...!!","review":"i am fan of kiss the first record cause impact in 70s grand band the best of best rock and roll forever...!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best !","review":"i had this album back in the day... i think i was in 5th grade. it was good then and its still good now. sounds is much better than the old LPs. i originally traded a bunch of baseball cards to get this album. i still have it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut!","review":"This is Kiss' Debut album-and It rocks!

Despite the incomplete story and those not exciting action scenes, the two main characters (Washington and Oldman) are outstanding.

And where do they get the gas to power their cars and even motorcycles? The \\"twist\\" didn't gel with the rest of the movie. I only gave 2 stars instead of one because the fight and action sequences were well shot and edited along with the cinematography.SPOILER ALERTAt least the intentions of Gary Oldman's character of wanting to use the bible to control the masses was a breath of fresh air because it rings true to how most fanatical Christians were... still are.

I'm not sure why many critics did not like this movie...perhaps they objected to the Biblical parts of the plot. I've been a fan of Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman for quite some time. Their performances were outstanding. DW's character was brilliant and complex...played with the correct amount of restraint and brutality needed in the dangerous post-apocalyptic world. I regret not seeing this movie in a theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant movie","review":"Great action and thriller. Leaves you on the edge of your seat to what is going to happen next. Excellant Denzel Washington movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOCK SCHLOCK","review":"This movie was even WORSE than I was afraid it would be. Inane, hackneyed, predictable & a waste of time. Sorry to see Gary Oldman waste his time & talent on this post adolescent, gum chewing mind numbing snoozer.The Hughes brothers could take lessons from the Cohen & Wachowski bros."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like New","review":"The CD was unscratched and worked perfectly. Just as important, the case was in tact and held the disk properly. Fair price, quick delivery, and good condition. Very satisfied, and would definately buy another movie from this seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not Great","review":"The Book of Eli is a good movie, but not a great one. Overall, I would probably give it closer to a 3.5/5, but I chose to round upwards. It has an interesting plotline, but they do not delve into the backstory (what caused the 'war'?). It moves slow - too slow in parts for an action flick, but makes a decent drama feel, except it has too much action for a drama. It was worth the two hours of my time, but I am glad I redboxed it and didn't buy it or rent it on amazon. Worth a watch, but not a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Flick","review":"First of all, I am glad that the trailer doesn't give out too much. I know people are coming after that book. But the movie is a whole lot more than that. I first thought that this is another I Am Legend. No, it is not even close. And when I am watching the movie, I thought that this is something like Mad Max. No, it is not either. This is a very good action adventure fairy tale flick. The surprise is at the end of the movie. It explains why the Sun is so gray and the world is so sandy. Jackie (*or* Solara if you must) is so cute in this movie. Denzel Washington is the same Denzel Washington from all his other movies. Gary Oldman is the same crazy Zorg from The Fifth Element; absolutely no Commissioner Gordon here.I first thought this movie is a cheesy flick but it is not.5 stars must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this movie. I've watched it a couple of times. I would say to those who find the religious connection too much that it pays homage to the power of the written word and of the printing press as much. Watch it. I promise you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD","review":"Purchase the DVD because it had a Chinese Crested dog in it. Once I got the movie and watched it I was pleasantly surprized. Very good film. Video of the Chinese Crested lasted about 2 seconds."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Classic?","review":"This movie (The Book of Eli) has the earmarks of a new classic. I have always enjoyed Denzel Washington and once again, he doesn't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Pitiful and bogus is this post-apocalypse flop that lies sick and diseased in a ditch with it's gross twin, The Road. These movies are so extremely LAME that they have me wondering, is this going to be the trend? Given the sad state of mentality that allows for a terrorist to sit in the oval office, maybe we should expect drivel and tripe to rule the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy The Original instead of Blu-Ray","review":"This is one incredible movie and definitely a 4 star movie, but this rating is on the Blu-ray version. The Blu-Ray is crap. This disk has a special feature known as \\"Maximum Movie Mode Survival Guide.\\" It is an excellent add to the movie if you have seen the movie and are interested in watching the making of the movie, live interviews, directors notes, and hand drawn images of costumes and set, while you are watching the main film. However, this add on is permanent to the Blu-ray and cannot be removed from the movie. If you want to watch the movie by itself, you are forced to watch the digital copy also included. Just a suggestion, but if you are a person like me who does not watch the extras but instead buys a DVD or Blu-ray specifically for the movie, by the original dvd and save yourself $10.00. You can purchase the Blu-ray in about a month or so when it will probably drop in price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Disable Informational picture in picture through the entire movie!","review":"What is going on? I have tried everything I know to disable the picture in picture that appearsthrough the entire movie.

This impossible to solve incident does not take place on any other blue ray disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad Max + Bible + Questionable logic","review":"- It's like Mad Max plus Bible- The action scenes are laughable.- The logic is questionable. For example, Eli, the main character is blind but he fought off all the bad guys with his gun and fists! He was shot point-blank but still survived!- After watching it, I found my curiosity was satifisfied but I did not feel entertanined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"Few guys decided to make a movie on the cheap but charge a regular price for it.

You are paying for it!Skip...next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this even get made?","review":"I am stunned that this movie ever got made. The storyline was ridiculous, there was no character development and the conclusion (\\"God did it\\") was such a letdown I'm making a point to avoid this director's movies in the future. A God-sent ninja saves the world by remembering the Bible, word for word? Ugh, I feel ill."},{"rating":"1","title":"only because I couldn't rate it zero stars","review":"This was one of the worst movies of all time. What the hell was Denzel thinking? For that matter, what was anyone that had anything at all to do with making this p.o.s. thinking?. What a total waste of time, money and acting talent. I could find no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Oh, and did I mention, I really hated everything about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME!!!","review":"This is a rather lame film. What's up with all the religious overtones in so many films today? Has Hollywood gone to the dogs (gods) ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough Action","review":"Very violent but indicative of what would happen without enforced laws (by whom) and morals or lack of. Mr. Washington defines the character of Eli; very believable especially when looking for an image in the wilderness that has purpose and ideals. One needs to pay attention to the hints and allusions that Eli might indeed be stone blind in his trek across the nation. Then again, you can't be sure. The action in the film would satisfy the most ardent \\"shoot em up\\" but I didn't find it excessive to be pointless. Very stark and believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"A storyline that's been done dozens of times before. An enigmatic stranger has extremely violent encounters with the bad guys. Only the context within which the storyline occurs changes. This time it's in a post-apocalyptic wasteland (again not original). Eli (Denzel Washington) is headed west packing a book that someone seems to want very badly. Along the way he graphically eliminates a lot of robbers and gangsters with seemingly superhuman ease. Theme at the end may have thrilled some but I found it a weak stretch.The movie was shot nearly devoid of color presumably to convey a sense of desolation. It did but I found it irritating to watch.In the end I gave \\"The Book of Eli\\" two-stars because I liked Mila Kunis and thought she was pretty good. Everything else was old and tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eli","review":"Picture quality awful. Usually Amazon videos are good but Book of Eli was definitely not. Hopefully they've fixed the problem or are at least aware of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Cinematography","review":"\\"Good Cinematography\\"And now the cons....Seriously just dreadful film. The plot made no sense; the story arc was...non-existent, the pacing was confusing, the characters were derivative & dull, and did I mention the plot was stupid? We won't even get started on the 10 pages required to recount the plot holes, inconsistencies, and illogical motivations.This is the type of movie that you would expect to see boom mics in the shot and 20 year old CGI technology effects...BUT the production value is top quality in this farce of a story.The final irony is you would expect a stronger pro or con reaction giving the religious nature of the story but even that aspect of this drama is seeping with a dull malaise.I know it is tempting if you are a apocalypse movie fan but, trust me, this is not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible did not work!!","review":"The movie was deffective and would not play at all..So sad because it was a gift for my father ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith","review":"Even though I'm an agnostic, I've grown weary of standard Hollywood junk in which religion is portrayed as near evil and religious people as fools. 'The Book of Eli' and a film I just reviewed, 'Frailty', are major exceptions to this general rule. Eli, although not the returned Messiah, is his prophet in the desert of a ravaged earth.The earth has been savaged by an apolcalyptic war and ignorance rules the land. He who has pre-apocalyptic knowledge has the potential for great and destructive power and there are those who will kill to learn its secrets. Eli, in a way similar to the demi-God, Achilles, in the Iliad, has been touched by the eternal and is--unfortunately for his enemies--virtually immune to danger and evil. He is the agent by which the world may be saved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very original","review":"Appears to be an unsanctioned remake of the superior Australian movie Freedom Deep. Why? Is Hollywood that short of ideas? The plot is a clone and many of the visuals seem to be totally lifted from Freedom Deep. Trailers for both are on youtube and can be played side by side and are virtually indistinguishable. Yet one is a piece of art with a heart, the other has Denzel. Freedom Deep's director is making a movie called The Rare Earth, I suppose these imitators will rip that off too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FILM","review":"I give props to the creators' of this film for making a very dangerous stunt with this movie. Excellent filming, acting, fighting scenes, etc. Will purchase the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Cinematography","review":"The dialog is minimal, but this is very much a visual picture. Film students can probably appreciate the technical aspects of the movie. Excellent cinematography. Any religious overtones are sveltly built into the enviornment itself and not obviously sticking out.Story is well told; definitely a lot of showing more than telling.Minimalist but very strong concentration of the wasteland. Watch how people act around each other even in the simplest of situations. You really do get the sense of how untrusting society has become. The acting from all the characters is superb.Well done movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"The Book of Eli is VERY inspirational to me! I mean, I saw the movie & it was just amazing! I loved it!There is great power in the Word of God.

I saw this movie while visiting a friend and just had to add it to my collection. And I had no problems with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Performance","review":"Very, very good performance by Denzel Washington. A must see DVD. He was awesome in this story. It is a little violent. But if you can look beyond the violence, and see the intent of the story, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it","review":"Nice story line, good action, held my attention, I could watch it again if a few months and enjoy it all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"book of eli wow","review":"This is a terrific film with a few distracting points. The mostly bland almost black & white filming leaves something to be desired. It does, however, convey the image of the earth after a major war. There is an underlying religious theme that will not be noticed by some, and loved by others. It brings to light various things in this vein. It is a film that requires your complete attention otherwise the ending as one critic states may not register. I plan on viewing it again to see If I can pick up any things I may have missed during the first viewing. There will be widely different feelings on this film. Watch it and relay your opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"I finished it, but why???","review":"1. This film isn't worth the time to write a lengthy review. Bottomline: the most incredulous of storylines but ok acting... but again, the story just doesn't make any logical sense... unless your half awake at 0300. Yea, I know Denzil Washington is in it, it has to be good; that's what I thought and that's why I viewed this film. After I watched this DVD, my thought was then \\"what in the world possessed Denzil to make this film?\\" Bottomline: skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique movie","review":"Even though there are a lot of apocalyptic movies coming out lately, this one is unique in it's story line and the way it was shot.

Plus I'm a big fan of both Denzel Washington and Mila Kunis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad Max Carries His Bible","review":"This is basically the worst kind of Hollywood schlock, with lots of gratuitous violence and cod-religious undertones.

Blindly this was ordered and from the cat being wantonly killed and barbequed and fed to a rat is when I SHOULD have stopped but this masterpiece of manure was continued only because Denzel Washington (in my mind) would in a while bring something positive.When my morning coffee started to come back up, the movie was put up for sale on Amazon. Shame on me for thinking that anything Washington was in would have to be redeemable.HEED MY WORDS: THIS IS NOT FOR ANYONE WITH A FAINT HEART OR AN AWARENESS OF THE VALUE OF LIFE.If all Hollywood can come up with is this crap then lets go back to looking at carvings on caves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring,Boring,Boring","review":"This movie starts very slow and stupid.

Freedom of speech is so important to all of us...however...this film is a joke.It seems to have been designed for those with the smallest of brains (and penises) and greater interest in war and conflict...than peace and understanding.I can see this as a sort of twilight zone episode, if it were tweaked a little, but this is too severe and caustic for my senses...far too thin to be of what the bible speaks of or what it has spawned in man and culture.

He walked west for 30 years? Well, let's see. The average human walking speed is 4.3 mph. That means that if you walk 1 hour per day times 5 days per week times 4 weeks per month times 12 months per year times 30 years you get: 4.3 x 5 x 4 x 12 x 30 = 30960 miles. Now, this is more that the circumference of the earth at the equator (which is 24901 miles). In other words, walking only one hour per day he will go around earth at least once considering him being able to walk on water. This is not the only mistake in this movie. For example, what happened to the water? Those clouds behind Denzel are not made out of water? You would think if there are clouds there is water and rain!

Most of the first half of the movie is very brutal fighting with swords/guns and it's pretty graphic. Not something to show a kid. I was also dissappointed by Denzel Washington's performance. If you liked \\"Man on Fire\\", this movie has those brutal fighting scenes but takes it to the next level. The story of Man on Fire was also better than this movie. Some of the movie showed about Faith, but I felt it was just a total action movie with graphic scenes that are way too harsh for me.

It's never surprising.

The Hughes brothers' vision is far more bleak and at the same time far more limited. After a nuclear holocaust, chaos in the form of cannibalism and banditry descend upon the earth, and that's just not an issue for Eli (Denzel Washington), a \\"walker\\" who is \\"traveling West\\" in order to deliver the world's last Bible to a sanctuary. In his way is a would-be messiah (played by a Dracula-like Gary Oldman) and very bad lighting. The plot is very messy, and the post-apocalyptical world happens to be even more absurd than the world we live in now. The ending is bathetic, and really does draw on for much too long (believe it or not, it's even more of a drawn out ending than that of \\"The Shawshank Redemption.\\" The movie also stars Denzel Washington so it's bound to be self-righteous, and this movie most certainly is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great service, horrible movie","review":"Amazon and their vendor did a great job, as always, but the movie had a really lame ending.

I thought the movie would lose its luster after one viewing. After all, the whole movie leads up to a reasonably good twist. On the second viewing, you start to look for clues to the twist; and they are there throughout. In the portfolio of sci-fi epics, The Book of Eli is right in the middle; not the best/worst.

A warmed over Christian fundamentalists wet dream. But it doesnt' stop there. The movie is boring for long stretches, pretensiously shot in a greyish \\"artsy\\" tone, full of loopholes in its logic (not unlike actual fundamentalists) and a soaring tribute to stupidity...a world with hardly a drop of drinkable water or edible food yet somehow an endless supply of guns and ammunition...I have now begun to doubt the integrity of actors that I actually liked; Washington and Oldman - did these guys read the script before signing on or were they duped?If you have half a brain or even a modicum of taste avoid this movie like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable guide for speakers, teachers, and students alike","review":"Nigel Turton has brought clarity and concision to the English language for many years and this extensive dictionary common errors are ones you will hear throughout the year. It contains words and phrases that trigger confusion or where you wonder if what was said/written is wrong, and if so, is there a better way to phrase it. Each error has the correction and a simple explanation. What makes this dictionary invaluable is that it includes examples from a wide variety of countries, since Britain and the US aren't the only English-speaking countries. Moreover, you can take this book anywhere -- plane, waiting room, bathroom -- and read as much or little as time allows. Worth every penny. My only warning is that after reading the Longman Dictionary of Common Errors, you will cringe when you watch TV news and hear the newscasters and reporters' 7th grade educations on full display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the STR-DE1075","review":"I actually purchased the STR-DE1075 first but returned it. The STR-DE985 is the new year model and they have made a couple of really significant changes. The STR-DE1075 advertises the multi-room capability... a big seller for me. But when I got it home it wasn't as easy to set up as advertised. It also didn't have any output for a 2nd set of speakers. The STR-DE985 corrected this issue. Sony has added another set of terminals coupled with the A/B speaker selection. The 2nd room feature still uses RCA plugs ... I'm still not sure how to set that up ... I was hoping I could just use existing speakers. There are more digital/optical inputs as well as more S Video inputs than the STR-DE1075. The STR-DE985 looks almost identical to the STR-DE1075 which was a great value ... but just not thought out too well. The STR-DE985 is everything the STR-DE1075 was and more ... The remote is smaller and a lot more comfortable in the hand ... Recommended for all ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Our 4 year old grandson would watch these all day.

Like on the Wild dog episode my wife was not ready to see a dog regurgitate about 3 pounds of meat on camera. Nor were we ready as parents to explain why the alpha kangaroo male on the kangaroo episode was trying to mate with as many of the female kangaroos as possible.)

No one can dismiss that Trevor Horn is the best producer around and knows his stuff. Some of the better performances are from Seal, Yes and other less known bands/artists from the other side of the pond. Most comical moment for me? The the 2nd lead from Frankie Goes to Hollywood (Paul Rutherford) exposing a gut that had maybe one too many pints from the 80's. But, the \\"new\\" lead singer of FGTH was interesting, though screechy unlike Holly Johnson's smoother delivery. Ahhh. It's all good. Just hearing all the music that Trevor's touched is distinctly there and a joy to watch as it's performed live. You're not going to get the crazy rawk n' roll frenzy of say, a Stones or Springsteen concert (Let's face it, the Prince of Wales is watching - so no stage diving), but performances from ABC and the Pet Shop Boys did manage to rile up some English boogie-ing.

In 1993 rap hadn't really found its voice. It was still considered experimental. Everyone wondered what was going to happen next. Sure there were heavy hits with lotsa radio play, and loads of anger. This one rises above the others in its slower danceable hip hop delivery and the way its rapped communicated here was something special. Nowadays things are too defined and commerically geared to be succesful. Insane in the Brain definitely goes counter to all that, and that gives it an elusive charm. I still play this even today.

A person with a massive coronary may need more prayer and to confess his or her sins but medical intervention is needed for a cure.

The pad itself seems to boasts just enough filling to be considered padded. With a description like XXXL I expected the product to at least have as much coushioning as the average comforter. I purchased this product to be placed on a college dorm mattress. (they are basically plastic wrapped around springs and have very little, if any, padding of their own) I feel that in order to get a comfortable rest I will need to purchase an foam \\"egg crate\\" pad to place under this pad because this product failed to live up to my expectations of what \\"XXXL\\" or \\"Double Filled\\" mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality stand.","review":"It is all the description makes it out to be.

I really disliked this book. I think Starhawk is getting carried away with her own sense of self-importance and I was especially offended by the effete sense that the truly spiritual can easily relate to the moutntains but not the desert. Ask yourself, how much damage did the protestors do to the Earth in the context of their protest against damaging the earth"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.......","review":"After reading a book of Starhawk's for the first time, \\"The Fifth Sacred Thing\\", I loved it so much and the characters, so I wanted more.

The fact that the story takes place over several decades only increases your emotional connection to the characters' struggles. I followed the evolution of the relationship between the main characters, Maya and Johanna, with personal interest. I read this book in a couple of days, intensely identifying with the desire to find out what your power in the world is and the sometimes painful healings that take place at major turning points in life. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been involved in the search for meaning, wants an intelligent novel dealing with spirituality or is a fan of Starhawk's other books. Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long a walk...","review":"Having devoured \\"The Fifth Sacred Thing\\", I was eager to learn more of Maya (or any other of the major characters). This current effort however, needed a much less timid editor. There are at least 100 pages too many, and the message and story got lost repeatedly in the details. I have not finished Walking To Mercury yet; I needed a break. I did like the story, and will finish one day, but I found myself wanting to know less, not more.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhilarating and depressing at once","review":"This is one of the most incisive surveys I've ever read of this vital American art form. The Golden Age of the musical, from 1927 to around 1964, gave us great art that was truly for the masses. Grant's analyses of singing styles, song types, and musical trends, is peerless. His remarks on how the microphone has damaged performance technique are vital to his thesis. It's utterly thrilling to read his narrative of how the musical grew into the glorious product of Broadway's Golden Age. But it also depresses me to consider that the musical as I've always loved it is probably doomed. This book should be required reading for every actor, director, sound designer, conductor, and arranger working on Broadway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"This book, though interesting, is perhaps the most poorly written book that I have ever read.

There are three levels of narrative in the book, and two of them - The Camera Eye and Newsreel - are positively Joycean. On top of that, the narratives about individual characters - the most detailed of the three levels - are written so that once you get to know a character, Dos Passos introduces a new character (there are 4 total) in a new narrative. It can be a little exhausting at times.Once I got past that, the richness of the language and brilliance of the story became evident. His style is simple, somewhat similar to Steinbeck's, and reflects the \\"common man\\" quality of the people he has created. But his scope is far greater than that of any of his contemporaries. It is truly a work of genius. Dos Passos, through 1000 pages (of all 3 volumes) and a dozen main characters, has managed to accruately tell the story of a coming-of-age United States in a human, compelling way."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Dos Passos: Forgotten Genius","review":"You will never read another book -- or series of books -- that can match the U.S.A. trilogy's characterization, scope, and power to make lives that ended a century ago seem as relevant as the latest news report.

It also traces the combat history of the 3rd Infantry Division. As a former member of this division, I greatly appreciated the movie, and the sacrifice made by these fine men. They truly accomplished great things under great difficulty.As far as Audie Murphy goes, he is a legend in the Army, and rightfully so. This movie does a nice job of telling his story, and includes some great action scenes. The fact that he plays himself actually works well. I watched it with my two boys, and they both enjoyed it. Other than the violence of the combat scenes, I think it is suitable for kids.If you like vintage WWII films (this one was filmed in 1955), then you will enjoy To Hell and Back.

I remember AMC showing this movie and the host commenting that Audie Murphy went thru a lot trying to get his book on the screen. Basically, they sanitized and cleaned everything up to the point where if you were young enough, you might think war is not that bad even if you get killed. I have had a copy of the book for about 20 years and have read it about 3 times, viewing the movie once ws enough for me. It is amazing how \\"all is quiet on the western front\\" made much earlier when standards were even more rigid was able to pack a bigger punch, make a point and be more satisifying than this watered-down mess.

It wasn't until recently when I was given a copy of Parallel Universe did I really start enjoying their brand of synthpop music. When I listen to the music I am often reminded a bit of Owl City, Pet Shop Boys, and even a hint of VNV Nation (like on the opening notes to \\"When It's Dark I'm Five Again\\"). I like that Fox Fletcher's guitars do not overwhelm and drown out the crisp synthesized melodies and gentle dance beats. I have to admit Jason Smith's vocals occasionally comes off whiny for me here and there but I quickly get over that and enjoy the music. Overall Parallel Universe is a very good synthpop album.

How can someone speak for 40 minutes jumping all over the place like they drank a Red Bull and then sell it as an audio.

Citibank - I had to practically manually download the data from the citibank website. The resulting data seemed accurate.2. DinersClub Mastercard - no support from within Quicken (you have to go to the web site and download quicken files).3. Brown and Company Brokerage - downloaded but the resulting data was inaccurate in many ways.4. Credit Suisse Brokerage - download worked - most data was ok but it couldn't recover the \\"basis\\" information from the account.I'm packing up the software and sending it back.

Last month, I got a warning from inside my 2003 version that the all on-line downloading feature would be discontinued in April if I don't upgrade (they call it \\"retail\\" or something like that). So I bought the 2006 version without much research and hesitation judged by the past upgrade experience. Boy, what a mistake! First, I cannot import the qif data from my credit union and bank any more. Then I got an error saying the data downloaded from one of my credit card companies was saved in a account no longer existing in my registry, what's going on?

When it gets corrupted it's bad, you can loose data, funny things will happen (transactions lost, bad totals, duplicate entries). It happens to me about every 4-6 months.

I came back to the states with the cd as a souvenier, and it has been one of my favorite albums ever since. People probably think I'm crazy, because I can't help but to crank the car stereo and sing along to every word with Maria Rita.Maria is fantastic, and her band compliments her so well.

Sometimes, when one knows her mother's voice, it's kind of disturbing, because it reminds always the great singer Elis Regina. A very nice and careful work of edition, with some, or most of all good are good songs. I felt two problems in the album. First of all is the fact that all the good songs, in this CD, come from others great brazilian compousers like Milton Nascimento and Lenine, and I think a musician needs a little bit of personalitty. And she does almost the same as Bebel Gilberto. Ok, they are nice, but we need differents songs, interpretations. If one listen to Bebel and just after put a CD of Maria Rita, I'm afraid he'll say \`Hey, they have good singers in Brazil, but they do the same\`.

If you haven't caught the original yet, then go watch that.

The filmmakers of the Omen (remake) took the 1976 version almost word for word, scene for scene, and added cell phones, 9/11 footage, slightly more grisly deaths, strange dream sequences, bad actors, and a lackluster soundtrack and released it to the viewing public expecting us to embrace it as a timely update to the original.

There are a few new things, a few changed bits, overall it even seemed that the camera shots were the same for the most part.

The clever casting of Mia Farrow notwithstanding, this remake has the same expensive sleek look as the original, and is almost word for word the same screenplay. What it lacks is the gravity and terror of the original; it's so much the same that it is ultimately pointless. And even though Gregory Peck and Lee Remick were too old in the original, their stature made the whole movie feel much more important than it had any right to be. This exercise is more like the recent re-do of PSYCHO - glossy, interesting in paper, but hollow. And definitely not scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Omen.

As they say, if it's not broke don't try to fix it and this film is the perfect demonstration. The child who plays Damien has maybe 10 lines in the whole movie and instead just sits around looking constipated. Julia Stiles, who I adore, has all the emotion of a grapefruit as she plays the mother of the antichrist. Liev Schreiber, much like Derek Zoolander, has one look throughout the entire film--which I like to call \\"Bored.\\" If the point of a remake is to offer a new perspective on an old tale, this movie serves no purpose. If you're in the mood to see the Omen go ahead and rent the original because this version falls way off the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and boring","review":"Maybe i expected too much from this movie. But i was left feeling very disappointed. It seems to have been another one of those 'the best parts end up in the trailer' type of films. which is sad because it could have been as good, if not better then the original. More then anything, i found this to be incredibly slow moving. At 95mins, it feels much longer. As far as the acting goes, I have never been a fan of Schreiber, but here, he's nothing more then a bland, emotionless cardboard cut out excuse for a 'devoted' husband and father.

The only problem I had with the movie was the child who played Damien. He just did not live up to the spookiness and evilness of the original Damien (that kid had it down pat!)

I barely had to follow along to know what was going on, and what was going to happen. So if you don't like to think too hard, this movie is perfect for you.The only thing I liked about this flim was Mia Farrow..now she was creepy!

YES it was very much similar to the original, but that appeared to be the idea, just to modernize (in terms of technology) the orginial. Further, Mia Farrow as Mrs. Balock was fabulous. In the end, it IS the same as the orginal and nothing is wrong with that. If anything, the remake brings it closer to home. AND FOR THE HATER WHO WROTE EARLIER...the films itself never quotes the year of Damien's birth just a month, day and time...try watching before you write a review."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 reasons why this is a good remake , 2 why its not so good","review":"the good:1.Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick's performance as Damien(excellent)2.The decapitation scene is creepy3.Julia Stiles plays Kathy and Liev Schreiber plays Robert Thorn4.Such scenes like when the nanny suicides , the father's death,and Kathy's fall from the 3rd floor5.It was quite good and crepythe bad:1. I expected to see more new scenes2.The nanny was'nt so creepy(actually she was cute!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy.","review":"Yet another failed remake. This version of The Omen not only collects and regurgitates all of the problems with the original, but adds a slew of its own including (in no particular order): (1) a silly kid whose goofy/evil faces are laugh-out-loud ridiculous; (2) the modern cinematic penchant for using loud, jarring sounds in lieu of genuine scares; (3) some genuinely bad acting (particularly from Julia Stiles -- if she gets another role after this, there must be some particularly profound shortage of minimally decent actors in Hollywood); and (4) implausible sequences and plot holes so large Arnold could drive his Hummer through them.Seeing this film is genuinely a waste of your good time.Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Avoid at all costs!

I've been listening to Social Distortion for about eight years, and i would recommend this cd to anyone who likes them. This album brings together Mike Ness's raw emotion with the rest of the groups punk/rock music at their best. It is definately their best work to date. I'm on my third copy of this cd, because i listened to the other two so much that there was nothing left to them but scratch marks. If you are in any doubt of getting this cd, trust me GET IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh man!","review":"This is probably my very favorite cd. First off social distortion rock, Mike Ness is just awesome, all the songs he writes are really good. I think every single song on this is great, the highest points are \\"Dont drag me down\\" \\"When the angels sing\\" and \\"I was wrong\\" just to name a few. The music is more hard edge then other social distortion albums but it doesn't make a differance in how awesome they are.

It demolishes everything in its path with Mike Ness's rugged vocals leading the way. \\"I Was Wrong\\" received some attention for good reasons, but the other songs are comparable and some are better. \\"Gotta Know The Rules,\\" \\"Don't Drag Me Down,\\" \\"Dear Lover,\\" and \\"Down On The World Again\\" are all relentless rockers that mostly last for over four minutes. Even the semi-ballads like \\"When The Angels Sing\\" contain a guitar assualt and rough vocals that keep your head moving throughout. The only misstep may be \\"Down Here (With The Rest Of Us),\\" but this is not even what I would call a bad song. It just doesn't have the sense of urgency or speed that characterizes most of the album. This is definitely top-notch punk agression from one of genre's older bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not compatible with the New Video Ipod, newest Ipod","review":"In the photo you are deliberatley decieved into believing it doesn't contain that chip type plug in.

It's definitely one of those books where it is evident that the author believes in what he's saying and relates his theories and findings in a truly interesting manner that captivates the reader. It's quite obvious that Mark Smith enjoyed every moment of writing this book. I must say that I didn't agree with every single thing that he said, but am amazed at how much I did agree with him.

It's a must read for everyone in this important election year...even for those on the \\"Looney Left\\" would benefit if they'd stop whining long enough to read the truth.The irony is for year's liberals-who have been spoon fed talking points by the DNC for years-have accused the right of being the masterminds of a grand conspiracy, but this is the first book of its kind. The truth is conservatives agree and present a united front on key issues, not because of talking points, but because they actually believe what they say and live what they believe.Mark's book shows the clear, consistent logic that permeates the conservative mindset in a format that is both informative and fun to read. Thank you Mark W. Smith!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and simplistic arguments","review":"I would NOT want to hire Mark Smith as a \\"lawyer\\". His \\"arguments\\" read like the kind of \\"evangelizing to Catholics\\" pamphlets put out by Christian Fundamentalist that assume that the arguments on the other side are \\"stupid\\" and easy to demolish. Also, his own arguments are flawed in the light of how Bush has actually INCREASED the size of the Federal Government and instead of working to limit the power of the government over the lives of its citizens as is the libertarian goal of conservatives, has increased it through not only the Patriot Act but on how government regulations are geared not toward the boardrooms but the bedrooms.

No, Conservatives need better arguments than the simplistic ones offered here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Same Old...","review":"Reading this book (as much of it as I could stomach) reminds me of why I gave up the talk-radio-induced conservatism of my younger, less intellectual days.

This clown does his friend Ann \\"Kill Their Leaders & Convert Them\\" Coulter proud. I still can't figure out how these flag-waving super-patriots can claim to love their country so much more than \\"treasonous\\" liberals while showing such utter contempt for their less fortunate fellow Americans. If Smith, Coulter, Savage, Hannity etc. are the best and brightest the right has to offer, it's a sad commentary on our society that this vicious ideology has advanced as far as it has.

Typical. I used to respect anyone's opinion, and I still try to, but when people clearly ignore facts and cling to their biases, without considering what they can see or use common sense, I have to call a spade a spade.

The writer makes many references to other books I have already read.

His book is so well written, it would take an idiot not to completely understand every point he makes. In the spirit of Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity, Mark writes with humor and confidence, making the book not only easy to read, but thoroughly enjoyable, sometimes even laugh-out-loud funny. It's like Mark took every belief I've ever held and bound all those beliefs together in a single work. This book should be required reading for every citizen of this country. The conservative movement in America is lucky to have a scholar as bright as Mark on their side. If you read no other political book this year, read this handbook. Oh, and make sure you fill out the \\"official membership card\\" in the back - that'll be important come November."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing the Loony Left","review":"This book shows that defeating the Loony Left is not only easy, but fun. In just two hundred easy-to-read pages, Smith throws one jab after the other (always leading with his right of course) at the liberal wackos, exposing their left side and shattering their glass jaw. This book is filled with scrupulously footnoted facts (my favorite--did you know that most species on the Endangered Species Act list are insects and invertabrates?), and is indispensable for conservatives who want to best their liberal friends and colleagues at cocktail parties and around the water cooler. Armed with actual facts, it's as easy as ABCs and 123s. If everyone reads this and buys a copy for their friends and families, the question is, will there be a Loony Left left?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong","review":"The book is a good read. Too bad much of the information is incorrect. For example, \\"Smashing Leftist Lunacy\\" says \\"my favorite--did you know that most of the 'animals' on the Endangered Species Act list are insects and invertabrates?\\". Which is not true at all. If you check yourself at the Federal Wildlife Service, (http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/TESSBoxscore) you'll see that out of 391 animals in the US and 516 foreign, only 148 are \\"insects or invertabrates\\" (clams/snails/insects/arachnids/crustaceans). The other 243 are Mammals/Birds/Reptiles/Amphibians/Fish. Almost 63% are something other than \\"insects or invertabrates\\". Of the 516 foreign animals on the Federal Endangered Species List, 426 are birds or mammals (82.55%)The whole book is like this. Quick sounds bites about facts and figures. But their facts and figures they quote are wrong and easily checkable. If you want to believe something that is wrong, buy this book and quote it.

What the author refuses to consider is that lawless businesses freely pollute at will, as the number of toxic waste sites in this country shows.The author would put us back in the time when raw sewage freely poured into rivers, smokestacks freely belched poisons into the air, and when children had the freedom to work in factories and mines, regardless of age.

You'll find a lot to pat each other on the back about. But if you ever talk to actual liberals (and assuming you have the intellectual honesty to admit when you're wrong) you'll quickly find that Smith grossly distorts some liberal positions for the sake of knocking them down (straw man argument), or else offers shaky support for his points.Just like Coulter, Hannity and Limbaugh, Smith has to be selective and sometimes dishonest in his presentation in order to make a case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching to the choir","review":"Any person who attempts to use this stuff against a serious liberal will come away bloodied. Mr. Smith actually plucked some short criticism from this site when he was on a CSPAN program. He overlooked difficult to deal with criticism. He does not provide facts that are indisputable. Watching Mr Smith in the flesh he is a standard right wing hack lacking of original ideas. If he is what conservatives had to offer in the wake of the 2000 elections to explain the right wing side of Bush v Gore the real conservatives stayed home that day. A note to Mr Smith... not all judges are un-elected. The US Supreme Court would be the most glaring example. Also lots of middle class families do not send their children to schools that cost $100,000 for four years of tuition. If you think you are conservative and want your biases fed get this book.

With the release of this book you get to see what Left is trying to say and what this Right is actually doing.What this book exposes is the lies, obfuscations, demagogues and misleading statements and actions. The book also shows you what you need to do in order to stand up and be counted.

It has an liberal argument/conservative counter-argument format split into chapters based on the topic discussed so it's easier to skip around to whatever topic that interests you and whatever talking point you want to specifically read about.If you're a conservative you'll love it, if you're a liberal you'll hate it (and I mean HATE it).

He has such a strong message for those in a similar situation or not. His son provides superb photography to begin each chapter and they compliment the overall feel of the book perfectly.

Of all the hard things in life you can think of, Christopher Reeve must have gone through much harder in his new life and if someone of his status could accomplish so much it makes me to think what I can do.

No masterpiece, but still a solid effort which I can respect. I think most Josh fans will love it, and if you're not, it could go either way.

It is the worst display I've seen on a portable device in at least ten years. There is virtually no lighting situation in which it is easy to read.I did start programming it, but soon realized that the display was bad enough to keep me from ever seriously using it.

In this story Khan is building a shadow kingdom and is bent on world conquest. His biggest obstacle is Gray Seven and and his other super being sibilings.You see how Khan wants the world to be a better place but naturally in his own image. He will do whatever is necessary but in the end things go wrong.We see some cameos of various people from the Trek world. People that appeared from TOS to Voyager. During this story we also have a side story where Kirk is trying to figure out if the Federation should accept a new world that is involved in making humans superior.Overall a great story and I enjoy how Cox gets current events that happen in the 1990's and make it part of the story. I can't wait for his 3rd story in this Khan adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Star Trek Rewrite","review":"Part I of this series was quite entertaining, but this one isn't what I hoped for. It's another example of rewriting the Star Trek universe in a vain attempt to fit reality. It doesn't suprise me, because this novel fits perfectly into the philosophy of the new Trek series.I gave it two stars because it did fit reality in a somewhat clever fashion, but as someone else already stated, it didn't happen this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Influential and beautiful","review":"Undoubtedly \\"Sittin' In\\" was one of the seminal albums for the singer-songwriter genre of the 1970s, and was also highly typical (and yet influential) of the growing California sound. Kenny Loggins's pairing with Jim Messina was one of those magical happenstances you look back on years later with wonder, like Crosby & Nash inviting Stills over one afternoon.Although the achingly beautiful \\"Danny's Song\\" (with which Anne Murray had a big hit later) is worth the entire purchase price of the CD, there are other standouts as well, including the popular \\"House at Pooh Corner,\\" \\"Back to Georgia,\\" and the trilogy of \\"Lovin' Me,\\" \\"To Make a Woman Feel Wanted,\\" and \\"Peace of Mind.\\"Though their other albums together may not have been as strong, \\"Sittin' In\\" is a clear and enjoyable demonstration of the potential they had and the songwriting gifts they both possessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Messina with Loggins","review":"The reality is that this album took an unknown, Loggins, and teamed him up with an old pro, Messina. Jim's great success at writing, guitar playing and producing with Buffalo Springfield and Poco were all good fortune for Kenny Loggins. Messina wrote or co-wrote half the album, played lead guitar and produced the album with a little guiding input from the great record producer Clive Davis. For me it seems the most overlooked cut on the album is Same Old Wine by Messina. It captures a timeless political sentiment from the late 60's and early 70's that resonates again today. Jim's guitar solo here is one of the best you'll ever hear and a strong testament to his place as one of rock n' roll's greatest contributors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about it","review":"This CD compiles Cher's 2 albums she recorded for Casablanca Records in 1979-- TAKE ME HOME and PRISONER. Not only are these among her worst albums, this utterly needless trenching up of Cher's worst does little for posterity. Cher sounds ridiculous on many of the awfully composed numbers such as \\"Wasn't It Good?\\" and \\"Shoppin'\\". She has to compete with drum machines, synthesizers, and screeching guitars through most of this mess. She is utterly detached from her material, resigning herself to grunting and squeeling to keep up with her accompaniment. Worst of this set is the PRISONER album, which teeters hopelessly between disco and new wave. \\"Take Me Home\\", the disco classic stands the test of time as does her country crossover hit \\"Its Too Late\\". Little else on this sloppy compilation is worth recovering on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"disrespectful hatchet job","review":"Rachel Carson so loathed this film that she neveragain sold the rights to her books................-- and with schlockmeister irwin at the helm, it's no wonder --after suffereng through the initial heavy handed attempts atproselytising, the viewer is treated to a thematicallyconfused 60 minutes that veers mindlessly fromgawking at the under water 'freaks' togee whiz, look at the variety of life tohey, let's kill some helpless sea creatures for 'sport' --building to a climax, we are entertained by a mass killing ofking crabs (an infinitesimal preview of things to come)and for the finale we are treated to the blow by blow slaughterof a whale -- as the screen fills with blood (and the viewerwith revulsion) we see in no uncertain terms the true natureof man's 'stewadship' of this planet --..........shame on the producers -- if they had wanted to make a filminsulting everything Rachel Carson stood for , they coulldn'thave done a better job"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cherry Jelly","review":"I found this product online for my wife.

I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here, not as comfortable as the original (the others looked better for the work place too) but I broken them in and they were acceptable. Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two. Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same. Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them. Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much. One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear. The quality has really degraded. You might want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoe was too narrow for me","review":"I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe. Once on, with the use of a shoehorn, the shoe was long enough but too tight overall. Too uncomfortable on, it was immediately apparent they had to go back. Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise.

The new shoe was not as comfortable at first, but after time has become more comfortable. After just over a year, I, too, have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers.

The inside is completely ruined and they have a slightly funky smell (as 13 yr old shoes often will) but they're still the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. I keep meaning to buy a new pair but never seem to get around to it. I love these shoes. Every few years I get the urge to toss them out (they're old and dirty and ripped up inside) but the moment I try them on again I remember why I haven't before.

The King's work in Memphis is legendary. This book is amusing in places, but comes off looking like an advertising for WWF programming. I realize that the WWF is widely recognized by the younger set, but it would have worked better for me if Foley had used generic grapplers instead of WWF characters. I didn't have any problem with the moon coming out; bare butts in children's books are not unprecedented. Lawler's illustrations are very good, but that's no surprise to long-time fans. If it hadn't been for the fact that I'm turned off by books that appear to be promoting specific products, I could have given the book a higher rating.

It was so bad that it actually took me out of the story several times. It was almost like the author lost a bet and had to include EVERY corny catch phrase imaginable. The characters are unbelievable. There is almost no action. It even makes me wonder if these 5 star ratings are plants (Yes I know that people can have different opinions, but if your opinion is that the sky is green, you're still wrong. Which I would argue is the case here).

I wouldn't even read them, but my brother is a big fan and I like to see what type of books he's reading. I love the human alien combat scenes, I really enjoy the slam bam action, but these books need more character development. I am not a hormonal teenager like by brother, I don't need a bunch of gratuitous sex, which this book had plenty of. Instead, I want characters that I like! With these Aliem books, I haven't found a single character that I actually liked enough to care whether they got torn apart by Aliens. So, all in all, I'd say these are OK books if you like violence and sex and don't want to be involved with the characters at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"It's always a bit diff to recommend a book if you don't know what the reader\`s prefs are. So if you liked the movies A1, A2 and A4, then you'll like this book. Maybe for some people's taste it starts off too slowly, that is, except of a short intermezzo right at the beginning Aliens do not show up. However, in the book's last quarter they do, and there you've got the tension you seeked for. Some new technical stuff has been invented to withstand the Alien threat, and it's a fascination read.

The father is involved and facilities their pretend activities of a racecar, airplane, and train, even a space ship. The soft, warm pastel illustrations strengthen the emotional warmth of the story. The mother is attractively dressed and coifed-even to the two earrings in each ear. The little boy wears the outfits of the pretend characters. Happiness, excitement, mother-son love exude from each illustration. This book is for children ages 5-8 and could be a bedtime story for younger children. After a long day of \\"zooming\\" there is a tender picture of the mother holding her sleepy son.

As a writer, he often belabors his points or repeats them endlessly (count how many times he inserts \\"had to\\" in the first three volumes of this series). However, in this book, he does it far less often and it is far less invasive because his narrative is so compelling.Here he posits a sweeping scope of American history in a readable, complete way that is engaging and never boring. I found his chapters on Richard Russell, Hubert Humphrey, and the battle for the 1957 civil rights bill the best parts of the story; in many ways, Johnson is just the center of a more complete work of history. (A case in point, is that another terrific part is when Caro describes when Johnson suffered his heart attack, which is almost a side story to the fight for the \\"Great Cause\\").I'm anxiously awaiting publication of the fourth volume from this master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Update on the Next Volume","review":"Just had to share some information on the next volume, I heard Robert Caro being interviewed today and he said that he expects his next LBJ book to be completed in 4 or 5 years. The reason this book took so long is that he has been also doing a lot of research on the next volume (LBJ's Vice-Presidency and Presidency years), because he needed to interview so many people before they die, several already have. Caro said that not only did he interview so many people from the LBJ administration, but he also had to read their papers, documents, etc. So, in effect, a lot of the ground work for Volume 4 has already been done.I just started reading this volume and so far it has exceeded my expectations - wonderful detail without going overboard, fascinating perspective into that era. Caro is a great writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings an earlier time and people to life","review":"Of course this is a great book and series, but here is the bottom line: After fininshing the book, and realizing that I would not see the next one for who knows how long, I actually started missing Johnson and the other characters.

This doesn't even cover his vice presidency or presidency - which will make even more engrossing reading for sure. The re-evaluation of LBJ's legacy now is especially pertinent given the current situation of another Texan in office facing a foreign crisis whose parameters remain frighteningly unknown. FYI, I noticed HBO has a movie coming out soon Path to War about LBJ's decisions that led to the escalation of the Viet Nam conflict. Looks fascinating as well, and hopefully along with the Caro biography - a more complete, well-rounded view of LBJ will emerge for the public at large."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of Revelations on the US Senate","review":"Aside from the story of Lyndon Johnson, which takes the reader through a range of emotions from admiration to repugnance, this is an eye opening look at the history and the internal machinations of America's only insular legislative body, insular in its unique protection from American majority opinion.

Caro's book (not for someone with a short attention span) is so detailed and so well researched that the pages almost come to life as it describes his ascent to power within the House and then to the Senate. With over 1,000 pages of reading, I would have probably not taken it home from a bookstore, but I guess that is one of the problems with ordering on Amazon (i couldnt scope it out before i purchased it). It is definitely for the wonk and well educated political hack, this is no easy reading. It is no wonder that it takes him 10 years to produce each of his books, they are long and very well written.

They include three on Lyndon Johnson and one on Robert Moses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leadership 101","review":"Caro's triology on LBJ is unrivaled, and this volume might lay claim to the best of the bunch. LBJ's genius in leading the Senate is put on display, but also his raw ambition and dishonesty. Caro shows how LBJ is a model of how to lead and not to lead at the same time. LBJ's knows all, remembers all, and befriends the real power brokers. And yet, a classic bully, one not afraid to inflict terror into others to get his way or just plainly lie.Rarely has such a American political icon been undressed in such a pentetrating, thorough way. Caro leaves no doubt what a genius and utterly dispicable person LBJ was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting and authoritative","review":"It's not every day that I take a 1000+ page hardback book on a plane trip. But since buying this book in February I have taken it on several trips because I literally could not bear to be parted from it.LBJ was a puzzling and inherently contradictory character, a man with compassionate instincts who was nonetheless in thrall to some of the most base and reactionary political interests of his time. This book lays out with exquisite detail and nuance the odyssey he traveled from his early days in Congress until his finest hours as Senate Majority Leader, culminating in the passage of the first civil rights act in more than 80 years.Like many baby boomers who came of age politically during the Vietnam era, my view of LBJ was incomplete at best. I am grateful to this book for the additional understanding I have gained from it, and I look forward to reading the two earlier volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Study of Power","review":"Caro turns a dry subject into gripping drama.

We all benefit from Caro's lifelong work and devotion to his subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence defined","review":"Simply put, Caro's multi-volume biography of Lyndon Johnson is the best book I have ever read.

So - why only one star? The same book is available from Amazon for less than $15.00. So why pay $69 (the asking price as of this writing)?? The cover is different, so this may be an early printing. That alone does not warrant an additional $54."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great interpretation of Hong Kong during the 1950s","review":"Whatever your expectations based on watching the film by the same name, The World of Suzie Wong is actually a beautifully written book that provides an intimate portrait of post-WWII Hong Kong. For anyone who has lived in the former British colony, I guarantee you will be fascinated by Mason's astute observations of life in the territory. For those who have never set foot in Asia, Mason's themes about class and culture conflict are timeless, and the book surprisingly avoids easy cliches because it is so well executed. This is one of the most underrated books of the past 50 years, much deeper than the broadway play or Hollywood's film interpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A revelation","review":"I remember seeing the William Holden film of this book many years ago, and liking it. So, when I saw this book at the YMCA book store in Kowloon, I picked it up to pass the time between meetings.The book is very different than the movie. It is much more nuanced and descriptive of Hong Kong (and even British) society of the Fifties. Lomax is British in this book, not an architect or middle class, but rather an ex-pat who had worked in Malaya, and now wanted to paint. His romance with Suzie grows organically, and by the end of the novel, more truthful than the movie. That they end up living in Japan after time in racist England is so unexpected, but perfect... strangers in a strange land, to each other and to all around them, yet loving and supporting each other through life.Highly recommended - for the story, the ambience, social commentary and historical detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book-highly recommended","review":"This is a wonderful book which has covers the current issue of declining amphibian populations well in regards to the pet trade, habitat loss and fragmentation, and exotic species as well as specific species such as the golden toad and california's red-legged frog. Its an adventure as well as a source of information. The only reservation I had was that it didn't cover chemicals (pesticides) or frog deformities as issues towards species loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary and timely","review":"This reads like a novel, but the subject is non-fiction: the disappearance of frogs from our planet, what it means, and what we must do about it.

CD 1 opens with Curtis Knight's Zeus,two tracks that show a promising band with varied influences touched on. Two tracks by a band called Continuous Performance give no indication of the assault of Motorhead. Then there is 11 tracks of Motorhead.Bludgeon. The real gems of this 2 Cd collection are the opening three demo tracks of Fastway with Pete Way on bass. These two could have gone far but Mr.Way bolted for Ozzy Osbourne and later Waysted. I always liked Fastway so 8 tracks by this band is a fun listen.There is 4 traks from Fast Eddie Clarke's solo album which is fine and the CD closes with Motorheads\\"We are the Road Crew\\". Which if you have ever been on the rock & Roll road as I have, the lyrics tell it all with a laugh. Enjoy and cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy to read thorough treatment on all aspect of DE's...","review":"I originally purchased this text to help with my study for an undergraduate course in Partial Differential Equations and Waves. From start to finish, this book always presents the material in an easy to read and easy to understand manner.Generally, the book gives a really good understanding on the topics of solving ordinary differential equations, and then the various types of partial differential equations, such as the heat equation, where the solution methods involved can be confusing at times. The book also has a large selection of worked examples and wide ranging practise problems.The book has the effect where even if the reader is only armed with basic undergraduate calculus, it gives them a very good understanding of the material in a short time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Dense","review":"I found this book disjointed and disappointingly dense. I felt like the story started somewhere in the middle and even after reading about a quarter of the book I did not identify with any of the characters or find myself involved in the plot line.

Be prepared to fight your way through if you purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another great work ruined by Amazon's printing practices","review":"I am a huge Gene Wolfe fan, so despite the one star review let me state categorically this is not a negative review of his writing at all, as I have thoroughly enjoyed everyone of his written works. Rather, this review is about Amazon's deplorable practice of printing books 'On-Demand' and then trying to pass them off as the original from the publisher. If you look over this page you will not see any evidence that this book is unavailable or out of print - in fact it is currently listed as 'in-stock' - however, what you will be getting if you order it is a bootleg copy produced by amazon.

The first respons I got just said that I could send them the problem again, the second said to go to the quicken web page to get the price, and the third told me again I could get help by either phoning them, emailing them, or doing a on-line chat.

Already I have discovered two very irritating changes that I consider bugs and been told they are features:Each entity uses a different check format. Previous versions remembered which check format each used. Now I find it is up to me to remember to change the printer setup from wallet checks to voucher checks or vice-versa each time I print checks. I have ruined numerous checks for my silly failure to remember each time.Report titles have an appended year and history number appended to them, like \\"2006 Expendatures vs Budget - 2006:3\\". It is either difficult or impossible to get rid of the \\"-2006:3\\" part of the title. Previously I had complete control over the report title printed in bold, large font at the top of the page.

Quicken's interface is absolutely horrid! Moving from field to field for data entry is cumbersome, it can't reconcile my simple portfolio, and doesn't conform to standard key shortcuts. Data entry is an absolute miserable experience.While Money eliminates most of the headaches around financial management, Quicken amplifies them....If you're using Money, do not switch!

I surprisingly found almost every plant, bird, insect, animal, ect, that I encountered, on a recent trip, in this book (some weren't even listed in the dedicated guides). The book also has sections on topography, geology, habitats, astronomy, weather and conservation.It is beautifully put together with sharp, clear color photography. I don't know how they managed to get so much in this pocket guide. It's another wonderful book by Knopf and a great gift for nature lovers and hikers (No, I don't know or work for the publisher). I'm only on this site to buy another copy for a friend.

This guide is a great way to get started. It is very well organized into groups (reptiles, birds, trees, etc.) and I am able to find what I am looking for quickly and easily. It has great pictures and descriptions that are detailed enough without going overboard. (It is supposed to be a QUICK reference.) The only negative is that sometimes I see something in the wild that is not in the guide. However, due to the large variety of subject matter that is covered, this is totally understandable. If I want more detail on a specific subject, I will need to purchase a book that concentrates on that subject. Overall a great guide to start enjoying the CA wilderness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imposter designer (bad knockoff)","review":"Immediately upon opening what appears to be a genuine box, it appeared that the Cologne was off-color. in addition, the bottle had a very similar design, but was not quite like all the others I have purchased over the years.

So this review is more about the series as a whole then just volume 1.This book and the first few volumes start strong, introducing a medieval world under siege by shape-shifting demons called Youma. The human race's only defense are the Claymores, women with Youma blood who can go toe-to-toe with the demons but, as we learn, the more they use their powers the closer they come to losing control.It's a great set up, with lots of mysteries and chances for adventure and I really loved the first few books.But I found as the series went on it became more and more padded. Where once we had several adventures in a single book, we now had 200 page fight scenes.So I recommend it, but with the warning that the series will lose steam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I've already read this series basically online, scanlated, However, this series is so good, it's deserving of being physically bought.

Only Females live through the process.In the first chapter you get a sense when she first shows up she is a heartless monster. But later on through the book you see that she has a kinder heart than you might think.It has a very dramatic/action/adventure plot and great characters that have deepening stories to be told.I reccomend this to anyone who is interested in something new and exciting.

The author pulls together his information from an exhaustive list of mostly non-English resources and puts them together in a very orderly and interesting manner. The author brings life to the history of Dubrovnik (not that he would need to) which makes for a very interesting and easy read. I personally loved this book from beginning to end and can only hope the author produces more books on Croatian history (perhaps the next one could tackle the history of Split?). Overall, an excellent piece of work and a great price for a book that should be in every serious Croatian historian's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable!","review":"This is one of the children's shows that I love to watch with my daughter. I really like the fact that it is voiced by actual children (rather than the usual voice-over actors), and having the British characters introduces a different culture and manner of speaking to children.I also really like the fact that it does not use snark or sarcasm to get the point across or to entertain. Don't get me wrong - I love snark and sarcasm, but I'd really like to wait to introduce that to my toddler, you know?Charlie loves his little sister Lola, and they have a healthy, loving relationship. He has no problem helping to look after her, and the fact that he will go to lengths to cheer her up and make her feel better is excellent to see.The animation is cute, too.

It is an excellent, stirring movie and the quality of the master is the best in terms of video and audio quality. The actors -- Brian Donlevy, William Bendix, Preston Foster and MacDonald Carey are all very believable in their roles.

However, the latter sections concerning the wars of the roses, and Richard III in particular, are nonsense from a historical perspective. Norwich must have flipped through a few scholarly works and decided that including footnotes and cititions would be adequate. The problem is that he tends to ignore the credibility of the sources he cites, perhaps feeling that anybody living within a couple of hundred years of the events in question would be a credible and objective source. In the case of Richard the 3rd, many other people have made the same mistakes (i.e. taking Thomas More and John Morton as reliable sources of information).

Richard III's alleged physical deformity is faithfully repeated here for instance. The only problem is that any objective historian has rejected that part of the legend as simply being Tudor propaganda (how a person with a lame leg, withered arm and huge humpback became a renowned warrior is just not something that can be explained).

There is no reason to spend the money on this unlesss you are a big fan who HAS to have all the albumns. The production quality is as bad as most of the songs. I don't know about you but I can only listen to so many songs in which Gene and Paul make their sexual desires known to us over and over again. Once again the albumns of choice for this band are Alive, Destroyer and Love Gun. Also some of their 80's and 90's work is decent stuff but because of the changing lineups their sound was changing as well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is mostly garbage......","review":"This is the first KISS album I bought. I got it for 3 dollars as a used cassette from a flea market in Florida. Tha quality of the tape itself was fine but the music wasn't. \\"Rock-n-Roll all Nite\\" is a great song but it can't save this collection. \\"C'mon and Love Me\\" is a decent track as well. The rest, I'm sorry to say is not worth much. Compared to what other bands were putting out in this era: Aerosmith, Zeppelin, Stones, etc this album looks even sillier in retrospect. Buy Double Platinum or Destroyer. Heck get any Kiss album besides this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool rock","review":"While this is a good album, I can't honestly give it a 5 star rating even though I'm a big KISS fan. The one thing this CD features is the First release of the Top 40 Hit \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\". Rock And Roll All Nite, Rock Bottom, She, and C'mon And Love Me are performed in a somewhat slower pace than like they are on Alive. Still, this is a good CD to have if you love 70's rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very raw","review":"A very raw product from what was then a very raw band - looking back it's funny to think how my perceptions have changed.

It does sound a little polished compared to the previous two KISS albums, but it still contains some rocking tunes. \\"C'mon And Love Me\\" and \\"She\\" are the definite high points of the album, while \\"Two Timer\\", \\"Getaway\\", and \\"Love Her All I Can\\" serve as cult classics for die-hard KISS fans (like myself).Classics such as \\"Rock Bottom\\" and \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\" are more identified for their live versions from KISS Alive!In conclusion, I think the album is worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album is okay.","review":"This cd is okay. It isn't as good as KISS \\"KISS\\" or KISS \\"creatures of the night\\", or \\"alive\\" but it is okay. I am puzzled as to why so many of these mediocre kiss albums get 5 star reviews. This album is rockin good fun but nothing as special or as epic early Rush or Judas Priest albums. If you like KISS or rock you will enjoy this album, i happen to think Kiss is an okay band and this album is just okay. if you want to get into Kiss, start with the self titled, creatures of the night, Alive 1 and 2, or Love gun. Lick it up is pretty cool too(though mediocre)but still good fun music. I gave it 3 star instead of 5 because the songs are very simple and thrown together for the most part, but a handful are worthy to listen to...hell some people may even like the crappy songs...i know i do at times hahaha. kiss is cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"UNDERRATED CLASSIC KISS","review":"This hss always been one of my favorite KISS albums.

I figured they have longevity, let's see what I'm missing, they've got to be doing something right. They make catchy fun music and absolutely fell in love with their music. Kiss and the Ace years were very special. Each of the seven early albums are great. I don't think you can go wrong. You just have to take it for what it is and nothing more. You can certainly expect cheese, just in case you're new to them. It's Hard Rock, Rock N' Roll. Keep in mind the era in which this was done. Not heavy, rather thin sound. Gene and Paul have split duties with the vocals. I'm still amazed as to how marketable Kiss is. They really have left and are still leaving a lasting impression in the music world. You Wanted the Best...well, they may very well be."},{"rating":"2","title":"she's a killer","review":"The 3rd album for Kiss, Dressed to Kill, is another classic rocker. Of \\"The Originals\\" (the first three Kiss studio releases) this is my least favorite, but that only shows how great their first two albums are. Dressed to Kill clocks in at under 30 minutes, but it's non-stop classic rock from start to finish. This album also has a lot of \\"left over\\" material from the first two Kiss album recording sessions and even Wicked Lester. But even Kiss' filler from the early 70s is really good stuff. Another \\"must have\\" for any Kiss fan. Standout tracks: She, C'Mon and Love me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Kiss","review":"\\"Ladies in Waiting\\" and \\"Two Timer\\" are great songs that never got a lot of attention. This album has always been one of my favorite Kiss releases, ever since I traded another album for it back in Jr. High. It seems to be a little heavier and darker than the first two and the intro to \\"Rock Bottom\\" is awesome. Ace shows a glimps of things to come on his solos on DTK. It also has a few Kiss classics. Cool album cover too.

Torres nearly always crafts an entertaining story, but his characters really come to life with Miyazawa on art chores; he captures deftly the exuberance and excitement of the youthful cast and the wonder of a high school devoted to the super-powered. The characters are believable, likeable, and altogether worthwhile. The only real issue as I see it is that Torres sets up the story for further adventures (as none of the key plot points are really resolved) and yet there are no further adventures. It's always painful to see characters and stories left hanging, but especially so when they are worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, and Lifeless Art.","review":"I picked this up from the library with high expectations.

Though some of the essays deal with scientific issues (e.g. physics, cosmology, black holes) most of the book is autobiographical in nature discussing the author?s upbringing and struggle with ALCS.Written in the aftermath of the popular A Brief history of the Universe, the current work is a rather blatant effort to exploit Hawking's popularity with minimum effort. Although a short book (approx. 175 hardcover) there is much repetition amongst the essays. Readers with even a passing knowledge of Hawking will find no new information in this book.Overall, a disappointing book that has little to offer. Only for the most dedicated Hawking aficionado."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating read","review":"This is a collection of talks, essays and an interview given by Steven Hawking.

Einstein's book on relativity is a case in point, as is this book in which the candid reader is informed that \\"Objects at rest tend to remain at rest, therefore heavier objects will fall faster in a gravitational field.\\" Got that? If so, maybe you can explain it to me. Listen, I know something about Physics. Back in the seventies I built a particle accelerator out of a blow drier and a box of Mike and Ikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step into Hawking's personal life","review":"This particular book by Hawking explores his personal life as well as the physicist side of life. I become interested in how a man like Hawking came to be after reading his \\"A Brief History of Time.\\" This book answered all of my questions as he goes farther into depth about how he grew up, and lives with ALS. This book is a composite of many essays, so the reader will find that Hawking repeats himself more than twice. This is a good book, but not quite to the standard as his previous book was. I gave a rating of 4 stars because the title of this book was somewhat deceiving, as an aspiring physicist looking for an educational book might choose this one, little realizing that it focuses much on Hawking's life, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cashing in on \\"A Brief History\\"","review":"Hawking's best known book \\"A Brief History of Time\\" is one of the classics of it's type, managing to get across the essential elements of some very complex science in a simple manner. Unfortunately this is not in the same league and appears to be a shameless attempt to cash in on the Hawking name by lashing together a collection of old essays and a radio script. There is a LOT of material which will seem very familiar to readers of \\"A brief history\\" and a lot of repetition even between the different essays in the book.

The sail/pass form went in a second slot and passports in the third. My picture ID and the one credit card I would use for this trip also had their slots. I still had a zippered section left to hold my money. The loaded wallet fit into the room safe, and my wife was able to carry it in her small pocket book when required.

The main reason was the King Missile (you know, of \\"Jesus Was Way Cool\\" and \\"Detachable P***s\\" fame) cover of \\"Get Up.\\" What was a slightly annoying song in the original version on _Green_ became maniacally entertaining in the King Missile version, complete with deliberately stumbly and out of tune keyboard lines and enthusiastically off-pitch backing vocals, and sped up a good 20 BPM from the original version. I can happily live without the rest of the album (though the Sicilian version of \\"Talk About the Passion\\"--not \\"Pretty Persuasion\\" as the other reviewer mentions--is kind of interesting)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I give it 5 stars for one song...","review":"Phelg Camp's cover of \\"Feeling Gravitiy's Pull\\" is awesome.

If you get the chance, do try and catch her on tour at book signings.Great read - highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairstein was in over her head on this one","review":"I've read all the Fairstein novels with Alex Cooper, so obviously I like them. But this one shows me Fairstein tried to do more complex plotting and failed. The story was convoluted, with too many characters all dealing with ancient (and rather boring) history.Unliike some of the other reviewers who couldn't finish the book, I did make myself finish, but I knew the ending was going to be dumb and anticlimactic. And I wasn't wrong.Not Fairstein's best work.P.S. Ms. Fairstein, Alex is interesting, but she's also very pretentious (i.e. \\"the house in the country,\\" etc.). And her relationship with Jake is almost romance-novel-like in the way it's described. (I.e., the \\"I-want-my-lover-to-take-me-in-his-arms-and-make-me-feel-loved-and-adored\\" crap.)

Andrew Tripping, the suspect in the case, used his 10 year old son as leverage against his victim. At the same time, Mike Chapman is investigating a murder case that seems to be suspiciously linked to Alex's rape case. Alex, Mike, and Mercer Wallace must untangle the deadly web before the murderer strikes again.Fairstein is generally an entertaining read, however this novel seemed a bit formulaic. I understand that there is a fomula that lies beneath the surface of every mystery novel, but if I can grasp the formula and feel it working, then the author isn't doing their proper job. That is why I stopped reading Patricia Cornwell; the formula was in my face, and I am feeling the same thing with Fairstein. Overall, it was an OK novel. Nothing to write home about though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! Skip it!

To be honest, I would have been more excited to read court transcripts from actual trials -- such was the tedium of this novel.The complexity of the plot should make it more interesting, but instead I had a difficult time following who was speaking to whom. There were far too many secondary characters to carry the primary plot, resulting in a convoluted timeline that didn't entice.Furthermore, and this is perhaps the most important thing I can say, I didn't care about what might happen to the characters. Alex Cooper didn't come across at all as sympathetic, and the lack of personal details about a character written in the first person was just shoddy craftsmanship.

The performance is closely-miked with deep rich bass. (a conductor's perspective). But, I like it that way. This performance draws you in.

KISS was a live spectacle, to contain that and attempt to channel it into a studio environment is a terrible idea. Even so, KISS managed to produce a few studio gems (Destroyer, Dressed to Kill, Love Gun, KISS) but until you've heard the difference between, say, Deuce from their self titled debut album and Deuce on Alive! you can't really tell the difference.The intensity of their performance and the crowd combine to make AS close to an arena rock circa 1975 KISS show as you can get without a time machine.matt."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Everything KISS HAS RECORDED!","review":"I own some of these albums,(only in cassette form).I am trying to rebuild my KISS Collection after loosing all my albums during a couple of moves.I would like to replace my albums on CD, because the tapes I do have are getting worn out from over-play."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first kiss","review":"my first kiss record.i was 9 years old when i got this.it was my very first record bought.my parents let me pick out one record to buy as i started my rock and roll discovery. i thought the cover looked real cool,four guys in makeup playing live wow i was going to be cool.this rocked i was air guitaring with in seconds of putting this one my sisters turntable.this still rules even today.black dimond,100,000 years.my two fav kiss songs.kiss they still rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is simply a most own","review":"for any kid that wants to know how it was when rock was rock this is a most own this album has them in top form at their begging of the carrers this shows how great they truly are. you should get it if you want to play some cool tunes this album shows how rock was fun and not depressing how today rock is. kiss performs the best live believe me i saw them 10 times and i am 15 this is a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiss Alive! was exactly what I was looking for","review":"The product came in a timely manner. The condition of the product was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Although I am not a big fan of Kiss (I find Paul, Gene, Ace, and Peter very limited as a musicians), I have to admit that this album is great. The songs sound better than the studio versions (they are played faster here) and, perhaps more importantly, this CD makes you feel like part of the audience. It reached number 9 of the Billboard's chart and sold millions of copies -quadruple platinum (remarkable for a double album). If you like hard rock, you will certainly enjoy this album. I strongly recommend it. I can not finish this review, however, without telling you that this album might not really be a true \\"live\\" album. Some controversy exists with respect to how much of this album was made in studio. Paul Stanley has recognized that some work was made to enhance the live atmosphere of the album. Many people may be disappointed because of this, but for others it does not matter. I can just tell you this: if you want to enjoy a good rock album, buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Live Album","review":"'Alive!' by Kiss is a very fun and enjoying album to listen to. When I first purchased it I kept listening and listening and having a lot of fun, as if I were actually at the concert. I guess this is one thing Kiss succeeds in on all of their livereleases. This was the first Kiss album I bought, so it no doubtedly is a perfect introduction to the band. BUY IT AND ENJOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest aesthetic achievement of the 20th century!","review":"Certainly we can consider the novels of Faulkner or the visual creations of Georgia O'Keefe, but I don't think anyone would dispute the fact that Kiss: Alive! is clearly the superior of such relatively humble pieces of art. Of course, one can cite the rapturous use of tone and melody in these landmark compositions. But I personally find the greatest rapture in the unspeakably beautiful lyrics of G. Simmons. \\"Oooo wooo, Black Diamond,\\" indeed! Transcendent moments of that caliber have come very infrequently in the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where it all started.","review":"Given the inconsistent albums that this band has released in the last two decades one kind of wonders why would they still be playing. Well, this is the reason. This is where it all started reminding us what a great band Kiss was and is still capable of being. On a final note, although I do not particularly enjoy live albums, this one is a notable exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiss Alive!","review":"Kiss Alive! is the standard by which all live rock albums have been judged since 1975, and created the standard \\"double live LP\\" format. If you're a Kiss fan and don't have this one you NEED it ASAP. If you are a rock and roll fan and don't have this buy it now. This is an all time classic, and one of the greatest albums ever made. Kiss in their top form performing their early classics when they were fresh and raw. Incredible stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legend is Born","review":"Although many people think KISS is a notoriously great live act due to the spectacle, this album proves the reputation was gained through spectacular performances of MUSIC. The songs on \\"Alive\\" sound better than their studio versions could ever dream. This is one of the greatest live albums of all time because it gives these songs the life the studio could never provide them. KISS is a band more about energy than composition, about vibe more than orchestration. And this album captures that energy perfectly. None of these songs were hits. But \\"Alive\\" makes them all seem like classics. The band formed its legacy on this record and rightfully so. Despite delusions otherwise, there is only ONE \\"Alive\\" and it should be owned by everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure unadulterated KISS before the interruptions of fame","review":"I find Alive to be eternally fresh and timeless.It is a true taste of KISS in my opinion; and it is fortuneately given its just deserves in most commentaries. As an astute KISS fan I can say that this is the perfect album to cut your KISSdom teeth on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catman","review":"Criss could flat out play during the period when this set was recorded. After he became hooked on coke and heroin, around 1976, he completely lost his ability to play; hence, the group hiring studio drummers on several of their last recordings.He definately set the plate on this set. Without the steady 4/4 thump, this wouldn't have the \\"oomph\\" that it does.Simple songs and lyrics. What's wrong with that? The finest rock and roll songs are simple ones, and they're the hardest to write and make original."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest \\"live\\" albuns of all times !!!","review":"THrough my experience listening and reading about KISS, I still haven't reached a final conclusion: are they a band who really cared about their fans since their start, doing always the best they can, or are they people who cares only about their fans' money? I don't know. ALIVE represents this, because it's getting clearer day by day that this albun was greatly overdubbed in studios (a thing that is not difficult to believe, due to Kiss's known interest only for money). But: studio or no, this sounds amazing, fantastic, pure rockn'roll. It is included in almost \\"best-ever\\" list of albuns. Get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"KISS IS LAME","review":"Anyone who thinks this is an awesome live album is actually kidding themselves, not to mention if you think Kiss is a good band. Alive was completely constructed in the studio, and audience noice was later pumped in, louder than it actually was at a real show in fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"The idiotic circus that is a Kiss show, cut/pasted for your listening pleasure","review":"\\"Kiss: Studio Trickery!\\" is one of the most popular live albums of all time for some reason. To take it farther and introduce my opinion, Kiss is also one of the most popular bands of all time for seemingly NO reason. Their live sound is/was a sh*tburger, and not in a good way. Thanks to their out of tune trainwreck of a live show, this album became a first-class cut/paste job by necessity. Here's the kicker: after all this, it still sucks. This begs the following question: how did Kiss enter the glistening pantheon of the assorted Zeppelins and Floyds of the world while other run-of-the-mill late-70s hard rock bands (ie, Kiss's equals) have vanished into the mists of obscurity? Your guess is as good as mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"kiss blows","review":"im not a kid, i just dont feel like giving info out a lot. i find it very funny that they had to add in crowds cheering, and that says something about the band. this band is as fake as they come. if it wasnt for their image do you really think they would've gotten so big? of course not.so dont waste your money unless you are a true kiss fan, and if so thats cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was dreadful then, it's dreadful now","review":"There are only a few great hard rock bands from the seventies. Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath come to mind. Kiss is not even in that league. It's showbiz rock and Kiss Alive is the perfect example of this.It's one crappy \\"live\\" album even though it has been revealed they pieced this thing together using studio enhancement. Many of the vocals and guitar parts (bass included) were re-recorded in the studio as well. Paul Stanley is on record admitting this.Buyer beware.Looking for a great live \\"HARD ROCK\\" album? See Deep Purple's \\"Made In Japan.\\"No overdubs, no edits, no fake cheering, just a great band doin' their thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Show, No Talent","review":"That pretty much sums up KISS.This is considered their best album, i'm sorry, but that is just sad. These guys needed to put out a live album or they were gonna sink as a band because their studio albums sucked @$$, they had no technical skill with their instraments, they had to relie on face paint and pyrotechnics to draw the crowds into their shows. I like 70's hard rock alot, but KISS was nothing but a foolish show with four guys dressed up like effing retards breathing flames. With no ability to play, it was like going to a circus to see the clowns intead of a rock concert. This \\"live\\" album was completely overdubed as soon as the master tapes were parked in the studio parking lot, the only thing untouched was Peter Criss's drum work. They sucked so bad live that they need massive studio overdub to make this sound right. How can you call this live when nothing on here was recorded live?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greasepaint and volume attempt to mask lack of material","review":"Do you this this good rock music?SUCKER!The band is techinally inept, poor vocals, plodding drums from Peter Criss, 1970's rawk guitar cliches courtesy of Ace Frehley,Paul Stanley's preening Long Island pout, and the crass, cynicalstylings of Gene Simmons, who, if not genetically blessed with an abnormal tongue, would be wallowing obscurity where he belongs.Even as a teenager, I realized this was nothing but smoke and mirrors. I saw Bon Scott era AC/DC open for them in the late70's, and they mopped up the stage with these no talent New York bozos.Spend your money on AC/DC \\"Powerage\\", or \\"Let There Be Rock\\".You think this is good rock?SUCKER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to Cheer About","review":"Kiss was one of the big bands of the late 70s, but there was one thing Kiss could never do. Put out a album that's subject matter wasn't all about getting drunk and rock n rolling all night. Most of Kiss albums contain at least three good songs and the rest of the songs are fillers. Saddly on Alive! Kiss delivers reptitive versions of their \\"Klassic\\" songs. Lets get this straight Kiss was not a good band, they knew how to market the product and take advantage of teen anger by creating loud repetative songs. If you like flashy, loud repetative songs buy this, if you want really good live music look right to the Who. The one star is the least I could put so I would really give it no starts, but I had to give one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid live album","review":"People say this sh t is one of the best live recoedings ever,yeah.YOU want a live album that shreds this to dust get CRYTOPSY,NONE SO LIVE and listen to a REAL LIVE ALBUM.Kiss are PISS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice remaster of a classic cranker","review":"The remastering is decent. It's not jaw-dropping, but everything is just somewhat clearer, and the bass and drums have better definition. It also sounds like a better tape machine was used, as the sound is somehow more stable. Still not great sounding, after all in those days the P.A. system was crude and fed back into the microphones. If you're a fanatic, upgrade, if not, skip it.As for the album, read others' reviews. I'll just say that I hadn't heard this in a long time and involuntarily jerked to attention when some guy drove by with his T-top open and \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\" BLASTING out of his car!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best live album of all time...","review":"This is the best live album ever made. The song selection is great and they sound much better live than on the previous studio albums. I'd recommend this to casual or new fans over any of their many compilations. Anyone new to KISS, or rock n roll music in general, should definitely pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Chords+ Crowd Electricity = a Classic","review":"One of my groups of Bud's in high school used to listen to KISS as a studio band before this Mega-Selling Double Live Album came to be. But we were the only ones in our school. By the time ALIVE! Was popular, KISS had taken over the music of my school so much that in my senior year, the Art Club dance, (the biggest non-prom dance of the year) the hall's were all Sci-Fi paintings, and an All KISS dance (local tribute band Justy Queet?) . I guess you had to be there, but it was very cool!I got out some of the studio stuff a while back, and it just isn't the same. However, the live sets on ALIVE are just as good as ever, with an electrified crowd, this is still an amazing album."},{"rating":"2","title":"more applause, please","review":"If you're under 13, this album may not be for you. If you think extra applause added to a live album ruins it, grow up and smell the hormones, and study a little marketing.If you are 16-17, male, and not too new-agey/progressive/politically-correct/feminine, etc. you will appreciate one of the finer live albums from the hard rock 70's.The songwriting is neither heady, nor intellectual. The schtick is heavy, just like the make-up. It's theatre, folks. Take it for what it's worth. As a raging adolescent from that time, an aficionado of all things Nugent, Aerosmith, ACDC, Zeppelin, Scorpions, UFO, Montrose, etc. etc. etc.As a teenage mutant non-ninja non-turtle making his first concert (1976) a Kiss concert, trust me: this album rocks; the people who were there were enthusiastic, and so were the ones they added after the fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"the hottest band on earth","review":"this is one of my favorite albumsany kiss haters out there have not heard aliveand it bothers me that the record companys send teenagers out to promote one hit wondersthis album is a must have"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Essence of KISS","review":"With three good studio albums under their belt, KISS decided that they needed to show the world what they were all about, and at the same time give their fans a memento of what a KISS show is like. At first it was considered a risk, but this is the album that put KISS on the map as one of the all-time greatest rock bands, and it proves that KISS along with Led Zeppelin basically invented what is now known as Heavy Metal.Every song on this double album is bursting at the seams with pure rock power. Every track is a classic, but the instrumental jam at the end of \\"She\\" is a pure sample of the KISS sound. It is a hard, jamming beat that not only proves why they are still going strong today, but also proves that Ace Frehley belongs on the short list of all-time greatest rock guitarists."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS WHAT KISS IS ABOUT!!!","review":"This is the one by far...at least in my mind it is...this was before the commercialism set in and were the baddest band in the land...this album captures the essence of KISS,four young guys from New York rocking your brains out of your head!!!

I thank them for that. But I wish I still had that special feeling for KISS : I've accepted that it's only the \\"nostalgic\\" element that draws me to listen to them now, and even that's a pretty rare occasion. Listening to Paul Stanley talk, it's obvious that he seriously considers KISS music to be as timeless as say ... the Beatles. What a laugh. But like so many mindless religious fanatics, fans of KISS would never even consider them less than outright musical gods ... Gene $immons thanks you all !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good album, but not \\"live\\"","review":"The only portion of this album that is actually live is the drum track. Everything else, and I mean everything was redone in the studio after the fact. Listen to Gene singing harmonies against himself on \\"She\\" or Paul singing harmonies with himself on \\"Hotter than Hell\\"...you can't do those things live. It's not possible. (At least it wasn't back then)...Eddie Kramer and Bill Aucoin have both stated that the almost the entire album was rerecorded in the studio using a audience backing track. It sounds good, but to me it's still a farce. KISS could never play that good live back in the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it live? Or is it a studio album?","review":"It is both of these. If only we could hear the REAL master tapes of these performances could we then and only then really judge this as a 'live' album. This is really 1/2 live album and a 1/2 studio album. Many of the vocal tracks were re-recorded in the studio. Paul Stanley and Eddie Kramer are on record admitting and even defending these actions. Some of the bass and guitar tracks were re-recorded in the studio for this album. Much of the crowd noise was re-done for this 'live' album. What are we left with? A mirage. This album is a misrepresentation of a live album. It is dishonest and does not represent KISS live. How can it when most of what you hear was done in the studio? Don't say this is the 'greatest live album'. It is not the greatest for the simple fact that most of what you hear was not recorded at the show. This is album is a legend based on a lie. I give it 1 star because of the dishonesty and misrepresentation of what a REAL live show is."},{"rating":"1","title":"KISS ALIVE.................IN THE STUDIO","review":"Okay, here's what you probably don't know about this \\"historic\\" live album, it's a complete fake. This has been an inside joke in the recording industry for years because of the tricks involved with this worthless junk. Here's what happened. When the tapes of the concert were being played back, the guitar playing and singing were completely off-key. The only sound they were able to salvage was the drumming of Peter Criss. Everything else was re-recorded in a studio with crowd noise and clapping added later on. The reason the tapes were awful is completely understandable, Kiss is a visual spectacle to distract listeners from the fact they can not play. The result? 30 years of fame and glory. Only in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abolutely boring","review":"There were several good scenes, but they didn't make up for the rest of the book.

Kind of sucks because had someone else done they wouldve added depth to the charachter instead of butchering it with woodedness. scattered throughout are scenery chewing characters.

There aren't any real hooks or sing-along type songs here. Kiss fans like it because we're Kiss fans!If you're willing to give it a few fair listens, it's actually a bit intriguing. The sound of the hottest band in the world completely alienating their audience! The best tracks are Ace's 'Dark Light' and Gene's 'A World Without Heros.'If you're new to Kiss, go for the ALIVE! albums, 1-4.

I own this album and always will, simply because it's a KISS record. The truth is....this blows big time. It's not useful for anything other then completing collections. This is the worst idea Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley EVER had. Ace and Eric wanted to do a heavy metal album to make up for the \\"Unmasked\\" disaster. Good ole Gene and Paul said \\"nope\\", \\"were doing a concept album!\\" The songs don't make any sense and don't connect. The concept seems very similer to the \\"Zelda\\" nintendo games. When this record bombed, Gene and Paul knew they had blown it again. This is the only KISS record that didn't at least go gold. They decided to do a good metal album and returned with \\"Creatures of the Night\\" in '82. By then, the fans were gone, and a good album went ignored. KISS would have to remove their trademark makeup to get their fans to pay attention in the 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG THIS IS LIKE A LOST GEM OR AN UDERRATED ALBUM!!!","review":"Says the KISS fan-boys now don't get me wrong i am a huge KISS fan i own all 3 of the KISSology DVDs and almost almost all their albums but i can never get myself to say i actually like this album. some of the songs on here are just crap and actually gave me a laugh when i heard them such as Just a Boy Mister Blackwell and I. But some songs are actually ALMOST passable as KISS songs and they are:A World Without Heroes (though the unplugged version is better)Dark LightEscape From The Islandand the Oathso bottom line dont buy this unless u are a hardcore KISS fan if not then check out their 70's stuff (as long as its not dynasty) and see if you like that"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM, NO MATTER WHO WROTE IT !!!","review":"MUSIC FROM THE ELDER is a fantastic concept album, no matter it was KISS who wrote it. The songs are killers, altough obvioulsy not written for FM consumption, what is a merit for KISS.

They ventured too far from what made them great during the 80's but they figured it out and came back from the brink. This is one that is kept purely for historical record by the hardcore fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"KISS MEETS FLOYD","review":"I am one of those die-hard KISS fans (I even have a KISS tattoo) who happens to LOVE this album! In 1981, when it first came out, after the departure of original KISS drummer Peter Criss, to be honest, I thought it was just too non-KISS. But, over time, and especaily with the CD remastering, I find it to be one of my favorite KISS albums. My only disappointment with the album is the song DARK LIGHT. In my opinion, the song drags on too much, especialy the lead solo. I get the feeling that Ace Frehley did not give his all and this song proves that. I have heard both sides of the hate it/love it saga. One of my closest friends finds it to be an unrealistic KISS record. He owns it, but he never listens to it. As a KISS fan since 1976, I am glad they only did this once. Yet, still, I feel this albums shines."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad for a KISS album...but not horrible.","review":"KISS and a concept album? The two just do not mix in my mind. The band was in such disarray and had no idea what it's identity was after Dynasty and Unmasked.Musically speaking, this album is very good. However, KISS fans missed the pure power of the songs and the diversion into this artsy-rock just doesn't work. Apparently, KISS felt the same way as they got back to their roots with Creatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good album","review":"so people moaned that this wasn't very kiss like. when i first got this the track listing was different (back in the 80's) i thought it was really very different but really good. sure this album isn't rock n' roll over or alive, but they'd already made those albums. the first half of the album is relatively mellow, but they are well written and recorded songs. the second half is not really very different from any other bunch of kiss songs. the now correct track listing tells a pretty good story and builds in intensity all the way through. i really like this album, and if it hadn't been a kiss album, many others would probably have liked it too. my fave tracks would be under the rose, the oath, i, a world without heroes and just a boy ... whatever, i think it's a really good listen on many levels"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfairly Bashed, It's The Songs That Count.","review":"Who cares if this album is a product out of time, as if from another era? It's the songs that count, stupid! This album contains good melodies, expert arrangements and production, and some very good musicianship. Kiss are smart guys. Give them some credit for trying something different. Even if this collection of songs never made it to a movie or rock opera, their light shouldn't be hidden under a bushel. Kiss made plenty of bludgeoning heavy rock and roll to last three career's worth. The fans who only want '... grunt rock' all the time should remember that Simmons', Stanley's, Frehley's (and the late Carr's) brains don't just lurk in their pants! Thank's guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated, But Great Album.","review":"I've never understood the dislike of this album expressed by Mr. Simmons and Mr. Stanley. No, it was not what people expected, but since they had the guts to create it they should have had the guts to back it. Yes, Ace Frehley would leave after this album, but he was on his way out anyway. It seems that Simmons and Stanley were trying to stop the Ace fans from jumping ship by agreeing with his assessment of the album and blaming it on Bob Ezrin. This was a mistake that I'm sure they are aware of, but won't admit. Gene and Paul are proud men and don't recant odten. From the first track to the last this is a great record. I play this when I want to shut down KISS haters. I put it on without telling them who it is. When they ask they are amazed at the answer. Many of my friends own this CD as the only KISS in their collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Elder [...]","review":"What is this [...] This album is horrible! I love Kiss so don't think I'm one of those Kiss Haters but this album is just plain bad. It's hard to imagine the same band that gave us great albums like Destroyer, Rock'N'Roll Over, and Love Gun could put out something this terrible.

It was the late 70s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety is the spice of life","review":"This ain't your traditional Kiss album by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not the worthless stinker that its reputation would lead you to believe it is. Kiss decided to indulge in experimentation by making a prog-rockish concept album, complete with a fantasy-type storyline and orchestral accompaniment. Even though I wouldn't rank it up there with King Crimson or ELP albums, I appreciate Kiss's effort to provide us with a bit of variety. And some of the songs genuinely rock, which doesn't hurt at all. I've always loved \\"The Oath\\" and \\"I\\" (although I'm not a fan of the last track's closing coda), and most of the other tunes are worth at least a listen or two. Although I wouldn't rank it up there with \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" I wouldn't dump \\"Music From the Elder\\" in the same garbage heap as \\"Kilroy Was Here.\\" It probably belongs in the same category as the Alan Parsons Project's \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" or Queensryche's \\"Operation Mindcrime.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average KISS","review":"This is my second replacement of the original 45!

But I must say this is a really good album. I heard it was a concept one, but never really cared-what I do care about are the songs themselves and how they sound. The songs are nice and the quality of sound is high. In Music From The Elder Kiss sidetrack a bit into progressive rock and that only does this album good. No track feels out-of-place, the album is nicely tied together.So, what's not to like?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the sex,drugs and rock n' roll?","review":"Gene Simmons took pot shots at Emerson ,Lake and Palmer for being too serious in terms of musicianship.Here,we have Kiss trying their turn at serious musicianship with less than stellar record sales.Not so easy is it guys?Kiss is an act ,that happens to play music.No serious musician listens to Kiss to steal licks or technique.They do however love to steal the business model that made these guys famous and rich.Kiss's stab at serious concept music is a bit like Stallone trying to do Shakespeare.Not a good fit.Their niche is party music that glorifies sex,drugs and rock n' roll.It may not play well with their egos ,but it does so with their bank accounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone's Different","review":"I personally think this is a terrible album that should never have been made.

I personally disliked it but they take a mature direction here and it's a more serious album rather than a typical hair/glam band. The songs are more progressive and melodic, nothing real heavy but it's not too poppy either. Overall, not a very accessible album like their early stuff but it gets better with age. It's good to hear something different and to know that Kiss aren't going to make every album sound the same album over and over. Fans that called it boring or disappointing have a bland taste in music and should be more open-minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally worth every penny of the .59 I paid for it....","review":"Not being a hard-core KISS fan, but more of an 'appreciator' of their earlier work, I was drawn to buy this album primarily after reading Ace's autobio.

Strange days indeed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock bottom!","review":"KISS had been singing about Rock Bottom since the start of their career, and they finally hit it here. The only good thing about this album is that it did so badly that it forced them to get their butts in gear and put out the hard-rocking Creatures of the Night. If this is your first KISS album, it will be your last (even if you like it, trust me they never sounded like this before or again).

Beware of different versions -- orchestration, pace, etc. -- this was the closest I found to the movie version. Was very pleased with Amazon's search; only caught \\"Por Uno\\" as the movies credits flashed by, but was able to search out a number of CD's with this song on them, listen to samples of various styles, and learn a little bit about tango musica ... really astonishing, however, that they did not put that song on the movie CD!

WRONG! So, ladies and gentlemen, if you are one of the people who would buy the True Lies Original Soundtrack CD just to hear THE TANGO, recreating the scene mentally while listening to your stereo or working on your computer, you will be disappointed.

Patterson says is true (and he backs it up with, among other things, 31 pages of shocking testimony by future Presidential candidate John Kerry's testimony in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committe in 1971), election of Sen.

The only factual error I found in this book was that the author wrote that F-102's were not in Vietnam. F-102's were in fact in Vietnam. George Bush tried to get an assignment flying F-102's in Vietnam but was turned down because he had not acquired 500 hours of training time that was required.

He credits his older sister and wonderful teachers who worked intensively with him to help him learn to read and eventually to become a respected scholar. McCabe has dedicated the last thirty years to working on literacy. This book is a quick, fun read that shows a good dose of humor helps in discussing serious topics such as dyslexia.

However, as some who is dyslexic and also a teacher, there are significant things missing from McCabe's perspective. While I certainly understand his anger at educational \\"experts\\" he seems to operate under the assumption that he is the only one who has ever experienced his circumstances or has ever thought of the things he's promoting, which is an incorrect portrayl of the history of LD education.

Just everything you need to know about finding the right college, and getting accepted there--while keeping your sanity.As a mom of two, I've read many, many college admissions books, but none cover the process from beginning to end as thoroughly as Admission Matters. The chapters on fit (yes, it is possible to be unhappy at Stanford!) and applying early are worth the cost of the book alone. The section on athletics as a \\"hook\\" was eye-opening.Sure, you'll still need Fiske's Guide or one of the other huge tomes that provide the lists and score ranges--but this is the book you'll want to refer to when you finally sit down with your kids to narrow down the choices and get the applications rolling. It's a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing resource for anyone with admissions question","review":"As a high school senior, I've been having the usual problems with finding a college that I feel is right for me, and then actually going about the process of applying.

Even though this is geared to the 3 to 6 crowd I enjoy watching them as my daughter has an inner Lola. I just see so many things about Lola that are so true to little girls in general. From her obvious adoration of her big brother to conversing with Soren Lorensen her imaginary friend. Her stubborness, her creativity, her innocence, budding independence and the \\"me-ness\\" most young kids possess. No one could be disappointed in owning this dvd, the stories are clever, not preachy, great animation, wonderful British accents (my daughter now drinks pink milk)and just a little different from everything else out there. If you enjoy the animated series, look for the books, they are witty, brightly illustrated, and when you read them you can hear the voices of Charlie and Lola. My daugher also hates to get her hair cut, and will never eat a tomato."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST gift for kids!","review":"I can't speak highly enough of the Charlie and Lola show and DVD's!!

If you don't have any finance software and have a Mac, Quicken might still be your best bet. But don't pay for an upgrade if you have an earlier version - you'll get zero for your dollar.

It rocks. Except that I now have no good way of keeping my finances organized. My Mac shipped with this pre-installed and I can't get along with it. I have fired up my old laptop and have reverted to MS Money 2002. I admit to being biased by familiarity but I consider it far superioer. I have accounts in the US and the UK which I cannot manage both together on Quicken. No problem on Money.

Buggy, hard to use?I think it's great that Intuit is shipping free versions of Quicken on the new Macs. It's a great opportunity to put a stick in Microsoft's eye. But they're squandering this opportunity with the quality of this software. I ran the conversion, and I'm going to stick with the product (I did however, evaluate several OSX-based financial software competitiors - who I won't name here) - but please, please, please Intuit put some more RnD $$$ and effort behind this software and bring it up to your usual high standards!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel Like Wasting Some Time?","review":"I have used Quicken since '92 or '93, and still prefer the polish of intuit to the alternatives available.

Unfortunately it still will not reliably run on my G5/X.4.2 - It requires a restart of the system, after which it will start only about a third of the time. On closing, it will not backup files and reliably will hang if I try to use it again without rebooting the system.

I don't do anything fancy - just keep track of my spending and catagorize my expenses, I hate to spend another $70 to just print out my checks .Maybe I will just handwrite them, since I pay so many things online, there are not so many to print out any more.

Quicken is impossible to move. Only about 2 of 20 accounts transferred during the import/export effort. GIven many of the same comments in chats, I've had to keep my WIndows version on a separate computer.

It will quit sporadically, but it appears to act as it should for at least a cycle after a check register entry.Well, I assume the \\"bug\\" was extinguished from Quicken 2007-Macintosh, but it is not. Another user has noted this and I feel vindicated! One Quicken representative admitted that he has seen this issue.This evening a female technical representative called and made an unsupported claim that \\"John\\" probably did not understand my allegation despite my email archive.

If you are recent \\"switcher\\" from a PC to Mac, take note that the Mac version of Quicken does not hold a candle to the PC version. They are quite different products.

It is still not possible to perform basic necessities like sort your register by 'amount' or by 'payee'. 2006 still also lacks the same effervescence the Windows version has, such as forcing you to type in your online balance and the current date when you reconcile. It will allow you to input your finances, but due to lack of features (and just plain laziness), Quicken for Mac still makes it very difficult to keep track of them once you've put them in.

The other financial calculators, such as the retirement calculator, have similar math bugs.Intuit technical support says that it is a known issue but they don't know when they'll fix it. Obviously it hasn't been a high priority since many math bugs have existed in Quicken for Mac for many years. I get the impression that Intuit doesn't work on the Mac version much. Some years ago they even stopped making Quicken for Mac until Apple paid them to hire a Mac developer. I'd choose another progam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the R4 Updater","review":"I updated from Quicken 2003 -- felt it was about time. The R2 version came on CD. I was immediately sorry: all calculations slowed intolerably, and changing dates became extremely sluggish.

Intuit released the R3 update with no noticeable impact, but then the R4 update put things almost back to normal.If you're running OS 10.3 or earlier, I can't vouch for the R4 version's performance. I'm currently satisfied, but still feel I gace up some performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for me!","review":"Although I have used Quicken since 1998, I am in the habit of skipping the annual update routine until I see enough new features to make the purchase worthwhile; thus, I did not get Q2005, but have been impressed with the enhancements (especially the online improvements) over Q2004.

Instead, you will learn about an elegant theory of self, meaning, and communication. You will receive a nice review of abductive, inductive, deductive reasoning, and the scientific method. You will also learn about Autism within the context of the above theories and ideas.I love this book because it helps me understand my autistic son, my normal neighbors, a sleazy used car sales person and everyone in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every box defective!","review":"I had to give this item one star but if there was a negative 5 star rating I would have chosen that. I received 6 boxes of lights and had already put four of them up before I lit then and discovered that only half of each net would light. I checked the two that I hadn't unraveled, and they were defective as well.A huge waste of time and a big disappointment. On top of that, it is sold by a third party so I have to deal with the hassle of returning them. Who knows if I will ever be recompensed or how long it will take.Although there are no reviews of the clear lights yet (this is the first) 2 out of 3 of the other colors have poor reviews because of this very problem. I am guessing that there will be many more negative reviews as Christmas gets closer. I am headed out to Lowes to replace them with a product that, if it doesn't work, I can replace before Easter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceitful dimensions","review":"As the box advertises the light net is SUPPOSED to be 4 foot by 6 foot. That is not the case. The net that I received measured to a pathetic 2.5ftX3.75ft when fully untangled and stretched out.

Alexis Bledel who plays Rory Gilmore looks like Jackie Kennedy, George Lopez Masiela Lusha, Dawson's Creek Katie Holmes and Hitch Eva Mendes. Lorelai is almost old enough to be her sister than her mother. Lorelai is thirty-eight but she looks like sixteen or seventeen. If she went to a nightclub a lot of people thought she was a teenager. Rory is twenty-four she looks fifteen and sixteen. What is Lorelai secret of being young, I never seen her lose a wrinkle, she where clothes a high school student would wear and she looks like a teenager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Awesome Season Yet!","review":"I can't believe there was ever a time that I thought that this show wasTOO GIRLY for me.

Definitely going to be investing in the remaining seasons in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great (Duh!)","review":"Gilmore Girls is a wonderful TV show, and this season is no exception. Some say that by this season they got tired of Lorelai's constant remarks and her fast talking, but I think that this season is one of the best. Rory starts her first year at college, which is obviously a big step, and also has an interesting love life in which we see a return of past boyfriends. Lorelai goes out with her father's business partner for a while, but someone else (who we always knew she would get together with) comes along in the end.... Also, she and Sookie finally open the Dragonfly Inn.The special features aren't all that good, but they are better than the other ones. There is, again, a \\"Gilmore Goodies and Gossip\\" and there's also an interactive trivia Stars Hollow quiz to test how much you know about Gilmore Girls. The last thing is called \\"Who wants to get together\\", which is a bunch of clips of the season's best love moments.I would definitely get this season if you have enjoyed the last ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Absolute Favorite Show!","review":"Gilmore Girls is altogether fantastic!

It comes in either black or white and is designed to look and feel like your standard tennis shoe. Comfortable and light, it's also economical, being one of the least expensive shoes in the Dexter line.If I have one complaint it's that the soles are attached by glue which, if you are one of those people (like me) who tends to slide your shoe off with your other foot, could cause the sole to begin to separate. Unfortunately I learned the hard way not to be lazy and just untie the shoe to take it off. As long as you take care of your shoes they should last for years.In my opinion the shoe is a great value for us \\"bowl for fun\\" bowlers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good place to start...","review":"if you are new to Joan Osborne but she is one artist that doesn't have an album full of \\"throwaway tracks\\", so you are better off just purchasing the 3 studio albums and, if you really want a bluesy treat, get the \\"Early \\"recordings\\" album.

They could do all of their songs a capella and they would still be wonderful. The interplay between the various vocalists on each track makes each entire song constantly exciting. Sure there are plenty of better funk and punk bands, but that's not what the Strangeways are. I'd put them (and this album) in the top tier of modern traditional ska, only a slight notch below Hepcat and the Slackers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"west coast style modern trad ska","review":"this is one of my favorite ska albums still to day. and this is after 150 ska albums. if you like hepcat, but want something more modern, this is it. the only thing wrong with this band is that they didnt release enough stuff. check out stubborn records for another release by these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"can love outweigh desertion?","review":"Judd liked to live \\"single\\" even though he was married. Lanni was a needy wife who needed validation and Judd to stick to her like glue. Judd was unable to meet Lanni's expectations and ventured out on his own -- leaving Lanni and their small child, Jenny. Lanni gets her life together and Judd decides to walk back in (2 years later) telling her that he will be taking Jenny to his childhood home to visit his dying father -- Lanni has a choice to make, she can come with them or send Jenny off with her father alone. Is his father really dying or is it a ploy? Can there ever be anything real and lasting in their relationship? Has Judd changed his ways?**This is one of Debbie Macomber's earlier works and although it was a good book, I can honestly say that she has improved with years. I enjoyed the story line as it kept my interest. It was more sexually graphic than I like (and more than Debbie's recent books).

In reality, their is no strategy you can come into a fight with and expect to win.

It is easy to apply and the results look sharp. The reflectivity is on par with road signs (if that's a good comparison). The only knock against it is that the tape isn't 100% consistent in thickness and some of the edges weren't smooth, but that got better further along in the roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed guide for the advanced explorer","review":"The book offers detailed information on many of DV's back country features. Mileages given are very accurate and are useful in locating geographic and historical sites. The most referred to DV book I own. Only drawback is that since 1995, many of the roads have been closed by NPS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Introductory Guidebook","review":"For a general introduction to DV and several of its scenic roadways, unpaved roads, and hiking trails, it's not bad at all. Of course, you always need a good topographic map(s) of the park as well, and the latest information from the rangers, as roads wash out, and trails become blocked or impassible. Only a fool would explore DV, even by car or 4WD, with only the tiny maps in a guide such as this.While motor vehicle travelers can get by with plenty of water, a full-size spare, a recently checked-over vehicle and proper caution for remote areas of the park, inexperienced desert hikers would be well advised to acquire some additional knowledge on trip planning, equipment, first aid, and map reading. An excellent resource for this is The Ultimate Desert Handbook by Mark Johnson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for explorers!","review":"We planned a week exploring around Death Valley based on this book. Not visiting the touristy places that you can find on any map, but exploring canyons that don't get nearly as much traffic. Maybe it was partially because the book hasn't been updated in awhile, but the descriptions of the places were wildly different from what we found on the ground.This guy was a Superintendant there for a few years, and thought he'd write a book -- big deal. Coming out of one canyon where he described springs all over the place but we found only rock, we met some people who had another guide that was much better -- sorry that I can't remember the name. Anyway, my advice is to look around, and buy something else -- and something with maps in it, for one thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"the second half is a gem","review":"If you survive the first half with his delicious absurdity, your reward is the second half, on the scenes when he teams up with his \\"carnal\\" Marcelo singing American, Cuban and Argentinian music, but ending with a very Mexican serenade. If you ever saw Jorge Negrete singing in a movie you'll laugh to tears when Tin Tan sings. And with the lighting effects, you can see actual flashes of Jorge Negrete until you hear him singing.

I find it interesting to read about the stuggles that the characters face such as spirituallity, love and hate, life and death, and most importantly the problems they face when it comes to self-realization. I strongly recommend this book to the patient reader and to anyone looking for a book with tremendous wisdom."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been different","review":"This book is mediocre. The layout is fine, quite attractive. But the contents are obvious. One can hardly believe that somebody needed to write a book about it. There is nearly no insight.

First it does not live up to its claim to present \\"advanced\\" material. Instead we find material that all of us thought about in the early days of our study and training (and then with maturity, we moved on).The second reason I gave this book one star is that it is another example of Wicca as a \\"make it up as you go along\\" system. If that's what Wicca is, then why are we looking to authors to inform us when what we can make it up ourselves just as well as they can!?

As soon as I opened them, I knew I had made a mistake. I should have looked at the pictures better! On most/all of Paris' jewelry, the crystals appear to be glued on, they are NOT set with prongs. This means the crystals will inevitably fall out at some point, and from some of the reviews of her other jewelry pieces, they sometimes ARRIVE with crystals missing.The fact that this so cheaply made would not bother me, if it weren't for the ridiculous prices of her items. These earrings should cost twenty bucks AT MOST. But for $40, I expect not the best quality, but at least decent quality!They are very cute, I like the design. However I just can't get over how this cheap crap is getting priced so high, and this is one of her \\"cheaper\\" pieces.

Too mixed up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different voice for LeCarre","review":"I've read most (if not all) of LeCarre's novels, and I appreciated the different \\"voice\\" in this one, and the fact that it's more of a standard murder mystery. The preface by the author regarding the process of writing was especially compelling, as it gave color to his other books as well. A pleasant, quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong Opening","review":"I've set about reading the John le Carré collection from start to finish, and as his first book this is a strong introduction to George Smiley and an interesting, fast moving tale. It's almost simple compared to some of the later intrigues, but in that there's interest by itself. You can take this book either as the opening to le Carré's work, or a good page turner of a mystery novel in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intrigue, deceit and hidden secrets.................","review":"Call For The Dead is the first in a series of \\"George Smiley\\" espionage novels by John Le Carre. This is a classic spy novel set in the 30's where agents are recruited from within foreign countries in order to enable the use of a \\"mole\\" within a foreign government.In this story, George Smiley remembers his recruiting efforts and the surprises that would confront him years down the road.When a simple investigation leads to the death of an interviewed man questions begin to arise. Is someone manipulating the facts to make it appear to be a suicide, or was there a deeper secret in the man's past?? George Smiley must know the truth even if his life is on the line.With intrigue, deceit, and long hidden secrets this novel will entertain even the most sophisticated espionage fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb story","review":"A great novel, and an ideal introduction to Le Carre and George Smiley. Gripping, atmospheric, and morally ambivalent almost all the way through. A satisfying and thought-provoking read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to the character of George Smiley","review":"This book, which came out in 1961, introduced the war-damaged figure of George Smiley, who had already been abandoned by his wife. The writing is sharp and evocative and already we can see what makes Smiley so valuable to the spy service and why he is so crippled inside. The plot is a tad lacklustre -- a top civil servant with access to secret files is found dead just hours after Smiley talked to him on what was supposed to be a friendly vetting exercise. It looks like suicide but Smiley isn't so sure and the more he investigates, the more suspicious the death becomes. There are a few too many convenient coincidences but there's enough in this work to keep you moderately gripped until the end, although those without a deep interest in the Cold War might find the storyline a tad dry. Given this reasonable start, it's surprising therefore that Le Carre then produced the very disappointing Murder of Quality as his next work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very important short stories","review":"I am a seventh grader, and this book is part of our course reading. There are some wonderful short stories in it, ranging in difficulty in both the fluency with which the story was written, as well as in the vocabulary used, for example, the difficult vocabulary in \\"The Masque of Red Death\\" by Edgar Allen Poe. There are quite a few important, famous, and memorable short stories in Little Worlds, including the infamous story, \\"The Gift of the Magi,\\" as well as, \\"The Necklace\\" and \\"The Monkey's Paw.\\" But, I do warn you, the book includes some very controversial, yet famous stories like, \\"The Lottery.\\" Overall, I must say that Little Worlds is a truly wonderful book with exceptional story selections.

But soon a cat is telling him he must hurry up as he is falling behind and will lose his way. He starts following all the signs, even when they become very confusing and often contradictory. Soon his life seems like a chore or task to stay on the path and stay caught up with others. But all along he is becoming less and less happy. Then he wanders from the path and starts to find an enjoyment in nature again.It had been a few years since I read a book by Peter H. Reynolds, when his book Ish came to mind. I tracked down some of his newer books and was really impressed with both the stories and the illustrations. I love Reynolds, who has a very distinctive style of illustration, often minimalist in the extreme with just a small drawing in the center or each page without having to cover every page from edge to edge.

I got so tired of lotions that felt great when I put them on, and an hour or so later it was as if I hadn't put anything on at all. Then I found Camille Beckman and this stuff leaves my skin feeling great for hours. As mentioned by another reviewer, you need to let this soak in for a few minutes but after that the effects last for hours. I keep one jar by my bed and another at work. You don't need to use much so a jar lasts a long time.If you have dry skin and have been looking for something that lasts longer than an hour or so, give this a try.

Living in Chicago, the winters can dry skin out so badly, especially the hands. For me, this is the best hand cream I'm found. I've had no cracked hands whatsoever since I started using it - and really, that's a miracle!! My hands used to crack by my nails, thumbs, and in between my fingers - not anymore! I'm also a very frequent hand washer, and it still moisturizes perfect despite that.My only wish was that it didn't have parabens. This isn't 100% natural, but many of the ingredients are natural (glycerine, aloe, oils, etc.). I normally won't use anything w/ parabens or propylene glycol, but this worked so good that I have made an exception. I will only use it in the winter, however, because I don't want to be exposed to those additives year round."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glycerine Hand Therapy","review":"This stuff is simply great for anyone who has dry skin problems.

It's February, but my hands smell like Spring! (And they feel better!) I highly recommend -- it's only been on my hands for about an hour, but the fragrance is still there, not overpowering, and really, really perfect. Will update review if necessary.

I even listened to the song samples here at Amazon before writing this review and I have to admit they still sound terrible. Many people say this is their best album, but I actually think KISS Love Gun is a little better, because the previous albums were awful.I respect all the KISS fans, but I think they are one of the most overrated bands in history. Other 70's bands were years ahead of KISS and had much better albums than Destroyer.

As I grew older, I stopped listening to a bunch of their catalog because it wasn't as strong. This album, though, is top notch, yet I had also stopped listening to it much because it has a few of the tracks that you hear ALL THE TIME on it.Well, this remix is so well done it's like hearing these songs again for the first time. The vinyl edition is nicely packaged, and sounds phenomenal. It doesn't sound like a new album, but it just sounds better.I only wish it had come with a download code.

If you think this cd provides value to your life, then by all means, buy away...else, stay away...UPDATE!!! Because of the obvious manufacturing flaw in Flaming Youth, I decided to return this product for a refund (and rightfully so). I guess I Won't Get Fooled Again Who style.And one final note: Ezrin mentions in the liner notes to consider this a face lift.

Honestly, I think my original cassette sounds better!Wasn't expecting lots of \\"extras\\" or \\"bonus tracks\\". I was just expecting a kick ass version of one of my favorite albums, so I could crank it up and rock out. Even the cardboard that the album cover was made with is thin and cheap.The 180 Gram reissue of Alice Cooper's \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\", also produced by Ezrin, sounds fantastic!

Bob Ezrin's writing was very, very cool. The never before seen pics were super, and the cd itself looks awesome. I imported it using apple's lossless setting for maximum punch. I could drone on about each and every track, but if you know the album, you know the deal. There are a few differences from the original....you'll know when you hear them.

If you havn't actually listened to KISS, then this album is the one for you. These gods of rock i think probably fit in with guys like Black Sabbath, or maybe Led Zepplin.

Half way through Detroit Rock City, I was done w/ the album.I don't know to what extent Ezrin is responsible, or whether it was the privilege of the mastering engineer to butcher the album (I suspect so), but the result is nasty. Way too much compression, way too much limiting - some nasty artifacts and distortion - over-accentuated high frequencies, and so on.Which is somewhat surprising considering how refreshingly light-handed were the remasters of the original Kiss albums, including Destroyer.My take on it - if you care at all for the actual sound quality of the album, buy the original.

If it hits, the band stays. If it misses, the band fades quietly away. After \\"Alive!\\" KISS found themselves in that position. Fortunately, \\"Destroyer\\" is a break-away album, far superior to the live effort that first got them notice. Aside from the fact that this is the first KISS album to feature actual production values, this is also KISS's only album to feature some downright mature songwriting. Sure, songs like \\"Shout It Loud\\" are nothing more than the rock and roll romps it intends to be. But songs like \\"Detroit Rock City,\\" \\"Great Expectations\\" and even \\"God of Thunder\\" are more solidly written rock tunes than what had come before from the band. They're certainly not high art, but they're darn good heavy rock and roll. The fact that 5 or 6 of these songs are STILL staples of any KISS show proves how important this record is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me............Anusha","review":"The songs themselves are pretty decent. There is only one song that doesn't appear on other albums called \\"The Party's Over\\".

They could have at least reminded people of where Lit were when they made \\"Tripping the Light Fantastic\\". That album shows that they are much more than just pop tarts, and I don't think you'd ever say that with a straight face about the album.In addition, they add two variations of songs; the \\"Happy in the Meantime\\" remix, which doesn't add much from the great original (one of the few standout tracks on \\"Atomic\\") and an acoustic \\"Down\\".

I look forward to any new books written by Ms. Cornwell which include the family and friends of Dr. Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little better than watching paint dry.","review":"Not really a novel, more like a few concurrent episodes from a soap. It killed a dull afternoon though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The surprise in Hornet's Nest is that Patricia Cornwell wrote it. Not much focus, too many characters, too much background on trivial ones, no development of interest. Read as if it was a collection of ideas for a new series, trying to note threads and details to be used later. Not very professional compared to her past books. Loved Hammer, couldn't care about Brazil, West, Goode, Cahoon. Very one dimensional."},{"rating":"1","title":"abominable","review":"This is unbelievable dross. The characterization is non-existant and the writing is utterly dreadful. Cornwell's books have been in a quality nosedive after the excellent first two. I guess she finally crashed."},{"rating":"1","title":"hornet's nest of a brain","review":"How disappointing. An investigative reporter who \\"decompensates\\" when his stories are being hacked, instead of finding out who did it? A cat who gives a clue by dragging wet panties and a five-dollar bill on his mistress' face? Gimme a break.There's only one fairly well-developed character in this entire book (Hammer), and even she isn't entirely believable. This book is a mess, and not worth the money or the trees killed to print it. PC didn't even bother ending it -- it just stops. Is PC decompensating? How else to explain why such an ordinarily fine writer allows such a mess to be printed? And her editors should be ashamed of themselves for allowing such a reputation-destroying book to be published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who decided to publish the first draft??","review":"I've been enjoying Scarpetta (although I was annoyed that Cornwell ducked working out the emotional issues by just having her love interest die \\"off camera\\") -- but what is this mish-mash? Some of the individual scenes were very well written, but overall the book was sprawling and lacked direction. It also sounded like an unfortunate attempt to capitalize on \\"The Cat Who . . .\\" (which I can't read), and an unsuccessful attempt to capitalize on Rita Mae Brown and Sneakey Pie (which I love). By the way, has Patricia Cornwell ever actually seen an Abyssinian? They look like miniature mountain lions and have wonderful golden eyes, not crossed blue eyes (that's a Siamese)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire your editor","review":"I have read and enjoyed PC's previous books, though felt that the quality was trending down. The Hornet's Nest was a particular disappointment. There were glimmers of good writing but the plot was meandering and far-fetched. Some of the characters had realistic and interesting roles, others were flat and unnecessary. This novel lacked direction, tightness and most of all, good editing. Patricia, your editor should be doing better by you! If you are being pushed to publish tell them to back off! We will wait. So, please, take a vacation, refresh yourself and keep writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I've been a big fan of Patricia Cornwell and looked forward to this book.

Hope the next one is an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who really writes Patricia Cornwell's Books","review":"There is no way Hornets Nest could be written by the same person who brings us Kay Scarpetta. I couldn't even finish the book and I've read all her others. I figure either her regular editor quit, or her publisher rushed it out and no one actually read it. Thankfully I borrowed it from the library. It really should have a warning label: \\"This book is an insult to your intelligence.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hornets Nest Stung Where the Sun Dont Shine","review":"Patrica Cornwell severely missed the point of Volunteer Police Officers in this tale of Crime and Drama. Surprising since she did such a wonderfull job on all the Kay Skarpetta novels.

Hopefully the next Skarpetta novel will bring her back to the basic Police realism we have come to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inexcusable consumer rip-off!","review":"What a huge disappointment for me and my husband; we enjoyed Cornwell's other books and feel that both she and her publisher took leave of their senses in bringing forth \\"Hornets' Nest\\" to an unsuspecting public.

At last, at last, Cornwell has come up with characters who are LIKEABLE. Andy Brazil is downright endearing, and Chief Hammer is the character Kay Scarpetta wishes she could be. A lot of people have complained that \\"Hornet's Nest\\" looks like a book written by a completely different author. I have to agree, but not as a complaint. It looks to me like Cornwell has finally learned to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE Patricia Cornwell?","review":"What more can I add to what others have said? This book has to be one of the worst I have read in a long time. The plot is laughable (particularly the bit about the cat!), the dialog is false and the characters are totally unsympathetic. I love the Kay Scarpetta books, and have real trouble believing this one is by the same author. Are there two Patricia Cornwells?

The book seems to have been written to meet a deadline - the story is flat, the characters are flat and the editing is nonexistant!Either this was ghost written or Cornwall has a multiple personality disorder and this personality never took an English or Composition class. Cornwall seems to have forgotten everything she learned about run-on sentences, syntax and punctuation.Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I originally bought Southern Cross and dropped after page 10, then decided to give the first book of this series a chance since I love the Kay Scarpetta Series how different could this one be, but a fan can do so much.

Perhaps I started at the wrong end of her literary scale. The book title and jacket cover had me expecting an intellectual thrill ride. Instead, what I got was a boring and aimless exploration of three characters who were about as intriguing as a dead goldfish. I kept waiting for relevance to the plot to emerge. Then, after fifteen chapters or so, I realized there was no plot. The actual crimes that appeared to be the point to the book were in fact an afterthought - the story could have been condensed down to two paragraphs like you'd find on page eleven of the Metro section. I did a better job of getting to the point (and making a point) when I was in fourth grade. This was a waste of several hours of my life that I'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to the world of novelized soap operas.","review":"While there is nothing wrong with a well established mystery novelist writing two or more different serials concerning completely different sets of well established characters, Cornwell is obviously demonstrating at her fans expense the fact that she can't handle it. With this novel we have her rather sickly version of a soap opera in print. It plainly doen't work. First of all, a mystery novel is the wrong place for a soap opera. Secondly, Cornwell doesn't even clean up the soap opera's act well enough to make it worth the effort. And thirdly, who does Cornwell think she is insulting our intelligence with this nonsense?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I'm not alone......","review":"I am so glad not to be alone in my dislike for this book. I re-read it (gasp) because I thought maybe I didn't like it the first time because I was disappointed not to find Dr. Kay and the others there. Not the case.

I kept picking up better books and wondering if the book would get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"i love cornwell's work but hornet's nest is a BIG exception","review":"i love the scarpetta novels. the fast paced novels always keep me guessing. also, it is easy to identify with scarpetta's constant struggle between her personal and professional life. so when i discovered hornet's nest i was thrilled to find a cornwell book i had not read! never in my life have i been so disappointed in a favorite author. my mind felt soiled after i muddled through the pathetic book. i am not even going to bother reading southern crossHowever, i decided to give her another chance with her newest scarpetta--black notice. Cornwell is back on track (thankgoodness!) and i enjoyed it immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! This Book Was Too Nasty to Finish!","review":"Yuck! This book is waaaayyyy below the standard that Cornwell set for herself in the Kay Scarpetta series. It's badly written with characters that are so nasty and disgusting that you want to take a shower when you put the book down. I couldn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sell-out","review":"Patricia Cornwell is a great author, as I have read all her books that preceded this. I was ready for a change from Kay Scarpetta, and kept an open mind - however this book just slagged on and it seemed too much like what I call the Microsoft Word macro 'what would a cheesy bestseller author say now' was in full-force. Like another one of my old faves, Dean Koontz, this novel was chock full of 'plug ins' that are rampant amongst the bestseller 'read em quick, I am going to keep you up, here comes something sleazy' disease. I am NOT an arrogant 'I don't read bestsellers' person, as I look to books for entertainment as opposed to the mass wasteland of TV - however I hate to see great authors stoop below what I think they are capable of - there is nothing like a great book - and this is one that is good, but only if you have nothing else left in your bookshelf to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell missed the mark on this one!","review":"I was disappointed in the story and found it slow and almost slogging at some points. I did not feel that the characters were well developed or that the dialogue was real. She usually does such a good job of letting us into the minds of her characters and I feel this was lacking in this particular book. Not her best effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex, and good","review":"I felt that this book had the greatest combination of action and personal issues.

I too was very disappointed by this recent Cornwell novel. Most people are saying that she should stick with the Scarpetta character. I personally don't care who she writes about, I just want her to write how she did before. It is kind of refreshing to start a whole new set of characters but the writing just wasn't her usual style. There was too many small story lines and no big surprise at the end. I almost put the book down at page 210 but I couldn't make myself do it.

From now on, I'll stick to reading it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of hard earned money!","review":"A GREAT disappointment! No hint that this book did not have another Scarpetta adventure for me to relish. Plot weak-character development lacking. Makes me hesitate to buy her newest book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment to her Kay Scarpetta fans!","review":"Although I appreciate an author's need to expand her creativity by branching out to other story lines and characters, I must say that this was not the proper vehicle to do so.This is one of the few times that I have not been able to get \\"into\\" a book. Usually I can somehow manage to continue once I get started. However, the main problem with this book is that it is just \\"plain boring\\" and you somehow cannot associate with it's characters.It is amazing that Ms. Cornwell who does such excellent writing with Kay Scarpetta could not seem to get \\"into\\" these new characters herself and do them proper justice. Perhaps she identifies more with Ms. Scarpetta as do her fans. If so, she would be wise to bring her back or bring more of her old style to these or other new characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell Pens Police Yawner","review":"Patricia Cornwell, author of the tautly written Kay Scarpetta series, turns her focus to police fiction, and the result is an exceedingly dull Harlequin Romance reject. Character development is strictly black-and-white, perhaps in keeping with the police theme. Her Police Chief Hammer fairly walks on water, while we have other cartoonishly one-dimensional characters, such as the mayor, who is concerned only with the serial murders' effects on tourism (He wants the sainted Chief Hammer to report a 105% rate of closing crimes.) The list goes on: the eager cub reporter, the grizzled night editor, the female cop who rose through the ranks. Worst of all, Cornwell forgets to have a point to all this. The murders serve only as a backdrop to a sloppy half-baked romance, and the whole mystery comes to a rather abrupt conclusion, almost an afterthought. Suspense, drama and even crime are almost entirely lacking from this so-called thriller. Stick to Scarpetta ... please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell should stick with her Scarpetta series.","review":"Being a fan of Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta series I was very disappointed in this story. I read this book and was unimpressed with the characters. It seems to be lazily written. Cornwell should stick with her Scarpetta series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I have been a huge fan of Patricia Cornwall. This book, however, seems to have been written by an entirely different person. Filled with annoying, unrelated, wandering detail, it's the worst kind of writing you'd expect to find in a sophmore english class. The characters are cartoonish, the plot simplistic and utterly incredible. It goes on and on in agonizing mediocrity, with no hint of redeeming prose, for 377 pages.I've heard myths of publishers pasting the names of established authors onto manuscripts of lesser scribes. Now I believe it.Save your money and your time--if you have nothing else to read, RE-read a Scarpetta novel and should you have the misfortune of acquiring THIS book, save others like me from the dismal fate of exposure; compost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Paper","review":"Having been a Patricia Cornwell fan for quite some time, it pains me to say Hornet's Nest is one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters are interesting, but there is no story line present for them to reach their full potential. As I read this book, I often wanted to throw it in the trash, but I stuck with it in hopes it would improve. It never did. If you are considering reading this book, DON'T. Buy one of Cornwell's other works. You will enjoy them. This one will leave you with nothing but frustration, disappointment, and a slight headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Terrible!!!!!!!!","review":"I was given this book by a co-worker who said it was great. What a terrible recommendation (and book). I have not read anything else by Patricia Cornwell, and I don't plan on reading any more. This book, which is supposed to be a Crime thriller, reads like H.S student's attempt at drama...the plot is absolutely boring and most of it does not have anything to do with crime. The worst part is, however, Cornwell's \\"all knowing\\" narrator style. I mean, she tells you what everyone is thinking...including cats and even God! Also, her use of \\"at precisely the same moment\\" sounds, again, like a teenager trying to build suspense...terrible book. Too much like a Harliquin Romance....Don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible disappointment.","review":"After reading this novel, I had to ask myself \\"why was this ever even published?\\" I've enjoyed Cornwell novels immensely over the years and was horribly disappointed in this piece of rubbish. Set in Charlotte, NC and centering around the local police force trying to catch a serial killer, the characters are simply flat and as a whole evoke no emotional response from the reader. The plot is childishly simple and not specifically engaging. This is not a true effort from a highly talented writer. There are many much better Patricia Cornwell novels. Forget this one and go try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad can it get?","review":"Having read all of Cornwells previous books, I can't tell you how disappointed I was with this book. Maybe I've just gotten too comfortable with the Scarpetta/Marino characters, but those two characters are the only reasons why I even bothered to continue reading Cornwells books.I tried to read the Hornet's Nest, but couldn't get into it..too many damn women and just not the same feel as with \\"Scarpetta\\" novels...wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Flop in Charlotte","review":"I'm an avid reader of mysteries and after finishing Patricia Cornwell's Hornet's Next, I haven't read many as bad as this. The characters were whiney and insipid and the plot was very slow to develop. After wading through this book hoping things would imrpove, the ending was a complete bomb. I haven't read many Patricia Cornwell books, but all that I have read were much better than Hornet's Nest. Think I'll stick with Hillerman, Hiaasen, Grafton, Evanovich, P.D.

She told me that it was just okay for a Cornwell novel, so I just let it sit on my bookcase until just recently. I read it in just a few days and I really enjoyed it. I believe that people are looking at this book and expecting your typical Kay format. I believe that Ms. Cornwell developed her characters extremely well with some great baggage to haul with them from chapter to chapter. If the reader just scans the book without taking the time to see the big picture, they are likely to agree with many other reviews.

Eliminating alien possession, the opinion here is that in an effort to now capitalize on her fame and growing fortune she has dusted off something she wrote in college (high school?) rewritten portions of it to update and foisted it on an unsuspecting public.You can tell in the first 10 pages where Cornwell Today went back and updated Cornwell of Yesterday. her description of Charlotte is obviously written now, yet wedged in among paragraphs she wrote years ago.What's next a short story from grade school"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Abominable","review":"I bought the audio version of the book because I have a long commute to and from work and listening to books on tape \\"usually\\" make my rides more enjoyable. NOT THIS TIME! At first I thought maybe it was the reader (Chris Sarandon) and I apologize for all the terrible things I thought and said about his reading. Now I realize it was just the absolutely abominable text he had to work with. Since we now know that Ms. Cornwell is gay, I think the fact that she was trying to write about male/female relationships was the major problem. In the Kay Scarpetta books, it's the murder to solve, not the relationships that take center stage. In this book, it's husband and wife, male and female relatinships that she concentrates on and obviously she doesn't have a clue. Instead of providing me with relief from stress when driving this book raised my blood pressure to dangerous levels.

While engaging enough for me to finish it, Iwas left disappointed. In reading this genre, I preferthat the underlying mystery be the central focus of eachstory, with some compelling characters providing theconnecting thread between novels.Here, PC seems to be performing an experimentin establishing new characters: take a set of stereotyped,sexist, characters from a 30-year-old novel, reverse theirgenders, and let them bounce off each other for a while.The characters didn't work for me, and with theunderlying mystery given a low priority, neither did thisnovel."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you enjoy Patricia Cornwell, don't read this one.","review":"I hope we will someday learn about how this novel came to be written AND PUBLISHED. It has several elements of her other novels, but I am of the opinion that this novel had to have been written prior to the novels that gave her the fame she deserves. This one should never have been published (except maybe posthumorously). It may have served as a writing exercise to vent her emotions and feelings, but is more like a pallet of soap boxes.

The book has almost no plot as it wanders aimlessly till the end and is filled with ridiculously named people throughout.

What an incredible loser. Just reading about how this eager beaver kept losing weight and had to switch back to his high school clothes made me cringe.I wanted someone to slam a fist into his too-pretty face.And I was mad at Virginia West for getting involved with this baby boy.Seth's flesh-eating disease was a nice distraction from the rest of the crap this book contained, but it wasn't enough.

If you have read other books from P.C. you would think the this book was not written by her. The books on Dr. kay Scarpetta were much better and she should go back to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth finishing","review":"I am glad that I am not the only one who hated this book. I read about 1/3 of it and I just couldn't find a reason to keep reading. I, like most of the other reviewers, love the Scarpetta series. I am not thrilled that so many people have revealed that Benton dies. I have not read the last book. Thanks for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst writing Patricia Cornwell has released.","review":"Nothing else need be written. If her new book, Southern Cross, (same setting and same characters) is anything like the Nest, we'd better take up a collection for Pat. She's going to need the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book completely disappointed me.","review":"I bought this book, without even checking to see if it was a Scarpetta novel. That was my mistake, but even so how was I to know that the characters would be unlikeable and completely annoying. I did not make it through half of this book, where I normally read a novel in a couple days. I loved all her other books, and I am sad to say this novel is a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, too long, disjointed, undeveloped plot","review":"I felt this book was too long - by about 150 pages. The plot was very disjointed, hard to follow and not very well developed. I found too many staements that were incorrect. Worst book of hers I ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"I am a big fan of Patricia Cromwell, and I found it hard to believe that this book was written by the same person. It was so tedious and poorly written that I didn't even finish it. I kept debating whether it may have been her very first attempt at writing that she published now or one written by someone else. Even the sale price is too much to waste on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book by Patrucia Cornwell, aweful, can't even finish","review":"This is absolutly the worst book by Patricia Cornwell. Did she really write it or hire someone else to write it for her? How can the same person who wrote such books as Cruel and Unusual,All That Remains, etc. also wrote this horribly boring and disjointed book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!!!","review":"I am a huge fan of Patricia Cornwell's and have barrelled through all of her books with Dr. Scarpetta. I just finished reading Hornet's Nest. It was awful. No resemblance at all to the quality of her other books. The entire book revolves around Andy Brazil who is a boring nobody with an alcoholic mother. There are never any climaxes. I finally forced myself to finish it today after struggling over a month to read it. The end was nothing!!! Totally frustrating that I wasted so much time trying to finish hoping the end would justify the boring body. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Save your money and time and stick to Dr. Scarpetta stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 for two","review":"I read one other Cornwell book, Point of Origin, and I thought it was bad. But this one really reeks. There is no real plot at all, and her flip-flopping focus makes it hard to figure out what (if anything) is going on. I kept waiting to see which of the \\"elegant, beautiful, older, intelligent\\" women, one the Chief of police & the other head of investigations, the 22 year old blonde adonis would end up with. What a waste of time. The characters were unrealistic, the situations implausible, and the plot(?) boring. I find it amazing that Ms. Cornwell continues to be a \\"popular\\" artist. Frankly, I think I'd rather have a stick in the eye than have to suffer through another of her \\"novels\\". I got nothing from this book. I learned nothing new factually, I gained no insights into people, I got NOTHING. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm a huge fan of Cornwell, from her historic romances to the Scarpetta series to the FBI series so this was huge disappointment. The points of view from so many different characters were distracting. I didn't like the characters. I kept stopping to ask myself, \\"What the heck am I reading? Is this really written by Cornwell?\\" Do not waste your money on this particular book. To keep it simple, I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An attempt at something different, with fair success","review":"It appears that Ms. Cornwell was trying to write more of a psychological novel than her previous mysteries. In doing so, she expanded to the points of view of many more characters, in a sense showing that what one sees and assumes is not always correct. She perhaps went too far when she included \\"the Almighty\\" in her characters! The regular characters were not developed enough, especially in regard to history. The murders seemed to take a back seat and were solved incidentally (and would not have been solved otherwise). This is such a radical change from her series about Kay Scarpetta that it feels disappointing. However, I did finish the book without too much difficulty. I applaud Ms. Cornwell for attempting a new approach, and wish her the best of luck in exploring what are clearly some of her own issues.Melissa Lenihan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed, difficult to follow, a sad disappointment","review":"I have read her every book with great enjoyment.

Three hours in line & several chapters into the book, I had serious doubts about this novel and my decision to attend my first-ever book-signing. The characters in Cornwell's latest novel failed to capture my interest. Unlike earlier novels with Kay Scarpetta , Lucy, et al, Hornet's Nest's characters are flat, lifeless and simple. Even the villian, \\"Pumpkinhead\\", was a big yawn.While I was open to Cornwell's desire to expand and explore other characters, I was dissapointed in her failure to develop these new characters sufficiently. I never came to care about Andy, Judy or Virginia. I became increasingly annoyed with that damn cat!But, like a devoted sports fan, I eagerly anticipate her next novel and will reserve final judgement until I'm convinced that \\"Hornet's Nest\\" wasn't just a fluke"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Man, I paid twenty bucks for this????","review":"I'm a Cornwell fan, and I feel I'm using the wrong tense. \\"was\\" might be more appropriate, after reading Hornet's Nest. Theories abound on the writing of this stinker: it's an old Cornwell unpub dredged up to meet a deadline: Cornwell didn't write it; Cornwell wrote it but Didn't write the Scarpetta books; ad nauseam. But the scariest theory for me is that Cornwell wrote it and thought it was Good! Second scariest theory: Cornwell suffered an attack of hubris, and felt anything she wrote would satisfy her adoring public. Wrong. Very wrong. This one is dreadful. Sorry I wasted my money. Leave the procedurals to McBain, who I now appreciate even more after reading an unsuccessful procedural. And finally, one last theory -- previous critic NTSH10(above) is really Patricia Cornwell"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who really wrote this thing?","review":"I have four speculations about the origins of this book: 1) Cornwell is suffering from some malady that caused her to be unable to meet her deadline, so she had it ghostwritten, 2) It's really her first novel, written when she was a promising high-school senior, 3) She was tripping the whole time she was writing it and consequently put down every thought that fluttered through her mind without regard to plot, pacing, characterization, or good sense, or 4) She convinced herself she was writing an experimental novel--part wry comedy, part stream of consciousness (it's hard to keep track of just whose, since the point of view changes faster than Seth's hip measurement), part police procedural (I don't know--do police really proceed in this manner?). The book is certainly readable, occasionally fun, and bold in the sense that in it Cornwell breaks every rule her writing teacher tried to teach her"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"If this was PC's first book it never would have been published.Whatever was going on for her that she needed to set it on paperproved a big mistake.

Now, that I've read it, I see why the book was available. Word must have gotten out that this novel was not worth the trouble. I've really enjoyed Ms. Cornwell's other books (up until \\"From Potter's Field\\"), but her writing is really going downhill. I get the impression that this book was only published because she's a big-time author. If this book had been by anyone else, any editor/ publisher in their right mind would have refused to read it. It isn't just the plot (what plot?) that I object to, it's the writing style! I only finished the book because I wanted to see how much more fragmented and choppy the paragraphs could get.

I found the tone of \\"Hornet's Nest\\" both offensive and laughable with her preoccupation with the scourages of women over 40 and their amazing ability to always look all-knowing, beautiful, and more powerful (Batman and Robin)than every man in the book. Even the murder victims were these \\"weak\\" men. Several times I had to try to remember what the plot was...it was like \\"Oh, by the way, there is a killer lose in the midst of all this muck and mire of characters.\\" Very disappointing effort by Miss Cornwell"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best work of this fine writer","review":"Hornets Nest was a disappointment without the trials of Dr. Kay Scarpetta.

His shrill and strident speech is grating, the bad southern accents are horrible, while the background music is discordant and poorly timed. I was really glad to be done with this recorded book.

I was expecting the novel to be an interesting and exciting read, however, found it to be convoluted and often times confusing. I finished the book only because I felt I had to give it a chance to get better. It didn't. I would suggest that Ms. Cornwell stick with Dr. Kay Scarpetta - she has found her niche there and has yet to disappoint in that area (let's hope she never does)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the characters, hate the book","review":"It seems to me that Cornwall divies up Dr. Kay Scarpetta's character to create Judy Hammer and Virginia West. I enjoyed them, and while I am clear on their eating habits, clothing preferences and fast food obsessions, I never got to the core of what made these characters tick. They were enjoyable none-the-less.It is the sloppy, poorly conceived and terribly paced story line that destroys the experience. The book felt as though it went directly from legal pad to printing press with no editing or revision. I am a recent Cornwall fan and have read most of her oeuvre since September. They have been spellbinding, well-paced and consistently innovative. Hornet's Nest was none of these. I feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst novel I've ever read!","review":"This has to be a book written by Cornwell when she was high school. It's juvenile, absolutely preposterous, and numbingly boring. I didn't expect a Scarpetta look-alike when I picked it up but I also didn't expect to read such drivel. I was so glad that I checked it out at the library instead of spending any money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hornet's Nest","review":"While Hornet's Nest may not have the intense drama that Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series has, it does have character development which I feel is missing from the Scarpetta series. Cornwell has created two strong, driven female police officers in a gender reversal as the main male character appears to be the more sensitive and feeling character. She has laid a foundation in Hornet's Nest which will give the reader a better idea for character motivation in following novels. It is nice to see characters that are portrayed in a more human way rather than the caricatures that have populated the Scarpetta novels of late. Good Job Patricia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. And I do mean *bad.*","review":"While reading this book, I spent a great amount of time flipping to the cover to make sure it really was a Patricia Cornwell book. I enjoy her Kay Scarpetta series, but before I'd read 20 pages of this horror found myself wondering how the woman who writes them could possibly have written *this.* The characters are without exception shallow stereotypes; the dialogue is frequently painful; and there quite simply is no plot. And if there is some sort of unwritten rule about how many different points of view one novel can contain, Cornwell broke it with bells on. I forced myself to finish it by some sense of obligation, but when the last sentence was finally read it had been quite some time since I'd cared even remotely whodonit (and, as it turns out, a good thing, too). Potential reader, beware: Cornwall as you know her this most certainly is NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncompelling, and hard to want to pick back up","review":"Could not get into this book.

She should stick with Kay stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual good work","review":"This is one of the worst written and thinly plotted bestsellers I have ever read. Patricia Cornwell has written some fine books, but this departure from her Kay Scarpetta series does not deserve to have her name on it. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot has more holes than a pierced teenager, and I still am trying to figure out what Cornwell was trying to do with that cat. Read the Scarpetta novels, but stay away from this clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like psychic cats, you'll like this book by Cornwell.","review":"Cornwell introduces new characters in this detective novel. The writing style is a rat-a-tat Dragnet clip which I found extremely hard to read. The characters are total stereotypes, with most of the women \\"good\\" and most of the men \\"bad\\".

It never did, except for the fact that I realized that no editor ever put a hand to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big mistake to exhume this one....","review":"This bears so little resemblance to Cornwell's assured, suspenseful Kay Scarpetta titles that I have to conclude it's maybe her first novel, the obligatory learning-experience make-every-mistake-in-the book one that most wise writers consign to a bottom drawer and leave there. To cash in on the Cornwell craze it seems some marketing genius decided to dig this one up and foist it on her unsuspecting fans. Bad move. Presented as juvenilia it might be sort of amusing, but passing this off as mature work can only hurt this writer's reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a great disappointment.","review":"If this were my first Cornwell book, I doubt I would ever buy another.

Unfortunately, it seems that another author is cranking them out so fast that they don't bother to write a REAL story. This book jumped around so much you wondered why she didn't write three books that would focus on the 3 main characters. Also, very incomplete story line.

Having lived in Richmond I was, until now, an unabashed Cornwell fan. But, is Hornets Nest a first novel written years ago and brushed up and just now published?

Don't waste your time reading it"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Not a Dr. Kay Scarpetta mystery !","review":"With dust cover references to Dr. Kay Scarpetta, and nothing to say she wasnt in the book, I erroneously bought the book. I finished it, it was not a riviting, put everything else aside mystery like the previous Dr. Scarpetta stories. The style was different, broken up, and a little dificult to follow at first. The style was so different from the forensic novels, I'd almost venture someone else wrote this book, because even the sentence structure seemed odd, not like before. Authors have a right to change style and characters. There should have been a big warning label, \\"No Dr. Scarpetta in Here\\". This may be a good novel. I however was looking for a forensic thriller, this was not"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Ms Cromwell could not have gotten this book published if it were her first.

In the beginning the stories were fast-paced, exciting and you couldn't wait to get to the end. Hornet's Nest is the worst of all; minimal plot, characters come in and out every few pages, having little to do with moving the story along. It almost seems they are fillers, just taking up space. I'm disappointed in Hornet's Nest and disappointed in Patricia Cornwell. I won't buy any more of her novels"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful","review":"How I wish I'd read the reviews here before I shelled out for this dog.Like many others, I've enjoyed Cornwell's other books and was delighted to see a new one out, so I snatched it up. Halfway through page 2 I decided it was either ghostwritten or an unpublished (and unpublishable) first novel tossed out to capitalize on Cornwell's current popularity. Whatever its provenance, it's a wretched offering: The style is laughably unprofessional, the characters are irritating, and the dialogue is thoroughly unconvincing. I don't mention plot because there isn't any. Should have used the $20 to light a cigarette."},{"rating":"1","title":"When did she write this?","review":"Many of us take to the bathroom to read - usually magazines that don't require long periods of time to digest detailed facts and serious plots. I think maybe that Ms. Cornwell wrote this in short little bursts - maybe in the privacy of the bathroom. Few of the ideas or original or well developed and the characters are blah! After Cause of Death, I was prepared for something less that stellar but I wasn't prepared for nearly nothing.I've always been amazed by Ms. Cornwell's technical knowledge but in her last two offerings, that too has faultered. In Hornet's Nest, cops are always using their \\"scanners\\" to keep up with their work. True, some police cars use scanners to monitor other types of activity - but seldom their own. The use tranceivers, trunked radio systems, and that kind of stuff. None the less, Ms. Cornwell obviously needs a rest - maybe a long one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally Disappointing","review":"Perhaps the problem was that I read Southern Cross first. I thoroughly enjoyed that book, and picked up this one in hopes of gaining more insight to the characters and the general Brazil/West/Hammer story line. What a disapointment! The plot was riddled with inconsistancies, parts where you wanted to know more were cut short, others were drawn out way to long, and sometimes you were just teased without anything happening. Not a total waste of my time, but the book needed a good editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fascinating departure from the gory world of K Scarpetta","review":"I found \\"Hornet's Nest\\" to be an interesting look at the heart of issues for women in position of authority, as well as an absorbing read. The characters had professional and personal depth; each personality realistically portrayed. There were no major mysteries requiring plot twists and surprise endings. It was simply a close and surprisingly accurate psychological treatment of females in traditionally male positions. The scrutiny, the resentment, the suspicion (and the reality) of sex on the job were \\"dead on\\". Ms Cornwell did a fine jnob on this one, proving that it isn't a bad thing if a writer departs from the familiar. I'm hoping to see more of this cast of charaters"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!","review":"Having read several of Cornwell's books in the past, I was anxious to start this one. I'm so sorry I ever picked it up. Every character was so stereotypical and contrived, I wanted to throw up. The whole book was like a very bad cartoon. And the ending was a total mess!! The worst of it was the ridiculous notion that Niles, the cat, was not only interpreting the criminal goings on at USBC, but was trying to get his powerful(NOT!), no-nonsense(confused, hormonallly challenged) owner to understand his three syllable meows (which of course she does) and the meaning behind him dropping panties and money on her face as she slept. What the hell? The only thing worse would be a movie from this script. Or a follow-up novel. Or warts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched and frustrating.","review":"I wish I'd read the other reviews before I picked up this book. I love the Kay Scarpetta novels. And was kind of excited to see Cornwell branch out into something new. But this book didn't work on so many levels...it's hard to know where to begin. My biggest criticism, I guess, is that there are just too many points of view here to support a cohesive, gripping storyline. Cornwell gives us a glimpse into the thoughts of every character she introduces--no matter how insignificant their role. As a result, it's nearly impossible to follow any one plot, or care about any one person. Now I'm not saying that every book must have only one POV, but most of these characters are two-dimensional, stereotypical, and do nothing to help the plot along. Nor do they provide any insight into the human condition. A very awkward and unrewarding reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hornet's Nest","review":"I have read all of this author's books and this one was a disappointment.

I would hope that no one reads this book first because they may never pick up another one of Patricia Cornwell's books and that would be a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What? 0 stars not allowed?","review":"My wife and I were astonished by this book. Then we saw Cornwell interviewed on TV and she essentially admitted that it was a number of college writing assignments glued together. The glue doesn't hold water. Worst book I've read in 5 years. 'Used' to like the Scarpetta novels but I think her newer Scarpetta books now show that she - uh - probably needs to go back to school."},{"rating":"1","title":"I stopped reading Cornwell after this book","review":"I was a huge Kay Scarpetta/Patricia Cornwell fan, until I read \\"Hornet's Nest.\\" The new characters introduced in this book are exasperating and unbelievable. Andy Brazil is a whiny, egotistical, self-centered brat; Virginia West is supposed to be so talented and accomplished that she earns a top job in a police department, but for some reason decides to risk both her job and her life to cater to his idiocy. The author wasn't able to make me understand the motivations behind West's actions, and the resulting unbelievability rendered this an excruciating read.The Scarpetta books were so engaging. This one was so absurd. I read it all the way through, hoping that it would improve as it went along, but I was disappointed. It's difficult to believe that the author who created Kay Scarpetta was the same author who came up with this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hornet's Nest","review":"All I can say is do not waste your time. I have no idea why I finished this book other than the fact I like to finish what I start. I swear it took me 6 months to get through this book. I is not like her usual books. It goes off on too many details that felt dragged out. I just plain did not like it. Terrible book and there was really no surprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for hardcore Cornwell fans","review":"I was disappointed in this book. The story never seems to take off and grip you the way that the Scarpetta series books do. Perhaps many of us have been spoiled by the excellent plot and character development of the Scarpetta series, but - like many others - I found this book to be disappointing and slightly tedious. Still love Cornwell's writing, but if she wants to carry on with this character, the next book will need to be a major improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, shallow eratic characters, and a rushed ending.","review":"I admit that I like the Kay Scarpetta novels, and also like Ms. Cornwell's writing style. I had high hopes when obtaining this book that it would be the start of a new series of characters. I was not only disappointed with the characters, but with the pace and story line as well. Over all, I hate to say bad things, but this novel is frankly not even worth reading. Doubly so when you have the opportunity to read the Kay Scarpetta book which followed the release of this novel. A scary moment, there, when first opening the new Scarpetta novel where one wonders if the writer has lost the magic. This is apparently not the case, as it seems that 'Hornets Nest' was simply just a lousy book! Every writer should be entitled to a few though, so what the hell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you must read borrow it from the library","review":"I've read a few of Cornwell's other books and enjoyed them. This one, however, is awful. The characters are contrived and the plot ... well, what is the plot? I've read poorly written books before, but I put this one down at chapter five. Don't waste your time, but if you must, then please don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am a huge cornwell fan and was definitely disappointed after reading Hornet's Nest. It lacks a plot and it seems as if the ending was rushed. A definite waste of my time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I started reading Cornwell novels in the last few weeks. I enjoyed two of them, and then I read this one.The book is difficult to follow. In several instances you are in two or more people's heads in the same paragraph.The main focus of the novel is that a young reporter gets to work as a volunteer police officer. Many crimes are committed, and all of them seem incidental. The characters are put through agonizing relationships with very little if any resolution.One particular character that overcomes hardship throughout his life is reduced to self-destructive behavior because of the smallest setbacks. It feels out of character.I am hard pressed to remember one male in the novel that had redeeming characteristics. They were either self destructive or chauvinistic.This novel is extremely disappointing. Do yourself a favor and pass it by."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not even worth one star","review":"It's a good thing that Cornwell wrote other books before getting this one published ---- or she would have seen the rejection slips pile up. The characters were cardboard stereotypes, the dialogue unbelievable, and the plot boring. What a waste of my time. It's an incredibly bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rating of One Star is Generous","review":"Much to my dismay, this was not a Scarpetta story, nor did it carry the same pizzaz and appeal. Like so many other comments written here, I agree the book was simply not worth reading and a major disappointment. Come on, Ms Cornwell, we all know you are capable of much greater things - you deserve 20 lashes with a wet noodle for this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow","review":"Not as good as her other works. I can figure out who is the murder victim after reading 3/4s of the book. It is like she is trying to weave in a love story but it is not working."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I couldn't finish!","review":"I have read most of Ms. Cornwell's books and was very dismayed to find that this was not a Kay Scarpetta novel. Not that there's anything wrong with an author writing a novel out of series. The problem with this book was that it was simply awful. I didn't care for any of the characters and found it very difficult to read. I stopped reading midway through, which is something I've only done once before."},{"rating":"1","title":"A struggle!","review":"The constant switching between storylines could have worked if the stories had gone somewhere. Each time I picked up the book hoping to find the trademark Patricia Cornwell style, I struggled through a few more chapters til I had to rest. I was looking forward to getting to know a new group of characters, but instead I learned more about guns & ammunition that I ever imagined I'd need to know. I'm a staunch fan so I will keep on reading her books. Maybe next time will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not one of Ms. Cornwell's best. Hard to stick to.","review":"Being an avid fan of Ms. Cornwell, I have read all that she has in print so far. The Hornet's Nest was hard to \\"get into\\" and stick with unlike her other books that won't let you put it down. I, however, can not wait to see what she does next. I will always read her books for just that reason. She does need to stick with her medical examiner though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of Patricia Cornwell Novels","review":"As an avid Patricia Cornwell fan, I expected the full character and plot development that this author has used in her other novels. This book had no character development, and a disjointed plot. It doesn't read well and I wonder if Patricia Cornwell even wrote this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hornet's Nest role reversal","review":"I agree with most of the other posters that this book is a waste of time. It surprises me that no one else seems to have mentioned what I thought was a fairly obvious gimmick used by Cornwall. She reversed the sexes of her protagonists. If the male characters were female and vice versa you would have a very traditional thriller format. If there had been something interesting going on this role reversal might have created some excitment, but unfortunately Hornet's Nest has zilch.I think Cornwall needs a better editor, her last few books have lacked focus and her characters have been more irritating than engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Plot?","review":"I was looking forward to new set of characters from Cornwell. Frankly, Scarpetta was getting a little too grumpy for my tastes. Boy, was this book ever a letdown. The main characters were ridiculous (although well-dressed and gorgeous!) The minor characters were just cardboard cutouts of people. The author seemed content to just describe their actions and random thoughts without any specific purpose in mind. The ending seemed tacked-on, as if after 200 pages of meandering prose, Cornwell became tired of writing about these hollow characters (I know I was tired of reading about them!) and felt the need to wrap it up quickly. Maybe she had a deadline. I'm just happy that I didn't buy the darn thing! C'mon Patricia, you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very strange affair","review":"This book reads like Cornwell got a hefty advance and subcontracted the writing to an adult literacy class. A stunningly bad book, the pacing is truly unreal, and the ending is as abrupt and anti-climactic as any I have ever read. Only interesting for the increasing openness of Cornwell towards issues of sexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters in search of a plot","review":"This book held promise, and I enjoy when a writer steps out of the familiar. Unfortunately, Cornwell should go back to thrillers. This was a collection of (mostly) cardboard characters in search of a plot. There was little character development, no threads tying it together, and the ending was ludicrous. I lent it to a friend and she says she will never forgive me or trust me again. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing -- A Real Sleeper!","review":"It took a two-week vacation to get a third of the way through it. I've read most of her other books and have usually finished them in two to three days. I don't believe that I'll ever finish this one. It was slow at the start, but I kept thinking that it would get better -- NOT! My biggest regret is that I purchased it, instead of checking it out of the library! I hope this is not the start of a writing slump, as I really do enjoy her work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big waste of Time!","review":"Not only did this book have a very weak plot, but the writing was horrendous. I expected much more out of Cromwell. The characters lacked believability and I felt no connection to any of them. Sorry to see Cromwell join the ranks of Crighton, Grisham, Koontz and King."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than a disappointment","review":"I have been a loyal reader of Patricia Cornwell's books and I have never been more disappointed in a favored author. Patricia's tight writing style and well-rounded characters are simply nowhere to be found in Hornet's Nest. I am hoping this was a momentary abandonment by her muse and not the disintegration of a previously excellent writer. For those of you who read Hornet's Nest but have not read PC's previous novels, I implore you to read her other books. You will find wonderful characters that you grow to care about, or at the very least, wish to come across again. Unfortunately, the most interesting character in Hornet's Nest was Niles, the cat, although he apparently over-indulged in the catnip near the end of the book. Sorry Patricia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this a draft??","review":"I agree with the general drift here of Cornwell's Hornet's Nest. It pales next to her well-developed Kay Scarpetta novels. The novel has a rough-edged, unfinished quality to it -- not to mention that the plot is all over the place -- and I wonder if her publisher insisted on getting this book to print way before Cornwell was ready. I respect her effort to try something new, but in the future I hope she sticks to her guns and doesn't publish before she is ready. She can do much much better than this, as Cornwell fans are well aware."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I couldv'e rated this book a 0 I would have","review":"I cannot believe how horrible this book was. I kept waiting for it to get better and it only got worse. I wouldn't waste my money on this-I wouldn't even take it if someone gave it to me for free! I have always enjoyed Patricia's books in the past and she needs to stick to Kay Scarpetta!!! The Dr. Scarpetta books I don't want to put down-Hornet's Nest I didn't even want to pick up! The only reason this book was on the best seller's list was because of Patricia Cornwells past performances-not because this was a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Use it to start a fire!","review":"This was my first -- and last -- Patricia Cornwell book. I kept reading it thinking she would develop the characters further, but nothing ever happens. Even the motives of the killer aren't delved into. This could probably be an excellent book with some further character and plot development, but in my opinion she needed to fulfill her book contract and chose to do it with this piece of junk. Not worth the paper it's written on. Too bad, too, because the *potential* is there for an excellent story. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to her writing??","review":"I got lost after the first 20 pages, too many characters that meant nothing. Her other books were so much better that this. What a disappointment!! Hope her future books are not like this one. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"put this one in the litter box!","review":"Since getting hooked on Patricia Cornwell by accident while traveling, I can barely wait until she publishes another book. I would have preferred to wait longer, and get something better. There's not flow to the book, I didn't feel anything for any of the characters, and though I read the entire book, there was no resolution. I'm annoyed that I wasted my time and my money on this one, as are all the people I've spoken to. I especially hated the focus on the cat - how ridiculous can this get? I don't know what Patricia Cornwell was trying to accomplish here, but I hope it doesn't happen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who REALLY wrote this book?","review":"Don't judge the author based on this boring book. Her others are great!! I plodded through about 150 pages of this thing before I finally realized it was NOT going to get better & threw it out. I really can't believe this was written by Patricia Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending smelled like last weeks dirty diapers!!!","review":"Give me Dr. Kay. I like not having any fingernails. Didn't sleep with a ball bat after I read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not kay Scarpetta but still good","review":"Having read all novels by Patricia Cornwell I must say that she is doing a great job, no matter what character she describes. After all the Kay Scarpetta novels she probably had to write about something different, one can burn out and not write about one and the only person all the time. Many readers will miss kay in this Novel, but do we as readers want to limit an author as to what she writes? Great job Patricia - keep writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bewilderingly stupid","review":"I had my hopes up for this book, just BECAUSE Kay Scarpetta wasn't in it. I've always thought that the Scarpetta series is vastly overrated. But was I surprised! This book was infinitely worse than any of the others I've read. For a while I thought it must be a satire, but in the end, I had to face that it's just plain bad, with cardboard characters and a totally unbelievable plot. The worst part is that I was given this book for my birthday by a very dear friend, and I'm desperate to come up with something kind to say about it :-/"},{"rating":"1","title":"A plotless and pointles novel.","review":"The book has no real plot; the serial killings are secondary to descriptions of two rather unbeliveable female police officials and one immature male reporter (also fantastically \\"beautiful\\")!

Just not her quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must have read a different book, I thought it was great.","review":"Everyone is tearing this book apart. They keep comparing it to the Kay Scarpetta novels. If they would quit trying to compare it and read it for what it is they might enjoy it better. I thought it was a refreshing change and the characters were nothing but shallow. They were deep in a subtle way. I feel that she allowed us to form our own opinions first then find out who they really are. I enjoyed the book very much. I can relate to the things going on in the book. It actually made me have to think instead of just saying here this is how it is. Quit comparing apples to oranges and enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time/money","review":"Patricia Cornwell seems to have joined the legion of book a year authors who started writing excellent, intriguing books and who wind up cranking out one a year regardless of content.

Not up to her usual standard at all. Pretty awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patty's Gone Round The Bend!","review":"Maybe we should blame the publisher's credo, that in the mystery genre, one must write and publish one sequel per year to be successful. Cornwell's first 3 or 4 books were new, exciting and passionate, but then she started to slow down. In Hornet's Nest she comes to a parade rest. Worse, it's obvious she doesn't know WHAT to write about. Personal agendas jump out at you from every alley and crime scene. Plots start and stop like the 5:22 local to Patchogue. It's probably a cliche to say the characters are cliched, so how 'bout shallow and underdeveloped. \\"Quit while you're ahead,\\" would be good advice to authors like Ms. Cornwell, Mr. Ccichton and Ms Anne Rice, whom she seems to be stalking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Therapy for Patricia?","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this book. Patricia was obviously using this book to reflect what was going on in her life at the time of the writing. She was so into showing that people are not always what they seem, and that different people may have differing opinions on another person. There was no plot to speak of, just pages upon pages of character development. There was no real end to the story, either, it felt like falling off a cliff, without the actual fall. One minute you're there, the next...I will definately read her next book, because Patricia Cornwell has shown me time and time again what a great author she is. However, if there is no Dr. Kay, I doubt I will read it (unless it's from the library and I'm desperate)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!!","review":"Hornets Nest is the second book I purchased by Patricia Cornweel and I just don't get her popularity.

Her brilliant observations are wasted here in confetti like bursts about random characters who pop up and never appear again. The novel lacks plot structure and anyone with whom to identify - except perhaps for the reverently described but unidimensional female police chief, Hammer - and she is not really involved in solving the main mystery - a series of murders which is set up in the beginning - and then abandoned for pages and pages of wanderings. I kept with it, hoping for a miracle. Wish I hadn't. Bring back Scarpetta - and a plot - please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hornet's Nest - not so hot","review":"I've read almost everything Patricia Cornwall has written, and I must say that Hornet's Nest was a big letdown. I can appreciate her moving away from the Kay Scarpetta character, but this book just didn't fly with me. They main story line was good, but the resolution to the crime was weak at best. I felt that there were too many issues jammed together to provide good thriller reading. The cat's pseudo-psychic abilities proved to be a rather lame attempt at bringing closure to the various issues which had popped up in the story. Immediately upon finishing the book, I wanted to send Patricia an e-mail - I felt that her editor and any manuscript readers working for her had let her down in allowing this book to fly as-is.

The characters were not fully developed and made it impossible to make any type of connection with them. The story skipped back and forth so much I found myself constantly turning back to earlier chapters to try to figure out what was going on.

What an ordinary, unbelievable tale!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst Books Ever","review":"I've read almost every one of Patricia Cornwall's books and this book is simply awful. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it (and I always finish a book). She should stick with the Kay Scarpetta novels. Not that going off series is a bad thing, but this book just didn't engage me at all. If you're a Kay Scarpetta fan, don't read this book. You'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This was the first Patricia Cornwell book I read, and it made me decide to never read another one of her books (thankfully I changed my mind later). It is confusing, has too many dead ends and unanswered questions. The Andy Brazil character must be schizophrenic he has so many conflicting personality traits. The relationships between the characters goes hot and cold at the drop of a hat. The search for the killer is haphazard and slow. He might as well have jumped out in front of them and said \\"I'm the killer\\" at the end. Essentially the plot was stupid and the book frustrating to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hornet's Nest","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell's books, but was disappointed with \\"Hornet's Nest.\\" Dr Scarpetta was not in it which was a dissappointment in itself.

She has the talent to do much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this??????","review":"As a faithful follower of Patricia Cornwell's work, I was not only surprised, but utterly disappointed with this novel. Who really wrote this is what I want to know. Cornwell's Scarpetta novels had me up all hours of the night. I finished all of the books in this wonderful series within one week. It took me a total of five weeks to choke down Hornest's Nest. Cornwell cruises through hyper-space with her lights off. The serial murder plot was there, but so distracted by Brazil, West, and Hammer's off beat problems that never really did tie into the story line. Each paragraph was never over 15 lines long, and each one contained a different story it seemed. Needless to say, this novel was very UN-Cornwell like. I highly doubt that I will even attempt to swallow Southern Cross. I'll just sit back and wait for The Last Precint, which I know will once again put Cornwell on top of the readers lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the Kay Scarpetta books","review":"Anyone noticed how many name-brands are mentioned in this book?Is Cornwell getting paid for product placement? Brands are not a feature of her other books, first time I noticed them.

Then I actually started reading the story. Some reviewers have mentioned that they thought this was all a big comic opera of a police story, and sure there are some funny bits such as Bubba gluing his hands together. But the sadness of the alcoholic mother, and the relationship between Hammer and her husband isn't at all comic.And for the love of God pick a point of view!! Jumping all around from the main characters to every single insignificant character as your point of view is just irritating, unless it's done well and for a point. And don't get me started on the cat. Man oh man.Overall: YUCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My favorite author has completely bombed out.","review":"Unlike Ms Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta novels which are real page turners, filled with emotion,Hornet's Nest leaves me lost.

This one is just boring. It's a lousy police novel,is not the least exciting, has no interesting characters. Add to this a complete failure to tell anything interesting about women-officers in a man's world. The only thing in this book that makes me happy is that I borrowed it in my local library so I didn't have to buy it.Anyhow, one star is a generous mark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you win some, you lose some","review":"I love all of Patricia Cornwell's books -- which means all of the Kay Scarpetta series. This one, though, was just flat. It was missing a plot, snappy dialogue, etc. It really reminded me of a first effort from some kid starting out as a novelist. I don't think Cornwell is a bad writer -- on the contrary, I think she's excellent -- but this book was most definitely NOT one of her best efforts. Try again, Patricia."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever read!","review":"I've never been so bored in my life as when I was reading Hornet's Nest.

Songs like deuce, Detroit Rock City, and Love Gun are complied into one large Cd. All of the songs are worth listening to. Personally, i think the cd gives you a bang for your buck. However, Beth is sung by Peter Criss, whom doesnt have the best voice for the job (I preferr Eric Carr's version).

But word to the wise, don't start off your Kiss collection with this album, it full of remixes that sound too discolike, too soft. The reason I bought this album was because it looked too cool, I mean who wouldn't buy and album with a completely platinum design. The first thing I thought when I bought this was, is this Kiss, one of the heaviest bands in history? If my friend didn't suggest I buy Alive, I would've never knew what true Kiss sounds like. Alot of people actually suggested this album, but a person should start with the normal version of a song, then listen to the remix. If you want to start a Kiss collection, buy Alive, not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think this over.","review":"I have always had a problem with this album. Shout It Out Loud should be on here instead of Do You Love Me, Christine Sixteen should be on here instead of Cold Gin, and Shock Me or Plaster Caster should be on here instead of She. Also why is there no material from the band best album, ALIVE? Also when Neil Bogart asked them to re-record -Disco-Strutter, they ruined a classic song. Many of they remixes suck like Calling Dr. Love or Firehouse. This and many others make you ask yourself if you want this or you are getting it to complete the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"KISS- Double Platinum, terrific album","review":"This is, to me, one of KISS's finest releases. As I've grown up I've heard too many people bad mouth KISS and I call these people \\"musical snobs\\". They tend to listen only to things like progressive rock. I like KISS because they played from the heart. Yes, the music is not be technically superb in most ways but they did have some very original ideas on this CD like the guitar playing of Ace Frehely and the little boy voice- very cute. One of the finer songs on the CD is \\"Hard Luck Woman\\" written by Peter Criss. Peter is a terrific drummer. He's no Carl Parlmer but then Carl Palmer was no Peter Criss. If you like hard rock and want to add to your audial history from that repertoire then you may just want to get a hold of this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Platinum 'Hatchet Job'","review":"With the release of digital remasters, Paul called this one a 'hatchet job'.... and rightly so. The songs are great, except for the Strutter '78 because of the disco type drumming (c'mon, this is supposed to be a hard rock classic)... but the sound is trash, esp. noticible on Deuce, 100,000 Years, and Love Gun.... for being digitally remastered, it's really muffled, badly....

I'd have to say that this is Kiss' second best, with the standout cuts 'I Stole Your Love', 'Love Gun', and 'Christine Sixteen', as well the song that introduced the world to Ace Frehley's voice: 'Shock Me'.

There are no anthems a la FLAMING YOUTH or SHOUT IT LOUD. No wacky conceptual numbers like GOD OF THUNDER. OVER is pretty much one song played over and over again about lust and ... lust. The group got its act together for one last gasp on the follow-up, LOVE GUN. That album at least boasts the strange ALMOST HUMAN and the slightly crazy cover of THEN HE KISSED ME. OVER gets two stars only because its one basic idea is pretty catchy and more fun than, say, Eddie Money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure '70s","review":"Much better attempt than DESTROYER, this one rocks a little more, and doesn't try to be so big-budget like DESTROYER. Though it seems to be a little overlooked, this is probably one of Kiss' best '70s albums. \\"Mr. Speed\\" is an awesome song. And \\"Hard Luck Woman\\" is probably the best rock ballad I've heard in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"See you in your dreams\\"","review":"This is my favorite KISS album, even though I don't even like all the songs. This is the one album that has the catchiest collection of songs on it. It's all Gene and Paul here, as Peter's (written) contribution is typically weak, though I've read that he said that this version of \\"Baby Driver\\" didn't turn out the way he really wanted it to-guess he should have partied less and paid attention more... He does shine on the Paul written \\"Hard Luck Woman\\"-an obvious rip off of \\"Maggie May\\", yet still as catchy (maybe more so). Gene's \\"Calling Dr. Love\\", \\"Ladies Room\\", \\"Love 'Em and Leave 'Em\\", and \\"See You in Your Dreams\\" shine over all the others, though \\"Makin' Love\\" is a sick ass hard rock song with really stupid lyrics, even for these guys. Overall, this album still sounds fresh though-A definite 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCK!","review":"this is 70's rock personified. Kiss was really gathering momentum and this lp helped pushed them along. A bevy of Kiss classics like Makin Love, I want you and Peter Criss doing an excellent vocal on Hard luck woman. Also check out Peter's Baby Driver a real underrated tune.Major dose rock"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a Jewel in the Rough","review":"This is Peter, Paul, Gene, and Ace at their hard rockin' best. Recorded live in the round and produced by Eddie Kramer this one is full of pure raw energy. I've been listening to this one for over 20 years and I still manage to give it a listen at least once a month. It's just that good. The songwriting is simple and powerful, mostly about fun and good times. Ace displays some of his best lead work during his time in the band on this album. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remastered worthy of paying!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"ok, this is album is good not the best, it has great songs such as Hard Luck woman, Baby Driver, callin dr love, take me, and the cd is great, but I am tired of everyone on here saying the remastered versions arent worth it. bull crap. the essay you get is great for new comers and the most important thing and i cant believe when people ignore this. is back in the 70s when these albums came out on vinyl the include posters or tattoos or something there was always something, then the first issue of these to come out on cd didnt have anything but songs credits now with the remasters you get the cool posters and stuff. wortht he money. i cant beleive these hard core kiss army members dont appreciate the inclusion of the extras posters and stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ULTIMATE KISS ALBUM","review":"The title on the album describes it all \\"Rock & Roll Over\\" and remastered, well, what are you waiting for?? go and buy it.

Hard edge rock reminding me of the days when music was important. Yea, image was a big part of Kiss but their music was solid in the 70s. After that they exchanged the makeup for jungle tights and the fun was gone. These tunes continue their hard rock Beatlesque harmony meets the Who and Hendrix. I Want You is terrific, Baby driver is cool and Dr. Love is awesome. Boy I miss the 70s. Pedroloser hates this CD...WHYOWHYOWHY????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album with some classic Debutes, and a few unsungs.","review":"Rock&Roll Over! A Classic album from KISS at the hieght of their popularity! This album gave birth to standard kiss tunes like: I Want You, Dr. Love, and Hard Luck Woman. There are also some songs on hear that I love, but that are largely unheard: See you In your Dreams, Take Me,Makin Love, Mr. Speed, and Baby Driver. All of these are GREAT songs that have for the most part gone unheard except by the true fans...One of the best of the Studio albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Rollover and writhe in ecstacy","review":"The most underrated of all Kiss albums. The intensity of the guitars on this is the best they ever got in the studio. Mr. Speed is probably the best single they ever had and they never released it as one. Even the artwork is great. buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the love of nostalgia","review":"This 30 minutes of extra tasty bubblegum rock blows bigger bubbles than any of their other studio albums. Each song seems to have a formula: 2 minutes of rocking out, a 30-second guitar solo, and 30 seconds of the chorus being repeated forever. One thing I never noticed before, was how much the shuffle guitar work in Take Me sounds similar to Love Em Leave Em. What can I say though, I Want You is an awesome opener, and each song is rockin. I still don't understand why my favorite track live off of this one is Makin' Love. I even like Baby Driver, and the hidden gem Mr. Speed. Eddie Kramer (minus KISS) produced the most fun material for these guys: Alive!, this one, Ace Frehley's solo album. I think if you can find a decent copy for a lincoln, it's worth every penny. Casual fans will want I Want You, Calling Dr. Love, and Hard Luck Woman. Sample Mr. Speed to see if it's up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock and Roll Over (1976)","review":"Kiss's follow up to Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over is another good Kiss album.

Bernstein's version feels like the natural way this melodic, uplifting, and surprising symphony was intended to be performed. (Though I do tend to skip the storm movement.) Musical things are happening throughout on different levels at once. Very thrilling and satisfying.I also got the Bruno Walter version based on some of the reviews. I simply do not understand those reviews. Walter's version is stiff and unflowing. I can't imagine a worse interpretation. It is more robotic than pastoral."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOK FURTHER","review":"My taste in action:I thought this was on the sleepy side. Let's face it, the No. 4 has real drive andboldness.

This adventure is told mainly through the eyes of an adventurous journalist, but the deepest motives of many of these people are traversed as events rush towards the conclusion. Who will panic, who will hide, who will step forward, who will protect whom. The mystery of the treasure ends up being secondary to how each person reacts to the pressure and temptations of which they are thrust. So the real climax, as in most MacGrath stories is in how true character and indeed heroism show in people, both high-born and \\"common\\". This is an enjoyable and gripping character study/revelation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for do-it-yourself learning; barely adequate as a lab manual","review":"This is, as best as I can tell, a Simmons professor's lab notes, set in type with very, very bad photographs, and bound as a book.

Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking Glass Wars Trilogy","review":"This book is a great spin on Alice in Wonderland. It revamps a childhood story into someting adults will enjoy. The movie Tim Burton did on this trilogy did not do it justice. Theres more depth to books then the movie protrays. This book is a GREAT read for fans of Alice in Wonderland and fantasy readers alike. MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jump Alyss...","review":"THe Looking Glass Wars is the first novel in the Looking Glass Wars series, Duh! But it was a great take on the great stories written by Lewis Carroll, where everything thing he wrote is actually a twisted up/changed up story of a little girls real life, Alyss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I gave The Looking Glass Wars four stars because it was a great read but at times seemed to slow down and lose my interest. I think though that anyone looking for a book with a different twist to Alice's story would really enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not really a fan of this genre","review":"This book wasn't extremely deep or anything but it was entertaining. It wasn't what I expected as the author focused more on developing the environment and trying to make Wonderland seem as real as possible. There wasn't as much character development as I expected and no real relationship building between the characters. The development that does take place is very quick without a lot of explanations so it's kind of hard to really be vested in the characters and their lives.That being said I did like how he changed the story of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and I liked what he did with the different parts of the story that were normally really childish and fantastical and made them more realistic with more reasoning behind it.I would recommend this book as a surface entertainment but do not read it if your looking for something deep with rich and multifaceted characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"You think this is good?","review":"What is wrong with you guys?? This book is awful. Just plain awful. I went into the book expecting Wonderland to be described really well and all the fantastical elements expected in a good fantasy or science fiction novel. This had almost no detail on the scenery. The characters are underdeveloped, its just plain bad. From the first couple of chapters, I could tell the book was a waste of 17 bucks, but I rarely quit on a book, so I finished it and still felt it was a waste of time and money. The IDEA for the book was amazing. Someone should really try to write a series or a book that takes ideas from this book but actually makes it good."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great start to a Alyss in wonderland series","review":"When I heard about this book I thought this is either genius or it could go very wrong and I was so happy that it was genius I absolutely loved the book . Alyss is actually a princess from wonderland and Redd (the red Queen) is her aunt . Dont want to go into to much details as it will spoil the story and I hate to do that! It does have some parts with violence so if a child is sensitive to that stuff you might want to read the book first! The first three quarters of the book does jump around from Alyss/Alice,Dodge,Hatter Madigan,and Redd but I did not find it difficult to keep it straight! I could not put this book down and now am getting ready to start book two Seeing Redd !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz.....","review":"Not a lick of character development in this book, which makes me not give a hoot about what happens to anyone in this story. This book reads like a Cliff's Notes version of what a better book could be. It reads like he just wanted to get his ideas down on paper as quickly as possible, get it to the publisher and cash in. The story is rushed, the plot is rushed and his descriptions of the characters and world around them couldn't be less vivid. This thing needs a reboot by another author."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I really wanted to like this book because I enjoyed Alice in Wonderland so much. But I could not even get to page 50 before I shut the book and gave up.Yes, this is a YA novel, but I've read YA novels that are written MUCH better than this. Just because it is intended for younger audiences does not mean the writing should be allowed to suffer.I had the same problem with Twilight--intriguing story idea but, when I began reading it, I felt like I was reading online fan fiction written by a rather untalented middle schooler.I'm glad I borrowed this from the library rather than buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing Reed","review":"The Looking Glass Wars series is truly entertaining. It is full of action, adventure, and romance, not really like Twilight though, it is more of imaginary characters (for instance, Glass Eyes and Spiritdanes, things like that). Seeing Redd is more of a book for people with higher reading abilities. So I very much recommend this series to anyone who is willing to sit down and read read read a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing World.","review":"Randomly pick this book up on a discount table at Fred Meyer. And to my surprise..SUPER SUPER loved it! Great retelling of a well known story, totally turning it on its head. Great pace and wonderfully believable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, attention grabbing, amazing","review":"I don't usually write reviews for books(I mostly just read them) but this book is beyond AMAZING, the whole series is fantastic, the magical world Frank Beddor has created had me awestruck, I have all the books and the scrapbook as well, these are so fantastically written, I encourage anyone that loves(or even just likes) Wonderland in any form to give these books a shot, Franks story is by far my favorite one yet.His characters are so well developed, and the land is great, the maps that he includes are a very nice touch and the images of everything else are beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Violent Battles","review":"I really liked this book because it was a new and exciting twist on Alice in Wonderland. It's supposed to be what really happened to Alyss and even explains how the tale we know as Alice in Wonderland came about. I liked the action and adventure of Alyss and the bodyguard. This book is full of violent battles and action packed adventures. I recommend this book to ages 12 and up, it could be a bit too scary and complex for younger readers. I realy enjoyed the book and have already picked up the sequel at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"At first glance this is an interesting play on the theme of Alice in Wonderland. Under closer inspection the plot is underdeveloped and the writing lacks continuity. The tone uses modern day phrases that seem strange in the world of Lewis Carrol's beloved heroine. In fact, the writing as a whole seems too casual for the dark story the author is trying to present. The ending is blatantly left open for a sequel and without a sequel it seems mildly unfinished. The main characters lack depth, and the author seems unsure whether to make the villain Alyss'( alternative spelling for a new twist) Aunt Redd a truly frightening person or merely a comical overbearing caricature. Because of this indecision it is hard to feel any emotion about the villain. The end is an anticlimax and overall the book seems to juvenile to deal with the real underlying themes that made Alice in Wonderland a beloved tale. Don't read this book unless you have little experience with good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poor execution.","review":"I picked this book and it's follow up Seeing Redd from the library because it seemed so fantastic a concept. On reading through the first book however, I was terribly dissapointed. Many of the events are interesting but the command of language and ability for the author to paint a scene are just not there. I was especially disgruntled when entire swaths of the book read out like a child trying to act out some kind of action sequence from a cartoon. Lot's of \\"fwoosh fwoosh, clank, bzz! and Hack! and Pow!\\" if you know what I mean. For those of you who haven't had little brothers or son's to reference this description, I apologize. When I finished the book I turned it over and read about the author and discovered he is a movie director. Suddenly it all made sense. This guy can see it in his head but he just can't translate it to a page. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wishing for more","review":"I cannot decide if I'm disappointed or not. If I am it's not greatly. I loved the storyline, but had I been the publisher I would have handed the manuscript back and said \\"you're writing a trilogy. Split it up and go to it.\\" Really there is more than enough material for three books, the story skims along at a breakneck pace, which while engrossing, does not allow for character development or world development. At the end of the story I found myself wanting to know more about the characters and what they looked like, the only ones I have a clue to are Alyss and Bibwit. I do SO want to know more about these people and their lives. I wanted more of wonderland as well, I did not quite catch some of the finer points.*sigh* Ah well, I quite enjoyed reading it reading it. It would make a lovely series if it were done properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeesh.","review":"I admire Beddor's gusto in exploring an 'alternate world' Alice in Wonderland, but the result is pretty middling. First: if you're going to mess with one of the enduring classics of literature - much less a classic with a sociopolitical subtext that isn't even meant for young people to understand - you'd better be a fantastic writer. Second: you'd better have good reasons to populate your alternate world with Star Wars castoffs designed by Doug Chiang and extras from 'The O.C.' What are those reasons, by the way? And finally: if you want people to read your book and imagine it as a movie - just cut to the chase and write a screenplay, not a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awwwwww","review":"I usually don't write reviews...mostly because I'm lazy. For this book, I simply must. The author's writing style really bothers me. I read a lot and I appreciate each author has his/her own style, yet...this author writes like a child! This is a children's book, but there's no reason to write like one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off with his head","review":"The premise of this book seemed intriguing enough; as a fan of Carroll's original books, thoughtful YA literature, and dark spins on beloved tales, I jumped at the chance to check out this series.Unfortunately, while the premise is intriguing, the writing is execrable. Not everyone can write like Philip Pullman, but I expect a narrative that is, at least, not full of clunky dialogue, tortured metaphors, and achingly obvious plot turns.I have finished some fairly awful books, but I walked away from this one about a third of the way in. Where is Humpty Dumpty when you really need someone to order misbehaving words around?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult to Any Reader","review":"From cover to cover, 'The Looking Glass Wars' fails by varying degrees thanks to an unstable narrative style and too much tongue in cheek, \\"aren't I witty?\\" blather. To believe in the reality of any work of fiction, the reader must be taken in like a fly to a cunning spider's lair. Frank Beddor, with the use of many elementary narrative tricks with very little follow through, weaves this book into a tangle of loopholes that have you guiltily attentive to the end the way many of us rubberneck at a car accident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just another fantasy book","review":"Wonderful story, great characters and fantastic imagery. With so many fantasy novels out on the market today, it is hard to find one that seems a little different from the rest---in comes The Looking Glass Wars. Frank Beddor has created a world we are all dying to see on film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Fun","review":"This book was sheer fun and was so imaginative that I couldn't put it down. I liked the map at the beginning of the book, the time table at the end, the twist on the origanl Alice in Wonderland story, and all the other very nice visual details that made this book fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely missed the mark","review":"I just plain didn't get this book, and I really, really wanted to love it. I pushed myself to page 100 before I gave up the cause. Not only did the writing never engage me, the story was so loosely based on Alice in Wonderland that I would hardly call it a retelling of the same book. Yes, some of the characters had the same names, but they were completely up-ended--the Mad Hatter a martial artist? The White Rabbit a dottering old scholar? Come on, now; at least try to preserve a hint of what made us love the book in the first place. It seemed more like the author wanted to capitalize on the popularity of Alice in W. in order to get his book published. The book read like a record of gory, political strategy and there was nothing to pull me in. So disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"I found this book at a garage sale yesterday and decided to buy it. (the cover was eye-catching) Notice I said yesterday. That's because I read this entire book in twenty-four hours - and not because it had few pages. \\"The Looking Glass Wars\\" is a fabulous book that really enchanted me from the very beginning. Normally, beginnings of books are rather boring, the set up for the real entertainment, but not in \\"The Looking Glass Wars.\\" I was pulled in right away and, before I knew it, I had finished the entire book and couldn't wait for the second one. I have read a whole bunch of books in my life and this one has had a unique feel to it that put it on my \\"Absolutely MUST Read List.\\" I encourage everyone to read this book, even if you don't enjoy the original book.

Huge agreement, this is an overlooked classic. Huge agreement, this album could do with a small amount of trimming. However, I believe the trimming should be aimed at one of the slow-mid tempo tracks, one too many I think. 'Something's gotta give' is the hidden pearl in an album of gems, and as for trimming the guitar outro.???????? Nooooooooooo! that guitar outro. turns a great song into a truly special one.

It is extremely loud on some songs and quiet on others. It is also quite hard to make out the words even though I remembered most of them.

At that point I requested a replacement but was informed by Panasonic that my only recourse was to continue to send it back for repairs. Unacceptable.

It was this work as conducted by Mahler. Fortunately there is a piano roll of the first movement of the work as played by Mahler. Walter's tempi are a little more rapid, perhaps by as much as eight minutes over Mahler's performance timings. However, Walter gets two important points right. The adagietto is played and paced almost perfectly. Norrington's overall routine performance sports perhaps the best adagietto. Very few conductors get this right. The \\"suddenly passionate wild\\" section in the first movement is usually overdone. Boulez's decent performance of the work plays that section perfectly, but nothing else is that good (including a too slow adagietto). Walter is almost perfect in this section and almost perfect elsewhere. Listen to the character and expression of the opening of the first movement. There are other ways to play this work and other good performances. This one (while not good enough) is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The word-toolkit model","review":"Sorry, but reading the book I got the feeling that the author is using the word-toolkit to describe the Universe, and is limited then by that toolkit. He seems to exist in a world defined by words. The Universe seems to be a bit more simultaneously and dynamically complex than that, across a scale of entangled detail density that is very hard to even begin to hold in a mind. The best authors and explorers seem to start with the Universe and try to expand the toolkit to express their visions. This is a difficult and untidy process with very different results. What is a symbol? It is never the thing being symbolized, and it is never static. So what is it? I enjoyed the book, but did not agree in many places because of the narrowed and selective causality used. I also tend to consider metaphors to be inherently incorrect attempts to describe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gödel, Escher Bach Lite","review":"Title says all!Too much wit, too little novelty since his seminal 1979 book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Strange Loop is a Granny Knot","review":"While this book is entertaining and insightful,it is also, in many sections, pedantic andrepetitive.

Over the past two decades one respected commentator after another has come to grief in trying to explain it.

Sadly, \\"Strange Loop\\" has none of the charm of Hofstadter's first work, and has virtually nothing new to offer. Most of this book is a simple re-hash of ideas and concepts from earlier works.

Although many of the GED ideas have been reshashed in this book but it includes some new learnings and evolution in thinking that the writer has gone through in last 30 years.You may find the book using a bit to many analogies, but you should expect that from the writer of fluid concepts and creative analogies.

The first time is for the pleasure of the language and the elegance of the book itself. Certainly in \\"Marot\\" this was the case; more so than with GEB where the physical construction of the book was less important. That first read of \\"Loop\\" brought a smile at the familiar tropes of typesetting that Hofstadter uses to inform the reader that he is really serious about each word, even when that word seems to lilt and jump off the page.The next read is slower and more contemplative, following Hofstadter as he investigates \\"thought\\" while understanding his own thoughts. This is the most fun of all, because Hofstadter's brain is a great place to visit and he is unstinting in allowing us a window into it.I ordered this book when I first learned about it in 2006 and endured several delays and promises that it is on the way. I am sure that the delays were because Hofstadter did not find the book to be just quite right yet. It is now."},{"rating":"2","title":"RoboCop 2 nice movie","review":"This was a good sequel.

With the exception of King of the Night Time World, which was recorded in the studio with crowd noise added for effect. Since they did not want to include songs already released on Alive the 4th side on the second album contains 5 new studio tracks.

The only thing that i'd say is wrong with this album is that during this particular time in Kiss's live versions of songs are that they are played a little too fast.Anyone that has seen older Kiss concerts will tell you that they played their live versions of songs alot faster back then.The songs on side 4 aren't bad either with Rocket Ride being one of Ace's best songs ever.Although Alive II isn't as good as Alive it's still a very good album.Buy it.....you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAUL'S ANNOYING VOICE RUINS IT!","review":"The studio side is much better than the concert material!

It was all re-recorded in a studio and the result is exactly what one would expect from such a venture: a forced record, trying to sound spontaneous but unable to do so. Which isn't to say the 'performance' are bad. Most of the songs sound fine, in fact, throwaway songs like 'Tomorrw and Tonight' and 'Makin Love' have never sounded so good. But whatever energy there is on a REAL live recording, has been stripped away on this record in favor of a slick and more presentable record to appease the masses.The new tracks on Side 4, though, are solid, especially Paul's 'All American Man' and Ace's classic 'Rocket Ride.'

It's a pop song with foolish lyrics, but KISS always did that, the difference to other bands being that they did it with skill and mastery of their instruments and songwriting techniques.

That term is always funny to me, when used with celebrities. Its like fans think that their favorite celebrites are these honest, perfect, \\"not in it for the money\\" decent folks. KISS makes great music and have an inventive style, who cares what business deals or creative choices they make. The only down fall of this record is that Peter Criss has all but left the group at this point, only playing on \\"Dirty Livin'\\". The rest of the record has Anton Fig on drums.

By my own admission, I was never a big disco fan. And maybe it's only in retrospect that you can give this album any credit, but poppy or not, it's got some of the strongest writing of the makeup days, and thankfully the best contributions come from Ace.\\"Hard Times\\" (surely somewhat autobiographical), \\"Save Your Love\\" and the cover of the Stones' \\"2000 Man\\" are easily the best tunes on the album; the balls-to-the-wall approach can't easily be obscured by Poncia's production. But \\"Charisma\\" is a great Simmons tune that deserves it's A-side status. \\"Dirty Livin'\\" is weak, and while \\"Sure Know Something\\" is a bit twee, there's no denying it's catchiness.They drew heavily on this album for \\"MTV Unplugged\\", and the reason is the songcraft. Well worth the listen the critics want to deny you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A kiss is always good...","review":"Many fans don't like this album, but a kiss is always good, it doesn't matter how it is given. Although people say it's too disco, I don't think so, it's different, but so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of KISS's FINEST moments! Superb songwriting!","review":"Anyone who gives this release a negative review simply has no ear for good, quality songwriting, period! The songs on 'Dynasty' are, quite simply, memorable state of the art 'power pop' meets hard rock masterpieces. They are structurally and melodically tight as tight can be, and even playful and sexy at times! And as a previous reviewer mentioned, some of Ace's most tasteful guitar work was layed down on 'Dynasty'. This classic release is a MASTERPIECE, and the digital remaster gives the vocals and instruments extra 'air' and punch. Listen to this CD on a really good high end system at a healthy volume. If that doesn't 'do anything for you', you may want to call the local paramedics to perform defibrillation on you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the ending of an age","review":"this was the last KISS original lineup album till' psychocircus (peter doesn't really play on unmasked).hard times are about to come preety soon for KISS ,at this point still the most succsesful band around,gene presenting the bass axe never sounded better , whileyou don't hear enogh ace solos ,althogh it falls from love gun this album sounds great , an important milestonein KISS history 'cause thats where the connection betweenKISS and rock n' roll begins to fade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love band...HATE this album!","review":"I love KISS and they shattered my rock and roll fantasy of them on this album...I HATE \\"I was made for loving you\\"...it is a disco sell out...they made up for this cruddy album with more rock but I still do not own this album because of the disco junk on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the last make up album","review":"this album wasnt bad couldve been better but considering the last kiss album in the 1970s with the make up on their faces the album closed off a decade that kiss ruled along with the stones and aerosmith ."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],B={key:0},W={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(M,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-551d0b0c"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/8.md","filePath":"library/8.md"}'),R={name:"library/8.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
