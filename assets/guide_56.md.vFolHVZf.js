I was born much too late to witness this era so this album gives me a chance to hear what I missed. Classics like \\"Sweet Little Angel\\" and \\"How Blue Can You Get\\" will never go out of style. If you listen to and/or attend BB's concerts today, they are good but slightly slower paced and they drag a bit more. This one is probably his best recorded live concert. The song selection and energy simply shine.So many live concerts have been released by so many artists that it becomes very meaningless most of the time. A very few are as precious and special as this one.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive and Not What It Seems","review":"I too love Nancy Drew but being older, I prefer the original stories before they were modernized. If modern is what you want, this one is great, BUT I know a number of people who want to find the old, original unmodernized version and if so ... the cover they show here is deceiving. This cover art is an older cover that was originally on an older \\"vintage\\" edition that hadn't been modernized. Also, giving the 1932 date is deceptive because while the original story was written then, this edition is, as stated above, an updated and modernized version that was changed around 1959 or 1960 (or later). So, for anyone wanting a vintage story, check inside the book first if that option is offered, to be sure you are getting what you really want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok....","review":"Well, I guess this is an okay book.

I recieved this book on Christmas day when I was nine years old and I am in my 40s now. I still have that book and presented to my daughter when she was an adolescent. She is almost twenty-one and she fell in love with Nancy Drew just as I did. I remember Ned, Bess, and George and the adventures they had.

When Nancy goes ahead around the other side of the burning estate looking for survivors she spots a strange and mysterious figure running away from the scene of the crime. She finds two clues at the scene one including a diary that is completely written in Sweedish. She gets in some real trouble and the only people who can help her are three friends and her dad.I liked the Nancy Drew book The Clue in the Diary because it was a little slow in the begining but then got gradually into a real page turning book.

It is the version but shorter, over a minute, than the original. I wish I could find where to download/buy the exact version that came on Falco 3 released in the US back in 1985.

I just love the thought that I am getting 20 grams of protein in each bar to help curb my appetite and in such a delicious way. The dark chocolate adds just the right amount of sweetness to each bar and I like the fact that there's 0 grams of sugar in each bar. So, if you want a healthy, nutritious way to curb your appetite and get alot of protein to build and maintain your muscles, then the Thinkthin protein bars are for you. Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wont buy again","review":"Bought these when they were on sale a few weeks ago. I did read all the comments about taste before buying but didnt think it would be that bad. I tried it out for the first time today and was really disappointed with the taste and texture, I had a really hard time swallowing it and felt like I was taking a medicine but it never ended. I had to drink lots of water to kill the taste and to sum it up, I would not consume the remaining box and wont buy again. Im sure there are better tasting products out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor taste","review":"The dark chocolate bar tastes terrible. It has a good nutritional profile, but it is akin to eating cardboard. I've had the box of 10 in my pantry for about 6 months now, and I only eat one out of necessity and with a TON of water to wash it down.

Can replace as a meal if needed. Dark chocolate a little strong but that's just me. It's still a really good bar, especially if you like chocolate. Good for no added sugar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy in summer!","review":"I like the taste, but don't buy this expecting a candy bar. It's really not sweet at all, but I still like it. The diet food claims are pretty ridiculous, this small bar has 230 calories and is a meal replacement, not a diet snack. The product loses a star for false claims.It tastes good, is a convenient meal replacement, and a reasonable price when bought on amazon with subscribe and save.Don't buy it in summer!

I switched over to a subscription for the dark chocolate bar...I just ate it (had to force myself to finish it). It tastes SOOOOOO bad and leaves a chemical after-taste. I don't know how anyone can think this tastes good???? I am now stuck with three boxes of this junk that my dogs don't even want to eat.

They claim to be sugar free but they are far from it. Maltitol is a sugar which is identical in properties to sucrose (table sugar). The only difference is that Maltitol is only about 80% as sweet as sucrose.

Having trouble finding anyone who will eat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool like Cracker","review":"I don't buy the whole pre- and post-Dig argument, that the Dandy Warhols are a different band after the documentary just because of the exposure they received. I still hear them making generally the same kind of groovy, loose music they were making in the late '90s. Sure they continue to try out new ideas, but we wouldn't want or expect them to put out the same exact CD ten times, would we? I particularly enjoyed the new songs \\"Everyone Is Totally Insane\\" and \\"Down Like Disco.\\" This may not be their best work ever, but the Odditorium is still worth a visit. (However, it is not a 5-star album... For those who rate every CD they like as 5 stars, how do you distinguish between the good, the excellent, and the truly awesome? If all are 5 stars, what's the difference between them? Five stars should be reserved for enduring classics.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Opportunity","review":"Wayyyyy self-indulgent. Diehard fans will love it of course. But the rest of us that liked the witty and wry lyrics of previous efforts will only be marginally amused this time around. The music is worse than the lyrics (I am sorry to say because I like this band) but they could have learned a thing or two how to make long tracks interesting if the band listened to Stereolab. THAT's a band that can make a 7 minute song. Calling the music \\"dark\\" doesn't make this unfocused CD somehow better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this record so much","review":"Considering that I'm a pretty big Dandies fan, this record was something of a let-down. It didn't have the catchy tunes of Comedown or the introspective but lyrically brilliant, eighties syth pop sound of Monkey House or even the dog-and-pony show feel of Urban Bohemia. In fact, nothing really ties it together. The lyrics are lacking, the music is not very compelling, the record feels forced...like a compilation of Elephant 6 B-sides (if you can imagine anything that awful), and I would be hard-pressed to say anything good about it other than, hey, nice title. It is, after all, odd. Your money would be better spent on the next Courtney Love album (yeah, it's that bad)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak Effort","review":"Big fan of the Dandy's and this review hurts but bad is bad. They definately veer away from the slick Welcome to the Monkeyhouse sound and fall back much more on the older Dandy's Rule and Come Down sorts of sounds. Problem is the tunes here just are not any good.Tracks 2 and 3 exemplify the problems with this disc. These songs clock in at 9+ and 7+ minutes but the vocals stop at about the 2.5 minute mark. The problem isn't that there isn't a vocal track it is that the remaining 5 or 7 minutes of music is aimless and dull. They are not experimenting since nothing here rates at the level of \\"It's A Fast Driving Rave Up With The Dandy Warhols Sixteen Minutes\\" or \\"Creep Out\\". This stuff just isn't very interesting. Other tracks clock in over 10 minutes and frankly there just isn't a whole lot interesting going on duirng all that time.3 years wait for this....well it is just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to the Boring House","review":"What a shame... After four good records, onde of USA's more promising indie bands delivers an album that really fails to impress. The Dandy Warhols have always been a bit pretensious and self-indulgent, but this time they haven't enough strong songs to make up for that and the result is a mess. Overlong, unininspired and poorly written, most of the tracks here wouldn't be good enough as b-sides, and even the better ones show little staying power. I like experimentation, but this is almost unlistenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired.","review":"My personal opinion? Track 1 is just retarded, and the rest of the album? zzzzzzzzzzz. I was dissappointed.In some ways it revisits their old 'jam' style, but the tracks just go on for too long. The first 4 times I listened to it I stopped paying attention after the first few tracks... bad sign. I'm still trying to get to know the album but I know my opinion won't change.I'm a hard core fan, I've been there since Dandy's Rule and I just don't really like where the band is going. Their focus seems to be more on being 'cool' than the music.\\"It's only rock&roll; but I think I LIKE it.\\" stupid. Sorry guys - I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Dandy's ever..!","review":"There's no sugar coating this one...it's just bad. I'm amazed that some people are writing glowing reviews. It's so dramatically bad compared to their previous 4 albums. It really is an unfocused, meandering mess (as another reviewer wrote). Ironically, post-Dig! it almost sounds like they're trying to be more BJMish with what they're doing, but it just doesn't work. The production is trashy too, which is so completely different from Welcome to the Monkey House.If you're a big fan and like all four previous albums...be prepared, as this one's way off."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, what happened?","review":"Did they get a knock on the head and forget how to write good tunes? Up until this album, everything the dandy's did was pretty good to great. This album sounds nothing like the catchy tunes they were doing before and it is definetely on the morose side. Very hard to explain, but this album was not one of their best efforts. I also guess it is hard to top the great tunes they preformed prior to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well I like it!","review":"I put off getting this for so long since I'd read all the whining reviews about long songs and lack of tunes, etc. Come on people! This is a great album! If you've got the first two Dandy albums it's somewhat like a return, only with a whole load of Bohemian-Monkey attitude in the bag! Yeah, some songs are long but it's all about vibe and feel - this hangs together and it works. Except for the last song which is pants. Still - you can't have it all can you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've given it time...","review":"So I've given this album a LONG time to sink in.I finally came back to it on a few of my recent long car trips when I had some time to really focus on an album.I have this to say: \\"Ouch.\\"I would have been happy with an album 1/2 as good as \\"Thirteen Tales\\" or 1/3 as good as \\"Monkey House,\\" but it was not to be.I still wouldn't move it from #1 on my list of \\"Biggest Disappointments of 2005.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A meandering mess - What were they thinking??","review":"Look up meander in the dictionary.Meander - To wander aimlessly with no purpose or direction.I just listened to the whole album and as I big Dandy Warhols fans, this is a HUGE disappointment. I loved \\"Rule OK?\\", \\"Come Down\\" and especially \\"13 Tales\\" which was one the best albums of all time in my opinion. I even liked the last CD, but how they evolved into this mess is beyond me. Save your money and just buy the OK tracks: \\"Everyone is Totally Insane\\", \\"Smoke It\\" and \\"Down Like Disco\\".These three tracks all border each other and it's the only part of the album that didn't almost put me asleep.I was hoping for 12 More Tales and I got The Dandys Piss and Moan about Nothing in the Studio for 12 tracks.

Lighten up and have a beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a while, but worth it","review":"I remember I was bursting with excitement when this album first came out. I got into the Dandys with 13 Tales and Monkeyhouse, both of which featured shorter, arguably poppier songs. From here I delved into earlier Dandys and found a different but just as enjoyable (if not more so) sound.First time through Odditorium was a huge disappointment. I remember feeling confused, weirded out, and eventually disgusted. I had no patience for the clattering, on-off opener jam (Love Is the New Feel Awful) and was severely annoyed by the piercing, repetitive opening seconds of Down with Disco.Upon subsequent listens, however, I found Odditorium a rich, dense album that both rocks and rambles. Some of my favorite Dandy tunes are Easy, Holding Me Up, Everyone Is Totally Insane, Smoke It, (and yes) Down With Disco. It's hard for me to choose a number one among the Dandy's albums, but Odditorium is definitely the one that gets better each time you hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last!

The very concept of the book is bizarre at best and insulting at worst.Additonally the novel - which isn't erotic despite the hype - does not seem to come from a place of great caring but rather a place of self importance.

Those reviews obsessing on the book's erotic qualities have probably missed the point: this volume doesn't seem to have been written to get anyone off. Hard minimalism is rarely a writer's usual choice for that. It works very well, however, as a style for creating atmosphere, tension, and establishing a very strange, at times touching relationship between the characters.Marred by a few implausible moments and the difficulty of writing about the subtle intensities of BDSM, \\"After\\" is still a beautifully tense, thought-provoking read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit","review":"Needed a spice rack that would look good on the counter and fit the space I had. Really good construction, and spins smoothly and quietly. Love the glass containers because they are large enough to fit a teaspoon inside.

However, I swapped what they gave me with spices that I used more frequently, then put black electrician's tape over the black label on the front, and used a paint pen to mark in my own spices.

Sure enough, mine was broken as well. The wood part was clearly snapped before it was packaged, and a piece of the broken wood isn't even in the box (thus can not be glued). Two screws were laying in the bottom of the box, and clearly had never even been screwed in. The packaging was well done, but the product was disappointing. It might have been nice if it wasn't. The spices I received included chives, gourmet sea salt, italian seasoning, bay leaves, season salt, parsley, marjoram, celery salt, basil, pizza seasoning, rosemary, herbes de provence, oregano, fennel seed, coriander, and crushed mint. They are not common, which I expected, based on other reviews but I planned to replace the majority of them anyway.

I originally bought it because I thought it looked cool and it went perfectly into my kitchen. What they do not tell you in the product details is that the spice containers are not glass, but plastic. A great feature, right? Not unless you don't use the spices and keep the jars full. If they are not full, then every time you turn this \\"revolving spice rack\\" or even try to move it slightly, jars go flying out of the other side because they're so light. Very poor choice of materials to save some money in manufacturing, if you ask me. I used to have a spice rack with the same design, only with glass jars and never had this problem before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolving Spice Rack","review":"This was a nightmare! They sent it to the wrong address, so my husband had to go to the post office and mail it to the correct one.

I got a replacement from Amazon. When I received the second one, not only was the wooden piece split in two lengthwise, but the spice bottles had shifted during shipping and had broken the wooden piece across the center. I used the two different racks to make one perfectly good rack using a screwdriver, wood glue and common sense. I also just noticed that the top portion of the rack has blue glue sticking out from underneath the chrome cover.Would not recommend this spice rack to anyone. However, the spices did come in glass jars, which was my main priority. I would have preferred a different set of spices, they sent me 4 different kinds of salt.

There are several things about this spice rack that are just bad. I can only assume that those who gave it a good review have not had it very long.#1 - the tops do NOT seal properly. they slide over the holes where the spice are dispensed, and because there is not a tight seal (such as a screw top would provide) the spices will dry out very quickly AND most importantly be susceptible to bugs.#2 - the tops are printed with the spice name, and the selection will not match your collection of spices, I guarantee it. since there are no options for putting any other label on them included with the product, you will have to rig your own.This rack looks spiffy and takes up little counterspace but is a waste of money in the long run unless you like pests in your spices.Also, don't every buy spice with a spice rack...they probably won't be fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Plot - skip this and move on to something else","review":"I see that C.

However, if you listen to this CD, you'll see that these are in sharp contrast to much of Joe Tex's material. Although some of the other songs, such as \\"Skinny Legs and All,\\" are humorous, even these aren't raunchy to the same extent. More importantly, most of the songs deal with very serious subjects and show a strong sensitivity to real-life tragedy. These songs are also interesting musically because although they fall firmly into the genre of soul, there's a strong overtone of country in the mix. Joe Tex was actually from Texas, and pays tribute to that state in his chosen stage name. Give this a listen and you'll see that there's much more to Joe Tex than adolescent raunchiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"soul with power","review":"I'd agree with the other reviewers who lamented the fact the Joe Tex is underrated and often gets lost in the discussion about the great soul vocalists of the 60s and 70s. That said, his style is not for everyone. On many of his songs he comes off as a little too funny or playful. Nothing wrong with that, because this style is quite enjoyable, but I think that casualness (for lack of a better word) prevented him from being taken as seriously as some of the deep soul singers of the era. This single CD collection shows off his versatility, from mid-60s ballads to his mid-70s funky and disco-driven numbers. One thing many people might now know: Joe Tex wrote all of these songs himself, so he wasn't just some guy singing interpretations of other people's material. He was the genuine article and a gifted entertainer. I hate to use the word \\"unique\\" but that's fairly accurate. There weren't many singers like him ... then or now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phase 10","review":"MY FAMILY LOVES PHASE 10. Going to try Phase10 TWIST this year.

That is, vocals. For which it gets an automatic star. Tom's previous instrumental album 'Warm and Cool' contained a track called 'Saucer Crash'. Here we get the follow up, 'Meteor Beach', which conjures up a sort of 'X marks the spot' Fifties Beach Party where young somethings come to hang out, drink bear and play some cool sounds. The trouble is, who really wants to sit around getting mellow to a lacklustre Tom Verlaine instrumental album? It's sort of surplus to requirements, isn't it?Don't get me wrong.

Deadlands is a great RPG, lots of fun, and the content of the books is wonderful.But, the book Amazon will sell you is a bound PDF (the other reviews must be from fans of the RPG who did not buy it from Amazon, or bought it when the book was still in print). This is, to the best of my knowledge, the same thing you'd get if you bought it from the game's publisher, Pinnacle. IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL HARDCOVER.

I also very much enjoyed the movie. Of course,I think it's great that even secular artists still thank God and Jesus for their blessings. However, I do feel that this release had a money money money feel. This feeling mostly comes from LeAnn Rimes. Although I love this song, I can just imagine the money she's making off the hit single, \\"I Need You.\\" I don't think any of that is going into the offering plate. If the artists donated even part of the profits of this CD to different Christian organizations, I'd feel better about it.

Come on! This album contains very little music that is remarkable. LeAnn Rimes contribution sounds just like something she'd yodel for a country album, and the 98 degrees piece is pure prettyboy nonsense. The album is not inspirational in the least. Check out the remakes of \\"Spirit in the Sky\\" by DC Talk and \\"Shining Star\\" by Yolanda Adams. What a hoax! Even the usually reliable Steven Curtis Chapman offers a banal, unremarkable effort.

Of course, I most often replay Leann's wonderful voice, but almost as much, I listen to others based on their message or the amazing sounds that the groups have produced. In all honesty, \\"Fly to You\\" by Avalon is an amazing song that on its own makes this volume worthwhile.

Nothing before or since has had the same visceral appeal as John Carpenter's The Fog. It has a captivating storyline, perfect northern California coastal setting, and a cast of well-known and not so well-known actors, who's performances make The Fog all that more enticing.This was filmed before CGI effects and mega-buck explosions became all the rage. I find that the acting/directing should carry the movie; Not what is done to it on computer months later. The Fog excels here. John Carpenter's musical score is simple, haunting and really sets the mood.For those who can't watch 10 minutes of film without an explosion or special effects, The Fog is not for you. More sophisticated viewers will enjoy the movie. I can only suggest this: Wait til it's dark, close your blinds, turn up the volume, and prepare to be enveloped by THE FOG.

A tight script and worthy cast are both good for starters. Most of all, however, it is the absolutely superb photography and atmosphere (courtesy of Director Carpenter and his wonderful Director of Photography)that makes this one a classic. Most all of the performances are good--particularly Hal Holbrook and Janet Leigh. Only drawback is Adriene Barbeau as the heroine, who presumably got this role in true Sondra Locke-like fashion from then director/hubby Carpenter. I've never seen her give an unaffected, unmannered performance, including this one. Jamie Lee Curtis, from Carpenter's earlier Halloween and here relegated to a supporting role, would have been much better in the lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's in the Fog","review":"A group of mariners, with leprosy, are tricked into steering their ship into the rocks killing all on board.

The local priest, Hal Holbrook, find the diary of his grandfather who, took part in the death of the mariners 100 years ago. Adrienne Barbeau owns the local radio station, Janet Leigh is the chairperson for the town's 100-year celebration, and Jamie Lee Curtis is a visitor just hitchhiking through town.Throughout the movie we see the Fog roll in and out, move against the wind, produce an old ship, and of course the mariners from 100 years ago.If you like suspenseful movies, you won't be disappointed with this one.

But the real bonus here is you get to hear from executive producer/screenwriter Deborah Hill on the commentary track. On the audio track, she shares all the ups and downs with this follow-up production and how they were successfully pressured by the studio to tweak its classic, mannered tone by filming new gory scenes for an audience that supposedly wanted more blood and violence.

A few interviews from past and present. Theatrical trailers, out takes and even an easter egg. John Carpenter knows how to make creepy movies. Scary is one thing. Blood and guts is another but this guy knows how to get the right atmosphere. That is the one thing I have always liked about Carpenter's movies. They are always dark and gloomy with just a hint of a breeze added for that extra chill. This is one of those films that is perfect for that \\"late friday night while hanging out with your girlfriend in the house\\" routine. Buy this version of 'The Fog' and ignore the useless remake. I don't care what ANYONE says, no horror collection is complete without this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Old-Fashioned Spooky Fun!","review":"I recently watched this movie for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am a fan of horror films (not the slashing/gore kind) and I don't know how I had missed this one. Although the plot is obvious this one got quite a few surprised screams out of me. The movie does not show graphic violence, leaving a lot to the imagination, which is usually scarier than anything Hollywood can create. Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. Barbeau and Curtis are excellent, as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"And why isn't this out on DVD?","review":"John Carpenter has enormous potential - but realizes that potential only once in a while. This film is the best example of what he can do. The screenplay, while not bad, isn't particularly compelling, but I can't think of a single film that sustains a creepy atmosphere as well as this one. In fact, this film would be affecting even without any sound at all, the visuals are that amazing (without computer enhancement or even old-fashioned animation effects). This film deserves a careful, extravagant DVD transfer - and restoration if necessary. Should be required viewing in film schools.As an amusing side note: my bilingual wife & I watched this on TV on the Spanish-language channel. The dubbed translation was hilariously terrible. The oft-quoted line at the end, \\"Watch out for THE FOG,\\" became \\"Go outside and look for the fog.\\" If you've seen this movie, you'll know why this was particularly bad advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spooky Classic","review":"John Carpenter's 'The Fog' has all the elements of a great ghost story, and is one of his best films. I have seen the advanced copy of this DVD (perhaps it is a Region 2 version), and the transfer was very solid. My American Carpenter coterie should really enjoy this DVD- that is, when it is actually realeased in the USA. For those exposed to modern horror films only- take a look at this film- its a true classic 'ghost story', unlike anything recent. Read the rest of the reviews for this film, and you will see how desperately this film needs to be released on Region 1 DVD. Its really a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:A really pretty terrible movie that is inexplicably beloved, The Fog sandwiches one or two effective scenes between reams of plot exposition and corny acting; only the \\"so bad it's good\\" effect saves the movie from an even lower grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fog","review":"This is a disappointing follow up for John Carpenter after the exceptional \\"Halloween\\". Jamie Lee Curtis stars in this early 80s horror romp (what a surprise) about nineteenth-century colonists back from the dead who terrorize a modern-day fishing village. \\"The Fog\\" lacks any real thrills and no major plot developments, as well as wasting the talents of Curtis and Barbeau. Look for Janet Leigh (\\"Psycho\\") who is actually Jamie Lee Curtis's real life mother. Certainly not one of the better Carpenter efforts. Director: John Carpenter. Cast: Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau, John Houseman, Hal Holbrook, Janet Leigh. Rated R for violence and profanity. 91 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sleeper Of A Horror Movie","review":"I think the people who saw 'The Fog' are divided into two groups. The first group is the group who expected a movie similar to 'Halloween' and looked for the elements, never found them and were disappointed.Then there's the second group, the group who gave the movie a shot because of the excellent cast and were roped in by the creepy storyline, great effects and general atmosphere of the movie. Sure, there are elements that make the movie seem dated (the clothes, hairstyles, and automobiles) but that's only on the surface. 'The Fog' has endured the test of time because it's a solid horror movie with a very creative slant to it - THE FOG!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing?","review":"The other thing that hooks the Consumer (& Lover of Film) to buy these \\"So-Called\\" new S/E Disc's is that when you buy the \\"Supposed\\" new \\"The Fog S/E\\" DVD for Example you get a Free Movie ticket to the Re-make..Whoppie...why can't Hollywood be orginial and make a real film instead of trying to rip-off a cult-horror classic. & I wish movie studios would stop re-relaeasing DVDs W./a free movie ticket to there re-makes and crappy sequels when you buy a Re-Packaged DVD W./nothing new added except nex \\"Box Art\\"! Wow? Not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine old school horror film","review":"Antonio Bay is celebrating its 100th anniversary. It should be a great day, but it's gonna suck! A dense fog rolls through the bay and into the town. Not being able to see is bad enough, but this fog also harbors an evil that will consume everything that it touches. The spirits of murdered sailors rampage across the village taking revenge on the inhabitants. The townsfolk must solve the crime and rectify the mistake or suffer a terrible death.This is a great horror movie. I wouldn't really call it scary, but it is a bit creepy. I love the atmosphere this movie creates. Many old films provide a dark and haunting backdrop that is lost in most modern horror movies. The Fog is a classic that should be watched by every fan of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FOG","review":"A good ghost story. Although this not John Carpenter's best film but it certainly is one of his better ones.A sleepy coastal town is terrorized by vengeance seeking pirates who want their gold that was stolen exactly one hundred years ago.Not overly scary but some chills and a spooky story will keep you interested. Jamie Lee Curtis is good as a hitchiker who stumbles upon the eerie happenings,Hal Holbrook is convincing as Father Malone, and Adrienne Barbeau as the lighthouse music DJ does a fine job.The appearence of the eerie glowing FOG is well done and the music is also effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and skip this one..","review":"I just watched this movie last night because I was in the mood for a scary flick. I wish I would have not bothered. The plot is kind of slow, and very predictable. The acting is pretty bad as well (unless you really like Adrian Barbieu with a overly-breathy voice). Not scary, not entertaining. Boring, boring, boring. I can't imagine what people who give this a high rating see in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring Movie EVAH!!!!","review":"My sister invited me over to watch this movie. I love scary movies and such so I was initially really happy to see this. The concept was a good one. The basic underlying plot was good. The story, however, was SOOOOOOO boring and drawn out. I mean, hardly anything even happened and the scenes of them freaking out in the water just felt idiotic and overacted.JUST when the movie started to get awesomely interesting...the credits began to roll! Yeah, the GOOD stuff happens at the absolute very end. Just when you get interested, you get cut off. It was a waste of my time and just boring all around. I can enjoy a good crappy movie like The Nun, or Tiki, or some other cheesy cult classic, but this was an extremely CRAPPY crappy movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie looked good but it [stunk]","review":"I thought this movie was going to be scary! I watched it last night with my roommate and it wasn't scary AT ALL! Barely anything happened, just a couple people getting murdered! If you want to watch a scary John Carpenter movie, rent Halloween and stay away from this movie. Michael Myers is much scarier than evil clouds floating around some town in California."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I agree with last review and.....","review":"I WANTED to like this movie when I saw it, but it, like any other Carpenter movie that I've seen (and I have to say I haven't seen anything recent of his), is so full of holes and flaws that still years later I feel cheated as a movie goer. I honestly do not know how this man continues to make movies.::::SPOILERS: Do not continue if you have NOT seen the movie:::I agree, like I said, with the previous review. The mood is set, but why set up all the knocking without entering a place, and then he breaks that whole convention in the end with their getting into the lighthouse (build up of power? who knows).BUT..and the biggest but..is when they just POOF appear in the church to behead Holbruck. If they could do this, the rest of the meager set up makes no or little sense.This movie could have stayed on VHS and gone out of print for all I cared. Why write this and share? Want someone to save money and get a better film."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great carpender movie","review":"A great film festival would be John Carpender's \\"Assault of precinct 13\\", \\"Halloween\\", \\"The Fog\\" and \\"The Thing\\". I love what this man does with characters and mood. The other reviewers have certainly gone over the plot in detail so I will reflect mostly on what Carpender does best. He takes a wide variety of people, lets you know just enough about them, and then adds those special moments of life that force them to interact under the most stressful of situations (oncoming doom). Halloween was the exception in that Jamie Lee Curtis was on her own. The music, again, becomes a character in how it puts you in the right mood for whatever's coming. The only annoyance was the little kid who just couldn't figure out that he shound RUUUUUN! away from the bad people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow Another great Carpenter Flick","review":"John Carpenter in his prime right after Halloween's huge success. What else can you say about this movie? The documentary is great on this DVD and i really enjoyed it. The movie looks good, it sounds good, it's a fun ghost story movie. It's finally on DVD and i'm a happy guy owning this. If you like Halloween or any John Carpenter movies this is definitely one to buy and add to your collection. The DVD version is long awaited and it's finally here. John Carpenter is a great film maker and this ranks up thier with Halloween, In the Mouth of Madness and The Thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dripping with Cheese -- I Love this Film","review":"John Carpenter is the current master of the cheesy horror flick. This film is great -- a creepy lighthouse, a pirate's treasure, ghostly undead, and -- of course -- the fog. Some of Carpenter's \\"repeat offender\\" actors are in the film, including Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Hal Holbrook. The dialog is a bit contrived at times, and the ghostly pirates move a bit too slow, but it's all in good fun and builds up the suspense. Naturally, the sound effects are classic Carpenter and add to the ambience, if that's the right word to use. You can't go wrong with this film if you like good old-fashioned scary stories or if you just like Carpenter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie? Good. Bluray quality? POOR","review":"I bought a copy of this and was very disappointed. It's supposed to be a 1080p disc but in my opinion, its just slightly better than a standard-def dvd. The detail isn't there. You know how a true 1080p movie is so clear you can almost see every strand of hair on a person's head? Well that's the kind of picture quality this movie is missing.

If what keeps you going is a sense of longing and humor and an always surprising eye for detail in the most ordinary of lives, he might be. This is my favorite of his many novels about the people and place of the American Midwest in the first half or so of the 20th century. Morris was an awesome photographer and his writing is keenly visual. The stories tender to wander, as the lives of the people in them wander, too, as our own lives wander. There's a lot of loneliness in Morris, beautifully rendered, but always a twinkle of play as well, and a clear love for the people and the land. Morris is as much poet as storyteller, a master smith of phrase and thought. For example, this book begins with a line I'll never forget: \\"In the dry places, men begin to dream.\\"Take Me With You When You Go"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read about, but out of print","review":"This book has been referred to many times by historians, but I finally have a copy and am sure it will fill the bill for research.

It also helps a manager steer clear of incurring their wrath.I recommend this book as a great primer for anyone learning about organisational dynamics for the first time.It was simply a joy to read and very useful, Excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to explain Organizational Culture in terms of 4 Ancient Greek Cults","review":"In my world, the mere learning of the existence of this book along with its premise was a powerful \\"I-KNEW-IT!\\" experience. So that is why my description of my first reaction was as follows \\"provides a firm intellectual foundation for that gnawing feeling that your work environment may very well be some sort of a cult. ...all too often this all-important question about work situations being cults goes unanswered.\\"After some time to roll it over, I see that this book's ideas--though resting on a creative, relevant, and sound basis--are quite fluffy and weak compared to what is possible.

They sent me an incorrect item, instead of this at first. I returned the wrong item and received the correct one via overnight mail. But, in the meantime, I downloaded the auto-rip, knowing I would be getting the correct CD and this function was free.

To find a CD that has such a range of styles and emotions these days is rare. The music takes me from a snowball fight to the tragic story of the Cherokee and lots of interesting places in between. The liner notes and pictures are great. I like the purity of the piano all alone, with none of the streamed-in sound effects that render a monotony to so many other CD's in this genre. The original compositions exhibit complexity and variety, holding my interest, pleasing my ear, and stimulating my thoughts and feelings.

When I read the reviews I wanted to see the film for myself first. when I saw it the reviews were correct. This sucked! All they did was talk, talk, talk ,talk,talk, talk, talk. And there was this stupid sentence which stayed right in the middle of the movie saying Property of Retarded Films or something like that. Anyway trust me. I know and I was in the same position you were in. This movie sucked. If you don't believe me rent or borrow it and see it yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably bad.","review":"I heard this one sucked. The Foywonder and Dr Gore tried to get that message thru, but it didn't work with me, as usual. So I rented it. And I'm sorry.Some nutcase tries to transport two Chupacabras, a male and a female, to a facility in some gang-infested city in Mexico. At least, I think it's a gang-infested city in Mexico. Anyways, the male escapes and starts killing people.It seems appearant to me that most of the film's budget went into making the two rubber Chupacabra suits, which are easily the best thing about this movie. But that isn't saying much. To say the script and direction are completely incoherant is an understatement. The acting isn't much better.If you did something wrong and feel like you need to punish yourself, or if you want to torture someone, this is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite a z-movie","review":"El Chupacabra is by far, the worst movie I have seen in the last few years. Imagine a horror film where the \\"monster\\" looks like a retarded chimp that's been punched in the face a few too many times, and has fallen into a vat of green dye. In spite of the fact that it's less than 3 feet tall and moves like it's doing the potty dance in slow motion, it manages to kill several stupid humans that aren't smart enough to just kick it like a football and beat it with a stick. Sadly, the monster being on-screen is the highlight of this movie, as the acting is horrible. I rented this movie expecting a really bad, d-movie, and it exceeded my expectations by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"El Cheap-o-cabra...","review":"We get an animal control officer, his cousin, an author, two idiot cops, three seemingly harmless gang members, a mad scientist, his henchman, and a homeless person. I left out a couple of people, but you get the picture. This is low-low budget film-making at it's... er, um, best? Well, it's not the worst I've seen anyway. The title creature is semi-impressive w/ no zippers I could detect. Just some poor guy in a monkey-man suit hopping around. There is blood, intestines, and carnage, though there's not much suspense. The humor is ham-fisted and mostly flops on the floor. I didn't fall asleep, but I did check the clock to see if time had actually stood still at one point. If you enjoy movies like ASTRO ZOMBIES or CORPSE GRINDERS, the style and cheapness of EL CHUPACABRA might appeal to you (although both AZ and CG are superior tales)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money....","review":"Unless you can pick this up in a closeout bin, and even then just save your money...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snotty film student weighs in...","review":"Great effort for a movie with a budget smaller than Blair Witch - I hope.

Luckily this book targets this business like a laser and leaves out the basic, common sense fluff I've seen in just about every other book. There are a few Business 101 pointers, but they are limited to just sentences rather than the usual chapters. You're run through the basic formation of your business in great detail, and the information on researching and determining your market are invaluable. The second half of the book is almost completely about relations with your clients, which I believe anyone who goes into a negotiation for an assignment should read.All told, I keep this book on my desk for reference. This is my first 5-star review, and it's well earned. You're not just buying \\"Business for Dummies\\" with a few mentions of photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Best I've Found","review":"Wow, this is a great lotion for everyday use, whether you're a fan of tanning or not. I have very dry skin and this is the first lotion I've found in any category that does what it says. I get asked all the time what scent I'm wearing when all I have on is this lotion. It's lightly fragranced, not heavy, covers nicely (a little goes a long way), and is effective all day. I use it immediately after a shower...I absolutely love it. They'd better never stop making it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best albums....","review":"Sweet, sassy, and one powerful voice. The songwriting skills of Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent come together with the magnificent voice of Petula Clark on this great album. I wore out Auntie's \\"My Love\\" LP at 7 years old but later in life was able to buy her a CD replacement AND get it signed by Petula Clark, herself, as well. Petula told me that she never really liked \\"My Love\\"...too bubble-gum for her...but at 7 years old, it truly appealed, and I have always loved it. I would alternate between playing the \\"My Love\\" album and \\"The Sound of Music\\" movie soundtrack LP, so you know that it is held in extremely high esteem. The great thing about \\"My Love\\" is that all of the songs are exceptional...a rare thing to love all tracks on a record. Petula Clark is truly under-rated.

There are cards that add to the total, subtract, and even double the total. Also cards that reverse the direction of play and even bring the total right to the top. When a person cannot make a legal play, the round ends and the player loses one of their 4 chips. That player then only receives 3 cards. The game continues in this manner until one player is left with chips, who is then declared the winner.This game has a lot of strategy and provides a lot of back and forth play.

My self-image was very low and this book gave me methods to bolster how I saw myself. I no longer agreed with everyone when I felt differently from an opinion they expressed.Self-love can be called self-respect if you prefer.When you respect yourself/love yourself, you can respect/love others because you do not feel threatened by others' comments, actions, etc.I have given this book to young people today who are having challenges in school with other kids. I trust that from this book, the one who reads it will bolster their own self-image so that they can better stand up for themselves and relate to others in school.This book is good for adults to give them suggestions about relating to people in life and living a more successful life by respecting yourself which in turn allows to respect others without judging them."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent sampling of the best fetish photographers","review":"This book is an excellent introduction and sampling of the genre of fetish photography.

Certainly there was plenty here to titillate rather than elevate, but that's no reason to throw out the entire batch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Photography and Costuming","review":"Fetishism doesn't personally attract me. However, in my continuing study of the human body for developing my own art work, the cover picture on this book snared me. I thought it was very original and eye catching. I bought the book and I did have many good art creation inspirations from looking at the photos. Curiously, however, most of that inspiration was in costuming, which formerly interested me greatly when I did fiber wearable art. The head gear in particular, some of which reminded me of great birds of prey and primitive masks, was visually stunning. This is pretty \\"out there\\" stuff though and I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for generally erotic photographs and think this book might do the job. I think you better specifically like fetishes, or have a specific other interest like mine, in order to make it worth your investment. This also might be a very worthwhile investment for those artists who are still in fiber wearable art or costuming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but works like full size","review":"I'll keep it simple. Lots of neat bells and whistles. Small camcorder that works like full size VHS. Has a nice adaptor for the VHS VCR. I tried other camcorders and full size VHS cameras before I bought this one and it was the closest to working like a full size camera. It is very light weight even with the battery on it. Your arm does't get tired from holding it up. It is also nice to have the LCD when you want to tape your whole family you don't have to look in the view finder to be sure it's lined up right.

The only real way to make money in the market is to know when to sell. While the pros on Wall Street want you to keep dumping money into their stocks and funds, or better yet, keep exchanging funds every few months so they can earn commissions from you, your account balance decreases.You'll see that without this book, your trading account will be \\"buy and hold . . . until your account goes bankrupt!\\".Thank you Al for instilling some much needed common sense for the masses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book Written For The Investor With Little Experience","review":"I bought Al's book about 8 years ago, and have been following it ever since.

The reason is that chicken is pretty neutral flavor and most of the people like it. I buy all kinds of Pasta Sides flavor pouches whenever they are on sale and I truly enjoy the creamy chicken. Pasta Sides are truly easy to make and taste great. It takes about 7-10 minutes of cooking time to make a bowlful of tasty pasta. When the pouch contents are added to the boiling water & butter consistence, the whole thing looks too watery, but as the pasta cooks and water evaporates, the liquids then thicken-up into creamy substance and pasta gets expanded. Each pouch I think is enough to feed an average adult person. Sure beats your standard mac & cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Made in China\\" Docs","review":"Had I written a review for Docs when they were made in england, I'd given them a 5 easily. They were rugged (most pairs lasted me several years), were made from quality leather and the look and smell of them suggested a superior boot.Since they started to manufacture them in China, the quality has gone down. The leather is stiff as cardboard, signs of wear show more rapidly (surprising since I dont run in them like I used to) and it's not just my observation but others as well.Considering that they cost as much as they did when they were made in england, I'll be looking for another brand once these wear out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic old footage","review":"Best thing I can say about this product is that it's relatively inexpensive. Be advised that if you purchase this, you are only getting some grainy footage from right after the liberations. Audio is nono-channel, and nothing has been done with today's technology to clean up the film. The first five minutes is nothing but letters testifying it's authentic. Might have been needed at Nuremburg, but not 65 years later. There is some interesting, and graphic, footage, but most of the best footage has already been used in other documentaries. This is simply post liberation footage from some of the camps and not particularly long at that.

It picks up a great deal of wind noise when outside. Also, the unit has a self protection feature that senses moisture. While this seems like a nice feature, I've missed MANY pictures because of high humidity situations.

This was one of her earliest books -- and it was written in a time when rapist heroes were accepted.The hero (and I use that term loosely) is so insanely jealous that he could have been a guest on the Sally Jesse Raphael Show. He rapes the heroine, yells at her, abuses her... The heroine is little better, for she is stubborn and childish in the most foot-stomping of ways.The saddest part of this book is that Cathy and Jon went through all this in their first book, Island Flame. You'd think he would've figured out by now that he could trust her -- after all, he married her at the end of the first book!Oh, before I forget, this book also has violence, a vomit scene, misunderstandings, and even a cat fight. There is plenty of adventure, but it's lost amid the name calling, rapes, humiliation, and foot-stomping.I gave this book an F at All About Romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Story that Inspires Anger","review":"The entire premise of this book is rather offensive. Unless you're a big fan of underdeveloped characters, a weak plot, rape (I lost count of the number of times the heroine Cathy is raped or almost raped) and child abuse, then I do not suggest this book. I was particularly outraged by how our 34-year-old hero, raping a 17-year-old Cathy was justified because she \\"subconsciously wanted him.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck, yuck, yuck!","review":"I know everyone has a different opinion, but I don't understand how anyone can say this book is excellent. I needed a shower and some therapy after reading it. There is no excuse for 99% of the crap in this book. Anyone who has read romance books for a while knows that rape used to occur in them from time to time...as horrible as that was, at least romance authors used to make their heroes redeeming in some ways. There is nothing good about the hero. He nevers once feels bad about the way he treats his wife. The heroine is stupid, weak, helpless, and nearly as bad as her husband. I understand that this is a historical novel and that domestic violence and rape weren't looked down upon so much at the time, but we are modern readers, so how can we not cringe when reading this book? And first and foremost, this is a ROMANCE NOVEL! If you can read this book and feel all lovey dovey afterwards, go and see a shrink please."},{"rating":"1","title":"dysfunctional and abusive isn't sexy","review":"This book really bothered me. I guess it was aiming for readers with different tastes than I have. I like characters who develop mutual respect and grow to love one another. This book was about a couple that became so abusive to each other that in real life, prison terms and restraining orders would have been issued. They are cruel and selfish for the whole book, making the \\"happy ending\\" absurd. I didn't find it romantic or sexy. This book really made me curse my inability to stop reading a book once I start it.

Seriously, though, his behavior was deplorable throughout the entire book with frequent verbal and physical abuse, and a redemption scene that's not even tepid at best.

I was very disappointed in all the fighting going on in this book. Either these two people, who were once lovers, have very short memories or all of their feelings were very shallow. I hated the rape scenes between a couple once very much in love. And Jon seems bent on believing the worst of his wife at every turn. I kept hoping she Ms. Robards would bring this love story around, but she didn't until the last few pages.

The problems he created and the SCE had to clean up, seemed very realistic and creative.

The photographs are well executed technically. It's unclear what she wants to communicate, however. The subject matter is pretty much all over the board, from Sammy Sosa to steel mills to suburbia. Is this a travelogue? Social commentary? Art? It's hard to say. Others have done each of these better than Ms. Evans in \\"Revealing Chicago\\". I think this book is mostly about \\"elevation\\", but that's not enough.Perhaps the worst thing that can be said about any artistic endeavor is that it's uninteresting. I personally find that's the case here. With several notable exceptions, the work simply doesn't capture the imagination on any level, positive or negative.

I enjoy alot of the brit comedies. I have Faulty Towers, Mr. Bean, Are you being served, Open all Hours and more.

The later series were much better with character like Foggy, Compo, Cleggy. I really like the character Billy Hardcastle and Alvin. They were excellent actor and the humor was absolute hilarious. I like English humor much better than American, the characters are more believable, and the quick wit leaves you chuckling. I am sad that this program has come to an end, it was truly a classic.

It could be my own sense of humor--but rating Fawlty Towers as a 10--Black Adder and Father Ted as 9's--One Foot in the Grave and Ab Fab as 8's, Keeping Up Appearances and Vicar of Dibley as 7's etc etc--this show is over rated as a \\"1\\" Along with \\"Allo Allo\\"--this is one of the two worst Britcoms I've ever seen. *it could be this show improved with time--as the episodes in this set are the only ones I've seen--and so they are the episodes I specifically refer to"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb by itself","review":"I bought just the car for my little girl for Christmas.

This book is undoubtedly a wonderful one for first readers (and it was in the collection of my two teens when they were young) but what I'd really like to impress upon the readers of this review is that this they shouldn't hesitate to give as a gift or get this book for the very young.

Then I whould want to eat it all the time. It showed me that almost anything is worth trying at one time or another.

My reason for loving this book has a bit of evil to it.My mother HATED this book. Detested the repetitive nature of the rhyming scheme, I guess. I found this out when I was 4 years old. So, whenever I was being punished and sent upstairs to my room, I would sit at the top of the stairs and read \\"Green Eggs and Ham\\" out loud. At the top of my lungs. Over and over again. Even in 1969, I was a miniature bad-ass.Eventually my mother would end the \\"punishment\\" rather than sit through another dramatic reading.

This particular edition of it, though, was not produced very well. Many of the flaps were glued down during production, so when we first read through it, lifting the flaps would cause a lot of tearing. We can't read many of the words because of that.

It is one of those classical stories that you will never forget Dr.Seuss for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Cat in the Hat!!!!!!!!","review":"I gave my collection of Seuss books to my 2 yr old sister for her birthday and she loves this book! The first book that I read to her was, naturally, the Cat In the Hat. She enjoyed the book. The next book I read to her was Green Eggs and Ham. She LOVED it- she would run up to one of us and ask us to read Green Eggs and Ham to her. This Christmas I will buy her the green eggs and ham game. To get even more involved with this book, make Green Eggs and Ham for breakfast. Here's the secret- add avacado to scrambled eggs and put avacado on top of ham. Enjoy the book !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Child's review","review":"This is a great begining reader's book. The words are relatively simple and the repition and rhyme in the book make the words and their context meanings more memorable for the child to remember. The silly situations in which the main character is asked to eat also adds some clever entertainment to the book that your child will find funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Dr. Seuss... But Everyone Makes At Least One Mistake","review":"Dr. Seuss wrote this book to teach children to try new things and not be stubborn about it. However, that's not at all what I got out of it. I read a story about one person (Sam I Am) trying to peer pressure someone into trying a potentionaly dangerous substance (if you ever come across green ham, it's probably horribly expired and covered in mold and bacteria DO NOT EAT IT.) At first he resists but then falls to peer pressure and eats it, realizing it's not as bad as he thought. What a kid might get out of it: parents and teachers say drugs are bad but if your friend likes it then it's good enough for you, and besides, trying new things is good, right? The moral could've been brought across better, but it does depend on the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"After reading this book you'll want some Green Eggs and Ham!","review":"I think all kids can relate to this book! Sam I Am is kind of like your parents trying to get you to eat something that you think is gross. In the end though he ends up liking green eggs and ham. The message in the book is don't be afraid to try new things, even if they do look like something your dog wouldn't even eat it. It could end up being your new favorite food! Green Eggs and Ham is a wonderful book to read to children. I know I loved having it read to me when I was younger. Even now I like reading it to younger kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Eggs and Ham by CM","review":"Did you ever not think you would like something but then you like it? Well in Green Eggs and Ham Sam tries to get his friend to eat green eggs and ham. Sam go's to all these crazy places telling his friend would you eat them here or there. Do you think Sam's friend will try green eggs and ham read the book.My favorite part of the book is when Sam goes to all the crazy places because it's funny.I recommend this book to everybody because they would think it would be funny, and would like green eggs and ham get the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I bought the regular version","review":"This is not the \\"standard version.\\" Too many flaps (that will inevitably get torn off) ... this is such a classic and it's not the same the way this is laid out.

It's pretty pointless as a learning tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourite books ever","review":"I loved this book for at least two years, when I borrowed it originally from the University library. Every time I get to the part where (spoiler alert) Sam I Am realises he likes green eggs and ham I tear up. I think it is an incredible piece that speaks to the human condition in a fashion unmatched by Western authors. The connections with existentialism and critiques of nihilism contained within are truly profound."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a classic! I don't know who hasn't read this book","review":"\\"I am Sam. Sam I am.\\" - I think all Dr. Seuss books are all classics and especially Cat and the Hat, One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish and How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I remember reading this book as a young girl and now that I've become a mom myself I think it would be a great book to start my son on reading. It's an easy book for your child to begin reading and reading it together is even better. I don't know any person who hasn't read this book at school in elementary(or even kindergarten!) and Dr. Seuss is such a well known name. It's a great book for kids to read out loud for their developing speech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for kids!","review":"This book is about a guy who has green eggs and ham, and tries to make another person eat them. At first, the other guy doesn't want to eat them, but at the end he does. This is a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading between the lines","review":"Strength: Catchy lines and detailed descriptions of the \\"delectable\\" green eggs keep readers involved in this page turning wonder. Detailing the conflicts between a drug-pushing Egg dealer (Sam) and his unsuspecting child pawn, Green Eggs and Ham is an intricate tale of peer pressure during the 70's. Lines like \\"I do not like them here or there. I do not like them anywhere!\\" are breathtaking when read aloud in the presence of others. When the child reaches his emotional breaking point during the climax and finally gives in to eat the eggs, it feels as if Seuss is ripping your moral standards from within.Weakness: Readers are quick to misinterpret this book as an introductory reading cartoon because of the almost complete one-syllable word composition and colorful drawings that accompany each page. One must look deeper and read between the lines to truly grasp what the author is saying. Would you eat the eggs? In a box, with a fox, in a house, with a mouse?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious Reading","review":"This is one of the most famous of all kids' books, and rightly so. In Dr. Seuss's classic story, Sam tries mightily to persuade his friend to eat some green eggs and ham. His entreaties, followed by the progressively longer refusals are accompanied by whimsical bright drawings against simple backgrounds. One can only say that it is \\"Seussian.\\" Whether the denouement will help your kids eat formerly suspicious foods is debatable, but it will probably increase their hunger for more fun reading. A great book for the beginning reader as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"This is a story about Sam I am who tries to get someone to eat green eggs. He refuses to try them because he says he already doesn't like them without even trying them. As you go through the book Sam I am tries to get him to eat the green eggs and ham in different places and different situation but he still refuses. Sam I am really bugging him to try this and he starts to get annoyed. At the end he just says that he will try it just to get him off his back and it turns out that he likes the green eggs and ham and he say he would eat them anywhere.This is a great book for children. It teaches them to try new things because many children only stick with the same old things and don't dare to try anything new. Dr. Seuss makes moral tales a lot of fun for children. He uses rhyming words and unique situations to make kids like the book and then they learn something from it even at the young ages where they don't really realize what a moral tale is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Dr. Seuss Book","review":"This is the most fascinating book written by Dr. Seuss. He wrote this book as a bet for $50 that he could not write a book with a 50 word vocabulary. He proved the guy wrong. This book also teaches a moral lesson that you shouldn't \\"knock it till you tried it.\\" This is definately the greatest book written by Theodor Seuss Geisel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up Lifting, Exciting and Encouraging","review":"What a sensational story. Dr. Seuss has done it again!! This book inspires taste buds to have fun and try new things. When I first read the story, it was a joy to read, hard to put down, it's just not a book that you read once in awhile. The \\"fox in the box\\" and \\"the mouse in the house\\" were just persuaive enough to encourage the taste of what come to be, the delicious green eggs and ham. The pace and tone of the story is quite fun and it allows the children to become involved. They are able to predict the rhyming words. What a joy, Joy, JOY to read for children and even adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Book","review":"This is a great book for younger kids because it reads very easy, they like the idea of green food, and can start to rhyme with the words. The book has nice pictures and has been read many times at our house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have a trike - need a basket","review":"I have a trike that came with a white basket.

The minute I popped it in the player, I was disappointed.It's a very boring DVD. Now, I'm no yoga slouch, but some of the positions were a little difficult - but not so much difficult as tedious. The sound quality was awful - not just difficult to hear, but it fluctuated depending on where she was facing. And, to be honest, I can't even remember if there's music.I was hoping to unlock bedroomy fun, and was left boredly hitting the fast forward button. If you want to feel sexy, I suggest getting another, slightly more active DVD - like Carmen Elektra's strip tease aerobics. A totally different ball field, but guaranteed to put a little spice in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I don't know why this yoga DVD got such good ratings. The sound quality was so awful, i couldn't hear what she was saying. It seemed like it was filmed in her living room without proper sound equipment or something. Also, definitely not for new yoga users. While Volume 1 is for \\"beginners\\", her positioning went excessively fast throughout the workout. It shouldn't be noted as for \\"beginners\\" if it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Yoga. Video.

I have not even done this DVD because the sound quality is so poor that unless my TV is up full blast I can't make out what she is saying. If I have it on loud enough to understand her, the music is so loud it's overpowering. I'm giving it a 2 for concept and because since I haven't actually done the exercizes, I will assume some good can come from them. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift!","review":"I gave this to my friend as a gift for her Bachelorette party.

A sexy twist.My hips are looser and I definitely am feeling better in the bedroom.I've only done the tqape about 4 times, and am feeling results already.Highly recommend for you or a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Buy","review":"I thought this was the most poorly produced instructional DVD I've ever seen. It was out of sync or something. Each segment opened with the instructor/commentator speaking but you can't hear them so you miss out on what you're supposed to be doing. Also I felt like the video had the feel of soft porn to it. After reviewing the entire DVD my thoughts are that a woman could just continue doing her regular yoga practice, throw in some Kegel exercises and achieve the same results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea ruined by lax, careless production","review":"I think the idea of incorporating pelvic muscle strengtheners into a yoga routine is great, but they really blew it with this production. The instructor is unprofessional and giggly, her voice gets muffled whenever she bends over, you can hear cars in the background, there is little instruction for beginners, and the useless voice-overs telling you to contract your core muscles are not synchronized with the breathing or poses. Worst of all, they flash instructional text on the screen when you are in poses that prevent you from reading it! A small budget is no excuse for this sloppy, disorganized presentation - they could AT LEAST have practiced cueing for video, this is the absolute worst cueing I've ever seen in an \\"instructional\\" video. I gave two stars because the yoga itself(if you completely ignore the instruction, production and delivery) is a decent routine, but don't fall for the marketing ploy, and skip this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"for beginners only","review":"This is patten's master's thesis. He got it published and it won a \\"first book award\\". that is a major accomplishment. That all took place in 1999. This book reads like a thesis and is for the beginner only. It misses so many points on hegel's concept that I won't list them all. Get Will Dudley's book instead. Or if you're just determined to agree with the other reviews of this book that I followed; then buy a used paperback.

Most of the performers here are from Europe, with over half of them being German punks. Practically none of the groups here are well known, with the most famous being Motorhead, doing their original song \\"R.A.M.O.N.E.S.\\", which was later covered by the Ramones themselves. Most of the performances are very good. Some of the most interesting versions are the ones where they translated the Ramones songs into the singer's native language. My favorite is Die Arzte's \\"Die Wikingjugend Hat Mein Madchen Entfuhrt\\". That is their version of \\"The KKK Took My Baby Away\\", although the German title translates into English as something like \\"The Viking Youth Has My Baby Girl\\". Of course, every album like this has at least one stinker, and in this case it's Patareni's awful version of \\"Endless Vacation\\". But that's the only bad performance here.

Although there are some brief sections that touch on the broader challenges and decisions of the American intelligence effort, most of it involves repetitive first-person accounts of people hiding in the woods from the Nazis. If that sounds interesting, it isn't. I came away from the book with a modest understanding of what the guys on the ground went through, but with almost no sense of the strategic challenges that sent them there. Having said that, it is an easy read, if only because it is largely devoid of interesting ideas.I would not recommend this to someone who wants to understand the broad sweep of the American intelligence effort in WW2. I would recommend this to someone who has some interest in first-hand accounts of the operatives on the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"valuable but very dry","review":"It is a very valuable piece of historic mosaic.E.g. one of many fascinating parts is how blatant were Soviet spies in the State Department when they torpedoed any effort by OSS to obtain intelligence on the Soviet Union.However, the presentation is too dry and too fragmented in my view."},{"rating":"2","title":"author interview on NPR Diane Rehm show, 7/9/2004","review":"On 7/9/2004 on NPR's Diane Rehm show, they interviewed the author.

The camera would auto-advance the film went it felt like it, Would double and even triple expose frames, overlap frames, etc. I changed batteries, film types, and film brands in hopes of fixing the situation but none worked.

I find that framing the subject with this camera is really easy (your picture comes out exactly as viewed), and I have thoroughly enjoyed it as my first SLR. I have beautiful sunset and beach shots that are clear and colorful, even without a UV filter. The camera has never given me a day of trouble. My first 28-80mm lens that was packaged with the camera eventually jammed and would not focus after 5 years, but I purchased a Tamron 28-200mm lens 3+ years ago with no further issues.

It will cost us over [a hundred dollars] to fix. They (Ritz camera) tell us something went wrong with the \\"clutch\\".

Nothing tricky about these shots, either; flash pictures of groups taken from ten or twelve feet. The outdoor pictures, taken in bright sunlight, tend to be a bit underexposed but are not too bad. The savy owner of my local camera store tells me that I'm going to need a much better camera if I'm going to use Kodachrome. (But I have no doubt that all of the pictures on this roll would have been correctly exposed if I had used my inexpensive Ricoh, even with Kodachrome.) He says that he refuses to carry the QTsi, because it is just too badly made, though he has a high opinion of Minoltas in general. Very disappointing, particularly since I really liked the feel of the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"$275 piece of junk","review":"Do not buy this camera, I bought it because it looked like a professional camera and because I thought Minolta was a good brand. I was wrong on both, learn from my mistake. The picture quality is poor to average at best. I thought maybe it was the developers fault so I tried another developer, same results. I can't tell the difference between the pictures taken with this camera and the cheapo I used before I got this one. You could spend a lot less to get the same picture quality. Minolta has poor customer service when you have a problem.

It contains superb acting, especially on behalf of Hoffman and by one of my favorite actors, John Malkovich.The story delves into the hardships and broken dreams of the main character, Willy Loman, who represents the average joe. Because of this, it is very easy to become entrapped in the life of the struggling characters that are representative of the all too common man.This movie is a compelling drama; the audience becomes sucked in and sympathetic towards the deteriorating family. It is the ultimate representation of the failure of the American dream.The movie at times may drag for those who are only interested in action and special effects. There is no focus on elaborate scenery or props; instead the main focus is directed towards the poignant acting that is very well delivered by a well chosen cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This is a great 2 act and a requiem play, and Dustin and the cast do a superb job. However, it still doesn't equal Lee J. Cobbs' portrayal of this delusional salesman and his last years of justification of his life. I would like to see the version with Frederic March as Willy.

I have read countless books re: depression, PTSD, narcissism, etc., - this is absolutely the first one that succinctly describes the consequences of growing up in a neglectful, cold environment. While the book is intended for therapists (and I'm not one) ... its detailed description of one's inner experience is something for anyone who wants to really get at \\"what's inside\\". It was published in 1987 - but it contains cutting-edge information regarding the body-brain connection.

The book also relates how duality (saying one thing when we mean another) is damaging, in both adult relationships and with our children.

If I had read the first then I would have cast this aside knowing how objectionable all the charactgers, supposedly the heroine's friends, all were. Finally, Ellie gets some gumption and some guts and wins the day. She is appealing. I am hoping for better because I can see the possibilities. I enjoyed the style of writing and the final conclusion. This is definitely a British heroine (in her early 60s) with a village background. An American heroine would have been more brash and determined, and kicked the daughter up the butt by Chapter Two. Ellie will grow on you.

Be sure to set your camera for action to help compensate for camera or subject movement for those far off shots. Great also for capturing those special moments at sporting events or concerts, even when you have nose-bleed seats.

There was no indication on the package or in the package how to contact the seller or return the shoes. I went online and found the email for the seller and asked for instructions on how to send the shoes back. It took 2 emails to get a response and there response was to try to get the shoes to fit, that this type of shoe you have to \\"squeeze\\" into and it will stretch to fit. This was unacceptable. It took 2 of these emails to get them to give my an address to send the to and a return # which is needed in order to get credit for the return.

All the ingrediants are here that go to make up a film of this type, but there is no substance, and the whole thing is a drag. It's badly produced, badly dubbed and the music is awful. Even the presence of Christopher Lee cannot save this film, and it was said that he was sceptical about doing it in the first place. Not without good reason. The film is supposed to be based on the Edgar Alan Poe story 'The Pit and the Pendulum' but that is just an excuse to feature a swinging pendulum forever getting closer to our hero, who although tied up is still able to fling a stone at it, and throw it off course. There is nothing to commend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor DVD release!","review":"To this date April 23rd, 2008 my great wish is still that one day someone will release She Beast, The Ghost, Castle of the Living Dead AKA Crypt of Terror, The Sorcerers and The Long Hair of Death in their correct aspect ratios and with a decent crisp transfer with audible sound.

This is a goal that I am still aiming for, and everytime I read The Polar Express, I get inspired once again. It is simply magical...timeless in it's wonderful illustrations and it's childlike joy. I am most positive in saying that it is impossible that you could not like this book...whatever age you might be. Afterall, the real goal of Children's books is not just to inspire the children, but to remind us all about our own childhoods. You can not be disappointed with this book.

The young boy is picked, and he asked for one of the bells from the reindeer's harness. When the boy gets on the train, everyone asks to look at the bell, but it was gone. There was a hole in his pocket. The story has a good ending, I leave you here to finish it on your own.The story followed a very good line.

I should have just paid full price and bought new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written; not-very-magical illustrations","review":"Glad I didn't buy this one! Starts of with promise but the North Pole is not a magical, sparkly place but a grim place full of factories & workers. Santa Claus is not presented in a friendly way at all - he even \\"whips\\" his reindeers! Scary I thought. And the final message is you \\"must\\" believe (in Santa Claus... or anything else I suppose) or you won't partake in something special...Didn't like it at all - and my 4-year-old girl was unsure... certainly not worth the hype. Thousands of better, way more magical/comforting/spiritual books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, what is all the hype about?","review":"I read this book in the bookstore. It took me a minute. There is absolutely no depth to the book at all. It never has a chance to have depth because it basically goes like this: Event A happens, Event B happens, Event C happens, Event D happens, etc, like two weeks worth of the comic strip \\"Mary Worth\\". Each page has one paragraph in it and pushes the story along one inch at a time. And then it ends. A lot of things that were in the movie weren't in the book and that's somewhat to the book's redemption. Perhaps the book has sparked memories in some readers' pasts and that has what has endeared it to so many but for me reading it was an empty experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of everything","review":"Waste of money, waste of time, and waste of a movie experience. I can sum up the plot of the story in one word: \\"Believe.\\" That's all you need to know. It's the same message found in Miracle on 34th Street (pick a version), and a million other Christmas/Santa movies. The story was dumb. I could print all of the words in the book on my hand...in big letters. There was no depth...just a stupid kid who gets on a train with a stranger. There's a good message for kids. The artwork was fantastic, though. I can see how the story needed to be fleshed out to make the movie, but I can't imagine how they made an hour and a half or so out of a book that took me less than five minutes to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"A pleasure to read but has nothing to do with the meaning of Christmas. It makes me sad when people talk about christmas meaning giving and showing kindness but leave out the birth of Jesus. If I would say no one knows the true meaning I'm sure I would be told that many people do. So why in almost every movie, tv show, book, especially made for children, never mention Jesus's birth? Instead of teaching about Santa, why not also teach children what Christmas is about. The book was sweet, but missed the meaning. Or really, I didn't see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascist Images Are Not Appropriate For Children","review":"We took this book out of the public library for our three year old child expecting a nice, warm story about Christmas.

The story takes place on a train that goes to the North Pole and sees Santa and the elves. They were making toys for the little boys and girls that believe in Santa.

This book allows children to understand that while Santa Clause isn't \\"real\\" the spirit of Christmas is what we need to believe in. Children need to understand that Christmas spirit is what they need to keep all throughout the year not just during Christmas and this book does a good job showing that. When the boy gets to choose the first Christmas present he doesn't pick a toy he pick a token that will help him remember the Christmas spirit forever.

As an e-book for children it is very overpriced. For the money, you simply get the text and illustrations. There is no read-aloud function or interaction. The illustrations are beautiful, of course, and it is nice that the text can be enlarged (although it then interferes with the illustrations).

I read it with happy anticipation, loving the warm tone and vivid descriptions on the trip to the North Pole and back, including when the boy finds the bell wrapped under the tree with the cute note from Santa. However, from that point forward, I hated it. His parents couldn't hear it, later his sister couldn't, etc., because they were not \\"true believers\\"?! Ugh! Yuck too! To me, Christmas is about love, generosity, inclusiveness, a celebration of renewal, life, all children AND their families, not about celebrating being part of an elite group of true believers. I hated it; and I'm thrilled to have gotten rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"stranger danger","review":"Much to my chagrin, my 4 year old son has this book and the movie practically memorized thanks to my husband and his mother. Why is it ok to teach children that getting out of their beds, leaving the house, and getting on a train with a stranger in the middle of the night is a grand, desirable, adventure? I threw out a similar story about leaving the house and flying through the air with a snowman last year. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is another example. I have been searching for a copy of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales to counter-effect the message. My goal in teaching my children about the world is to instill a healthy dose of caution at least, about going off with strangers, forget political correctness."},{"rating":"2","title":"polar express","review":"this is my favorite book from my Christmas childhood.

And the ending is pitch perfect in capturing the spirit of Santa Claus and Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute delight","review":"If you love your children get this book and read it to them -- over and over again. We got ours when it first came out and before it had won awards or been recognized for the wonderful book that it is. It will be read again on December 23 this year ('Twas The Night Before Christmas has a lock on Christmas Eve). All of my children and now my grandchildren love it and all but the youngest have it memorized. The sweetness of the minds and hearts of the little ones themselves is the only thing on earth that is better than this story. In case you cannot tell, I truly believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polar Express","review":"We give the Polar Express two thumbs up and five stars. It happens on Christmas Eve. A train,called the Polar Express comes to a little boy's house. The Polar Express take them to the North Pole to see Santa Claus. This book is very exciting and mysterious. The spectacular illustrations bring the story to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"a haunting wonder","review":"In his introduction to his selection of ghost stories, Roald Dahl notes just how hard it is to create a true classic in children's literature. Out of the hundreds to thousands of children's books written every year, maybe one or two (in a good year) retain a large audience. The Polar Express is one of these rare volumes--and deservedly so.Chris Van Allsburg's holiday classic is full of lovely illustrations. One can feel the chill of a long ago Christmas Eve, the warmth of the inside of the train, the vastness of the Polar landscape. Yet, the real attraction with The Polar Express is its timeless, haunting story. Like the last echoing strains of the sweetest ringing bell, this story will stay with you long after you are done reading.With all the \\"stuff\\" that has come to surround and obscure Christmas--this story, of a boy who finds wonder in the face of surrounding disbelief, is a perfect book to read during the season.I give it my full recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Christmas Fav","review":"This is for sure one of my most favorite books of all times.

Hathaway joins this companywith Miasma. On the back cover of the book, there is a photoof him looking out at us through a literal miasma of cigarettesmoke, with an excerpt of his poetry: \\"He sits in an emptybar/with the ghost of memory/beside him smoking cigarettes/They say nothing to each other/only exchange glances/withcomplete understanding\\".

The editor has taken it upon himself to cut not only ALL the epigraphs from ALL t he stories (an absurd economy which distorts the tone of these parodic stories) but also fails to provide the two-page \\"From the Editor\\" frame without which the purpose of the Belkin tales is obscured.I would not recommend this edition even to the casua l reader who wished to get the true flavor of Pushkin's Sternean, self-referential prose works.

So, I went out & bought this album & I was pleasantly surprised. I usually discover only a couple of favorite songs on a new album by a new artist, but I absolutely loved EVERY ONE of Leslie Feist's songs. Her music is very stylish, but with substance and it's a little of everything: folk, bossa nova, jazz-pop, and indie rock.Feist also has a pretty cool website, www.listentofeist.com, which is definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs that make you smile","review":"What a voice! Feist does a great job with this one.

Probably my favorite album of 2007."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't just get the new one","review":"Good compliment to most recent album - sounds very original - highly recomended - a bit less poppy than recent album - refreshing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just lovely","review":"Thank goodness for commercials that introduce me to music I haven't heard before. I really like Feist's voice & style and will definitely buy more of her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY!","review":"Sorry, but this is just a Norah Jones record marketed to people who think they're too cool to admit they like Norah Jones. If you disagree with that statement you're just wrong. Feist also takes a pretty good crack at ripping off Sade as well on a few tracks. Go listen to the real thing instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it now","review":"Lonely Lonely, Gatekeeper and more songs on this CD continue to spin in my head! I knew I was expanding my musical tastes when I picked this up on a whim last month, and now I want to share it with you all. This is fun music that holds a lot of magic throughout in both the singer's voice as well as the often brooding melodies.Feist is something so different that I know they will be talking about them years from now, so don't just take my word for it, take a chance and get this album! One of the highly acclaimed releases of 2005, Feist is a showcase of musical talent and it is a shame more people are yet aware of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"I heard a review of this CD on NPR and thought my sister would like it. She LOVED it! and wants to know more about Feist's other work. She really appreciated Feist's smoky voice and unpretentious laid-back style as well as the simplicity of her instrumentation. Nothing slick or Pop about this CD, just good artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' it inside and out!","review":"Leslie Feist has this spellbinding ability to carry you through her dreams (\\"Mushaboom\\"), her past (the tribal folk-influenced \\"When I Was a Young Girl\\"), and her solitude (\\"Lonely Lonely\\"). Her voice is ever-quietly powerful, as are her lyrics, and rich with vibrato. \\"Let It Die\\" blends the folk with the jazz, the rustic with the urban, and the meditative with the fun-loving. Her rendition of \\"Inside and Out\\" is, dare I say, more funk-filled than the Bee Gee's and her other covers, which include \\"Secret Heart\\" and \\"Tout Doucement\\" are so zestful and fresh that they, too, arguably blow the originals out of the water. The essential cocktails-in-the-backyard summer album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting album","review":"The sound of the album is predominantly an alternate take on different forms of pop music current and from the past as well. The alternative comes in the minimalism of instrumentation and effective it is. Vocally, her voice is on the quiet and sensuous side. Some have likened her to Norah Jones and I see a resemblance only when the music she's playing is similar to Norah, so my conclusion is that she is a vocal and stylistic chameleon , albeit one who only sings mid to slow tempo songs. If you like how that sounds, then check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neist","review":"Leslie Feist has cooked up one of the debuts of the year, proving that you don't have to inaccessible to be hip. She can torch or samba as the occassion requires. \\"Mushaboom\\" is an instant alterna-classic. Excellent taste is also shown in covers: Ron Sexsmith's \\"Secret Heart\\" and the Bee Gees' \\"Inside & Out\\" (I swear she makes it work)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Repent","review":"I read that Feist was a sort of Norah Jones on steroids. I like Norah Jones but I'm not crazy about Norah Jones. I wanted originality. I wanted a jazz singer with a little more punch than Norah Jones. After making it through the first 8 tracks of Let It Die, I did.I've completely rewritten my review because this artist, Feist, is so good, you may not catch it at first. Listen a little more and her music grows on you---she infectous.Music has a new queen. Chrissy Hind, step aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good CD but sounds too familiar","review":"Is it me or does anyone else feel like Feist is an Esthero rip-off? She is trying to copy Esthero's vocal style! Esthero is an original, often imitated but never duplicated. Feist fans....if you haven't heard of Esthero, take a listen and you will see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm, go back to Broken Social Scene and let this siht die, please","review":"Fiest runs the gamut of musical styles from A to B on this record, from soul (ish) vocals to Norah Jones-like musings to out and out disco which was bad enough the first time - may the BeeGees rot in hell. I guess it's ok if you're an \\"indie\\" artist to regurgitate past musical styles that weren't too good to begin with and add a few electronic flourishes so you won't be accused of being too too retro and then add some dishpan shallow boy/girl lyrics and voila - pop genius! Fieist manages to be both sultry and sucky at the same time. Well at least all I lost was time having downloaded it, listened to it twice and deleted it. If mediocre modern pop is your thing then buy it but it's just not my bag, dad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not impressed (except when singing in French)","review":"Too much emphasis on her voice and not enough to songwriting dooms this set. Some of the tracks were so dull and lifeless. I've heard more passion, more joie de vivre from lounge singers in casinos. Yes, she sounds like Sade. I will say that I liked the one song she sang in French. I think I would have upped this album an additional star if the entire album were recorded not in English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Female pop at it's best","review":"If I were asked to equate Leslie Feist to a mixture of other well-known female acts, it would break down like this: Take Sarah Mclachlan's voice, add a combination of Norah Jones' soothing melodies with Frou Frou's refreshing, bold and absolutely in-place pop arrangements, and stirr softly until even.What you will obtain is a merely brilliant album; one that approaches perfection not through complexity but through the simpleness of the conjunction of a great voice and all the right instruments. From the first track, an atmosphere of carefully intertwined sounds is created that will hold until the very last second and, most likely, linger on in your brain even after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Many Lovers Aint Good for You.","review":"Got turned onto song from a dance performance on YouTube.

I went directly to check out and didn't look at their second screen which outlined in clear enough detail that this imported (to the USA) DVD may not be viewable on all DVD players in the U.S. The fact is, most DVD players sold in the U.S. are Region 1. The DVD is made for Region 2 (Europe). As a result, I spent $8.50 (including shipping) for a DVD I can't play and that can't be cost-justified to return.

Is it time to feed the pigs more money and buy this release? No way, get yourself a good DVD decryption program, rent this DVD, and copy it! Thank GOD for piracy, the studios have been ripping off the consumer for years and now it's time to fight back!

We have to take their word that they were successful. The movie, but for too many flashbacks, takes place in a parking garage of undetermined levels. People are few and far between and only provide fodder for the killer (an obvious choice among a limited cast). There's a lot of running, a lot of squealing tires, crashes galore, impossible stunts (I don't know of any person who could outrun a vehicle). Preposterous to the nth degree, very little makes sense. The main character/crook (Grayson McCouch) has several opportunities to kill the driver of the truck who's after him, but doesn't seize on any of these few chances.

If it weren't for it's over the top and unsatisying ending, I'd have rated it higher. Writer/director James Seale sets up a labyrinthine plot which keeps the audience guessing on who is driving the nasty truck. Grayson McCouch gives a visceral, masculine performance as our hero, a would be thief who finds himself trapped in a parking garage with a demented truck driver. Numerous flashback sequences give us plenty of suspects, and the villian's identity comes as a bit of a surprise,which is to Seale's credit. Unfortunately, the confrontation between our hero and the villain isn't written as sharply as the rest of the movie and the villain's fate is a copout. The movie deserved better. Still McCouch and company (especially Amy Locane and Adrian Paul) keep us interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Need I say more? This is a c-grade garbage.

You can't just zoom the lens as desired and stop it wherever you want (i.e. when you take your finger off the zoom, the lens stops where you want it to).

Although, I still find it incredibly hard to believe that our country was once so BARBARIC as to not allow people of color the opportunity to play sports with other students (white), the movie does a great job of showing how a team can unite and overcome the bigotry that surrounds them. I enjoyed how the white students on the basketball team eventually overcame their biases and how the black players also learned to like their white teammates.

It was supposed to focus on the first black basketball team but it seemed to be poorly written. It focused more on racial differences and one of the team mates fears and love life. I did not get through the movie because it just did not have a plot and seemed to just go from scene to scene. They were playing basketball then they are in the cafeteria. The couch is talking to his wife the basketball team is sneaking out the dorm. One of the basketball guys is on a date and then you have a racial scene. It just was not a good movie and it was not good. They should go back and take notes from Glory, The Hurricane, Malcome X, and other great black movies. I just think they had a writer that did not know what he was doing and wrote a poor story and they hired actors to act it out.

In the history of opera there have been so many voices that records couldn't do justice to and that were much better heard live. Lets hope this is one of those instances. After listening to the CD she reminds me of a voice similar to Inga Bork's; a big clunky voice that manages to hit all the notes but that doesn't move me at all. Inga Bork had a big career so maybe hers too was a voice that had to be heard live. I don't know I guess I will wait and see.

However, the fit for the X61 is snug (as I wanted it to be) and therefore, do not count on placing any additional large-sized hardware (such as a power adapter, although a small mouse will fit) into the sleeve.

Maybe too much of the book is about poor Mrs. Hopper and her unsuportive Husband, but Levin crafts the history so well that I didn't hold it against her.

This fatal writer was not afraid to discuss his experiences powerfully through his unique form of writing. Peter Hargitai celebrates Jozsef's 100 years by translating what Hargitai felt were Jozsef's strongest and most impacting pieces of literature. I was so amazed by the depth and anger conveyed by his poems, and even more surprised at the translation of such creative and breathtaking work. Jozsef writes mostly about his country, his women, and a strange love for his mother. \\"You're more of a cheat than all the (...) I know!\\" was a line dedicated to his mother in a poem called \\"Too Late for a Eulogy.\\" Hargitai does a spectacular job in capturing the true and deep feelings Jozsef expressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Selected Poems","review":"Selected Poems by Attila Jozsef is a very intense captivating book of poems. Selected Poems captures all the poets' inner feelings towards the world, his childhood, and poverty. Jozsefs expresses through dark images of his life and problems he encountered as a child. One of his life changing experiences mentioned is the abandonment of his father at the age of three. Attila also discusses about living in an orphanage and always living in extreme poverty. The poet Attila Jozsef encounters many scars during his years in this earth; the deepest wound he must have suffered had to been the lost of his mother. In his poems you are able to see the essence of loneliness and suffering that was cause by his mother's death. Although at times raw of the subjects he speaks of, I believe he is preaching his life and story. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys intense reading and who finds it a challenge to feel personal poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Selected Poems","review":"Attila Jozsef lived a difficult and depressing life. He grew up in a communist country without a mother. The absence of his mother left Jozsef feeling abandoned and angry at the world. He blamed God for his hardships and constantly longed for his mother's love. Poetry seemed to be Attila's outlet for all his frustrations in life. Selected Poems contains 100 of Attila's greatest poems, in celebration of 100 years since the poet's birth. Attila's poetry is unlike any other poetry I've read. His poetry is incredibly dark and filled with emotion. The ways the poems are written allows you to feel Attila's pain and understand where he's coming from. It was incredible to see how the poet was able to convey his emotions onto the reader. The poems really give you great insight into the mind of a depressed individual. Overall, Selected Poems, was enjoyable to read, although it did get depressing at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poems of Anger","review":"Jozsef's poems show his depressed feelings and constant thoughts of suicide. Many things have gone wrong in the poet's life. He lost his mother when he was in his teens and also got kicked out of college. Poems are the only way for Jozsef to escape from the outside world. He feels constantly alone and that there is noone there for him. Many of his poems are bitter and really show his anger at everyone and everything. He has lost faith in God and in everything else. I didn't particularly like Jozsef's style of writing. His poems are more story based than song based. That's just my preference since I am a young poet as well. I used to think that all poems had to rhyme until reading \\"Selected Poems\\" by Atilla Jozsef. The stories within these poems show the other uniquely creative styles associated with poetry other than simple rhyme and advanced alliteration. I definitely recomend \\"Selected Poems\\" to those looking for a deeper meaning into how a depressed poet feels."},{"rating":"2","title":"the black boy","review":"Attila really expresses himself in the poems. He writes about everything that bothers him and everything he likes. As you continue reading the book he begins to find more and more happiness. THings begin to get more clearer and makes him find more a reason to enjoy life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attila Jozsef's Selected Poems","review":"At first glance, one might take Attila Jozsefs' poems to be simple, but there is more here. The fact is that he was a poet who wasn't afraid to speak his mind and did so through his art. Although his poems were at sometimes very dark, his chosen words were truthful, even surreal. I was able to notice his transformation from an optimistic person who believes in change and a better life for his people to a depressed soul who has lost all hope and faith for his country and God.As I first began to read the book, I felt at a loss simply because of its negative energy. However, as I read on, I soon came to realize his reasons for writing the way he did. My favorite poems were the ones about his mother and the ones about his premonitions of suicide. My favorite poem overall was \\"The Final Battle\\" because of the passion that he evokes about his optimism towards making the world a better place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selected Poems","review":"These poems are written by the Hungarian Attila Jozsef. We can see Attila very deep feelings through his obsession with his mother, believing that life was nothing, so death was his freedom. He never could have what he wanted. That is why he is always negative about life. Some of the poems are related with his obsession with his mother and the book is mainly reproaching about life. It is sad to believe he threw himself under the wheels of a freight train. When I read this poem, I felt very sad. These poems are very depressing. These poems were written in times of the Great Depression in the thirties of the 20th Century. To understand better these poems we must understand it context.

Before this Blue Underground release, it was almost impossible to find an uncut version of this film. The DVD is well worth it. Django Kill! tells the story of a Stranger double-crossed by his fellow bandits and then tries to get his revenge. Tomas Milian stars as the stranger in one of the best title characters in the spaghetti western genre. The interviews with Milian, Giulio Gesti, and Ray Lovelock are very interesting since they deal with some of the more controversial scenes in the movie. The trailer is disappointing with the music playing behind the title being shown. In the movie, the violence is truly disturbing including the famous gold-digging in a man's chest and the scalping of one of Milian's partners.

My biggest beef with this camera was the autofocus. It hunted way too long, and this often gave way to poor shots with out-of-focus subjects. It's not so bad when you are photographing a posed shot, but candid shots were often screwed up because of this. The autoflash was also consistenly poor, making for mediocre indoor shots.<..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice","review":"I am very happy with my purchase of the Minolta Maxxum STsi.

This is a very poor printing of this work. The paper quality is similar to newsprint or industrial paper towels. The print quality is also inferior; there is much blurring and smudging. Often, whole pages are ink-tinged like photocopies. Most disappointing are the reproductions of the artwork. There are no color reproductions and the black & white reproductions share the same faults as the printing of the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urgh","review":"I guess the best part of getting this was that it was totally free.No wonder why it's free, though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice stories, strange appearance on Kindle","review":"This is the oddest looking ebook I have ever seen. I looks as if it was typed on an a typewriter, with evenly-spaced equal-width letters, but the margins are justified, so there are spaces of various widths between the words. The typeface and spacing cannot be changed using the Kindle's controls.Nonetheless, this is an interesting book, more novelistic than the typical fairy tale presentation (Andrew Lang's, for example). For $2.99 I am willing to put up with the appearance. The black-and-white reproductions of the illustrations are reasonably clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Point-N-Shoot","review":"I bought this while on vacation without a camera, possibly not the best time to break-in a new one. When first 3 rolls were developed I was able to see a progression of clearer pictures and now I'm completely comfortable watching the flashing green light in the view-finder for the optimum photograph. The compact size fits in a jeans pocket while knocking around historical sites. The 3 photo sizes allow for a vast array of shots and the zoom is fairly quick to adjust before the subject gets tired of smiling for the picture. Automatic dating and even a memo can be programed to print on the back of prints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Investment!","review":"I have owned a Vectis 2000 for about three years now and have absolutely no complaints! I have gotten numerous compliments on the camera's sleek shape and compact size. It is a very elegant looking piece of equipment that fits easily in my purse and is perfect even to just carry around in my hand. I have never had any problems with picture clarity, or messing up a roll at all. The camera is incredibly durable, I have taken it overseas, on many vacations and am still perfectly happy with it. If you are looking for a compact, easy to use, VERY good looking camera, then the Vectis is for you. Also check out the Vectis 3000 which has a larger zoom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I was dissapointed with this item. It wasn't, but should have been, listed as a unisex item. I was under the impression that I was purchasing a ladies rain slicker. When I received it, I realised that this was more likely to fit a man. The sleeves were way too long and wide. Even though there is a velcro strip, when it is fastened to a average sized womans wrist,it flares out like a skirt.....not flattering. In my opinion, this jacket would be a much better fit for a man. If you're looking for a jacket to fit the average proportioned woman, in any size, I wouldn't reccommend this. I was also dissapointed with the lining. It was a flimsy net. All in all I thought this was a very cheap looking jacket. It would be okay for an emergency rain jacket that you'd leave in the trunk of your car, but you could purchase those much less expensivly than this particular one."},{"rating":"1","title":"port authority-seattle slicker","review":"I ordered size M for my husband.

I have a pair of Keens that are 4-5 years old and I've worn them out. I wanted a new pair with better traction since I do some light hiking in with my Keen's on. These were perfect... however, when they arrived they were the right size but WAY too big. My foot was not snug in them & moved around even with the laces pulled as tight as possible. Then with the laces pulled so tight, the extra lace at the top was huge and would flop around. There is no place to secure or tuck in the top lace which seems to be a design flaw to me. I have fairly narrow feet so maybe that was the problem. Though I do not typically have issues with shoe size. I ultimately returned these Keen's to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband won't take them off!","review":"Once my husband discovered these shoes it's been hard to get him to take them off. We travel a lot and also do plenty of walking in our city and before finding these shoes he has having some problems with blisters and also because he needs a wide toe box, but not anymore. These shoes are the most comfortable he's ever had and boy do they last. He used them every day for several three-week trips and every weekend and we only had to change them after two years even though I frequently washed them in the washing machine. Despite being a \\"sandal\\" he even uses them in winter. They offer great heel, arch and front support and the cradle perfectly the feet. They also give enough space for your toes to be comfortable.

So far, I've been pleased with this product, which has a nice, natural looking color (I have medium skin) and lasts well. My only complaint about this blush is that when I run my brush across it (my own large brush, not the included one, which is much too small), a large amount of the product flakes off, making it a bit messy to use.

The short story by the late Meave Binchy is a summarization of all of her classic books, I recognized the characters from several of her books, and I smiled when I remember these characters.

And there is no stopping him. Sensitive and genuine understanding of where these women come from is what makes his writing so rich. Sensuality becomes art in this story. It's hard to second guess what will come next. He taps into spirituality and helps us all understand how connected we are not only to Rowtina but to each other.

With her long, lean physique, she looks incredible. I don't know if the Bar Method is all she does to stay in shape, but judging from this DVD set, it must help. The approach is part Lotte Berk, part dance-inspired (Leonard, in fact, studed the Lotte Berk method in the 1980s), and the workouts are way tougher than they look. This exercise style relies a lot on small, subtle movements that, if done properly, are highly effective.

However, if you are used to attending the live class you will find the video less challenging than the real class. The video might seem a bit too easy.

Big ouch (in a good way). BTW, I have a chronic back problem and rheumatic knees (I sound 70? 38 actually, so no bendy young thing), and I don't have any problems doing these.

They are all similar in the way the exercises are done with very small pulses or contractions and produce very great and noticable results even after a few workouts. What makes this DVD better is that you get a full body workout in one DVD unlike Lotte Berk in which there is a seperate dvd for each target zone. Callanetics is great but really outdated to watch.

However, unlike traditional cruches, it doesn't kill your neck and back.The arm workout was on the easy side. I started out using 5 lb weights (more than the instructor recommends) and my biceps are not getting much of a workout. Good tricep work though. I have to stop the tape and do more reps of arm work for a challenge.I am getting a bit bored of the workout, but the results in my lower body have been significant enough that I will keep with it. Looking forward to the new tapes this fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"I love it!!! After waiting for soooo long for it to arrive in the mail, it came today!!! I tried out the fat burn and burn it did!! I was shaking half way through and was wobbly afterward. The entire experience was great. I have a short attention span and even shorter when it comes to working out. I will turn off a tape after 3 minutes if I am not interested, but I stuck through the entire 45 minutes. I looked up at the time and 20 minutes had passed!!! I used a chair and a belt as substitutes for the bar and band and it worked fine. You basically can take this on the go and keep yourself in shape. I have one month to lose some extra baggage, so I plan to alternate the tapes every other day and hopefully I can see some quick results. Burr is so encouraging and right when you feel like you want to quit or stop, she stops and gives you a break and coaxes you into the exercises. Overall I love it!!! I'll try to check back in a couple of weeks and let you know my results! Bri"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Bar Method - this is a keeper!","review":"This is a great slimming, toning workout. By the third workout I noticed my thighs, especially my inner thighs contouring and reshaping. I definately felt it in my buns the next day and feel that lifting as well. I do alternate the Bar Method with my other DVD's since I feel that I need more cardio. I tend to get bulky with my legs, so this workout will slenderize your legs and make them leaner looking. My sister and I inquired if they will be making new Bar Method DVD's and they are in production this month of July 2008 and will be coming out in the Fall of 2008. Well that is what they say. I will be definately purchasing their new DVD's since I know that Burr came out with some new excercise positions that are not in the older DVDs that came out in 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"If you want to know how these turbos work, thats the right book for you..........beside that you will know how to tune them right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Plate, but Beware of Shipping","review":"After two attempts to have it shipped, I gave up and bought it in a local store.

I sent as a christmas gift, which did arrive in time, but the glass dome was at the bottom of a cardboard box with some packing peanuts. My friend contacted customer service and they acknowledged a problem with packaging and sent a replacement, still doesn't make up for a broken christmas gift.

It's actually attached to the plate. I was a little taken aback because it would be easier to store cake in the fridge or transport it to someone else's house without the pedestal, but it's not a huge deal. Also, my dome had a few imperfections. Not bad enough to exchange it for another, but you can tell it's not a really expensive piece. Regardless, I'm fairly pleased with this item and like that it has more than one use! I'm looking forward to storing cakes, cookies and other baked goods in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slight imperfections in the glass, but a very nice cake server","review":"After reading some of the other reviews on this product, I almost didn't order it as I'm pretty picky and was concerned about the comments on the quality of the glass. Had I not read the reviews, I would not have even noticed the slight imperfections in the glass, but yes, when I look, I can see some waviness and a small line on the top nob where the mold pressed into the glass. This set is made in Italy, not in China, and I imagine craftsmen and women creating this set by hand and thus the slight imperfections. But I think it's a nice set and despite Amazon's very liberal return policy, I will keep it.One star off for the fact that the glass isn't perfect, but again it's a nice set at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price - depending on where you purchase it!","review":"I purchased this from one of the \\"big box\\" stores locally at a price competitive with this. It is OK for the dollars. I saw some more expensive and prettier ones, but I have kids and the chances that this will get broken are high - so this is enough to spend. This will cover a pretty tall cake and it is real good for keeping bagles fresher longer, though it only holds a few if they are large ones. For the cost I might buy a second one as I am sure I will use it. Better than having a plastic cake holder sitting on your counter.Anyway....I saw the same item on a department store site for $50.00! It is the same thing! Save your money, this is a good price and fair for the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got to use it...","review":"It arrived with the base broken to bits.

(Because Macy's carried it, I made the assumption that it would be of good quality. Wrong!!!) I was really excited about its multi-use. It looked lovely in the pictures and therein lies the problem. First of all, it's not nearly as beautiful in person as in the pictures. Rather than graceful with elegant lines, it is chunky and plain. Second of all, the quality of glass is very, very cheap. The dome, plate, and base were full of very distracting bubbles. There were even lines in the glass where lines should not have been. I was so disappointed in this item that I promptly returned it!

It was so easy and a huge relief once I purchased it. I would definitely buy again, it is attractive and very versatile! A little heavy, but what do you expect-it's glass. The ones at the stores were much heavier, plain, and only 1-2 functions. The service received was also outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly packaged!","review":"This is a beautiful set, however, when I pulled the plate out of the box, the bottom lip cracked. It is packaged very poorly, so be careful. The manufacturer needs a better packaging design. Also, the lid does not sit well on the plate, which leaves room for gaps.

Instead of building any sort of strong narrative, author John Everson chooses to burden readers with Kieran's horny daydreams and creepy thoughts for a girl barely out of high school, or overload us with the graphic details for raunchy roadside sex and a teenaged girl's masturbation fantasies. Rather than being truly a horror novel, COVENANT reads more like a lame thriller bordering on cheesy porn lit. I don't know how this book deserved a Bram Stoker award."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Demon Inside","review":"Joe is an investigative reporter who has left the big city and settled in Terrel. All is not as it seems in the quaint little town. There have been many suicides going back over one hundred years, none of the town residents are forth coming when Joe sets out to investigate the current suicide. Many people have an inkling of what is happening to the town, but are powerless to stop the evil and manipulation that has happened for many years. All of it evolves around a demon and the covenant he has struck with a circle of women many years ago.This is the second book I have read by this author. I like the writing style, and imagery that his words evoke. Some scenes are very graphic and violent. I also liked the air of foreboding that Joe had by the end of the book. I don't think he would have had an easy time dealing with the demon, Malachi. If you are looking for a horror story then this author's works may be what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a good book.","review":"I can't believe this book won the Bram Stoker Award. I was very dissapointed in this book. The only reason I finished the book was because I figured it had to get better since it was a Stoker Award winner. Wrong. This book is considered horror but I did not find any part of the book scary. Also, the sex/rape scenes were ridiculous. Clearly the author was writng out some teenage fanatsy but that does make for good literature.

I nearly turned it off within 5 minutes. I wish I had. It looks like it was shot on video. There's no use of depth of field or filters of any sort. The lighting is harsh and generally poor. It looks like a made-for-daytime-soaps production. Seriously, it looks like something off Days of Our Lives or one of those other low-production-value shows.

My problem with this film is that it is just too long and directionless. Early in the film it is a half decent black comedy with over the top gore (which prevents it from becoming scary or suspenseful), and the special f/x and performances are pretty good for the very low budget. But after a while the constant bickering between the cannibalistic family members just becomes annoying and the wait for anything resembling a plot progression becomes unbearable. It seems the scriptwriter's main goal was to showcase his skill at penning insults.

There are some songs that are very good and especially \\"Honour & blood\\", \\"Wasting my life away\\", and \\"Too tired to wait for love\\" deserves to be mentioned. There are obvious similarities between Tank and Motörhead, and if you're into fast and raw heavy metal without a single trace of so called hair metal or MTV metal you will most certainly like \\"Honour & blood\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond bad","review":"You've got to feel sorry for Nicholas Brendon. A cast member of Buffy the Vampire Slayer since the show's debut, the poor guy gets casted in crud like this after the end of the series. Brendon, along with the smoking hot Jamie Pressly and a few other unlucky college kids, partake on some fun on a tropical island. The fun ends however, when a demon infested killer pinata comes to life and kills them off one by one. Yes, you read that last sentence right, a killer pinata. The CGI effects of the monster are beyond fake, and the CGI animated explosions that occur are deliriously bad. The acting is almost non-existant, along with the story, and the blood and gore is ridiculously lame looking. Everything about this movie is just plain awful, and fans of Buffy will feel for poor old Nick Brendon.

Long delayed and kept from the general public, Pinata is both contraversal and breathtaking. 7 teens on an island; a sort of scavenger hunt gone terribly wrong. writing on par with the Bible here folks! Jamie Prestley takes her role and more or less morphs into her character. the result is a seemless gift to the silver screen.

Let's get to the movie, if you can call it that. The \\"basic\\" premise of the film is that a group of college students travels to an island to join in a scavenger hunt... they open up a pinata that contains all the bad vibes from an ancient tribe. People run, monster chases them, people are killed. There's nothing in the film to really make you jump out of your seat (if you haven't fallen asleep yet) and the intensity level was nil. Problems with the film: the character development is non-existant so you never really care if one of them get's killed by the obviously computer animated pinata-monster. They could of at least gotten good looking actors / actresses or written a script. If you thought Scooby-Doo was scary and Ishtar was exciting I highly recommend Pinata... otherwise stay far far away from this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Budget Horror Film","review":"Hunky boys and cute sexy girls are running around an island being chased by a pinata monster.

The special effects were INCREDIBLY bad, the acting was terrible, the death scenes were way too expected, and the ending was so obvious from the start. This movie is beyond help. A total waste of time. I am only writing this review to try and shake some sense into people dumb enough to actually dish out money to buy this lame excuse for a movie.

Within the first 10 minutes I had already picked out who was going to live until the end and who was not. Everything about this movie I had seen somewhere else. There's the token black character, the broken up couple who gets back together midway through the film, the pot smoking teens who unleash the beast and get killed shortly after, distorted shots from the killer's perspective... the list goes on. The CGI on the pinata was terrible, and the acting was mediocre at best.

PLEASE be sure that you get separated from the group, so that the monster can single you out and kill you!Haven't we all seen enough of these that we might actually believe the girl who has the initial encounter when she comes back totally terrified and tells us what happened?

The teens are obnoxious enough that you want bad things to happen to them, but the little monster just isn't quite funny enough to make it total camp, and his attacks (while being thoroughly ridiculous) are really rather vicious.

Needless to say, I could not even sit through this entire monstrosity...what a worthless waste. What they should have done was have this pinata explode killing everyone on the set including anything remotely resembling the making of this movie...that's how lame and absolutely pathetic this movie was.

Why does the author feel he needs to criticize Jon Polito's performance in Miller's Crossing, and why does he think we'd care?

My girls found this exasperating, and so did I. My opinion is that rules can be taught *as* they are needed rather than before. However, enough people swear by this method that I'm *sure* it has its merits.Find a copy to look at before you buy it. Read it thoroughly. Like many people, I found the book difficult to understand even after reading it from cover to cover three times.This method looks inexpensive until you add up the cost of supplemental books, classes, etc. For the price of those things, there are many other programs out there which are much easier to use and have more child appeal.

Their wish to take other Jews down with them is, however, unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book ignores Arab Anti Semitism","review":"The book totally ignores Muslim AntiSemitism. With massive Muslim immigration to Europe they imported a new type of very virulent anti semitism.

Israel is the only bright spot in the middle east, the author seems to ignore this and puts all of the blame on the victims of arab genocidal hatred... but it's ok to hate, rape, murder, and steal. as long as you do it to a kaffur (non-muslim person)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book - Waste of Time. Lacked Logical Thinking","review":"This is a poorly written book by Michael Neumann. I am an avid reader and love to read about the different perspectives regarding issues which are important to us today, although this book is not worth a penny or the time. His claims clearly go against reported and factual history, and if I had to make a decision - the land should be the land of Israel.This is a hateful text with virtually no scholarly support - Israel is the land of the Jewish people and this book makes me lose great respect for all Arabs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"Michael Neumann should be ashamed of himself.

Most Americans brainwashed by constant Zionist propaganda don't understand that Israel was the colonial creation of British imperialism and American militarism inflicted on a helpless people who were too weak at the time to resist. Israel is comparable to the Boer regime in South Africa, or the medieval Crusader States that were imposed on the Arabs in the Near East. In short, it is a ruthless, aggressive and sadly successful attempt to colonize a people and suppress them and steal their territory. So far it has been successful, though finally the subjugated people are rising up, as best they can, to resist their oppressors. The last thing the Zionists want is that you understand this. Neumann's book will help you to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Buy","review":"From the title this sounds like its some good softcore sexy stuff. No sir. Boring, lame, NO NUDITY!!!!

Forty-five minutes into this film, the puppets have only appeared three times in new scenes, twice for less than a minute (Pinhead and Jester), and once for about a minute long sequence where Blade sticks a Nazi in the calf. A long sequence early in the movie simply regurgitates PM1 where Blade is racing against the Gestapo to warn his master of the danger. Been there, done that. I'm sure it is cheaper to film human actors yakking endlessly about their problems than to pose or computer generate the puppets, but the franchise has been successful, so I fail to see why they have to recycle cuts from the older(and better)installments and why they insist on writing such bad and cliched dialogue for the human actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete fail","review":"simply put this was a disappointment, dont waste your time with this.

I called the manufacturer and was pointed to this rug on Amazon. The colors are much more vibrant than the picture shows (without being obnoxious with the colors) and the rug is absolutely lovely. I get compliments on it often.The only reason it is 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is not quite as good a quality as the one I saw at Home Depot, and the pile is very thin.

I was raised in a close-knit Irish Catholic environment and rarely had contact with Jews or other non-Catholics as a child. I finally met, lived with, and made lifelong friends with Jews at Princeton (undergrad), Columbia (MBA), and in the work world. But even after these experiences as a university student and a working adult, I never really understood what Jewish culture was all about or what accounted for the great success of the Jewish people in the face of many serious threats they had encountered over the centuries. \\"The Jewish Phenomenon\\" has given me valuable insight into seven principles that have allowed Jews to contribute to society far beyond their numbers.

When I tried to exchange the Susi II for the Susi Deluxe, all Amazon would offer was my money back. So some time after making the initial order, I have no garlic press at all.

I have no trouble with it. The only complaint I have is when a garlic is pressed, some of it does not go all the way through the holes but flow back to the press and make a mess.Also, my wife, who has nice small hands can't use it. The handles are apparently too short for some people that more strength is required to press just a small clove of garlic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job perfectly","review":"I bought this press because Cook's Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen recommended it. I agree with the \\"Why so enthusiastic?\\" review in spirit, but I'll tone it down a bit. This garlic press is the only one that performs as well as it should. When you pop in a non-peeled clove and give it a squeeze, it extracts all of the pulp and all of the juice (sometimes with a surprising amount of force), just leaving a dry peel in the basket. To be fair, I've used three garlic presses in my life. The one the my Mom had (which is awful; garlic oozes back around the plunger and takes four presses to get reasonable results), a Kitchen-Aid press (the removable basket snaps through the holder, preventing a full press) and this one. And by far, without any doubt, this one tops them all. It reinforces my belief in Cook's Illustrated's methods. 5 stars without any reservations."},{"rating":"1","title":"paint came off!

It's so easy to just squash, peel and chop or mince a clover or two. I've done it all my life. But the Susi is marvelously simple - you dont even have to try to peel the garlic. Just pop it in and presto, chango, crushed/minced garlic. Just wipe it off into the pan (or whatever) and keep going. Cleaning is a snap, too. I dont understand these complaints with the plastic cleaner.

So there IS a better product available - somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best, without question","review":"To echo what one of the other reviews said, you can buy other garlic presses, but you'll eventually have to get this one.

I've owned it for four years now and I expect that it will last for many years to come. This is an item I use almost daily in my kitchen. It's durable and built to last. Well worth the investment. I would buy any product with the Zyliss name."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are people thinking?","review":"I'm baffled as to why anyone gives this garlic press a postive review! I found it's performace to be completely sub-par.The spines on the lame plastic \\"clearing implement\\" are prone to bending, making it difficult to align the pegs with holes.The handles are too short for a solid grip, and worst of all, pressed garlic often shoots up and out the back of the press, all over the person pressing. (It would be comic if it weren't so infuriating.)This press made the Oxo product (which, granted, broke) look not so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zyliss Susi Deluxe Garlic Press","review":"I love this product. It is the best garlice press I have ever used. I use it all the time. The only problem is that it does not come with the gadget to clean the garlic peices out of all the little holes in the press. However, I just soak it a bit in hot water and throw it in the dishwasher. But, again I love this garlic press."},{"rating":"2","title":"For more than Garlic","review":"I've owned one for many years and its been bulletproof. I bought one for my mom and told her that it works better if you don't peel the clove but she doesn't listen. Leaving the peeling on makes it easier to clean and doesn't waste any more garlic.Try it with ginger. Peel and cube a bit of ginger and crush it in the press. Its a little harder to crush than garlic but you get fresh ginger without all the fiberous material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be VERY careful. Potential health hazard.","review":"Watch out if you think Alzheimers might be linked to to much aluminum in your diet.

My 3 month old one is pushing out gray discolored garlic now, so it's in the bin. This is my 3rd one to do this over the years, so no way I am getting one of these again.Remember that a lot of the reviews here are from people who have had it only a short time and it will not be exhibiting this behavior for them yet.The design is the best I have found, but why did they paint it?? If they made it out of stainless, I would give it 5 stars. But right now my health is to important to risk using this product anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"ZylissSusi DeLuxe Garlic Press","review":"My first garlic press, and a winner! I researched these and think this is the best. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and I use it daily or more! You don't have to peel the garlic before pressing and it will still work just fine. I have arthritis in my hands, and I still have the strength to press the garlic, and it comes out perfect every time. I do find that to keep the holes in the head of the press clean that it helps to run a vegetable brush over the outside. Seems like there is always one piece of garlic that wants to plug a hole. But overall, I'm completely satisfied and won't be without it EVER AGAIN! Regrets?

And yet, I want to say it. I use garlic a lot in cooking, and had pretty much given up on garlic presses, as they were all rather annoying. But in a last ditch attempt I was convinced to try this one, and well... ok, I\\"ll say it, this garlic press changed my life. You don't have to peel the garlic, it actually presses the garlic out through the holes (instead of up around the back of the press - we've all had that happen too often), so you never need to touch the garlic, whcih means you don't have the oils all over your hands. It makes adding garlic to anything so easy to use that you wind up using it more frequently. With the handy dandy tool, clean up is also easy. It is the little things that work in a kitchen that are really worth buying, and this is without question one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's my garlic press, Target?","review":"I had this garlic press before and loved it.

That someone could smile, and smile, and be a villain.Shakespeare's wonderment was at human duplicity - that people can smile and project a wonderful image, and yet be duplicitous and, as in this story, even a murderer.The plot is wonderfully wrought: a murder takes place during a live radio broadcast, and the station, at the height of its popularity, wants to make sure that it gets solved quickly and finally. Who else beside Nero and Archie can deliver the goods?While it is not the best Nero Wolfe of them all, this is a strong story with some fascinating characters.

This book has so much going for it - the plot, the interaction between Archie and Nero, and the most powerful and dangerous villain of all. And it is set in a world where radio is still king.

But, wanted to give it another try.Generally I like the content of the articles, some are quite inapplicable to me. Unfortunately, it looks to me like the articles have gotten smaller over the years, but same level of quality and attention to detail seems to be there.My main objection is that when I subscribed to the magazine I didn't realize I was signing up for fundraising letters.

Yes, it's riveting - perhaps the film's deftist feat is its way of hooking the viewer back in every time the two characters threaten to part ways. But by the end I hated the actress and wasn't terribly fond of the journalist. I felt like I'd been enmeshed in the lives of two people unworthy of my time and attention. Also depressing was the ageist message/resolution. Made me nostalgic for films in which age and experience counts for something durable and respectable. Instead, this just drives home today's youth-uber-alles viewpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"The DVD jacket is totally misleading in its trying to sell the film as a comedy \\"with a twist\\". In fact, the writing is pretty bad, the directing is worse, and acting is wooden and stereotypical. Sienna tries hard but has little to hold on to.There is very little of interest here to attract the casual film watcher. The personal dynamics does not work, in fact, Buscemi is awfully irritating in his quasi-journalist role and I kept asking what would the Miller character see in Buscemi's ineptly played persona.84 wasted minutes.

This is Picasso as celebrity entertainer cartoonist, not the edgy artist genius of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon and Guernica. It looks as if he's painting with magic markers on screen and the action is speeded up so it looks like a cartoonist at work. I turned it off after 30+ interminable minutes.

That's what OMD did on \\"Junk Culture.\\" Processed horn sections, electronically filtered vocals, quirky percussive efects all never sounded so magnificent....and to think this was just a light pop music record. Critics? What did they know? They were too busy drooling over Van Halen's latest back then. OMD was not music for rock music critics; a primitive life form that could not possibly grasp an electroacoustic journey like \\"Junk Culture\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Junk Culture-Loved The Title. It became my first OMD purchase.","review":"After buying this I fell in love with OMD and the album spent a lot of time on my turntable(dating myself). I never cared for instrumentals and always skip them so I ignored the title track, but the rest of the album was great. The songs have aged pretty well and my favorites are ones most people ignore. \\"Love & Violence\\", and \\"Hard Day\\" are brilliant. \\"Love & Violence\\" captures the behavior of a couple going through difficulties in their relationship with chilling accuracy and \\"Hard Day\\", does the same for the working class. This is a great CD and is enjoyable on many levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"About ten years ahead of their time","review":"This album blew me away so hard when it came out--more innovative and original than anything at the time. OMD did have their own quirky vocal flavor, which may explain their limited popularity. Personally, I loved this album then and I still do. These guys were simply genius. I'm listening to this album as I write this. It's the first time I've heard it in more than ten years. It still strikes as intelligent and honest, with a waterfall of soul and emotion coming through compelling electronic sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"There are a few songs on here that most people will definately know right away if you're already familiar with OMD. Locomotion, Tesla Girls and Talking Loud and Clear are all available on the OMD singles collection. As with all OMD, there are a few lesser known gems on this album as well. Songs like Hard Day, White Trash, and my favorite song, Never Turn Away. Although I don't like this album nearly to the extent that I like Organisation, Architecture or their self titled debut, this is far better than Dazzle Ships. OMD never went through a time where I disliked all of their music, but there are definately alums that are superior. This one falls kind of in the middle. It seems like they abandoned their more introspective and thought provoking music in favor of poppier and more radio friendly sounds. Not that this is all bad, OMD were successful at everything they attempted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book to Learn French!","review":"This workbook is a very good book for a beginner.

Tea is placed in the infuser, off boil water poured on top and the brew process easily gauged by the clear see through design. Once the perfect steep is achieved, compress the plunger and the steeping process is terminated. The double wall design is not as efficient as a vacuum container but keeps the rather small volume more than hot enough to finish off a perfect pot.My only reservation is the sense of impending doom stemming from the very thin laboratory style glass. This is not a pot to leave out in the open as it the spout and handle look particularly vulnuerable, but so far so good.

I think my six year old likes it more, onlly because he knows how to make the chair \\"talk\\". My one year old is still trying to figure this part out. He does however like to put his stuffed animals in it and he knows that when he sits down in it it \\"talks\\". The chair does exactly what I thought it would; I just think that I should have waited until my youngest was a little older to get it.

Instead of sitting on the chair to make the sounds, he pushes the seat with his hands. Usually, he can play with it for 10-25 minutes at a time. One of his favorite toys. The only flaw---my son now tries to stand next to the chair. The chair tips easy if he tries to do this. Hard to explain but if you have a baby who's becoming interested in pulling themselves up and standing, have the back of the chair against your couch or something stable so it doesn't tip over.

It also does not fit in with my educational philosophy. There is no stimulation for the imagination here -- it is the same thing over and over. And it is made in China. Once you put it together, it cannot come apart, so it will never fit into the box again.

Because of this, the cheese came out in clumps or not at all.I would advise cheese enthusiasts to spend a little extra money for a better-constructed grater -- or else buy the grated cheese in a can."},{"rating":"1","title":"This grater isn't great.","review":"Granted, this grater is advertised as a grater for hard cheese, nuts, and chocolate, but it didn't specify only cold chocolate! Trying to grate room temperature chocolate in this utensil only results in globs that have to be pushed through.And, wouldn't one think most nuts are hard? Not so. Walnuts are smashed rather than grated as are Macadamia nuts,After the fiascos with chocolate and nuts we didn't even try for the cheese!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be put off by the plastic; this grater rocks!","review":"If you are comparing graters and thinking \\"ech, plastic! I should get the metal Noro grater\\" well, don't. This grater works far better and is much more comfortable to use. And it will last. It is made of a very durable plastic by Zyliss, a Swiss company that makes excellent kitchen tools.Zyliss also makes a plain ordinary can opener, but unlike the usual metal ones you get from the grocery store, theirs works amazingly well. In short, Zyliss knows their stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best HARD CHEESE grater on the market.","review":"After seeing the Zyliss grater used in so many restaurants, and unable to find it locally, I was so thrilled when I was able to order it online. It delivers everything it promises and more. I have tried most other brands before, and none comes even close to the performance of this little marvel. My wife being French, she insists that we purchase REAL ITALIAN Parmesan, and uses it almost every day. The instructions state clearly that it is a grater for HARD CHEESE, dry nuts, and chocolate. We have used it for all the above and had extremely good results. The cleaning being so easy, as there are so few parts to clean, we haven't seen the necessity to put it in the Dishwasher, but I am pretty sure that it would not be damaged if one has the good sense to put on the top basket. Will recommand it without reserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grater","review":"This is a neat little grater that is handy to use for small fresh portions of grated hard cheeses, like parmesan and romano.You really can't use it for soft cheese, nor would I use it for anything but cheese, as I find plastic will take up the odor of various foods. I haven't tried as I have had this experience with other plastic items.You can't use it for large quantities either (more than a 1/2 cup), as you will end up with arms like popeye, if you try. It isn't much exertion, but after a while it can be tiring... I know I tried.I think everyone bought theirs when they first saw them used in Olive Garden 5 years ago. They serve their very fresh salads with an option for freshly grated cheese on top... One great way to add more fat and calories to an otherwise healthy diet...

It is a basic, easy to read book that also puts across a powerful message on how to be a successful caring person for what is a very challenging time in a person's life. Dementia is very challenging because it starts slowly and can be terribly frustrating for the caregivers. I was able to get the local library to obtain a copy and was able to refer folks there if they were not able to purchase the book. I am worried that for some reason it is not currently in print!

It felt like an overdrawn episode of \\"Unsolved Mysteries\\" but without the cool music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The waking dead","review":"The movie,the actors,the script and particularly the direction are as lifeless and wooden as any movie I have ever seen. Crudup's performance is either an all-out emoting chewing-the-scene kind of display or a sullen male model pout with nothing in between. The other members of the cast and crew don't fare much better but then with a cliche ridden script filled with platitudes false emotions and pseudo left-wing jargon, its hard to place too much fault on them aside from their decision to be in the film to begin with. No, the brunt of the blame for this pretentious claptrap should fall squarely on Keith Gordon from the clumsy flashbacks to the forced rabbit-kissing loves scenes to the absurd close-ups of Billy Crudup looking like he's rehearsing in the Actor's Studio trying to wake the dead lines that have been forced on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Have Got To Be Kidding Me","review":"I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.

It's not that he's done the same thing again; he never does that. Gordon this time has made a beautiful love story with Billy Crudup, one of the most under rated actors out there. His performance is so powerful. I don't want to ramble on and give anything away about the movie.

Billy Crudup as Fielding gives a beautifully honest portrayal, of a young politician trying to hold on to his beliefs and the beliefs of his deceased true love as he enters the \\"machine.\\" The dialogue is pure literature, yet not beyond everyman. The cinematography is absolutely haunting. You must own this film. The DVD conatains 45 minutes of cut footage as well as a featurette. I have yet to watch the film with Keith Gordon's commentary. Warning: have kleenex or a dry sleeve available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the ratings for this movie.","review":"I didn't care for the choppy style - the way the film was put together.

I will probably never watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate love","review":"I acknowledge the objectiveness that people can have to say that this story is not a love story. It addresses so many things that are not love, but they are all contingent on it. \\"Waking the Dead\\" is one of the greatest love stories I have ever seen, and I have seen many. I have never seen two actors, Crudup and Connelly, so entirely enveloped in each other. They played off of each pther amazingly. With respect to the story, I feel that it speaks of the kind of love that many of us can only dream. That one love that loves us despite our conflicting ideals, ideas, and desires. The final scene of the movie is probably what haunted me the most. Crudup pleading for reasons. Reasons for why his love had to leave him, and leave him the way she did. It also inspired me. It showed me that with the kind of love that they shared, life can go on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like \\"Ghost\\" but good!","review":"This is a beautiful film.

But keep in mind that the movie was made mostly using an 8mm camera in the 60's or 70's so the quality is grainy and there's no widescreen version which is the only thing that really upsets me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Very disappointed.

I vaguely remember Ali from his televised fights when I was small and held some interest in the man as a result but purely because of his boxing capabilities. What I got from this film was a peek into his charisma, intelligence, and personal values. By focusing on the Rumble in the Jungle fight the director brings out these qualities.What I find equally interesting about this movie is what we learn about Foreman who, at the time, had none of the charisma and was not politically engaged in the issues Ali was. In many ways this fight shattered Foreman and it took many years before he overcame his bitterness. I think in many ways Foreman, due to his lack of charisma then, was misunderstood, and you see his frustration in the movie.This is really a movie about both men, both noble in their own way, and how they were changed by this fight and how they changed those around them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD unable to play in Asia pacific region","review":"Unfortunately the DVD is not a compatible format for our region.

It's much the same for Jaco with \\"Dead Air,\\" except here it's the other way around. He's lived through the excitement and now he wants to try his hand at being an author. As a result, he ends up just as much a hack; in his case, the facts are there, but the writing's not. The characters come off as stilted stereotypes instead of breathing, passionate people. Next time, Mr. Jaco, snag a ghost writer and let him or her put your experiences into a more appealing story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"It's hard to think of anything positive to say about this novel. I suppose that some of the technical military details the author worked into the story are mildly interesting. But the plot is silly, the characters are cartoonish, and the writing is absolutely amateurish. I'm shocked that something this bad is considered publishable. Ballantine Books should be ashamed of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting technical info on first gulf war","review":"For those curious about difficulties faced by grunts on the ground in Kuwait & Iraq, this novel provides fascinating insights while eschewing direct unit combat descriptions. In addition, it furnishes some technical information about the creation of TV news with its equipment. All of this data is background to a thin plot line that moves fast from place to place. The culmination of action contains a major surprise. Lead female character helps maintain a taunt pace. A pleasant beach read."},{"rating":"1","title":"error in kindle version","review":"I am reviewing the kindle version of this product.

I purchased the kindle version of the book, which looks great at first but has one very simple but catastrophic error. --The answers for the cases precede the case images and case questions! (You can download the sample before you purchase to confirm this). The whole point of the case review series is to be able to take the cases as unknowns, the answers are revealed after your best efforts at reaching the most likely diagnosis. The reversed arrangement of the kindle version, where you see the answer first defeats that purpose, and makes it unusable. This is not a mistake on Amazon's part, its just how the publishers arranged it. If the arrangement is changed, then this will be an equally phenomenal purchase, in which case I will be first in line to buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ghost was a gift from her father...","review":"As usual, Gibson opens with an intriguing line then proceeds to send the reader on a wild ride in a beautifully imagined world. This is the third in the Neuromancer trilogy and would be confusing to those who haven't read Neuromancer or Count Zero. Of course if you've read either of the first two books you probably can't wait to read this one. Well, it's worth the wait. These stories will be hallmarks of 20th century literature and that's no mere hyperbole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best science fiction ever","review":"I love the whole Neuromancer trilogy and even when this isn't the best one of the three, it's still very very good.

I read Neuromancer, which I thought was an awesome book, and I read Count Zero, which was good but sort of boring. Mona Lisa Overdrive however was a true masterpiece true to Gibson. The environment, so dark and un-organic paints a dark picture in your mind that is so real and tangible in a way. Cyberspace and the computer-driven networked world also played so much of a part in this simply amazing imaginary world. When it matches with the characters so nicely you can't discount the book because it's so enthralling.

Since the Canon of the bible (The New Testament) was compiled by the Catholic Church, it's a Catholic publication. So to say that Catholics don't believe in the bible is akin to arguing that a mother doesn't believe in the existence of her own child. McCarthy, like Boettner, the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan is simply anti- Catholic. He takes half-truths and history out of context to support his own prejudices. Bible Christians lack the history, the physical presence during the time of Christ and the Tradition of the Catholic Church so they have to make up lies to denounce it. This book is a foundation for those lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"James McCarthy hates the Bible","review":"Catholicism teaches everything in the Bible and that make James McCarthy mad!!! James hates many of the Bible's teachings and just wants a feel-good religion where one can have a good time on earth and still be sure of heaven. He hates all of Jesus' hard teachings, as well as Paul's, Peter's, James', etc., all inspired by the Holy Spirit. When Paul writes, \\"Do not be deceived...\\" (Gal. 6:7) McCarthy thinks he was joking. The last laugh will be on James McCarthy. Let's all pray he comes to a complete Biblically based faith instead of his man-made, stripped-down version of Christianity before it is too late for him and the others he is leading down the wide path to destruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"NonCatholics don't realize","review":"...that there is NOTHING the Catholic Church teaches that is contradictory to what Christ taught.

If that is too uncomfortable, watch Catholic television (you know the channel) silently in your own home. Why not go to the source? A thorough, open, and truly objective inquiry would help to prevent the publishing of pamphlets and books filled with misconceptions and misunderstandings or at least offer a well-balanced, well informed document. I was baptized Catholic as a 2-day old baby, raised Evangelical Protestant and am now a devout practicing Catholic. I did not jump into the faith, but rather educated myself; asked questions, sought answers and I find these types of books so severely uninformed. This and other types of similar publications are propagandaism and rhetoric in the purest form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are Catholics not Christians?","review":"I was highly offended by this publication because it was Anti-Catholic. When you open it up the sub title is something like, the 62 Errors of the Catholic faith. It proceeds to state Catholic Beliefs on one side and the \\"Bible Teachings\\" on the other, which are day and night different. How offensive; we all know Protestants and Catholics have differences in translation, but to make it look like facts that Catholics are wrong is irresponsible of the author. It also states not to be premature about helping your \\"Catholic\\" Friends find Christ - give me a break - I have Christ in my life, and Catholics and Protestants are both Christians. I think the pamphlet should be re-written to summarize the differences, as that is fair. I am dissapointed to have found that pamphlet in a Christian Bookstore - I do not get offended easy, but I was offended enough to bring it to the store manager's attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"As a former Protestant minister who is now a Catholic priest this is not the resource you need to understand Catholicism.

Christmas Carol book from my childhood. My mother's family parties included my singing cousins (some 10 of them) who stood around the piano as I played from the Rittenhouse collection, which contains both favorites and some less-well known carols. The arrangements are sophisticated yet easy to play (I first played them as an 8-year old piano student) and in good keys for most singers.

I am not sure what was in between, but I can't think of much that would interest me on this one. I guess I should have had an idea when I looked it up here on Amazon and see the lack of any description at all. I guess that's why I went ahead with this review. Maybe it will help someone who wonders about it too. I would venture a guess and say there is no description because there is not much to describe. Sometimes even the best ideas need work.

While watching it, I kept on wanting to push the FF button to see if I could find a good part. It wouldn't have mattered. Berg should have given the actors the dignity of wearing paper bags over their heads while being in this movie. In fact, they should do a gimmick movie out of this, remake it, using the exact same script (like the new Psycho), call it Very Bad Movie, and give out written apologies to everyone who buys a ticket, signed by the director."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's torture to sit through this film","review":"I was under the impression that this was supposed to be a comedy. Don't make that mistake yourself, because you won't laugh once during this film unless your name is Ted Bundy. This movie has no other point than \\"if someone disagrees with you, kill them\\". To make matters worse, none of the characters are even likeable. They are all just cardboard cutouts who stand around and swear at each other. It's a waste of quite a few good actors. Don't write me off now as being a softy who wouldn't like this kind of movie, because I do enjoy dark comedies when they are handled correctly (i.e. Pulp Fiction, Fargo). The bottom line is that nothing about this movie is worth watching.

So I thought this movie, hyped as a very dark comedy, would be right up my alley. Sadly, apart from a few moments here and there, \\"Very Bad Things\\" simply fails as a comedy. And it fails as a drama, because every single character is unlikeable and unsympathetic. That's too bad, because the actors are fantastic and do their best with the material given to them. I fault the script, which has problems at best, and the direction and editing, which give the movie a strangely languid character at inopportune times.

The only message is that all the good or wrong you do in your life can be back to you....but what a sadist way to show it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Violent and Over-The-Top Black Comedy","review":"Very Bad Things is a wild black comedy about five friends that go to Las Vegas and have a bachelor party and when one of them invites a stripper,one accidentally murders her and that leads to another murder and then all five bury the two dead bodies in the desert and head back to L.A. and when the wedding is around the corner.Everyone starts killing each other.Some parts are funny but others are so outrageous and wild that it makes this unwatchable and it feels like a wasted rental.Worth a rental or watching on TV(Comedy Central shows it).The excellent cast includes Christian Slater,Cameron Diaz,Jon Favreau,Daniel Stern,Jeremy Piven,Leland Orser,and Jeanne Tripplehorn.Written and directed by Peter Berg"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Was Totally Outrageous!!!","review":"If you watch this movie and say, \\"Ugh! That's sick!\\" then you're missing the whole point of the movie. I liked it because it was so unrealistic. I commend Peter Berg and the cast for going along with a crazy idea that grew more insane by the minute. I loved this movie. It was very dark and hilarious at the same time. But I didn't take a moment of it seriously. I wouldn't suggest you do that either because if you do, you won't like it because it is extremely violent, contains graphic (almost gratuitous) sex scenes, and the language is graphic too. If you watch this movie, watch it with someone who sees a movie for what it is... a little entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Movie","review":"I did not think that this was a very good comedy whether Dark Humor or not. For me five guys who try to cover up various murders is not that amusing. Cameron Diaz, who played the persistent bride, was lousy and did not seem to fit well into the overall picture.Granted there were some funny moments in the beginning, but things got out of hand in a hurry. After the first two murders, the killings made no sense and the plot went nowhere. There was alot of shouting and yelling in the picture which only made things worse.I am glad I only rented this film and did not pay full price to see such trash. My advice is don't waste your money on this so-called movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick, Slick & Very Funny!","review":"Maybe I have the strange and famous \\"British Sense Of Humour\\", or maybe I'm just plain sick. I thought VBT was the darkest and funniest film I've seen in ages. I long for more political correctness bashing like this - and excuse me if I'm missing the point here, but Robert Boyd (Slater) wasn't all bad. His heart was in the right place, what with wanting to protect his friends from the consequences of what was quintessentially, an accident.The chainsaw scene was a little too much, even for me, but the ending was fabulous. Diaz' character severely got on my nerves throughout the film with her miniature seating plans and hysterical bride-to-be tantrums etc. but she certainly got her just desserts at the end. Slater's done a few \\"on the edge\\" roles now and should do a few more - he plays a psycho SO well.I haven't laughed so much for ages, but I must apologise to the other people in the cinema who probably thought they were sat with a maniac in the midst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist Pricks","review":"Does the hooker / stripper REALLY have to be Asian in this scenario? And does this scenario have to happen at all? She's killed by a nail going into her head while she's having sex. It is literally sex and and death, and once again sexualizing violence against women.

This movie is pretty black... but really does lack the humour!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is a comedy...","review":"... this is a very sick comedy. As the title implies, the movie involves some very bad things, indeed. If a comedy involves an exaggeration of something, this one is an exaggeration of the greedy side of human nature that doesn't want to be caught doing anything bad. This is not an exploration of human nature, guilt, or greed; it is an exploitation of these things - a horrible exaggeration."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this movie NEGATIVE stars, I would!","review":"I am in disbelief as I read some of these reviews. COMEDY? Puh-LEEZE! Any so-called comedy is far superseded by the mindless violence and utter stupidity and duplicity of both the plot and the characters. At best, this movie would be a morality play (subtitle: \\"Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Spineless, Soulless, Duplicitous, Murderous A*******\\"). What scares me is that the movie tries to make these guys look like they could be the average Joe next door.

I seldom take time to write a negative review but this movie is just so awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a typical movie","review":"I have never seen a movie that made me feel so uneasy as this movie did. I can't say if i liked it or not. I don't know if i would tell someone to see or not. It was unlike anything i've ever saw. It is by far not that funny, the cover is misleading. I guess i liked it only because it is so different. Good acting and directing. \\"Pulp Fiction\\" type of movie, dark. Just keep telling yourself it's just a movie. Give it a try, just be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top ten movies of all time!","review":"This is one of those movies that you can't stop thinking about for three days. Hilarious dark comedy, excellent acting, twisted plot, all the ingredients for good entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"TO SEE WITH NO PREJUDICES","review":"First of all: if you want to see and enjoy - and laugh out loud - this movie, you have to get rid of your prejudices. This is more than a black comedy, but it comes to show actitudes of real people. Believe it or not, I'm sure many women would be very close to do the same that Cameron Diaz did in the film to achieve its unique objective in life: getting married. But, if that kind of girls saw this movie, I belive they would review their priorities. Christian Slater and Cameron Diaz are superb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very BAD things is right!","review":"I WOULD GIVE THIS MOVIE NO STARS IF I COULD! This movie was horrible.

Sure, it's not lightweight dumb comedy, but I was laughing all the way (final scene is something really cool) If you like dark humour and really original movies, you MUST see VERY BAD THINGS! And you will remember that doggy in final episode for a long time :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinematic Trash","review":"Cameron Diaz and Christian Slater must have had some bills to pay, Its a shame that drive-ins are going the way of the do-do because this would be a great B-movie feature. No plot, No engaging story, Kind of like 8 heads in a Duffle Bag meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING HILARIOUS ABOUT MURDERING PEOPLE","review":"This movie would have been better if from the beginning they were not trying to make the situations they were in funny. There is nothing funny at all about murdering people whether it be prostitutes, security guards that take bribes, or your best friends. THe time I guess I was supposed to laugh I was more appaled by the moral aspects, then even find it a little funny. I was dissipointed to see Cameron Diaz in that rather bitchy role that was preety stupid if one thinks about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!! Not the comedy its hyped up to be !!!!!!","review":"I rated the movie one star because they compared the movie to \\"Something about Mary\\", which is a true comedy. But dont get me wrong, the film does not go without merit. If you expecting a gut wrenching comedy - forget it because it's not! It's actually a tale of something that innocently goes wrong but goes awry. Every scene thereafter complicates matters worse by outdoing the previous one, creating even a bigger mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete idiocy.","review":"This is the worst kind of movie; It wants us to think that it is deep and philisophical, but it is complete garbage. Peter Berg has no understanding of the human thought process and needs to stick to directing (i'll say why later). There was nothing funny about this so-called \\"black comedy.\\" If you think I am saying this because I can't handle violence and such, you are mistaken (I can be pretty twisted). If this was played out as a suspense, and the script revised a bit to fit normal people, it could have been a cool movie. On the positive side, the acting was almost great (besides Cameron Diaz's generic psyco) and the shots and angles were near perfect. Christian Slater scared the **** out of me! Without a grasp of reality and an ability to find *real* funny material, Peter Berg will be reduced to making well acted pieces of trash. P.S. Two seperate times people who should be dead were kept alive longer than humanly possible. This made the movie even more of a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent & Disgusting, a complete waste of time.","review":"I believe this movie will be in the \\"comedy\\" section of video stores,( at least Blockbuster) WHY? In the first 45 minutes you get to see drug and alchol abuse, prostitution, and two violent murders. It just gets worse from there! Its a shame that such a group of actors would put out such garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Bad Thing","review":"I was drawn to this movie because it was billed as a \\"dark comedy\\" I thought that meant that it was supposed to be funny, at least on some level. But, it wasn't funny (darkly or in any other way). It was not suspensful because it was predictable. It did however feature a very hip cast... except for Daniel Stern and Leland Orser who provided us with the extremities of acting (overacting and no acting). This movie reminded me of the late HBO series Tales From the Crypt, minus the cryptkeeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Lame","review":"\\"Very Bad Things\\" does contain all of the necessary elements of a dark comedy. Unfortunately, the mark of a truly great dark comedy is how effectively it drives its satirical point home, and this is where \\"Very Bad Things\\" lacks. It takes pokes at a variety of topics, but never leaves you with a feeling that you've affirmed or uncovered some great universal truth. Well acted, but not even close to being the best dark comedy ever (Dr. Strangelove gets my vote). Get this movie ONLY if you have to choose between it and \\"Ishtar.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you trying to make people attend therapy??","review":"I thought this movie was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Just when it started to get bad (the first 10 minutes) it got worse. This movie has little to no plot and leaves the audience with a feeling of disgust and resentment of spending their time see such a horrible film! Movie buffs, spend your time and money somewhere else, unless you are \\"Very Depressed Already\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCARY!!","review":"i am hardly ever shocked, but freak out!! this movie shocked the heck outta me!! its like they took every shocking and bloody thing that could happen and threw it all into this one movie!! i had to cover my eyes sometimes cause i couldn't believe how morbid it was!! it was disgusting and not very funny. pretty sad. i don't care if its black comedy. too black to be comedy. dont' waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"sick and twisted","review":"I am amazed at how many people liked this movie. But then again the movie review in the papers were all \\"must see.\\" Also surprising is the fact that it got released at all. It is demeaning to the intelligent and sophisticated mind, and demoralizing to view. With movies like this out there it is not a wonder at all that we have the problems in this world that we do. Forgo this movie for almost anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't I pick \\"0 stars\\"?","review":"After reading some of the reviews in this list, I thought I'd give the movie a try. News Break: This movie is NOTHING like \\"Shallow Grave\\", \\"Heathers\\" or any of the other black comedies I enjoy. Slater's character is a F-ing psycho, Cameron Diaz is a whiny brat (which was refreshing, though still annoying) and most everyone else was just sort of there to be used as props to either be killed or verbally abused. Everything seemed strained, as though the filmakers just wanted to push the envelope as opposed to doing something with real originality. Probably the most annoying film since \\"Eight Heads in a Duffle Bag\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unentertaining violence","review":"I have seen quite a few black comedies where the violence in the film adds to the whole plot. In \\"Very Bad Things\\", the violence is just there to sicken. Diaz and Slater should be ashamed to put their names to this garbage - it really shows a sad and twisted side of life that is just disturbing. I have never seen so many people - myself included - walk out on a film before."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Comedy\\" at its worst!","review":"I am an educated, openminded person, who loves to watch movies, but this one took the cake! I have never seen anything so morbid in my whole entire life! It makes the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, look like a sunday walk in the park!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Things = Even Worse Movie","review":"About as much comedy here as you'll find in an ingrown toe nail. The film relies on guts, gore, stupidity and a lot of shouting between the characters rather than an intelligent script. I can't help but compare this with the somewhat similar \\"good plan goes awry\\" plot of A Simple Plan. The latter film develops emotion for the characters - even the not so nice ones. There's not a single main character in VBT that causes one to even care what happens to them. VBT does not work as a comedy - even black comedy (try Fargo if you want to see a textbook example). It doesn't work as drama. There's practically no character development. This thing just plain does not work! The only saving grace to this movie is the incredibly gorgeous young Asian lady who plays the prostitute! The director should have kept her character alive and killed off all the rest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Definitely one of the top ten worst movies of all time. The description of this movie sounded like it could be funny, but it is instead a painfully unfunny attempt at dark humor.The characters are not realistic, and the bad acting only made them worse. Cameron Diaz's character has no point in the movie, and Christian Slater was so horrible that I kept wishing his character would get killed off. Most of the movie consists of several people screaming at the same time, very annoying and hard to sit through. The story line starts out with a plot, and then goes nowhere. People just keep getting killed off and it just gets repetitive and predictable. I was hoping that this movie would get better at the end, but it just kept getting painfully worse. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BERG YOU SUCK. Sincerely, Marty","review":"What do you get when you put a bunch of good actors in a movie and have them scream at each other for 90 minutes? Plenty of dark comedy in that! It's funny cuz they kill more people! Then they scream some more! Then Cameron Diaz screams too! Then they all scream for ice scream! WAKKA WAKKA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reprehensible, irresponsible poorly concieved snuff-comedy","review":"Everybody involved with this rancid nightmare should be ashamed of themselves. Especially the lame-o stars who took to the TV circuit to say 'It's okay to laugh at this movie' in response to the near unilateral disgust experienced by early audiences. As if it's wacky and funny that five coked-up honkies impale a chinese hooker then stab a black hotel security guard while holding lame, uninteresting discussions about the morality of it all. Cameron Diaz's phone-in role is on screen for all of 3 minutes. A monument to the decline of film company respect for the audience. Why do you think so many of the ads showed only big pink lettering? Because there's nothing worth seeing. Don't confuse this witless work for another Heathers, or Something About Mary. Steer clear. Your eyes and brain will thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Key word: Annoying","review":"Very Bad Things is very hard to sit through, although it had its moments. Slater aside, every single actor manages to annoy the hell out of you throughout the whole move. They accomplish this though constant yelling and profanity. Horrible script. The plot itself is thin; It seems like it was written in about a day. Every thing that happens is totally unbelievable and not realistic. The characters are so annoying, you don't give a damn about them. I would rent something else! ~also Cameron Diaz is hot, but don't rent it because of this. She is not in the movie much, and when she is, you will be ANNOYED"},{"rating":"1","title":"One death leads to another, to another, to another....","review":"How dissapointed am I? I love dark comedy, but this one missed the mark entirely for me. I really thought with a cast like this that this was an underrated gem that slipped through the cracks. Well, I can honestly say (and I know every previous reviewer has said it) that it lives up to its title.Basically Favreau is getting married and so its off to Vegas with his best friends for the bachelor party. The stripper is killed by accident and then the blood bath continues as covering up one accidental death is not as easy as they planned. I'm sure each cast member that gets killed off was relieved when it was their time to go to escape this pointless mess. I have never wanted to punch Cameron Diaz more than everytime she opens her mouth in this movie. Not to mention Daniel Stern and his non-stop freak outs. The whole cast deserved better. Save yourself the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad things indeed","review":"What a horrible mess! Despite a great cast, a great premise and a first-time, promising director, the movie fails miserably to succeed. It's like a terrible, missguided experiment in black humor. Those in search for a true black comedy should try Todd Soldonz's \\"Happiness\\". Those who think that Christian Slater's role was a good \\"Jack Nicholson\\" imitation, should take a look at \\"Heathers\\", and those who think Cameron Diaz was truly wicked, should watch \\"The Last Supper\\". 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very, very bad society we live in","review":"that could condone the production and marketing of a film like this. I'm convinced that eveyone who gave this film 4 stars or above also ordered Time Life Books \\"Serial Killers\\" for some reading enjoyment on a rainy day. Lets face it, this movie represents a very sick scenario that when it actually does happen in real life, the perpetrators get the death penalty or life in prison.

Yeeeaah...Leah, on the otherhand, is portrayed as a vapid, shallow, & emotionally weak woman who uses denial to deal with her problems. Michael & Leah together are plain toxic!

At least ten times better then \\"Adventures of Sonic\\"Negatives: Horrible charecters being cramed down your throught as Sonic's brother and sister, who are searching for their mom who for some reason is hiding. Even worse, hard rock music numbers near the end or during every episode.

Boring story, painfully acted and visually dreadful. We wasted 60 minutes of our lives hoping it would get better before we finally gave up. I have never in my life asked for a refund until Brothers Grimm. The theater manager gave a knowing nod and cheerfully refunded us our money. Too bad I can't get a refund for those 60 minutes of my life that was stolen. Miramax/Disney should be ashamed for putting this film into release.\\"Ditto--except I wasn't smart enough to ask for a refund! *slaps head* Needless to say, this is the only film I ever walked out of. It put my husband and me to sleep. We kept sitting there scratching our heads trying to figure out what was going on before eventually giving up."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Grimm indeed!","review":"This movie is a really dark mess; total waste of time.I once read a bio of the real Bros Grimm which said they were linguists who collectored the stories told by persons they encountered while traveling for research. Many European tales are scary indeed, but we have the brothers to thank for preserving the folk heritage.Too bad they didn't make a film about the real story. Maybe someone will yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you really wanna know?","review":"The plot is contorted, like my back after watching this film. The story bounces around, touching slightly, and wrongly, on several of the fairy tales that we all heard about. there were no moments of sheer excitement or raised bar. It was as low as filmmaking gets. Everything was out of order barely making comprehensive sense. It's jumbled. Even the jokes felt strained. It's not worth it. It really isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Movie","review":"The plot for this movie went off on tangents, but even before taking the tangents into account the plot was incredibly weak. Maybe its a good scary movie for elementary aged kids. It wasn't scary, it wasn't funny, it wasn't intelligent. It was all I could do to even finish the movie, which I did, in the hopes that it would somehow redeem itself. It didn't. It was beyond a waste of time, it killed brain cells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Turkey","review":"It has been years since I have so hated a film. Rent it and cringe if you must, but don't even think of buying it unseen.When the film did not simply drift from one act of random violence to the next, it meandered into scenes of astonishing sadism performed by absolutely repellent characters with bad accents.There was little to no plot, the effects are choppy when not gorey, and the story was minimal and composed of scenes stolen from dozens of much better films. The only bit of Gilliam genius in the film were the dozens of little fairy tale quotes that punctuate the action.An absolute waste of time on par with Munchausen. My advice to producers: For god's sakes please stop giving Gilliam big checks. He makes excellent films when reined in on a tight budget, but monsterous piles of celuloid excrement when given tonnes of cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Horrible film, full of cheap shots and horrible special FX. I rented it and wish I had saved the four dollars.

It has nothing to do with the real brothers Grimm, and nothing to do with their fairy tales either. It has an extremely silly plot, and the characters are too grotesque to arouse any sympathy whatsoever. The film has nothing to recommend it whatsoever, except that it does end eventually. You could make a good film out of Grimms Fairy tales. This isn't it. Watching it was a grim experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my all time LEAST favorite movies","review":"I dont like to write reviews about movies. However in this case I will make an exception. This movie was a jumbled mass of complete garbage. I have read all of the original brothers grimm stories and they are in itself dark enough in their original form to hold up a modern movie. But dont expect any continuity of plot from any one grimm story. Dont expect that any one point in the movie really makes sense. At times the story is so dark people dying left and right and the main characters are marveling at the special effects. Half of the time I was wondering if one of the brothers was retarded or mentally impaired. Usually if a movie is this bad I would walk away and start washing the dishes or something. However this was so bad that I just stood there in shock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brothers Grin","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.Suspend belief, receed to your childhood and enjoy immensely"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it...","review":"I had moderately high hopes for this film going in, but was sadly disappointed.

Did you just need the cash?","review":"Terry Gilliam is one of my favorite directors, or at least he has directed some of my favorite films.I had forgotten that he directed this terrible film when I watched it this afternoon ,in fact I commented to my friend that this would be a good movie if Terry Gilliam had directed it.When the credits finally rolled I almost cried to see his name there.This is a very bad film.It didnt have to be.It could have been great.But very poor casting, uninspired performances, over use of so so(at best) CGI, a terrible script and the most uninspired and weak direction by a previously artful often edgy and always strong director's career, results in this being a very weak film and it grieves me to feel this way.I can never again trust that a film is good,or even watchable just because it is a Terry Gilliam motion picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"or maybe not\\"","review":"Fractured, spastic, jerky; a make-it-up-as-you-go series of special-effects sight-and-sound skits without wit or humor or drama, though the result is usually startling since you have no idea what's coming next.This show will doubtless please fans of Terry Gilliam. Others, don't even think of buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've Been So Much Better","review":"A movie or television show is really only as good as what the writer(s) create. While the visual sets and special effects were awesome on this film, the storyline was so bad that I felt sorry for the actors in the film.

But, unfortunately the script and the director never matched thier quality.First off, if you are expecting any Grimm tales in this movie, you will be disappointed. The Grimm tales are just brief snips scatered through the movie, none of them shown at any length.Also, the director can't seem to make up his mind if this is supposed to be a funny movie or a scary one, the result being that it's neither.Great potential in set decoration and scene design that are wasted in a poorly written and directed story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brothers Grimm","review":"Will and Jake Grimm are traveling con-artists who encounter a genuine fairy-tale curse which requires true courage instead of their usual bogus exorcisms. This is one of those u love it or hate it movies. Effects could have been better but all in all not bad. I loved it, it has humor, action, ect: basically it has a little of everything. I don't think you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"cat cruelty warning","review":"I watched Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm. I am sickened and appalled at the use of animal cruelty as humor. The scene where a fluffy kitten gets chopped up in a machine is totally unacceptable. It does not add anything to the story and is clearly added as a sick attempt for humor. I am familiar with Terry Gilliam's previous work and feel this is a new and disturbing low. Animal cruelty is not funny. I recommend a boycott of this movie and all of Gilliam's work. Animal right's groups have worked too long and hard to stop animal abuse to allow this kind of warped humor to be used. We need to show that we will not stand for this kind of treatment of animals in films. It is simply not acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"This is a great movie! But, I also love this type of fairytale. I thought it was creative and interesting, the characters were wonderful too."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe all reviews.","review":"The Brothers Grimmas with some movies this one does not quite live up to what the studios presented it to be. It is well done, but is more of a comedy then a great thriller. The main characters are a bunch of con artist that have been forced to solve a real magical curse and a mystery. They do however it showed great courage and the special effects were well done. This one is worth the price and will most likely be watched more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was very good but...","review":"I thought it was a pretty good movie. The plot was good and I liked the fairy tales mixed together. However, there were some slight animal \\"gore\\" should we say?

Minus, thoses parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie:) Streaming:(","review":"We were VERY disappointed with the quality of the streaming video!!!

We will never use streaming video service from here again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One time was enough","review":"My friend and I saw this movie in theaters. I figured that being it was directed by Terry Gilliam it should be a really good movie. I was wrong. I personally feel the movie is too long and drug out. For only being about 2 hours long, I felt more like it was 3 and a half. Towards the end I was thinking to myself \\"Can we just get this over with already?\\" I was so bored with it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Sooooooooooo Much Better!","review":"Saw this yesterday, didn't expect anything and that's pretty much what I got. Some of the special effects were cool, the storyline was very weak to say the least, I can appreciate the intertwining of the classic fairy tales however the gags pretty much made you go hugh? through the whole flick. Matt Damon should stick to his Bourne parts and stay away from this kinda film. I think Ledger was okay, maybe pairing hime with Matthew Mcconahuy would have been a better cast. Don't waste your money, wait til it shows on TV or rent the DVD to say the least, definately not a movie for kids either, then again some of Grimm's tales are pretty Grim as well. I would have much rather seen this be a Tim Burton thing, if he would have been involved would had been kinda like Sleepy Hollow! Oh well, nice try Guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...Could They Have Made This Any Worse?","review":"It is truly disappointing when a movie with such unlimited possibility is trashed by inept acting, poor effects, and a director who cannot seem to decide where the movie is going. With such a cool premise, the movie just turns into a bunch of garbage that is unbearable to watch let alone get involved in. I was glad this was a free rental at the local video store. I would have been ticked off had I spent a dime on this crap. Consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"What a waste - a waste of the $8 for the ticket. A waste of the actors, who are much, much better than this material. A waste of the many special effects. A waste of the location and sets.It's not the worst movie ever. But then, I haven't seen every movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Seen Worse Films.....","review":"Hmmmm, disappointing movie for the likes of major film stars Matt Damon and Heath Ledger.I like the premise of the movie being that of the Grimm Brothers and how they may have come up with the fairy tales they wrote! But other than really good special effects, I can't say the movie was really worth watching! Pass on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess! - Miss it!","review":"I was initially intrigued by the possibilities of a plot combining an action movie with the tales of the Bros Grimm, but also had my reservations. Unfortunately, I did not listen to that little voice in my head and went to see this film. What a big mistake and what a huge waste of time! I was moved at several points to get up and leave the theater - in the end I wish I had. A cohesive well laid out plot and compelling story line would really have been nice things to have!! And the sputtery, awkward acting was most likely a result of not really having anyone at the helm on this ship. Save your money on this one folks....Miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GRIM INDEED","review":"In typical Giliam fashion, this movie is pretty to look at and is very dark and unique. I found the movie keep my interest, it really does not flag. Alot of it is hard to believe, all the coincedences and luck, but i was cool with that. Damon and Leger are very good, though Leger seemed to be a channeling a west hollywood coke head, but whatev; it works i guess. Overall, id highly recommend it for its unique story telling, beautiful sets and quality acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. Really Bad.","review":"There are few movies that I am not able to see through, no matter how bad. This was one of those. I tried twice. I don't think I got more than a half hour into the movie. For a movie that was such intense action, it was so BORING!Really, there was nothing good about this movie. Not even the star studded cast was able to salvage it.And in case you say to yourself, well, she didn't see the whole movie, so she can't give a fair critique--a friend told me the plot to the end. It doesn't get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films ever!","review":"I'm a big Terry Gillam fan...Brazil was genius...but this movie will go down as one of the worst of all time!

I doesn't know if it's a comedy or a horror film. Too bad it's neither funny nor scary. I'm a big fan of fantasy and the cast is first-rate but the whole thing falls flat with a giant thud - you'll want the two hours of your life back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy fun!","review":"This movie was very fun, but you cannot take it too seriously. (Um...the director is Terry \\"Monty Python\\" Gilliam, so there's really no reason to EXPECT anything but fun and silliness.) Two brothers con their way to fame and fortune by pretending to be early 1800s ghostbusters (of the witches and demons variety) in French-occupied Germany. They run into trouble, though, when the French military catches them. In exchange for their lives, they must rid a small, German village of real haunts that have been stealing away children.This movie has mediocre special effects and so-so acting, but everyone is having so much fun that it makes the entire film a real treat. Sure, \\"Army of Darkness\\" did this kind of cheesy-horror thing better, but this one is still enjoyable. Put your mind in neutral, pop a big bowl of popcorn, and enjoy the endless twistings of fairy tales and nursery rhymes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grimm film","review":"This film reminded me in a way of Tim Burton's 're-imaginings'; Terry Gilliam has taken the story of the Brothers Grimm and come up with a novel twist - but one that fails - this one has the Brothers as some kind of 'Ghost-busters' who go around solving ghostly problems for customers.This is quite profitable for them until they are engaged by Jonathan Pryce to do a job, and it turns out there's a real super-natural crisis going on.And Jonathan Pryce kept popping up in the most annoying sub-plot of the entire film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Gilliam, but ...","review":"I like Terry Gilliam's stuff. Brazil is wonderful and Twelve Monkeys is the best time traveling movie ever, but this movie does not click. It starts off really slow, I gave up once. The second time I fast-forwarded through sections I saw before and was able to make it all the way through. There are some good moments and it does tie some loose ends together, but it is just too weird. The non-fantasical world is stranger than the enchanted forest. The happy ending works, but it was a very convoluted and nonsensical path to get there. I can't recommend this movie. It is Gilliam's worse movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this made?","review":"I will keep this simple.Disapointing, horrible, waste of time and money.A previous reviewer stated that you need to knock back a few drinks to get through this movie. I agree...knock back enough to pass out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpectedly gory, predictable with a really bad ending","review":"The Brothers Grimm was generally without plot, cruel to children and small animals, gory without cause and just plain stupid. The acting from the main charaters was fine, but the rest of the cast was terrible. In the end, neither of them get the girl and the evil queen doesn't die. Please don't take your children to see this movie!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A light hearted horror story","review":"As a person who often enjoys horror stories its disappointing.There is nothing particular gripping in this story. The special effects are just okay as is the acting is on the poor side.The story seems to owe almost nothing to the Brother's Grimm. TheBrothers themselves seemed out of place, American style con men in occupied Germany. The French soldiers acted quite stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it would be a lot better","review":"When I went to see \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" last weekend I was expecting a great film because Terry Gilliam,(The Monty Python Series) directed the movie. I was very very wrong. Indeed The Brothers Grimm had cool special effects and it was fairly funny, but that was not the problem. This movie did not have a good story, it had poor acting, and very dumb humor.The major problem I had with this movie was it was like a puzzle, Gilliam took bits and peices out of other movies, storys, and fairy tales that didnt fit but he still put those scenes in there anyway. Which in the end, the final product looked horrible.Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinematic insanity","review":"Take the frantic, scene-jumping weirdness of Time Bandits, a few of the more absurd elements of Shrek (you'll know them when you see them), and a great deal more of the 1990's remake of The Mummy than you might expect, put them in a food processer and blend them to a paste, then smear it on celluloid in a haphazard manner and you get a fair representation of The Brothers Grimm. It is a hyperactive, disjointed movie that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up.That being said, there are (few) moments of real humor, and even a vague suggestion of something that was almost brilliant, but missed by a wide margin.Watch it, if you must, for a truly remarkable performance from Heath Ledger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Whoever came up with this movie has one really messed up mind. I really did not care for it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugghhhh..

In a more than dismal attempt to tell a story the producer slaps the audience with a series of incoherent scenes and mediocre acting. I cannot believe this movie was released to the public. I have seen much more elaborate works from directing students. I even doubt that kids will enjoy this heresy. Adults: you'll probably get more enjoyment out driving through a long tunnel than watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It...It burrrrrrrns.....","review":"This movie took a great idea and completely eff'ed it up. While amusing at times, this movie just doesn't cut it. Heath Ledger was amusing enough to make me stay, but otherwise, this is one ugly duckling."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the real-life story of The Brothers Grimm!","review":"Being a fan of Grimm's Fairy Tales and the Grimm Brothers, I originally thought this movie was going to be the life story of the Brothers Grimm and how they got their inspirations for their re-telling of old, classic tales (in a similar style to the movie Finding Neverland). It WASN'T! The movie made the Grimm Brothers out to be like they're idiotic con-men turned action heroes, not to mention that it shifted WAY too much into the fantasy spectrum (in which they come upon a real magical forest with moving trees and such). This movie was way too unrealistic for me and I didn't stick around to see the rest of it because I was so disappointed. So if those of you are under the impression that this movie is based on the true-life story of the Grimm Brothers (like I was), it is NOT. Don't waste your time or money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"This movie may look interesting, but it is incoherent and trivial. Not really worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very harmful movie!","review":"For 3 generations our families children were read stories from the Grimm Brothers. Then when i was a child myself i saw on the huge Cinerama screen \\"The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm.\\" What a wonderful piece of work and it has become a part of my collection of Videos until it's released on DVD.This new version is a drug trip gone wrong in Hollywood. There is NO WAY you could ever take a child to see this film. He would be scared out of his mind. What has gone so wrong in Hollywood that they can distort wonderful literature. Those people in Hollywood are getting more and more pervertly sick in every way. No wonder people are not going to the movies like they use to. To me, it shows how the Hollywood film makers looks at life. Everything to them is violent. I was just going to say something bad about Terry Gilliam, but then i would be just as guilty as he is. This is the beginning of the end for Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe: Something of no value; rubbish","review":"Acting = annoying.Story = silly and insulting to one's sensibilities.Typical hollywood idiocy.Complete with degrading pretensions.\\"The Christians cut down the forest\\".How childishly stupid.Don't waste time or effort with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim Brothers Grimm","review":"Everything is not for everyone proves true as I viewed 'Brothers Grim'. The film exuded boredom. The mundane acting by supposedly top actors caused my eyelids to droop. The film elicited neither excitement nor suspense. Not one chuckle passed my lips. If this film were free, it would be overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money, mislead by Ad trailers and promos","review":"The movie begins as did most of its promotional advertising showing the Grimm Brothers being heroes. Alas, they're frauds, charlatans who bilk money out of local people while the Grimms pretend to vanquish witches and anything the villages live in fear of. As just desserts the brothers are nabbed by a French General (Jonathan Pryce), but instead of punishing them, he uses them for his own designs. At this point my interest in the film waned considerably as Damon & Ledger appear to be nothing more than frightened mice (even appearing dressed as scullery maids while they are forced to scrub floors by the french soldiers). The ending does have a pay-off as Ledger eventually musters up the courage to save the day, but it took so long to get there, it was a waste time and my money and these days that's saying a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only mildly amusing.","review":"The main reason why this film is important is that its presence on the shelves of (mostly used) video stores with serve to raise the question,\\"Why does the much better film released in the 1960s'The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm' continue to remain criminally unavailable on DVD?\\"The answer can only be that the contemporary American film industryis only interested in making as much money on as much mediochre \\"product\\" as it can,and is abyssmally ignorant of the rich treasure trove of folklore that COULD be suitable for cinematic interpretation existing internationally:especially in this case from that rich vein of storytelling gold and gemsthat the brothers Grimm mined in the mysterious environs surrounding Thuringer Wald."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tick tick tick goes the DVD counter...","review":"This is a really horrible movie. There is absolutely nothing going for it. I had to turn it off after an hour and I can't remember the last movie I didn't bother to finish watching.Terry Gilliam, aside from his legendary work with Monty Python, is probably the most overrated director there is. Jabberwocky and Time Bandits were horrible. Brazil and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas were hit and miss. His last good film was Twelve Monkeys...from 1995...11 years ago; and it doesn't look like he'll ever make another one.So skip this one...or at least skip the first hour...who knows, maybe the last half was pure genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Truly Awful Movie","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Other than that it was actually a waste of time. If you spend two hours doing something in your life you should do something that you can look back and and say, \\"hey, remember when we--?\\" But The Brothers Grimm is not one of those times. I actually fast forwarded it about 90 minutes into the film to watch the rest go jogging to the end. You can't blame the actors as some on the review board did, it's really not their fault. Blame the script writers and the lousy lines these people have to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame is this movie !","review":"it gets one star for the short bits where no well payed actors played their roles, the kids showed more talent then the stars of this film. the rocky movies had more of a fariy tale effect then this movie could dream of. seems like a poorly planned cash rake off the backs of movies like lord of the rings . very sad both the main actors , have been good in allmost every other film they have been in, with exeption of knights tale . wouldnt recommend watching this movie even if life depended on it , death would be a sweet release from this Z class film. and while the CGI was very bad not even a 500,000,000 dollar budget could save this flick , even the french mockery was lame ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not everybody can be Tim Burton Or Spielberg....","review":"So if you saw it in a theater like I did you lost 2 hours...so imagine owing it in a dvd and watching it all day!!!

If that wasn't enough all the acting or over acting was sub-par at best. The actors seemed to be trying to act like other actors while in the movie and doing it badly to boot, so to sum things up this movie is crap don't watch it and count your self lucky that you did not waste your money or time on this desolate film.

Sometimes the visuals don't thwart the rest of the film, sometimes they do.In Brothers Grimm, the visuals overwhelm a film that would have very little going for it anyway. Terrible dialogue, confused plot, poor acting (by excellent actors) -- all under really poor direction.Why are so many characters -- Heath Ledger, Jonathan Pryce, Peter Stormare, among others -- given pointless, thick, accents which, when coupled with painfully confused dialogue, make them all but incomprehensible? Why in the remote village setting, are so many different accents piled on top of one another? Just an example of revoltingly bad scripting.To his credit, Gilliam manages to hold the film together through to its conclusion, but that's about all. It amounts to getting most of the passengers off the ship before it sinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 STARS FOR ART DIRECTION -- 1 STAR FOR MOVIE","review":"There's a saying: \\"No one sets out to make a bad movie.\\" BROTHERS GRIMM (Miramax) might prove otherwise. Near the beginning of his commentary, the usually brilliant Terry Gilliam actually says, \\"I didn't like the script, but I was out of work.\\" Not a good sign but an honest admission from the former Python.Although wonderfully visualized, the Czech locations can't make-up for the muddled mess of a screenplay culled from perhaps the richest mother lode of raw story material available anywhere: The collected fairy tales of Wilhem and Jacob Grimm.In spite of stars Heath Ledger and Matt Damon as con artist exorcists who encounter real evil, a great poster and an OK trailer, audiences rightfully stayed away via quick word of mouth (\\"incomprehensible\\" \\"unwatchable\\").

In addition character development was not gradual but went from one extreme to the next in almost a scene. I would say that it relied to heavily on brothers grimm stories, but i cant honestly say. Ultimatly this film was seriously lacking in direction, and the plot was weak at best. I would strongly suggest looking for something other than this film"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute idea poorly executed","review":"The Brothers Grimm seems to have started with the germ of an idea \\"What if fairy tales had a real basis?\\" That's a good start, but the movie went off the rails after that.The story line was muddled, somehow including the French/German political landscape of 1810 in the plot. The characters are uneven.For example, there is this truly horrible Italian torture specialist who goes from being a terrible and annoying character to a sympathetic character towards the end of the movie with little explanation as to why. The same happens with the \\"Trapper\\" girl who loses her skins partway through the movie and starts wearing pretty dresses.The conflict between the brothers in unclear and seems to center on one's dreamy nature and the others cynical realism. But the conflict is poorly managed and doesn't play out well.The ending makes little or no sense. Overall, a disappointing effort. Perhaps they ran out of time to hone the script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real brothers Grimm flipping in their grave!","review":"The script was clumsy, and the special effects were unprofessional.

I really had trouble believing that Terry Gilliam actually signed his name to it, he would probably have done better by letting Alan Smithee take the credit, if Mr. Smithee were still around. And I guess Matt Damon just needed the money.There was something resembling a plot, disjointed as it was. So it was better than \\"Van Helsing\\" which had no plot and was exclusively about the special effects. But \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" stands as yet another testament that you cannot make a good movie out of a bad one by throwing money at it in the form of an endless barrage of special effects. Especially when the rest of the production is done on the cheap in eastern Europe using glorified extras with unpronouncable names masquerading as actors.

Ragardless, what I can do in either case is place the storage lid on top to keep everything fresh until the next time I use it. The lid is an extra purchase for the Oxo.2. The Zyliss is more fun (at least in my opinion). The movement is much like starting a lawnmower, yanking on the cord.

As it is, the frenetic pacing, cuisinart-style editing, and migraine-inducing visuals wind up merely wearing us out in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy on blu-ray!","review":"Don't buy this movie on blu-ray, buy regular DVD version instead. Movie can only be watched if your have connected your blu-ray machine to the internet with an $80. router.

Regular DVD is only option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't play no matter what on Samsung bdp-1500","review":"As others have noted, there is a problem with this disk. Others have found a work around for their particular player (memory card,internet connection). All of these \\"solutions\\" failed to work on my Samsung bdp-1500. This is not the first release that will not work on this player. I ordered a sony player which should remedy this. If the blu ray format is going to gain acceptance,a disc should just play.

There are constant overtures of sex and insane stunts that even a 5 year old wouldn't believe (I wouldn't let anyone under 17 watch this). Jason is an awesome actor and this was the only reason I bought the movie.

While the original was fresh, and exciting, this sequel is stale, vulgar, boring and borders on the pornographic. The plot wanders and strains to find a storyline amid the mindless set pieces. I could only watch half way before loosing my lunch and turning it off. No, I don't care how it ends. Save your money unless you want to see Amy Smart naked and performing graphic simulated sex ( very demeaning for this actress ).

I've all the latest firmware updates and it still doesn't work. I wouldn't recommend buying the Blue-Ray DVD until the problem is fixed. I've tried it on another Blue-Ray DVD and it still doesn't work. There is definitly a problem with the Blue-Ray version of this movie. I added a SD card and it now works fine although i wasn't using BD Live, since i didn't have an internet connection.

This movie is so bad, if it had been aired on network tv, I would have skipped the show and watched the commercials.

Basically whoever wrote it, loves strippers, whores and nudity and sick violence. The better movies he's done are The Italian Job, Transporter, and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. To me, Crank 2 is worst than the first one and it has no plot. He is capable of much better movies like the ones Bruce Willis does. I don't recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD Doesn't Work With My Sony Blu Ray","review":"I love this movie and think it is hysterically funny.

Crank was a nice closed ended movie, then they ressurrected the series by beating the dead horse with an even more improbable storyline. Chev Chelios has, you guessed it, one hour to do something again or he dies. This time, he has get his heart back or he dies, and has to live longer than the one hour, so he keeps having to shock himself to keep his artificial heart pumping. The skin exposure is more, vulgarity is more, the gore is higher, the action is still present, but the flow is aweful. Plus they keep throwing in jokes that are not funny. Jason Statham must have really needed the money. I really liked the first film, but this one could have sat on the shelf.

Not worth of money to spend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crank 2: Low Wattage","review":"I enjoyed the first Crank movie. It was silly and fresh, and it had a good sense of humor about itself.Since it begins with the resurrection of a dead protagonist who survived poisoning and a helicopter plummet, Crank 2: High Voltage obviously needs to be even more tongue-in-cheek, and it is. It's as knowingly silly as a movie about a action-hero with a faulty mechanical heart can be. HOWEVER, it is extremely vulgar and gross...the violence, language and nudity is all excessive. You may find it entertaining, I just fast-forwarded to the ridiculous end. I expect Crank 3: Hypoglycemia to come next spring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone read the script?","review":"With good reason, the critics have not been very kind to Crank 2: High Voltage. I must ask: Jason Statham did you read the script? (No.) Did your agent read the script? (No.) Did your manager read the script? (No.) Did anyone read the script? (No). Didn't think so. This movie is horrible on many levels. Its caliber is so low that it called for an amateur actor, not a mid-career or veteran actor. In addition, it could not pass for a made-for-tv film. Final analysis: mindless script filled with filth, soft porn, and little action (in comparison to Statham's other films), remotely entertaining, contributes virtually nothing to Jason Statham's body of work or the film industry. ...FAIL."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievable","review":"one of the worst statham movie ive ever watched. poor decision making on his part when he accepted this role"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to it's previous","review":"Good movie, but it's only an hour long! It seems throughout the movie that they even struggled to make it that long.

Definitely not amazing like the first though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever!","review":"Okay maybe not the worst ever-there have been some truly terrible movies made-but it certainly was a disappointment & deserves at least honorable mention for the Worst Movie Ever title.I liked the first Crank and loved other Jason Stratham movies.

Anyone connected with this film should never have another job in the cinema business. It has no plot beyond Mr. Statham chasing after a dyed hair Chinese brat with a $4.95 mini-thermos with Statham's heart in it, lots of bullets flying around strip bars, while Statham constantly shocks himself on everything from doggie collars, Tasers, to 3000 volt transmission cables to keep his temp-heart ticking.

I found it very disappointing. Jason Statham is good as always and his character is still immensely likeable. Too bad I can't say as much for the film itself.

Everyone chosen for the book made a conscious choice not to have kids and doesn't regret it. Each has a facinating and fulfilling life.

There's an unprecedented prologue, where Joe Leaphorn recaps the plot, then there are several places during the narrative when the events are recapped, and it gets distracting.Even Jim Chee's romantic life is reviewed in some detail. I hope Tony Hillerman is well, and that we have more to look forward to..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par with other Hillerman stories, and factually inaccurate","review":"I agree with most of the other one star commentators that this book is a great dissappointment. There is very little real plot, and it is endlessly repeated over and over. Spoiler ahead!The worst part is the trip down into the canyon. Having hiked down into the Grand Canyon this story assumes the readers will never come within 500 miles of it. Meaning that Hillerman's description has no basis in fact whatsoever. The Canyon is amazingly vast and complex. The idea that the characters could just walk down and randomly bump into the body with the father's arm nearby is just plain silly.The earlier books in this series are excellent. Skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"George Guidall does a great narration!","review":"CD/unabridged: Book 17 of the Joe Leaphorn & Jimmy Chee series. I've listened to two other books by Hillerman and he is a very good story teller. This one was written about four years before Hillerman's passing and is short. I was surprised to see that it was unabridged and only six discs.In this one Leaphorn, retired, recounts the story of an airplane that crashed in to another and fell to the Grand Canyon while trying to prove the innocence of a simple man. I like it because I learned something; most of it doing with Indian culture. In a flashback, you learn the story of how Chee and Bernie went into the GC to find the diamonds and the wrist. The ending was a little fulfilling. I've read several novels that have a \\"male rain\\" that wipes out everything. (Another one, just this year.) It was an easy out and shortened the storytelling.George Guidall does a great reading with a lot of flavor of the west."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skeleton Man","review":"What a disappointment!

The characters were carefully delineated, as well, the personalities distinct. This novel feels like it was cranked out to make money, the characters have turned into simplistic cartoon forms. Anyone could fit into the various roles, Hillerman characters or anyone else's. The plot is interesting but that's it.

In it, he carefuly weaves together a story involving input from various people and events that help Joe (and Jim) solve what ordinarily would be so complex a mystery, even the FBI would simply overlook most of the real story that exists in layers under the wind-swept playas south of Shiprock. It's a very enjoyable story, because of Tony's well-developed characters as well as the well-developed story.

It's barely a mystery; Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee do little detecting and the \\"mystery\\" is solved unrealistically with little more than a few questions, a walk down a trail and dumb luck. Worse, there is little character development. Leaphorn and Chee are not in the book much, and Chee seems quite unlike himself. (His fiance questions whether she wants to marry her \\"hard-voiced sergeant.\\" Hard-voiced? Chee?) And worst of all, several stories in the book are repeated over and over and over. What's happened to this wonderful series?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much plot","review":"This latest Chee/Leaphorn novel does not do enough to distinguish itself. What sets Hillerman apart from other mystery writers is the rich evocation of Southwestern landscape interwoven with Native American cultural and lifestyle descriptions. The plots are usually more or less interesting foils for this cultural/landscape portrait. When overly complex plots about corrupt Belagona behavior dominate the books the \\"real\\" Hillerman is diminished. Such is the case with Skeleton Man which does not really get interesting until Chee et al descend into the Grand Canyon near the end of the book.Unfortunately, this is the case with most of the later Hillerman books. I long for the good old days of \\"The Blessing Way\\", \\"Thief of Time\\", \\"Listening Woman\\" and \\"The Dark Wind\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real letdown","review":"I've read all of Tony Hillerman's Leaphorn/Chee novels and looked forward to this one eagerly. Disappointing is the only word to describe my feelings about it. The narrative point of view jumps all over the place, and the reader never maintains an identification with any of them. The plot is not very interesting. We don't see enough of Chee and Manuelito to care much about them. But perhaps the biggest difference between this novel and the previous works is in the atmosphere. No one created a sense of place better than Hillerman. But like the narrative technique, the atmosphere here is diluted. Grand Canyon in a rainstorm just isn't as interesting as the off-road desert of New Mexico.Perhaps as readers we don't want writers to try something new. I hope that is not why I didn't enjoy this. I try to imagine that this is the first Hillerman book I read--would I read another? Honestly--no. I can only hope for better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skeleton Plot","review":"I've long been a big fan of Tony Hillerman but I have to say I'm disappointed in his latest novel. The plot is thin and Hillerman constantly interrupts his narrative and obscures the storyline with asides about Navajo and Hopi culture. He's always been commendably sensitive about native American traditions, but he's lost much of the suspense his earlier novels featured with his extraneous references."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read with old friends","review":"Sergeant Jim Chee and the Legendary Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn are like old friends I grow more comfortable with and fond of with each story. As always with Hillerman, the tale is well told, the plot is tight, and the author's love and appreciation for Native Americans--and their cultures and the land to which they are conneced--shines through. The twist here is a realistic and enchanting adventure down the Grand Canyon. It's my favorite so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skeleton Man Skeleton Man Skeleton Man ...........","review":"Not one of Hillerman's best. The story line is thin and obvious. But most aggravating is the repeating of story facts....over and over and over and over again. Leaphorn has basically a cameo appearance. Not a bad effort if this was Mystery/Adventure 101."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bury it","review":"Skeleton Man is not one of Hillerman's best. Details of the story were needlessly repeated--how many times do we need to know why Joanna Clarke was looking for the diamonds and the bones of her father? Even the plot was weak with a miraculous appearance of the Indian woman to guide Bernadette to the hidden diamonds. Though the landscape descriptions and details of Indian lore are interesting, they are not enough to carry the reader through the story. I hope Leaphorn and Chee have more compelling adventures in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor book, no plot, no follow up.. nothing","review":"Its an easy book to read, but with a very bad story, it begins ideas that it never ends.

We also get the great first-time intros of some of the best villains--Baron Mordo, the Dread Dormammu, and Umar the Unrelenting.The 'modern' reader, won't necessarily appreciate a lot of these things when compared to the current generation of writing in other comic books (like the edgy X-Men, Avengers, etc).

Tiny print masks gross verbosity","review":"I've read lots of academic books in the course of studying for several degrees, but this has to be one of the most impenetrable. It's almost impossible to read because of the typeface which seems to be 9.5 font size - even with my glasses this is very tiring, and brings up the question why so small?There is only one answer, and that's to keep the book of manageable length, which then leads to the question why is the book so long? Why indeed. The author is far too prolix - the text should have been edited down by at least a third - perhaps then it may have been possible to persevere with the turgid prose.But, probably not as the author doesn't seem to have much original to say, rather just surveying what has already been said and criticising that.

(Dian has some really good organizational ideas for large and small groups.) The last 3/4 of the book is devoted to camp cooking. The ideas for cooking over the fire are really cool, and for someone who has done only a bit of camping and car camping at that, really unusual. However, if you like your food fresh and not from a can or packet, the recipes are pretty useless.

This product, however, destroys clarity entirely. It's ok for playing background music, but if you enjoy cranking up the stereo occasionally, it turns on the static and background noise, making it unbearable to listen. My last adapter let me turn the volume way up, without problems. Also, I purchased a car charger for the iPod... plugging it in whilst the adapter is plugged in as well creates a lovely sound I can only liken to a heart monitor flat lining.

But all the life is sucked out of the music and you're left with this tiny sound, that quite honestly, I'd rather roll the windows down and listen to the wind.So all in all if they could make this deck last it would be a quality product.

This just makes the audio drop out as there is no \\"Side B\\" on the adapter. Then typically the cassette player just spits out the adapter.

I have read several books on the pilots who flew during WWI, but this was the first time I had heard stories from the men in the trenches. My brother-in-law teaches history and wants to borrow it for his class. The things these people had to endure...it's amazing anyone survived.

Of the few hits that are here, all of them have been stripped of whatever magic they had that made them hits in the first place. A smokin' funk instrumental jam such as \\"Pick Up The Pieces\\" deserves better than to be chopped up and re-assembled as one of the most annoying remixes you'll ever hear - chances are that you won't be able to stand more than a minute of the repetitive loop before you move on to the next track.If you really want a great remix CD, check out \\"What Is Hip?\\", a collection of classic Warner Brothers hits reworked by contemporary DJs who did an amazing job - unlike this buzzkill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thrown into the trashcan after 2 listens...","review":"I had such high hopes for this cd.

It was a good one and not just one that lists all of the options without any further explanation. But even the best book I had found still assumed that I understood Unix. So I was having trouble. This book is really different. It makes everything understandable, not in a simple-minded \\"dummies\\" way, but in a technically proficient way so that you can understand what it means, no matter what your background. If you are going to buy a book on Samba, this is the one to start with.

This type is employed in many different sects/schools of Buddhism. His instruction is practical, and the book includes questions/answers that can be helpful to the practitioner. It's nicely done too. He also provided a very fine and useful quote for my collection: \\"People are attached to their own way of looking at things. As soon as you say something that in any way threatens it, they become defensive. So the way is not to threaten, just to be the way you are, letting the Dharma unfold.

Unfortunately, that song was a big hit. But, fortunately, the follow up didn't sell well at all. Give the Dixie Chicks credit, they restored interest in a more-traditional sound, and nobody was interested in a country singer trying to imitate a pop singer anymore. Maybe LeAnn will go back to country now.Anyway, she looks like a bona fide psycho on the cover. What happened to that cute, country girl on the first two album covers?

This is my first time reading the series and I found Sergeant Fry and Cooper to be an enjoyable team to follow. The story however falls flat with an overabundance of imagery, creating page after page of detail on something you don't even care about. The story itself is far fetched, and with each page the story becomes more absurd. I wanted to like this book, the characters were interesting and I found myself intrigued with their development.

Before or after you watch an episode, you can use the book to uncover the in-jokes, bloopers and trivia that make viewing these episodes fun.

But of course Natalie much prefers to torture the poor sap. Ah...the privileges of being beautiful. Jake has a fantastic one-liner in this story; 'Thank Angus for the use of his property.....etc' I wish I could write so well. I totally believed in their HEA once Nat got over the guilt of wanting sex again so soon after her first husband's demise. The skill of Ms Lamb is that as you read this novel your sympathies lie entirely with Natalie.

Worst of all, the fighting is terrible. All you have to do is learn your character's most devastating combo and you completely thrash all of your opponents.

Fairly clean fighting with a minimum of gore (considering that the characters are slashing at each other with axes and swords), with the opportunity to have as many as 8 characters battling at once, it can be a lot of fun. The combos aren't hard to master, and the graphics are very sharp. You can even pick up nearby objects and hurl them at your opponents, which is a fun trick all in itself.For a one person or two person fighting game, there are better, but for 4 people, this is an excellent choice, especially for under 15 dollars.

Emily Watson is excellent here as Jackie, and Rachel Griffiths is her reliably talented self as Hilary. The film moves rather slowly and is not the most beautifully told, but it does illustrate a sense of unconditional and boundless sisterly love between Hilary and Jackie, although it elevates Hilary to near martyrdom for her putting up with some of Jackie's more outrageous and selfish demands, but it also shows Hilary being the only person there for Jackie in her last days when multiple sclerosis claimed Jackie's life, both figuratively and literally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incongruous Logic = terrible direction","review":"I watched this movie up until Hillary, who appears in every way intelligent, decides that the demand of her sister, who, after running naked into the woods, is found shivering and out of her mind, should be allowed to have sex with Hillary's husband! The reason? Because she needs to know somebody \\"LOVES\\" her???? I thought the idea that sex = love was something most adults realized was not necesarilly true about the time they found out what the word \\"prostitution\\" means.I understand the musical aficionados have their own bone to pick, but I found the incongruous logic that would allow an emotional lunatic (which Jackie certainly was at the point of adultery) to 'have her way' with Hillary's husband (with Hillary's blessing) was to allow the lunatic to 'run the asylum' because the emotionally damaged sister requests it to be too much to swallow, and i shut the movie off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one thing wrong with this movie..","review":"They should have found someone else to play Jacqueline Du pre.

I remember that the original movie lasted at least 2 hour and 15 min. The video is merely 2 hour and 1 min. I would like to ask video producers that they should contain everything that was in the original movie. I would recommend not buying this one at this moment.

But the director refused to go for the cheap effect (what tears there are, are genuine), thus turning this film into something maudlin. The trailer tells you misleadingly that this is a movie about a woman, her sister, and the man they both loved. I guess I missed that last part of the story (and thank God, the director did not dwell on the sensational element in the story). For me the film was about the relationship between two sisters, music, and death. The only criticism I do have is Ms Dupre's passion for music is not adequately covered; and in its place we get her dis-passion for her profession. Had the director confronted the passion aspect, he could have then woven the trilogy of concepts - human relationships, music, and death - into something awfully profound (but then again, perhaps this is something only Shakespeare could have pulled off). Still in this movie the beginning and end meet quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a movie, folks","review":"I think that many reviewers are hung up on who the real Jacqueline duPre was and therefore do not appreciate the films numerous redeeming qualities and instead concentrate on Emily Watson's cello-playing. The film is deeply moving, superbly acted, and, more than anything, succeeds as a work of art. I'm sorry I am being so vague about it, but I haven't seen the film in a few years and anyway there are enough plot synopses here to get you through. My recommendation is that you watch this film. (If it means anything, I am a 3rd year male college student, and my musical background is limited to playing the clarinet for only about nine years, so I am no authority on the cello. But this movie really isn't about playing the cello. I wish some people would understand that.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful drama","review":"Somehow this film reminds of Cries and Whispers - maybe becuase that one was also about sisters. I found this one to be quite good,a well-paced drama with powerful cinematography. I also think that an important issue was raised that a genius in something can be quite and ordinary person in their personal life. So, whether it's true or not that Jaqueline de Pre had the life as depicted, the point is (in my opinion) that a talented person could be not of a very sublime behavior. I'd recommend for seriou film watchers."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is all wrong","review":"I'm sorry to all of you people who feel like this is a good movie. It's not. This is an absolutely terrible movie. I'm a cellist myself studying at a conservatory of music and Jackie is my cello idol. This movie portrays her terribly and Emily Watson, who is attempting to imitate Jackie playing, does a terrible job. If you really want to see what Jacquelin du Pre was like, then go buy an actual biographical video of her that they have here at amazon.com or you can go to sharmusic.com. I'm sorry, but this was an absolutely terrible movie and any cellist that knows anything about Jackie will agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gravely disappointing","review":"I just didn't buy the premise of this movie, painting Hilary as long-suffering and Jackie as capricious. There was very little indication of what made her the great musician that she was. The whole family was a little sick, but I think Hilary was the really certifiable one. I have always loved Emily Watson, but this performance was not among her best. The mimed cello playing was unconvincing. The fox-like Rachel Griffiths had some moving scenes, but this seemed like a self-serving attempt of an ordinary soul to \\"set the record straight\\" about her brilliant sister. The movie also suffered from inept concert sequences and the usual misguided cinematic attempts to portray the life of classical musicians. The whole thing left a profoundly sour taste in my mouth. Why not look at a video of Du Pre performing to cleanse the palate?"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRENDOUS Film","review":"Whether I knew who Jackie was or not before hand, this hokey, poorly made soap opera would have made me never want to KNOW who she was. The acting is mediocre, the writing is the worst, dialog terrible and directing barely that of a Lifetime Network Movie. Watching this was as much of as having rectal surgery by a paraplegic, no, actually that would be MORE fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art vs Heart","review":"As a female musician, this is my favorite film on the subject, ever! Keep in mind that it is based on Jackie's sister's perspective, which is entirely self-serving. The conflict between \\"art\\" and \\"heart\\" has always been an intrigue. Music, as an art, is pure science: it suffers no fools! There is no space for emotion when you are creating works to generate emotion in others! Jackie is portrayed as the obsessed, arrogant and ruthless genius, and her sister as the innocent, martyred lamb. I value \\"ice\\" in the blood of a woman! Had it been her brooding, breeding sister who contracted the dread disease, it would have cannonized her in the same way that \\"Melanie\\" was sainted against the narcissistic \\"Scarlet O'Hara.\\" Genius IS entitled to \\"creative license!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"for years I have been using Amazon for books and videos and have never beem dissapointed but this time I was.The DVD was advertised as only being used once.

Not Really...","review":"I'm not sure what it is about bondage stories nowadays, but majority of authors in this genre always rely on the same, tired cliche of a woman being dominated by a male boss, lover, husband, stranger, etc., and the even more lackluster and boring cliche of her being spanked, forced to call him \\"daddy\\" or \\"sir,\\" and at the end the woman is his slave, not wanting anything more but to be his ultimate sex toy. Now, don't get me wrong, the scenario is hot, but after reading story after story of this same cliche, it starts to become trite and just boring and unimaginative. Most stories in this collection are about this cliche. I think it's quite a shame, since there's more to BDSM than the male being the top and the woman being the bottom. It would be nice if BDSM authors would explore female domination and male submission, and add a bit more imaginative bondage scenes other than the repetitive spanking and ageplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"How To Be A Player..","review":"This is an awesome movie. this movie is hillarious. i thought that the story was good and so were the actors. this is a good movie. if you have not seen this movie i recommend you do"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bellamy is da' bomb","review":"Yo, dis movie is da bomb!

While many other reviewers have pointed out Stepanich's rampant inaccurancies and tendancy to just plain make stuff up (\\"ancient Irish potato goddess\\" indeed!), nobody seems to have touched on the blatant plagiarism that led to certain of her books being yanked out of print.She has no respect for accuracy or even the intellectual property of other authors. She certainly has no respect for her students, or she would not teach them such utter trash.

In addition, let me direct you to the bottom of page 134, where Kisma writes: \\"...the horrible witch burnings of Salem, Massachusetts, in the United States of America...\\" Any witchcraft historian worth his/her salt knows \\"witches\\" were never burned in the Colonies.

Besides, Joelly's character would make a horrible mother; she's so paranoid and possesive. Also, she constantly whines to her husband that he'd rather be having sex with Cameran Diaz, which is a stupid thing to say given that she has more than a passing resemblance to Diaz herself.

It helped me to make sense out of everything that was once stumping me. I highly recommend this book.I hated math before this book, but I went on to take the elective grade 12 math (BC, Canada) after being in the advanced math class for grade 11. Coming from a student who nearly failed out of grade 9 math!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"This book does not explain things well enough, I did algebra years ago and forogt seps and formulas how to do things. This books does not help you relearn those formulas what so ever! all it does is create false confidence"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Book","review":"HiI hope no one to be hesitate to buy this book for the purpose of remembering the Algebra course. Even though the book is easy to understand, it will enrich your memory by all of algebraic material which you may had forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical, yet Erodite","review":"I Love this book. I started reading it last night and was in stitches for thefirst two or three pages. It's about Time someone wrote a science/math/physicsbook that keeps you chuckling while you're learning. AND the authors are quite adept in their explanations of algebraic principles. A nice, easy and yet astute read. What a Gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has helped me a lot","review":"I came to this book not remembering how to add a couple of fractions, and now I am able to solve quadratic equations and factor polynomials without too much stress. It's a really good book. It presents information in short doses, then gives a few exercises to do, with the answers listed directly following. I find this a good system, because there's not too much time between absorbing information and making use of it. The examples are nice and clear, and the writing style is basic and to-the-point, without being patronizing waffle.I will take one star off for a couple of typos that were frustrating. For example, presenting a question with a + sign, then giving an answer to a question with a negative sign. There are only a couple of these, fortunately.I'd recommend this to book to anyone that either needs a refresher or is learning from scratch."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never studied Algebra before but I know it now","review":"This book is very good for Algebra reviewers or first time learners. One thing it lacks is drill and some explanations are hard to understand for first timers. I had to ask a friend to help me out and also look up better explanations online. Apart from that its fantastic. His attitude and writing approach are encouraging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great review book!","review":"I bought this book to prepare for taking a college placement test. I had not done algebra in several years and was returning to college. This book helped me get to a college level algebra course instead of having to take a lower level course. It's easy to understand, has practice problems, and is worth every penny. I really recommend it if you are looking for a review or as a second textbook for students struggling with algebra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Explanations","review":"They give you a short explanation of the problem, then some examples for you to try. But they don't explain everything they should before hand. So you are left looking at the answer to try and decipher how they came to that conclusion. I would recommend getting another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Petery Selby & Steve Slavin, great @ math, bad @ teaching","review":"I normally only review a book if it is either completely outstanding, or frustratingly awful. This book is the latter and I am shocked at the 5 star reviews. Much like the author's other book \\"all the math you need\\", this one is lacking in so many places. If the author were a swimming instructor, he would briefly explain to you how to do the backstroke, then immediately grab you by the belt loop and throw you in the deep end fully expecting you to swim. The practice problems at the end of each explanation go googles beyond anything that was explained. This leaves you frustrated and confused at ever turn. I've fortunately found some excellent resources on the web that fully explains every concept covered in this book. There's no doubt that the author knows the subject and it was a noble effort to attempt a book, but some people have no business attempting to cross over into the teaching business and this is a prime example of just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Algebra","review":"This book is more of a high school training book.

Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for independent study","review":"This is exactly the type of book we wanted for our 15 y/o homeschooler. It's well written and easy to understand. The answers are on the same page as the exercises so she can check her answers without wasting time flipping to the back of the book and searching for the answers. A simple card covers the answers while she works. She really likes this book as do we. It's perfect for independent study. It's really only for those that are self-motivated and understand pre-algebra."},{"rating":"2","title":"great review book","review":"This is a great book for reviewing the algebra I learned long ago. It is clearly laid out in chapters so you can start where you're comfortable, and lays out all the principles clearly.

Thanks so much to the authors!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Looks Good 29 years later...","review":"I used the first edition of this text 29 years ago, as a 13 year old 8th grader teaching myself Algebra. This text allowed me to learn thoroughly and well, such that I was able to complete courses through Calculus while still in High School, and go on to be an engineer. My 13 year old daughter had trouble learning from her school's textbook, so I am breaking open this book again. It's step by step strategy of mastery is key to the overall success. Nothing forces you to move on until you can get all of the correct answers. I am so glad that it is still in print so that my daughter may have her own (not falling apart) copy of this excellent text."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delight!","review":"If Math gives you pleasure, you'll love this book. Over the years I've either forgotten some of the basics of algebra, or can't recall how they're derived. Since algebra is the foundation of so much in the great field of mathematics, this book is invaluable. The authors not only know their subject perfectly, they also know how to teach it through the written word. The text is not long-winded, and examples are given in the form of frequent small challenges to the reader to work problems for her or himself. The problems selected have a way of bringing enlightenment. For example, if you arrive at a solution other than the one given later in the text, your mistake will probably reveal to you the logic you should have used. These problems, then are a continuing form of instruction.This is no novel, or light reading. It's absolutely wonderful. I can't recommend it highly enough. And what a bargain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I choose this one...","review":"If you're like me and haven't done any Algebra since leaving highschool (for me that was 15 years ago) this book is a excellent refresher course. The authors have use a conversational style in presenting the concepts of Algebra. Reinstalling your basic knowledge of math before you became tied to a calculator and guiding you through Algebraic methods and then backing those up with lots of examples and problems which really helps illustrate each concept. There is also a self-test at the end of every chapter.I'd forgotten most if not all the Algebra I was taught at school but this book has re-awaking the geek in me and made Algebra (dare I say it) enjoyable and not a not a teeth renching experince I'd invisioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily Confusing","review":"I bought this book to help teach my fiance algebra before he starts school in the fall.

It was an experience that I will never forget. I've seen many Holocaust films before, but nothing like this. It is certain to touch your soul in a way you can't anticipate. In the theater, when it ended, we were all frozen in our places. No one spoke. No one moved. Everyone cried. Simply an incredible film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, moving portrait of Hungarian Holocaust survivors.","review":"This masterful film documents the experiences of five Hungarian Holocaust survivors. Their stories are told through a combination of their own words, historical footage and films of their current lives. Especially moving are the survivors' return visits to their former homes and concentration camps. These haunting stories are told with courage and quiet dignity and each one is ultimately a tale of survival. This film tells its many tragic stories vividly, emotionally, and beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Film for all generations","review":"This film is painful and mindbending. I was compelled to watch it numerous times and have shared it with many others. Everyone should see it. I have been a nurse for 30 years and have cared for many survivors. I have listened as they shared their heart wrenching experiences and ineffectively tried to provide some sort of comfort on sleepless nights. In the end, all I have provided is presence, as I know that I will never be able to provide healing for these people. The agnonies that they have endured cannot be entirely comprehended. I commend those who have stepped forward to provide personal histories of their experience. It requires courage to do this, but is so important for present and future generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Days","review":"The Last Days was heart touching to watch.

It frezzes up everytime I try to play it. My second computer has Windows 7 installed.

My biggest complaint is that all online screenshots look amazing, but even a good computer will have trouble running this game with the graphics settings remotely high....and in this game, there is a big drop off between High and Medium graphics settings.

Consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Uninspired","review":"Never tried the first spellforce, so I don't know if it was supposed to be any good. But if the second is any indication, I don't think I'll bother with finding out. The game tries to be both an RPG and a Warcraft style RTS. What happens instead is that your characters wander through some hokey maps killing random monsters (not very difficult) until they \\"stumble\\" across an army that needs to be suppressed. At that point, they build the necessary unit factories and march off to war using the same hokey maps. The RPG side of the game is a poor copy of Diablo with a similar, but relatively useless set of skills. The RTS side is equally uninteresting with units that have few redeeming qualities. There is no point in developing any strategy harder than the classic rush 'em, i.e. throw everything you got at the bad guy, no matter what it is.... you'll win every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ships Without a CD KEY!!","review":"Be careful - our copy of the game arrived with no CD Key - which is required to install the game.

It is loud enough to trigger headaches....There is no visible speaker on it, so to make it softer will mean it has to be taken apart. Hopefully, it wont ruin the toy when we do that.

I'm very pleased that I took a chance on a book by this author. It is easy to get lost in this book...even after the first chapter, I was hooked and couldn't wait to get back to it when I had to put it down. I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next two books in this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Key of Light reaches its dazzling conclusion in the same manner as Roberts's other books: with the promise of more to come. A wonderful read! Fans of Christine Feehan and Sherry A.

I cant wait now for book two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance a mystery","review":"Positives - The fantasy/mystery story line was promising and the book itself is well written.Negatives - This story is much more a romance then anything else and for that to work I need to care about the relationship. Unfortunately this love affair was stupid and childish... What I'd expect from a junior high school coulpe (but with more sex then I remember).I'm not going to bother with the rest of the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a keeper","review":"This book is more in keeping with the old Nora Robert's books. It's believable in other words. Her characters feel like real people, they don't talk fancy, they don't look drop-dead beautiful. Okay the guys do but hey, that IS every woman's fantasy. The first in a trilogy that's sure to bring a smile and a sigh to all her fans. There's even the big, goofy dog that you can't help but love.It's a keeper on my shelf. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work","review":"I found this book to be all that I look for in a Nora Roberts book. She keeps the suspense alive in her story telling.

I have read nearly all of her titles from the Donovans to the MacGregors to Roarke and Eve. And everyone in between.However, this series was not worth my time. I haven't even been able to make myself purchase the last book in the series. The romance plots were more than predictable, and not even a little enjoyable to read. No attachment to the characters. And the events that happen in another realm are silly. You don't really believe in the characters and the God and Goddess, nor do you care about them. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!~!~!~!~!","review":"Boring!---Boring!---Boring!---Characters were undeveloped right from the start making them flat and unlikable. Absolutely no chemistry between anyone. Plot slow moving and too repetitive. WAY, WAY, WAY too much inner retrospect and \\"soul searching.\\" Made me want to gag.I regret the fact that I purchased all 3 audio books before reading the first as it was a huge waste of my time and money. This series is NOTHING like my other Nora Roberts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry","review":"I really do like Nora Robert's books and I love the JD Robb series, but I could not get into this book. I've read fantasy books before, I've read books like Laurell K. Hamilton and Kelley Armstrong, so nothing is too far fetched for me to read. But I tried and tried and very soon lost interest in this book. There was nothing that kept my interest, kept me wanting to read to find out how it ended and there was nothing in this first book that sparked the desire to read the next two in the series. I'm sorry, but this was not one that I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading this -- you probably already have!","review":"Sorry, but this trilogy is no different from others Nora has written. In fact, if you read Three Sisters, then you pretty much already have read the same basic story as this put forth in this book. I'm not sure where all this \\"wit\\" other reviewers are speaking of comes from, I didn't think the dialog was that engaging. I love Nora Roberts, but over the last two years her books have become predictable, formulaic, boring. She's a great author who needs to slow down output to write a unique novel. Or doesn't that fit the current business model?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Nora, I'm a big fan but...","review":"frankly, dear readers, I should warn you...new readers may like it, I found it trite and the most boring Roberts book I have ever read. Sorry to be brutal Nora, sincerely sick of the \\"supernatural\\" bunk, the three sisters/brothers formula, and you are writing like the hack Steele lately.I know deadlines are a killer--but Nora, what happened to your great imagination??? Go back to re-reading some of your earlier work...you had it right back then. Witches/wizards/faeries/blah blah blah I think.Apparently, you are giving into your publishers??? demand to use the Lord's name in vain...and you see nothing wrong with it Can't you be a little bit more assertive and think of more original phrases???Lj--sorry got the second for Xmas, will read, but do not expect a miracle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbest Ever!!","review":"TERRIBLE - STUPID - DUMB - STORY LINE IS RIDICULOUS - UNINTERESTING - ABSOLUTELY NO DEPTH TO ANYTHING - EVEN FOR A FANTASY IT FAILS HORRIBLY.

Why can't she just curse without bringing God into it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, believeable plot and characters","review":"The only thing that drove me crazy was the amount of pages that were necessary to develop the characters. I know it was necessary but I wanted to scream at them \\"stop interacting and look for the key!\\". Looking forward to the other two books. The part about Malory wanting to be an artist but not having the talent really touched a chord with me. Don't we all feel that way sometimes about dreams?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora Roberts Books","review":"Key of LightI enjoy Nora Roberts books very much (except for the graphic sex which I skim over to get on with the story!) I have read most all of her books and love the trilogies. I really get caught up in the magic, mystery and the characters. It is kind of a let down when I finish with the books. She is very interesting and writes a lot of stories set in Ireland. Makes me want to travel there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora Roberts Key of light","review":"I enjoyed all three key books. I liked the way everyone worked together to solve the mystery. Oh, and they had happy endings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but a page-skipper . . .","review":"Moe the dog is definitely my favorite character in the whole trilogy. I enjoyed the self-learning process of the characters, but there were still a lot of pages of repetitive matter on the evil curse and the rules of the quest, which weren't all that complicated in the first place. I would also agree with a former reviewer that the endings are flat. Still, the characters are gutsy and have a lot to overcome, and mixed in with a little romance and a dream-like quest, it makes for a good midnight read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assembly line story","review":"There are clothing designers who magically weave color, fabric, and style together. Turning what was once a rolled up bolt of fabric into a beautiful creation. Then there are designers who use a cookie cutter to stamp out fashion ware for department chains like K mart. The bottom line is mass production and sales. I have always believed (and still do) Nora Roberts can magically weave a novel. However, this book reads as if it was stamped out from a cookie cutter on an assembly line. I regret purchasing all three books. Will be more careful the next time. It misses the quality of her earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Key of Formula","review":"An interesting idea that goes nowhere--This book is an example of formula writing at its best. There is no tension and no suspense--the plot twists are obvious and the caracters, while enjoyable, are lacking in origionality. I bet I can guess what's going to happen in the next two books even before they are published. Nora Roberts needs to take more time with her books; meeting her publisher's deadlines has robbed her fans of her origionality and care for detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Writting, but Somewhat predictable","review":"I love Nora Roberts, but after reading her series, you recognize characters right away. There are always three women one of which is artist in some way, another is bookworm of sorts and last one is a homemaker. I love the celtic undertone and the way she brings mythology into contemporary life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooooooooring","review":"Once again, we have another trilogy focusing on 3 women that are somehow \\"mysteriously\\" connected. Roberts was once one of my favorite authors, but lately, she churns out these series that are so boringly formulaic, I wonder even if she writes them herself or has a team of \\"aides\\" that write them for her. Nora, if you read this, whatever happened to stories like \\"Honest Illusions\\"? I fear success has commercialized this once talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again?","review":"Like others have said, this reads like a re-hash of the Three Sisters. You can skim over huge chunks and still pick up where you left off.There are some words that keep popping up that bug completely, and certain things that she just can't put in right.Like \\"jazzy\\"...when was the last time you ever heard anyone say that in real life? Or the several scenes where the girls were \\"shaking their booties\\"...I mean, come on! It was like in one of her former books where someone was actually snapping their fingers to BarenakedLadies.I'm actually glad of the naughty words, though--it's more realistic. One thing I've noticed is that her endings are rather flat. And why does everyone always have to get married at the end??? Isn't enough to end it with just them loving each other? A triple wedding on Valentine's is the most hackneyed idea I've ever heard of.I think she needs to take a vacation for a bit to get some fresh ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Studio says \\"no plans\\"","review":"The reviews below are for the VHS edition.

I later lost the tape, but still had the case with the address of the record company. I wrote them, but the letter was returned: apparently they had gone out of business. I was distraught. I could still hear that music in my head all the time and I was dying to hear it again. I've been searching online for about two years now and finally I've found it- the same album from a new record company.Folks this is THE GOOD STUFF.

The old stock footage is uneven and doesn't show enough of the truck. Other footage was taken on the fly when someone happened to have a camera on the street. The song is OK, but once that's over my son walks away. Why would a child who LOVES trucks walk away? Because some guy's voice (which sounds like it's in an echo chamber) comes on talking about a bunch of stuff he can't SEE on the screen. What's on the screen? More garbage stock footage. This looks and sounds like it was slapped together in someone's basement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"I own several Real Wheels movies and thought I would give this one a shot. I found the picture quality to be less than I expected and the footage seemed out of date. The narration was dull and boring, and the children's voices screaming the number of the truck to be annoying. I would recommend any of the Real Wheels series instead of this - they never fail to please my 3 1/2 year old truck lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our son learned how to use the DVD player!","review":"Our one year old son loved trucks and starting saying \\"Ruck\\" and pronouncing the \\"K\\" sound. Well, after buying him this video, he actually learned how to replay the \\"Twenty Trucks\\" song from the main menu. He starts clapping and smiling when the song plays. He especially likes when the tractor trailer honks it's horn and is mesmerized by the concrete mixer and the moster truck. When he wakes up in the morning, he crawls right over to the DVD player and starts pushing the play button.I would rather have our son watch a video like this instead of cartoons because it is educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids who know a wide range of trucks already.","review":"This video would be a good intro for very young kids who are interested in trucks, but if you have a young child who already knows and loves trucks like excavators, wheel loaders, demolition trucks, feller bunchers, jackhammer trucks, bulldozers, mini-loaders, and the like, I would not buy this one. There are only about two trucks that were interesting for my three year old who loves trucks - the vacuum truck and monster truck. Out of the twenty, there are some really boring ones - even a bus and a pickup truck! If your little one is into construction trucks this will be a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"One of my son's favorite DVD's. He is 2 now, we got it when he was 1,5. He will sit there for the whole thing, so I can cook dinner or catch up on my chores.

Their professional equipment proved this meter to be entirely inaccurate, and more like a joke. We looked so amateur with our little meter and felt bad we brought the guys out based on a reading from a cheap device. Better safe than sorry, but it certainly would have abated our concerns from the start had the meter been accurate. We could have received a faulty meter, but there was no way of knowing until the professionals came to prove otherwise. We are sending it back, but evidently we will not get a full refund because it is outside 30 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase","review":"Purchased this item due to concerns with EMF fields at my home.

The suggested safe level is approximately 2 milligauss per the internet.Difference in readings on the two scales indicate accuracy of +/- 10%. As the meter has 3 coils it automatically measures the maximum field in any orientation. Most appliances produce a significant field which rapidly decreases with distance. In most cases EMF is at a safe level at 3 - 4 feet from the appliance.I found the meter very useful as it confirms that we are exposed to strong EMF when using cell phones or cordless phones. Homes located next to high voltage powerlines have significantly higher EMF, even well away from any appliance.The meter is sensitive enough to locate hidden wires inside walls or under the sidewalk.I consider the manufacturer's product description to be true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that accurate","review":"Bought this to measure EMF around the the house. I was getting some pretty high readings with the house power shutoff. I called So. Cal. Edison who will come out for free and read EMF around your house.

They showed me their recent calibration certificate since these devices need to be recalibrated to maintain their accuracy. So, I wouldn't take the readings on this device too seriously.

Also when I am using the zero to 100 scale I sometimes get a reading of 6, but on the 0 to 3 scale a reading of 3 in the same spot.

I purchased it for testing the EMF at a piece of property that I have been looking at that has 345kv power lines going through the property. I found that at about 300 ft at peak time it measured less than 1 miligauss and right directly below the lines it measured about 20-25 miligauss. When the microwave was going it read over 100 miligauss and in my car it was 4-10 miligauss. I spend a lot of time in my car and the EMF in my car was more than 100 ft from the 345kv power lines.

We see a 1 minute dance of her from a distance, clearly not a good enough view to really appreaciate her humogous breasts. The other shots of her were only for a few seconds spaced throughout the movie. Again in one 3 second clip she is half submerged in water, unable again to view her wonderful assets. Yet Russ spends ample time on less attractive smaller brested women. Clearly Russ got it all wrong.

Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great primer!","review":"Having recently completed my MBA I look back and realize how much of a help this book was to me during my program. The author is able to take complex subject matter and reduce it to simple, unerstandable concepts. The chapter on TVM was especially helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative!","review":"This was a very informative video. I would definitely recommend it to anyone trying to decide on a particular breed of dog as it does profile quite a few breeds. My 7 year old daughter loves to watch this video just to learn about all the different dog breeds. She is constantly now recognizing different breeds when we are out and about. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teacher","review":"This text was recommended reading and as a teacher myself, I find it confounding that it was not required reading during my teaching education. She certainly was ahead of her time, but Sylvia Ashton-Warner might still be distancing herself from those standard based minds determined to put children into the molds we have decided are necessary for their own good. How do we get children to see the power of language so that writing and reading have personal meaning that piques a lifelong journey into the love of learning--this book has some incredible seeds that a willing and curious mind might take, study, and find itself using to change the world, and at the very least the landscape of education as we see it today. Read this book if you want children to come alive to learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"We need more like this!","review":"This was one of the most underrated movies of the 80s; underrated because not many movie fans know how to appreciate an intelligent movie. While most movies grow more boring each time you watch them, this one gets better everytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching again, but with moderation","review":"I liked this book, but I generally like historical novels. It is a “who done it�?with a medieval setting. It shows some the hypocrisy of the church of the day and of inquisitions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lawyers and Beancounters","review":"Yes I am writing this review prior to the release of this Dvd. If lack of information is any indicator, I am INCENSED that this film would be released in a format that DOES NOT reflect how it was shot. It looks like another release I've been waiting for (Map of the Human Heart) also is not widescreen. The idiots (obviously NOT film fans) who make these decisions should be hung! It is an affront to every cinematographer to butcher films in this manner. If museums decided to crop works of art there would be such a public outrage that would drown out the CEOs of the studios for good. Shame on them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and disappointing adaptation of Eco's masterpiece","review":"A dull and disappointing adaptation of Umberto Eco's masterpiece by the mediocre French director, Jean-Jacques Annaud. If you have only seen the movie, you will have no idea of the richness of Eco's novel. The movie only deals with the murder mystery (and it does this poorly) leaving aside all the philosophical debates and the esoteric minutiae that made the novel so compelling. The reconstruction of the era makes it look grim and depressing, and I don't think that was the feeling in the book. It's hard to think of a novel so poorly translated to the screen as this one (Reportedly, Eco is of the same opinion, and this is why he hasn't let other books of him be filmed). Connery (a fine actor) is indifferent here, while a young Christian Slater is totally out of cast as Adso (he has a \\"what the heck am I doing here\\" look). Skip the movie and read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great period film and more entertaining than the novel.","review":"Umberto Eco's novel, of the same name (which the script was pretty closely derived from), is a tedious, bloated, manuscript, that can't decide whether it's a murder mystery, a treatise on the state of European and the Catholic Church societies and politics of the early 14th century, or just a way for Eco to show off what a great scholar he is, and how proficient he is in latin. (If you read the book, have an Latin-English dictionary handy - or just skip a lot of paragraphs and/or pages, as I eventually ended up doing.)The film, on the other hand, is a marvelous murder mystery, set in a prosperous abbey in northen Italy in 1327. The atmosphere is dark, the production design, costumes and make-up, excellent. The cast is international and they all deliver. I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very different","review":"Numerous reviewers have commented on the differences between Eco's intricate, convoluted, compelling, and periphrastic novel and this spiffy little medieval mystery. For maximum enjoyment of the film, it probably is best to forget all about the novel and view it as a thing-in-itself. Far more mature and sophisticated than the Bond movies that made Sean Connery a household name, The Name of the Rose is visually interesting and compelling throughout. So what if Murray Abraham pushes his character over the top and Christian Slater's ingenuousness is a bit precious, this is still excellent entertainment for those who do not require that their thrillers be accompanied by car chases and gunshots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a warning for families . . .","review":"Families & others who have moral standards should at least be forewarned that this movie has graphic sex scenes, with full nudity, etc. Wish I'd been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Connery work, fun, suspense filled","review":"Definetly one of Connery's better films. Though the film was never well-known, it has a solid following with Connery's fans.I liked the way the film portrayed the monks as obsessed with stamping out fun and laughter - as if it was the root of all evil. The historical aspects of the film might help the unenlightened get a grasp on the ideas behind the Spanish Inquisition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing and riveting","review":"\\"Name Of The Rose\\" is a real take-me-for-ride kind of movie. Clue after clue leads to an even more threatening position for the seekers of the truth. The maze of tunnels and staircases reminded me of the \\"National Treasure\\" movies. If you liked those movies, you'll like this movie a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Medieval Thriller","review":"This review refers to the theatrical movie as the DVD is not available as of this writing. I do think it's worth buying on digital disc because it will be a widescreen version, which I don't think was/is available on VHS. The movie is based on the novel by Umberto Eco who is a master of arcana and esoterica. The novel, one of my true favorites, is richly detailed and atmospheric. The movie tries to capture that dark, ominous, medieval atmosphere and succeeds admirably. This is a superb thriller about the investigation of mysterious deaths in a monastery during a bleak winter in the 14th century. Sean Connery is simply wonderful as the Sherlock Holmes-like sleuth. Even Christian Slater, a very young Christian Slater, does a fine job. The movie can be slow at times, especially at the beginning, but once it kicks off, it is utterly compelling. The ambiance is like a cape that just wraps and draws you into the mystery. To say more would be giving it away. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can not view the DVD","review":"Same as the review of The Magdalene Sisters. Can not watch the DVD because of Region problems.

I tried it in two different players with the same result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"This is perhaps the worst screen adaptation of any book that I have ever seen. It not only misses the points made in the book, it makes a mockery of every idea that the book encourages one to explore. A rich intellectual saga is turned into a trite, slow moving, \\"politically correct\\" exercise. None of the characters are developed beyond a shallow shadow of themselves.If you have read the book, don't watch this movie! You run the risk of the kind of rage that could cause the demolition of your video equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This film was a major disappointment. I recently finished reading \\"Name of the Rose\\" and not only does the film grossly deviate from the text, but the acting was very dry and uninspiring on all accounts. This is yet another example of the motion picture industry trashing a literary work of art. Comparing this film to Eco's masterpiece is like comparing \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" with Demi Moore to Hawthorne's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Within the darkness of a benighted age some still keep the flickering flames of knowledge, wisdom, and compassion alive","review":"Sean Connery infuses this film with his commanding presence as the wise old ecclesiastical scholar who becomes involved in the investigation of a series of suspicious deaths in a 14th century monastery. Christian Slater plays his young protege, a mere adolescent through whose eyes we see the plot unfold. The lovely Chilean actress Valentina Vargas plays a mute peasant girl who seduces the innocent boy played by Slater. This film evokes the haunting spirit of a benighted past only occasionally illuminated by the wisdom and compassion of a few enlightened individuals who labor in the shadows. Adding to the magic is the film's beautiful score."},{"rating":"2","title":"The name of the Rose","review":"Product arrived in good quality.

A classic whodunit set in a Catholic monastery in about 1530 ad. It's a great story, impeccably told, and superbly acted by Sean Connery, Christian Slater, F. Murray Abraham, Ron Perlman, and the rest of the cast. The whole movie has a sense of urgency, and the timing of the events is flawlessly delivered to keep you on the edge of your seat. The cinematography is so well handled that you will actually believe yourself to have been transported back to those long-gone years. You can almost smell the stables. I love this movie, and highly recommend it to anyone who truly enjoys a great mystery or suspense tale.The service through whom I ordered the movie was as impeccable as the movie itself.

Well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not about the book...","review":"If every second counts for you, you should probably skip this book and read something a little more worthwhile. Unlike his previous book \\"It's not about the Bike\\" this book lacks the drama and general interest for the common reader. That being said if you are a cycling fan you can probably find some behind the scenes stuff here to be interesting, but basically this is a recap of Lance's racing since the 1999 Tour De France win. Which means if you are a cycling fan you already know everything in this book and if you are not a cycling fan you wont care what's in this book.Overall it is more less just another puff piece athletic biography that seems more interested in re-enforcing Lance's status as a sports hero than it does delving into one of the most fascinating sports figures of a generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lance, RIDE THE BIKE and STOP TALKING!!!!!","review":"Who on earth wants to keep hearing the same story over and over?

A lot of people will provide polar reviews of both books based on their take of the doping charges against Lance, but in many ways, I think that misses the point: it's not about the bike, it's not about the doping charges, it's about one individual's willingness to be a survivor and all the ups and downs associated with this struggle.Much of the book is focused on Lance's training routine and analysis of his teammates, which offers an amazing view into one of the most competitive endurance events today. After months of training and weeks of grueling racing, in the end, it still comes down to seconds to determine the winner. There are lessons here for everyone. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful, well written","review":"This book is a very insighful look into Lance's life, and how it changed after being diagnosed with cancer. It describes his battle with cancer in detail, including lengthy descriptions of chemotherapy treatments. If you want to learn about cancer and chemotherapy, this is a good book to pick up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooo","review":"This book is HORRIBLE. If Mr. Armstrong feels the need to defend himself against the drug charges Europe was holding against him (which nobody believes anyway!), why didn't he just hold a press conference instead of publishing the worst book of all time?

Seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational Book","review":"Throughout this book Lance Armstrong talks about different aspects of his life. From struggling with cancer, his training for the Tour de France, raising three children, and all the other criticism he faces; this book has not only a factual account of his life, but ideas that are useful to all. \\"Winning only measures how hard you've worked and how physically talented you are; it doesn't particularly define you beyond those characteristics. Losing, on the other hand, really does say something about who you are.\\"This book is not only inspirational but gives you the insight on the sport of cycling that many are not aware of."},{"rating":"1","title":"No yellow jersey for this one","review":"If you have read the first book go ahead and skip the first 100 pages or so of this book. Then you get to read about how his marriage is breaking up. Lance can not figure out what went wrong, but anyone who reads these two books are bound to figure it out. This book took, a person with a truly inspirtational story, and dissolved it all away. I do not think that I care for Lance anymore. It is lucky that he can get specially made equipment, because it is the only way he will get a helmet to fit over his enourmous head. Do not buy this book.

I didn't know if this was the same person that wrote the book \\"It's Not About The Bike\\"I felt sad for him, because it seems the only thing he takes ownership for in his life is racing and being a cancer survivor. Both of which he is a GREAT role model for, but he does not see there is so much more to life than that. This book really tells the story of how Lance is a thrill seeker, nothing more, nothing less.I hope one day Lance develops the skills necessary to take a deep look inside himself and then takes a wider view of the world and people in his life.

At this point, we ejected the tape and resorted to the radio. I don't understand movies, etc that have to include such objectionable language. Certainly, this tape should have been properly labled so that parents could make an \\"informed\\" decision.

The raw emotions of the characters become apparent with the read -- a difficult thing to do for readers if they have not seen the play -- and also is startling honest about how jealousy, fear and desperation all meld into one.Definitely a must read, if you want to consider yourself in the know of American literature, but Moon does at times seem trying, with blatant symbolism(the moon is quite noticeable throughout the play) scratching at the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version is terribly formatted","review":"This e-book is so poorly formatted it is nearly unreadable on the Kindle.

Bought this for my 3 YO expecting classic Looney Toons updated for 2004. Was sorely dissapointed. The animation is poor, the gags are non-existant on any level and the voices are poor imitations. Unfortunately I spent 17 potatoes on this junk at a major toy store. If I wanted some animation this bad I could have gone to the Joe Cartoon or Bullseye Art websites. No surprise there are lots of used ones for sale. For those of us who grew up with the originals, this was a wholesale letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.

That apart, the design fits very snugly around the ear, unlike the other devices from Nokia, Sony Ericsson etc, it's attractive enough to make heads turn at crossroads, discos, pubs and wherever one seeks attention. Functionally, it works flawlessly although sometimes it tends to cut off and one must reset it by placing it into charge mode again. But these instances are maybe twice a year. Transmission is decent but tends to suffer if there is too much breeze, airconditioning close by etc. Reception is generally good but a lot depends on the service provider. All in all I'm very happy with it and wonder how others, myself included managed without it for so long. And yes, the charge lasts around 36-48 hours depending on usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Elephant","review":"Back when online, Internet-based shopping was merely in a twinkle in Algore's eye, I bought this offering--Simple Minds's \\"Life in a Day\\"--in a used-CD store. I had known, from listening to KROQ, that Simple Minds had written & recorded a few gems prior to their 1982 U.S. \\"New Gold Dream\\" debut, and I was willing to gamble that \\"Life in a Day\\" would contain some of these gems.When I skimmed the \\"Life in a Day\\" CD, however, I found that it did not contain these gems. Moreover, I found that it beared almost no resemblance to the brilliantly produced \\"New Gold Dream\\" record I'd adored. Moreover still, I found \\"Life in a Day\\" to be loud and cheesy, so much so that I couldn't bear to hear it more than a couple of times.I concede that I might have acquired a taste for this CD had I had the motivation to spin it a few more times--that is why I rate it with 2 stars rather than 1--but I lacked that motivation and ended up giving it away at a white-elephant-gift party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple Minds Debut Looks To Their Influences","review":"Debut album shows the greatest amount of influence for this long-running Scot band. Be Bop Deluxe and especially Doctors Of Madness figure high in the mix with a little Sparks showing up as well. \\"Chelsea Girl\\" and \\"Sad Affair\\" stick out like a big fat 1960's hits that never were, but elsewhere the mood is dark and serious.

This is not one of those albums. In fact, I dislike it more an more everytime I hear it. At times I even doubt that it is Simple Minds. The only proof to me is that it really is them is that it sounds like Jim Kerr's voice. Obviously, they had not found there \\"sound\\" yet. I was expecting an album similar to their other early releases such as \\"Empires and Dance\\" and \\"Sons and Fascination\\" (which are two of my all time favorite albums) but this album is missing the cutting edge originality that I like so well. A previous reviewer used the word \\"cheesy\\" which is a perfect description. One song reminds me of a bad Go-Go's song.

I don't expect high theatre from Hong Kong kung fu movies but even the fight scenes are very sub par. One of the charming things about Jackie Chan is that he doesn't take himself too seriously; his characters always do something goofy, comical, endearing. Since he is the bad guy and just a supporting actor, he can't/doesn't do anything goofy, comical or endearing. And the mole looks less like a mole and more like he has a leech on his face.

Here is another things, why is this move called \\"Young Tiger\\"? It should be called a female cop and a taxi driver.

Many times the phone will ring and no one will be calling and the only way to get the phone to stop is to turn it off and turn it back on again. Another extremely annoying problem is that after about a month of owning the phone the top oval shaped button fell off and now, having had the phone for nearly 10 months, the one, two, three, five, and six buttons have completely fallen off my phone. Though still on the warrenty, Siemens tells me that if a button falls off they cannot do anything about the phone being a piece of crap.

I called Siemens and they said that this model Number has a tendencey to do that, it goes corrupt and starts deleting everything and I would have to reenter all of my numbers, well I don't have all of them now because some were just entered as I would see someone that I hadn't seen in a while.

The seat is pretty, comfortable, and easy to clean;. However, it has a new kind of fastener that is designed so that the seat is supposed to be easy to remove. They tout it as being easy to clean because you can simply pop the seat off to clean it. I have two problems with this. First, after the seat is installed, for me anyway, it is extremely difficult to remove. Second, it is difficult to tighten it adequately (because, on my toilet, the wingnut does not have room to turn and has to be forced) and consequently, the seat gets loose after a short time, but I cannot access the screws to tighten it.

These men, who had the responsibility to place food and supply depots for Shackleton's intended journey across Antarctica, endured hardship beyond description. They were totally dedicated to their task and their devotion to Shackleton is heartwarming. It proves, once again, his leadership prevailed even though he was almost 2,000 miles away from them.

The iPod version is probably more useful for the limited library size. On the positive side, once it is synced, it is very responsive to commands and the range of the remote seems fine in my small house. A larger remote with a number/letter pad (like a telephone) for navigation and a larger screen would make this device more effective with iTunes but the sync issue is a definite deal breaker.

Erich's status as a Soviet POW for 10 and a half years had much to do with it. Erich's postwar life was also difficult upon repatriation. His outspokenness in the upper ranks of the Bundesluftwaffe and NATO limited his career, which is not covered in the early edition. However, given this, the biography is a good insight into a young man who performed at the highest level, fighting for his nation, and never abandoning his comrades.

His unit for most of the war was the renowned JG-52, which boasted more than ten thousand kills.After his unit surrendered to U.S. troops, the Americans turned them over to the Red Army, with predictable results. Hartmann then spent ten years in Soviet prison camps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"This book is a fantastic read about a man who seems to be forgoten in most of the mainstream books and TV programs about this time in history.

I know that many Americans tend to discount kills in the east (Despite the imprssive record of Russian pilots in Korea). But included in Hartman's tally are 5 Mustangs in one day. And unlike Rudel (Who's \\"Stuka Pilot\\" is also a great book), Hartman comes across as the boy next door type.

As somebody who never had a chance to see any of the Foetus-incarnations perform live, I was very much looking forward to seeing what a typical show would've been like 'back-in-the-day'. This document surely isn't an accurate representation.The sound is decent-enough.

You learn things about a particular subject, and you find yourself diving into a world where you make the choices and you get to solve the mystery.To me, \\"The Creature of Kapy Cave\\" was a major disapointment. I was really fearful that other games in the series would end up being like this, lacking any sort of challenge to it. I mean, when I played the game, I instantly understood why they were able to for once include the walkthrough with it for once! Nice insentive to get people to still buy the game, but it really isn't.This game, if you aren't interested in having ALL the Nancy Drew games, I honestly suggest not buying. Unless of course you are getting the game for an introduction to a much younger child then you normally would suggest it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've played a lot of these games. I'm not ashamed to say I love Nancy Drew. This particular game, however, was terrible. The plot was weird, the characters were annoying, the puzzles were repetetive and even the character graphics (which usually redeem the less-than-awesome ones) were much weaker than I would ever expect from a Nancy Drew game. The only part I was interested in was the Hardy Boys. I love seeing them in Nancy Drew games. Unfortunately, they were barely even in this one. Sure, you get to play as them, but that doesn't make up for the suspicious lack of Hardy Boy face visibility. So far definitely my least favorite of these games by far, other than maybe the first two, which I can forgive because they were...well, the first two.Don't let your experience with this game color your opinion of any other Nancy Drew game."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Nancy Drew games.","review":"I was very disappointed with this game. I played all of the ND mystery games and I'm a big fan. This was a short game and not interesting. Nancy Drew's assignment was looking through bug waste and counting and weighting whatever she found. The only thing I liked was playing as Hardy boys when Nancy Drew called them on the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer Boredom","review":"I love the Nancy Drew games and was highly dissapointed with this one. This is definitely the worse game yet. The title sounds exciting, but the game is sheer boredom. The puzzles not only fail to challenge the player, but they are useless and boring. There is barely any mystery-solving in this game. It is mostly comprised of needless and mundane tasks that others are telling Nancy or Frank Hardy to do. Most of these mundane tasks include looking at plant smaples under a microscope, fishing, and making necklaces. Come on HER Interactive, where is the action? the mystery? the intrigue? Let's hope the next one is up to par with the previous Nanvy Drew games.On a positive note, the graphics were pretty good, but that is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My daughter and I have played all of the previous games; we've enjoyed them overall. Some of the games are fantastic, challenging and fun. This game was quite lame in comparison to the others. The puzzles weren't really puzzling, just boring tasks. There were not many clues to find. Because there weren't many clues, there was no real sense of detecting anything. The game ended abruptly and was very short. We did NOT use a walk-through to solve the mystery in record time, just experienced a lack of challenge. We did like the newness of becoming Frank and Joe Hardy occasionally. The rest was pretty boring. If you are looking for a Nancy Drew game, try one of the others instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea But the Game Didn't Live Up to It","review":"I love all the Nancy Drew games, and The Creature of Kapu Cave was not a disapointment. It was a little short, and some of the tasks were booooring, but overall CRE was a really good game. I bought it from Her Interactive ASAP and it was worth it!

So, after waiting anxiously for their fourteenth, perhaps it goes without saying that I was extremely disheartened upon receiving it to discover that we can't play it. HER Interactive has decided apparently that they care more about Microsoft than their long-time customers and have chosen to support only Windows XP and Vista instead of any of the older operating systems.

While the graphics, and scenery are beautiful (and what initially attracted me to the game), it was a little too easy and ended way too soon. They didn't take time to develop the story, but explained it only after you have solved the game. Also not enough characters.

I've completely lost interest in ND computer games since The Secret of the Old Clock, and just sold my entire collection in our yard sale. The Creature of Kapu Cave had no substance whatsoever.

My daughter has played them all. However, after a while, it seemed as thow it was an easter egg hunt for three year olds. Everything was easy to find and not mysterious at all. All the other games took my daughter quite some time before she figured out the mystery. However, this game took her two days. All the other Nancy Drew games kept her intrigued and kept her coming back for more. This game breezed by and and she was quite disappointed. In fact, her words at the end of the game were, \\"that's it?\\". Her interactive, better come out with a more interesting game next time or you'll lose the interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment again for Nancy Drew fans","review":"Her Interactive started the Nancy Drew computer game series with wonderful, complicated, and fun games such as \\"Treasure in the Royal Tower\\" and \\"Secret of the Scarlet Hand\\" and \\"Danger on Deception Island\\". Now the games are too easy, too short, and the characters completely forgetable. This game has a promising start, but there are virtually no puzzles to solve--- only repetitive tasks. The ending is one of the worst. Her Interactive needs to remember that it is the story, characters, and puzzles that will keep fans purchasing its games. Like \\"Danger by Design\\", this was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredom in Hawaii","review":"I've played all 15 Nancy Drew computer games, and while no one can expect EVERY game to be great, this particular title doesn't even come close to being mediocre. The puzzles are completely boring and not at all challenging, the plotline is ridiculous. If the creators at Her Interactive are such big fans of entymology, perhaps they should have created a bug game instead. And the back-and-forth use of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew characters was annoying more than anything else. I will be looking forward to the next game in the series, but hope that Her Interactive doesn't rush it out the gate merely to put something on the shelf, as appears to be the case with this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This was the easiest and most disappointing Nancy Drew game. I have all of the others and very much enjoyed them. This, however, was not up to par with the others. I was expecting a lot more considering the location and the addition of the Hardy Boys. Didn't get my money's worth out of this one. Less to do and not as much dialogue. They could have really worked it.

Too bad I was done by the end of the day. The game was so easy to complete if you are familiar with Nancy Drew games. I was shocked when it ended. Seems like HerInteractive wanted the game out for the Christmas season and ran out of time to develop a good quality game with complex puzzles and a good story-line. If the game was truly developed, Nancy wouldn't have to talk for three minutes at the end to explain to us users what really happened. We would have figured most of it out in our detective work in the game!! Cool new features: GPS and Hardy Boy Switch.

As is often the case with \\"cult\\" novels, the fanboys grossly overrate them, skew the composite, and fool people into buying them. The cheap graphics of the book cover are indicative of what's inside. To say the movie was better, much better, is an understatement. The novel only survives in print because of the movie -- that's why I bought it. I suppose the book was controversial in the early 1960s because of its amoral tone and four lettered language -- and the controversy sold the book. If THE WARRIORS was first published today, it wouldn't sell a 100 copies. A lame plot line, unsympathetic characters, very little action, and a fizzle at the end.

Brilliantly shot, produced, cast. Then I got excited about owning my own copy of Yurick's gang-life masterpiece, for reading enjoyment. What a huge disappointment. Naturally all the gang names, personalities, and events are changed here. None of the names, faces, or climaxes are similar with the film. And the novel mentions an 'older' veteran gang member [originally titled the Coney Island Destroyers], who is nowhere mentioned in the movie. And much of the action doesn't match the film either.Perhaps that's exactly WHY director Hill deliberately captioned in the films' opening credits \\"based\\" on the novel. Not DIRECTLY QUOTED from the novel. For die-hard movie, including 'Warriors' fans, you may turn out disappointed like I was.Still, the novel is worth owning, alongside the DVD mainly for show and sentiment. However, the film was at least masterful.PEANUT"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT an insightful book about street gangs of the 1960s","review":"This book is about an all-black gang from the 1960s. It was written by a Jewish professional in his 40s. I dont think he had a lot of personal experience about the subject, if any. He loosely based the theme of the book on an Ancient Greek story.

Richards draws upon elements of folk, country and rock to create a very enjoyable pop album. Her music evokes the spirit of the 60's and 70's but the sound is completely modern. At first listen, she will remind you of Dido but the songs themselves have more in common with Sheryl Crow and Aimee Mann. Richards has the unique ability to blend a lot of different sounds without detracting from the song. The Herethereafter is a very easy listen and the songs will no doubt stay in your mind for awhile. It is refreshing to her such a gifted songwriter in today's often bland and generic pop scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the hype","review":"I bought this album on a whim, hoping for the best.

It's also a comfortable seat. We personally prefer padded seats because they provide comfortable cushioning for however long or quickly you're seated, and they don't get as cold, especially during the wintertime or even just when the AC is pumping in the hottest part of the summer. Yes, they do eventually tear at the seam between the top and bottom of the seat, but it's worth it. Besides, even though we keep ours clean every two weeks, the tears that eventually occur force us to change the seat out with regularity, whereas most people probably leave them on indefinitely or at the very least for far too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Live LP which captures his concert atmosphere.","review":"Surprisingly, until Lady in Red became a massive hit single in Britain, Chris de Burgh was not a particularly well-known artist.

I bought it mainly for one song; it's a song that has haunted me for years; it's the very beautiful \\"A Spaceman Came Travelling\\" which I first heard de Burgh perform at a mid-December concert in Bradford, Yorkshire in the '70s.I adore this man's style, his voice and even his lyrics (even though his Christian beliefs leak into the songs).

What a disturbing image that creates. It certainly is not a God I care to worship. They claim to quote Rachel's journals, in which they believe she wrote of God's prophecy about her coming death and the death of twelve others. If these are indeed Rachel's journals, it's possible that she was experiencing some type of premonition. How disturbing to think that she did not feel confident enough to tell someone. We cannot speculate about what might have happened, but to know that she kept such feelings to herself begs the question \\"Why?\\" Finally, the self-promotion of her parents and people like Bruce Porter at her innocent expense is the most disturbing element of all. Rachel, like the others, did not deserve to die. Neither does she deserve this continuing exploitation by people who love her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't kid yourselves.","review":"What happened to Rachel Scott at Columbine was a tragedy, but calling her a martyr is an insult to the memories of all the other people who died that day.

Trust me, they didn't put any thought into it, and Rachel would have been shot no matter what answer she gave them.Grieve for all of the people who died at Columbine and quit trying to make out like Rachel was better than everyone else.

After the one year aniversary, I wanted to read a book about it so I could better understand what happened and the grief that the community of Littleton, CO went through. I wanted to read a book that had a real message behind it, and that is exactly what Rachel's Tears contains. Rachel comes across as a beautiful and enthusiastic but otherwise average teen who struggled with the same problems that every boy or girl her age must face. The two things that helped her cope are her never ending faith in God and her ability to relate to those who were different from her. These two wonderful and rare qualities allowed Rachel to face her killers with the same courage that won her all of her friends and admirers during her special but brief life. Rachel died so God could share this message with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachel's Tears","review":"Rachel's Tears is a wonderful book! It is about a girl named Rachel Scott who was a victim in the Columbine High School killing. Two boys killed 12 students, one teacher, and finally themselves. When they were about to kill Rachel they asked her if she believed in Jesus and she said yes. A while after she was killed, her parents found about six journals full of letters, drawings, and her thoughts. Her spiritual relationship with Jesus was so great that He told and showed her how and when she was going to die. Before she was killed she referred to Columbine as the \\"Halls of a Tragedy\\". Even after her death she is still impacting the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read...","review":"This book grabbed me from the beginning.

She was proclaiming her love for her heavenly Father right to her very last breath. Am I that brave? Do I trust Him enough to do that? I like to think I do.

The account of Rachel's supposed \\"martyrdom\\" (i.e. the idea that she was shot after admitting to a belief in God) is completely and totally incompatible with original eyewitness testimony of her tragic death, all of which unanimously and unequivically state that there were no words whatsoever exchanged with her killers. Number two. The entire martyrdom story is almost verbatim identical to a story told about another Columbine victim, Cassie Bernell (and later proven false).So does this mean that \\"Rachel's Tears\\" is a shameless, unmitigated lie?

It speaks volumes as to the integrity of those individuals involved that they don't mind lying to the public AND using their religion as a ruse to sell books. Everyone is sorry for their loss but it is difficult to maintain a feeling of compassion for one who goes to such extremes of untruth to sell books.

However, since my oldest was born 14 years ago I have worked full time, not at all, and everything in between. The author states very early in the book that one of the first editors she sent the manuscript to rejected it and suggested that she not be quite as polarizing as she was right off the bat, and that she tone down the \\"staying home is definitely best - childcare is sub-par\\" message. Because of her non-negotiable position, I basically found myself mentally arguing with her throughout the whole book.I guess if a woman is just having her first baby and is able to stay at home right from the start, this might be a good book to read.

I have so seldomly read a book that Hollyweird didn't butcher so badly that the movie hardly resembles the book.

In DAWG they're way too opposite with conflicting agendas that they never made that love connection like I kept expecting. It just left a bad taste in my mouth at the end of the movie. I must admit there's a pretty good twist that I didn't see coming. But, looking back, it's kind of obvious. I just wasn't looking for it, I kept thinking they would fall in love or something like that. Sometimes a good twist can save a movie, for me, but it didn't warrant enough bite for me to appreciate the entire movie.Anyway, it's not a horrible movie, it's just not as good as DOUBLE WHAMMY. Perhaps, if I'd seen DAWG first, I may have liked it better. But I doubt it, seeing DOUBLE WHAMMY 2nd would have simply persuaded me back to this original conclusion anyway.

Anyway, Rick tries to create a helicopter taxi service. Got that? Because that's the movie's main plot!The songs are quite bad in this one. Do we think Elvis enjoyed singing \\"Datin'\\", \\"A Dog's Life\\" or \\"Queenie Wahine's Papaya\\"? I doubt it very much.Even Elvis isn't in the top of his form for this picture. He is noticeably a little pudgier than usual, and a lot of the dialogue is quite embarrassing to hear (much like TICKLE ME).The only saving grace to this picture is the beautiful scenery.

In every scene, he looks like he's just seconds from stomping off the set and going back to Memphis to figure out just where his movie career went wrong.In fact, here's a game for you: who looks more bored and disgusted for the entire length of a movie?Elvis in PARADISE or Sean Connery in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.It's not as easy to pick as you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, where's my career?","review":"What on earth is this stupid film about?

Adam Sandler's movies are either extremely funny or pathetically lame and boring. Nicholson has become a great comedic actor over the last 10-15 years, so I took a chance, and I'm very happy that I did. Sandler's portrayal of the pathetic loser was outstanding. From being bullied as a child, to becoming the whipping boy for his boss, he just is quiet and nice to everyone that treats him badly. Enter Jack Nicholson as an \\"Anger Management\\" guru. In most cases Sandler is playing the straight man to Nicholson, as Jack torments him to the point of explosion, which is where the adventure really starts. Sandler is led to confront the people who have wronged him in the past, with amazing results. The supporting cast is excellent, and you never know what's coming next. A twist ending wraps up the loose ends, and ties the story up perfectly. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tension Reliever","review":"I just love this movie. The premise and format is interesting and funny, even after watching it at least 10 times. Jack Nicholson was a perfect fit for the off-the-wall character, Dr. Buddy Rydell, even if Mr. Nicholson felt it a bit of a stretch himself. I like Adam Sandler's movies anyway, and this one was no different.Okay. I watched this movie again on New Year's Eve, 2006. I still enjoy this comedy. Reading some of the reviews, I get the impression that the reviewers expected something different than what was delivered in this movie. I like to watch it the way I did the very first time, with no expectation of what it should be, and enjoy it for what it is. Pure fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgarity brought to the extreme.","review":"I write this review mainly because the current \\"average customer review\\" doesn't reflect the level of this movie and doesn't give the potential buyer a fair and balanced assessment about the quality of this film.It is a colossal disaster. This motion picture redefines the phrase \\"a complete waste of time\\"; you just can't waste your time any better than you can waste it if you watch this film.Suffice it to say that after this film is over you will want to take a part in an anger management therapy group yourself, if only to vend all the rage and anxiety this film has created in you. The primary target of the writers is to stretch the nerves of the film's viewers to the point in which they will understand how it is to totally \\"lose it\\". I can give it to them - they've made it for me. Would you like to be another successful case in their disturbing experience?"},{"rating":"1","title":"badly executed fluff","review":"What a disappointment.

But watching the first hour of this film was perhaps the worst hour in front of the television I've experienced all year. I agree with another viewer that Jack was simply a major irritant, and except for Marisa Tomei I thought none of the actors brought much to the table. The dialogue was predictable and without comedic merit. Why did someone of Jack's calibre sign on to do this film?

There was no reason to make this movie. It could have satirized the rage in our ever-impatient society and the rage that drives psychiatrists to write anger-management books. However, it turned into a \\"Happy Gilmore\\" meets \\"The Odd Couple.\\" There was no reason to care about Adam Sandler even with Marisa Tomei as the dramatic stakes. Sandler lost whatever ground he gained with \\"Punch-Drunk Love,\\" and only \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" redeemed Jack Nicholson from the twin disappointments of \\"About Schmidt\\" and this movie. I will never be able to hear \\"I Feel Pretty\\" again.

But alas It has so many hits & misses in this movie. It was incredible. The plot of the movie is about a man played by Adam Sandler who is so passive. He should have of been a football. Mistakenly is sent to Anger Management. The supporting cast who by the way was in Mr. Deeds didn't add anything valuable to the movie except Heather Graham who was brillant.

My satelite provider had a free \\"premium movie stations\\" weekend, so thankfully I lost no money watching this comedy/trauma.Mere words cannot explain this movie. But like a 4 car pile-up, I felt compelled to look on horrified in disbelief.How Adam Sandler could pull together Jack Nicholson, John Turturro, and Marisa Tomei, and make such a steaming pile of cow manure is mind boggling! I can't imagine how much the cast was paid not to walk off such an embarrassingly bad flick.If you want to see the hokiest, most nauseating, unrealistic, sappy-ass ending to a movie ever, just tune in to the last 5 minutes.

Considering Adam Sandler's history, my expectations were not high but at least I had hoped for a pleasant diversion. Was I wrong! From the start this movie was painful to watch. This was as humorous and pleasant to watch as surgery on puppies without anesthesia. It may not have been as bad as \\"Ishtar\\" but I found it much more difficult to watch. My wife walked out of \\"Anger Mangagement\\" after only 10 minutes. She was \\"angry\\" enough to demand her money back.The situations were highly contrived, totally improbable and sophomoric. The world displayed in this movie was straight out of Dante's \\"Nineth Level of Hell\\". And, this was supposed to pass for humor.

Adam Sandler plays a designer of clothes for overweight cats who, through a series of unfortunate incidents, is sentenced to go through an anger management program with therapist Jack Nicholson. Although it seems that the comic possibilities are endless, somehow the laughs fail to come. There are a few funny moments, but they are surrounded with over-the-top, unfunny antics by the pushy Nicholson and unbelievable naivete by Sandler. There are several cameo appearances which are humorous and very appropriate for a film on anger management, but watch carefully because some of them are very brief. This is a concept loaded with potential which somehow falls flat from poor writing. The actors try hard, but are not given much to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"- 10 stars - as stupid as it gets","review":"I like Jack - not this rubbish.

(I'll admit that \\"Little Nicky\\" was a close second.) There are lots of great gags throughout the movie and as long as you keep in mind that the plot is just there to string the gags together you'll find that this movie is quite enjoyable! I'm sure that in the writing process the gags sprang from the plot, but the plot is definately not the strength of this movie. There are many ridiculous twists in the story that in retrospect are just plain stupid, but there's so much funny stuff going on that you hardly notice.

He doesn't get to be JACK, he just plays a watered down characature of himself. But the worst aspect of the movie is the very basis of the story. Sandler's character keeps getting set up and as a viewer you keep wanting a payoff, a reprisal, but the point of the movie is that his character won't do it. So you have a buildup of tension throughout the movie followed by a weak and rushed attempt at a payoff. The movie should have been dumped in the first draft stage.I chuckled at 3 throwaway gags in the film; the rest of the time I kept looking at my watch wondering when it would be over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anger Management is Sandler's best of his career, so far!","review":"This movie has a brilliant and funny beginning and an excellent ending to it. Adam Sandler stars as Dave Buznik, whose performance is his best since Big Daddy. Jack Nicholson stars as Buddy Rydell, the psychologist assigned to manage his anger. Nicholson's over the top performance as Rydell is brilliant and smart. Marisa Tomei stars as Linda, Dave's girlfriend, whose performance is also smart and goodhearted. Sandler's colleagues also star in the movie and they are funny and brilliant as well. The end credits have a song from The Rolling Stones called \\"19th Nervous Breakdown\\" which is brilliant to the movie's advantage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilariously Funny!!!","review":"Anger Management was truly entertaining. Nicholson and Sandler had perfect comedic timing and great on-screen chemistry. I saw this movie with my boyfriend, and we were laughing the whole way through. The movie is definitely not one you want to bring your young kids to, but it's a fun flick for the older generation. GO WATCH IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really stupid","review":"This is the stupidest movie I've seen in a long time and I think it may be one of the worst movies that I've ever seen. It's (with the exception of Nicholson) really not funny at all and it just seems to go on too long without going anywhere or doing anything. The ending was also awful. Are we really supposed to believe that Sandler would want to marry his girlfriend after she put him through all that? Don't buy this movie. Rent it once if you have nothing better to do and you're going to get drunk or something while you watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anger Management","review":"Adam Sandler and Jack Nicolson are funny in Anger Management, but lame and over-played jokes don't help this movie stay on its feet. With overplayed lesbian jokes and a bad disposition, Anger Management isn't exactly another shining Sandler movie. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repeat after me - \\"Goos-fra-ba...\\"","review":"This movie was hilarious - I can't believe all the people that ranked on it! If you read a lot of the reviews here you'll see that everyone who panned it said it didn't meet their \\"expectations.\\" That's the problem - I think, everyone expects a Nicholson film to be an award winner. If you're a Sandler fan, you'll enjoy this a lot although Nicolson is the funny one here as an eccentric, Jazzy-Beatnik doctor who flips over the line drawn between genius and maniac constantly. Its really fun to see Nicolson be this silly - \\"Did you hear a frog, Buddy?\\"There's also some great cameos and supporting actors. (Bobby Knight, MacEnroe, Heather Graham, Rudy Guiliani, John C. Reilly, Luiz Guzman, Woody Harrelson) but John Tuturro is the best as Sandler's highly-excitable, over-the-top \\"Anger Buddy.\\"Don't expect a blockbuster comedy - coz that it ain't, but I wouldn't be suprised in time if this movie gets a cult-classic following."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant and fun comedy","review":"This was a very good movie in our opinion. We enjoyed the brilliant acting as well as the plot of the movie. Having the personal experience of what it's like to hear someone tell you to relax while you are completely calm helps to connect with Adam Sandler in his role. The aggrevation that he goes through and the annoyance of everything that happens related to that anger. Jack Nickolson is as amazing as ever.I definitely recommend seeing this movie. Beware of the \\"I feel pretty\\" song. It gets stuck in your head for weeks and there is no way of getting rid of it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr Deeds can't match Nicholson's performance","review":"Nicholson is great, but it's too bad the rest of the movie can't live up to his talent. In a role tailored to his quirky character, Nicholson is brilliant, but Sandler's dull character and attempts at acting are no match. Sandler should never have taken the role opposite of Nicholson because it underscores he is no more than a wise crack with potty humor, not a serious actor with any depth. With a little better editing, I think anyone other than Sandler would have made this movie enjoyable. The pace was just enough to keep me from looking at my watch, wondering when it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ever? It's not even that good!!!!!!!","review":"What on earth does it say about shallow modern minds that people actually gave this a five-star rating?????? Unfathomable!!!Appalling drivel, all the more annoying in that I watched it on an evening when I was in need of a laugh or two.Script utterly devoid of anything remotely memorable, from structure to wit/humour....I agree completely with the person who wrote that you had to suspend disbelief over the nature of the story line to such an extent that the elastic snapped.To think that the box above insists I have to give this even one star.

If you like Adam Sandler's movies (any that have been released AFTER \\"Happy Gilmore\\" and \\"Billy Madison\\", in other words any Adam Sandler movie from 1998 or later), then you might like this movie. I cannot judge your opinion. With that caveat, here is my review:----------Like taking a cheese grater to your nether-regions, this movie is unthinkably painful to watch.If you're foolish enough to disregard my warning and you actually see the movie, know that you will need therapy afterwards...you might even need ANGER MANAGEMENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"This would have to be one of the worst movies that I saw last year!(the other being Matrixs Revelutions)It's portrayed as being funny when really it's anything but!It's too try hard where funny lines are ruined by bad acting and vice versa.I had to suffer through 2 hours or so or boringest were I nearly went to sleep,except the loudness of the movie wouldnt let me!This movie is like Cold Mountain.Way to much hype over a stupid and boring film."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAINFULLY UNFUNNY","review":"The poster sold the project: Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler nose to nose. ANGER MANAGEMENT (Columbia Tristar) is a series of stupid sophomoric skits. Even worse, instead of Sandler's well-honed crazed persona, he's normal here. A stupid film that could've been really funny if played as an angry guy meeting a REALLY ANGRY GUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DIDN'T LAUGH AT ALL","review":"I judge as a good comedy, a movie that makes me laugh. I didn't laugh at all. It's simply not believable.I will not criticize the actors.They are okay. The story is just flat with jokes that you expect longtime before they happen on screen. The worst moment is the scene in the stadium...completely bull.... I was bored and this therapy didn't work on me. It's completely the comedy genre you expect for Nicholson. On the other hand, it's too clean to fit Adam Sandler unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"sandler and nicholson, who came up with this","review":"I really didnt think this movie who'd do good in the theaters and it didnt and I thought that it was a waste of my money going to see Nicholson and Sandler sing west side story songs and Nicholson getting naked, im sorry. The funniest part who'd have to be Sandler getting yelled at everyone on the airplane and they stungun him. but, to my knoledge it was really boring after awhile. check out Sandler in his best performance in Punch Drunk Love, that was better than this. Tuturro has some funny moments also"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST NOT FUNNY!!!!!","review":"This movie was very highly anticipated and was number one at the box office and but I just didn't think it was funny at all. Is this a comedy? I just can't remember one funny moment?!?!?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is Greatly underrated","review":"It is hard to believe some of the low ratings of Amazon reviewers. I watched this movie with three other people and we were all cracking up all the way through. Some reviewers were trying to compare it to other Nicholson or Sandler movies, and maybe that's why they rated it low. Every movie has to be rated on its own merits, and this one certainly deserves five stars.No matter what you thought, the ending of Anger Management in Yankee Stadium, which is the best non-baseball segment ever filmed in a real Major League park, is worth the five stars on its own. The rest of this wonderful movie is just a build-up to this magnificent ending.The cameos, by top actors and actresses, with some not even credited, only add to the hilarious plot. This is a film you could see many times, and never stop laughing."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY Disappointing","review":"Every good scene was shown in the commercials. It was sophomoric, cliche, crude and poorly directed.I really couldn't believe that individual talents like Tomei, Sandler and Nicholson couldn't pull off something better than this.I'd hate to think that Rudy Guiliani read the entire script before he agreed to have a cameo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abismal","review":"Thank God I was smart enough to turn it off after 45 minutes. Thats over an hour of my life saved for sleeping. I did get screwed out of the $3, though. Give $3 to a homeless person, or burn it to keep warm before you rent this, and you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious idea, poor turn-out","review":"Anger Management (2003) Adam Sandler, Jack Nicholson, Marisa Tomei, Luis Guzman, Lynne Thigpen, John Turturro, Nancy Walls, D: Peter Segal. Redefines the phrase \\"odd couple\\": Sandler as an even-tempered businessman (who never sticks up for himself) is wrongly sentenced to an anger management session and Nicholson is his eccentric instructor who turns out to be more aggressive than him. One-joke screwball comedy had a good premise, not as funny as the critics quote it to be, better yet Sandler is less obnoxious than his actual persona inquires. Here, Nicholson is a real galling devil, and genuine comedy would come out of watching him convey his anger at a Laker's game. Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani give cameos. Running Time: 106 minutes and rated PG-13 for crude sexual content and language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as I expected","review":"Sandler and Nicholson together. What more do you need to know. Still, I was surprised that it was, after all, an OK movie. But then it wasn't a typical Adam Sandler film. That's probably why everyone else I know hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supposed to be funny?","review":"Like so many other reviewers, I picked up this movie because of its star power. It does not seem like you could go wrong with Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson. Looks like I was wrong though...Sandler's character does not have any anger issues, and it is frustrating to see his character go through so many runs of bad luck, and get blamed for things that are not his fault. All of the incidents rely on personal injuries and extreme immaturity, and I guess this is what the writers thought would make a good comedy. Unfortunately for them, it did not get too many laughs from our audience.If you can hold on for the last twenty minutes, things do clear up a little, and seem to be a little more sane. (The trick is just sitting through the first 75 minutes of the movie!) However it is not clear how Sandler comes out as a better person for all the time he spent in his sessions with Buddy (Nicholson). I was really hopeing for more of a comedy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"SWEET FANCY MOSES!!","review":"Boy! Did this movie suck donkey balls!! I was left terribly disappointed and furious! Nothing about this movie was pleasant. Nor did the \\"plot\\" make much sense for those of us who sat through this junk just because we wanted our money's worth. Please stay away and let's give a little prayer for Sandler and Jack so they may be forgiven by the masses and make a winner together some day..:) Thank you kindly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"That Maniacal Grin!","review":"Anger Management got pans instead of plaudits with many critics; I don't see it. Jack Nicholson's character reminded me of the role he played in The Witches of Eastwick; that evil, maniacal grin is back. Adam Sandler's bumbling, neurotic, dull character is a great counterpoint. The plot is sort of weak, the end is sort of predictable, but the movie's funny, the supporting characters are just caricatured enough to provide a comic addition instead of getting in the way, and I enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"just there","review":"I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler&Find Him Vastly Overrated&this film didn't change my stance on that.as for Jack Nicholson He should stay Court-side at Laker Games.He is just getting by with suspect film after suspect film.I haven't felt one of His films in Many Moons.this film was just something to watch&didn't move me at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anger Manegment","review":"In this movie, Adam Stanler stars as \\"Dave Buzznick\\", a compleltly normal guy with a completely normal life. When there is a misunderstanding on a plane, he is found guilty and sentenced to 20 hours of anger manegment. his anger manegment doctor \\"Jack Nicholas\\" recommends a 30 day close watch on Dave. He ends up moving in with Dave and since there is only one bed... you can guess. this movie is outragiosly funny. It's only weak point is the ending, the movie just seems tooo run out of good jokes, but overall this is one of the better movies I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Laughs","review":"There wasn't a single laugh in this wretched excuse of a comedy. Crude, yes. Dumb, certainly. But no laughs. Even though the movie is only 106 minutes long, it seemed endless. Adam Sandler used to be funny but this is three turkeys in a row for him (four if you count the painful Eight Crazy Nights cartoon). Jack Nicholson tried his best but with material like this, he didn't have a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least Sandler Is Consistant","review":"I only rented it because I thought Nicholson could offset the unwatchable Sandler.

The movie got funny until after 20 minutes and they showed some pretty stupid stuff (And I like stupid stuff!): lesbians stapling one of their mouth closed, the guy from cheers acting as a cross-dresser!, hurting a budhist and making fun of his retarded sister!, telling a woman that he is expolding in his pants and she says thats \\"too cute!\\", how much lame crap can you stuff into a movie!Don't bother watching this unless you want to see a sick movie and you are over the age of twelve."},{"rating":"2","title":"very entertaining","review":"a spectacularly funny movie that demonstrates Sandler's appreciable talent when given a powerfully written script and equally adept co-star.There is so much wit and expert acting in this film - I'm not sure what all the critics were expecting.A bitingly humorous and refreshing departure from the slapstick dumbguy tactics of so many other comedies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really funny","review":"The story is just ok until the plot twist is revealed which is the most contrived and unbelievable. It is almost as if the final plot surprise was written after the movie was screened.The con-game surprise ending really wipes out an already poor excuse for comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The script made me furious","review":"This film got off to a very promising start. Many of the elements were surreal but well-founded in pop psychology. The acting was quite good and Nicholson played Nicholson as he does in all his films, but quite good nevertheless. It started off quirky and offbeat and I did like the episode on the Airplane.It paced well, this was helped by Nicholson and Sandler. Then something went incredibly wrong...the film found its way into a packed baseball stadium (I am sure that most of the major Hollywood studios employ these guys to sabotage scripts and movies in order to make the movie more 'accessible' to the movie going public), it did not need this treatment as it turned a perfectly good film into a major turkey! and what the hell was Mayor Giulliani doing in this film anyway?.I felt quite angered by the end. I think I shall write an angry letter to the studio to demand my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"This movie is worth every penny!I am the BIGGEST Sandler fan in all of fan history, and i strongly recommend this movie to anyone, Sandler/Nicholson fan or not.I saw this movie 3 times.

However, like so many other people who had started out enjoying this, I was extremely disappointed at the ending. I could not help but feel gypped. A hilarious movie boils down to this???

Since there is nothing else to watch, and the flight is more than ten hours, you usually watch whatever is on T.V.

Now, the movie did have a lot of funny parts but it just wasn't good. The movie is based around Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) who mistakenly gets in trouble on an airplane. He is ordered by a judge to attend anger management sessions run by Doctor Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson). After another accidental mishap, the judge orders Dave to step up his therapy or spend one year in jail. Opting for more therapy, Buddy moves in with Dave to help him with his problem and all hell breaks loose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny Parts--Lame Overall","review":"I adore Jack Nicholson, and that's why I went to see this movie. I doubt I'd given it a second thought had he not been in it, because I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan. (Sandler was surprisingly not obnoxious, as he tends to be.)I laughed quite a few times. There definitely were entertaining parts of the movie. However, the storyline was incredibly stupid.

It was a numbing experience then and the most one can say for it now is: At least the Elvis impersonators will leave it alone. The story is weak, the co-stars are painful, and the soundtrack so bad, the weakest selling record of Elvis' career managed to kill of the Extended Playing record.

Not that his performance is bad, but the script and storyline are. It was obvious that Colonel Tom was cutting back on the what he was paying script writers inorder to try to make a quick buck. Even the songs in this one are not very good. Movies like this one are what killed Elvis' movie career and reputation as an actor. His management should have been fired for getting him into this one!Pass on this and get one of his early movies (Jaihouse Rock or King Creole are good) or maybe Blue Hawaii or GI Blues (they are far better than this one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a formula. Goes to show you, only times changed.","review":"\\"Easy Come, Easy Go\\" is a likeable in some sense. Elvis is a Navy frogman who's on a search for buried treasure hidden in a sunken ship under the sea. He finds it's linked to Dodie Marshall and with her help he tries to find it. But, there are some unwelcome searchers looking for it too. One of them being the enticing Pat Preist of \\"Munsters\\" fame. When the treasure is found, it's all in copper. But, they're able to get some money out of it. A good thousand or so dollars. Elvis' characters were never money hungry. This film has got all the '60s fads and fashions: yoga crazes, body painting, spaghetti/body art, swinging dance moves, swinging music, and a wheel full of girls called \\"The Love Machine\\". That one's a great movie song that's often looked down upon. It's so '60s themed like the Bond movie \\"Casino Royale\\" is.

Presley trimmed down for this film and he looks great. Despite the usual Wallis formula, Elvis gives a surprisingly adept performance and sings a few catchy tunes. However, the \\"Yoga Is as Yoga Does\\" number with Elvis and Elsa Lanchester must be seen to be truly believed. A far cry from the days of \\"Loving You\\" and \\"King Creole.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Come Easy Go should be for boats fans.","review":"If you got Elvis Presley and Dodie Marshall and put them in the same film you will have Easy Come Easy Go, an Elvis Presley that people who like boats or sailing or both will love. But anybody that hates boats or sailing and is an Elvis Presley fan will be un-happy. And Elvis' leading lady in this film is Dodie Marshall which I guess is a re-make of a film with the same name came out in 1947. And this is one of final films that Elvis sings the same song with somebody else, and the song is Yoga Is As Yoga Goes. He sings that with Elsa Lanchester who plays a not very nice yoga teacher.

Like it or not, Presley's popularity was diamterically opposed to his level of talent.

That's funny, as most biographers have no problem citing their sources. We could at least have had a bibliography here. Third, the author injects a LOT of speculation about Dick's state of mind, which is interesting but not in any way reliable as biographical material.

Carrere goes places and asks questions I'd never thought of in my 30-year dalliance with Dick's fiction. This book made me laugh out loud a dozen times and has rekindled my fascination with the major novels-- I'l be rereading my favorites all over again thinking of Carrere's clever melding of PKD's life and work. Sutin's exemplary bio dabbled in these waters. Carrere plunges in and-- with great creativity and humor-- renders a brilliant narrative that stands on its own while enriching one's understanding of Dick's oeuvre.So: if you've got a row of PKDs on your bookshelf, this belongs with them.

While the seat itself operates fine and is sturdy enough, the problem is this: the paint on this thing started blistering and peeling within a year. On every surface, all over. It's horrendous.

After a few weeks of intense usage, I found some problems. I found my legs fell asleep after only one hour of continuous use. This made it very difficult to get up without assistance. Also, I found if you start to sweat too much, which most of us do, you end up sticking to the seat when you get up and then the seat slams down making a bunch a racket and leaves a red mark. And finally, the comfort level of this seat is questionable. If you are the slightest bit boney in that area, there is potential for bruises after an active session.

I appreciate that trying to make training wheels to fit multiple types of bikes is a bit of a struggle; so I'm not upset that it took some work to get them on, and one of them required bending some of the plastic on the bike, and a bit of creative thinking too. Having done that, they seem to work. They are very solid and feel like they'll last a long time (depending on where my son parks his bike!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult, flimsy","review":"These training wheels were VERY difficult to install, and after all that work, rattle.

What I got was much deeper.When I put down the book I took with me the lesson that we must accept those who are different from us, and attempt to understand them, even if we are at odds on the surface. This sounds like a big lesson to get from cats, but perhaps coming from the animal world it makes more sense than if it came from humans.Character development was terrific. I often forgot that the main characters were cats, they were developed like human characters. Also, excellent use of setting, although there was a lot of techinical jargon that I'm not used to reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent fantasy epic, with wonderful characters","review":"Owned by 6 cats, I could not help but love this \\"can't put the book down\\" read.

This rankls right up there with the classic \\"Tailchaser's Song\\" and the newer \\"Wild Road\\" I applaud Warner-Aspect for printing this tale and hope others will follow.

It was quiet and really seemed to help my laptop keep cool. But after a few months, the cheapish construction started to break. Four of the fan \\"arms\\" on the right fan have broken off and the left fan now regularly makes a VERY loud whirling noise that it never made before. Turning the pad on and off will usually stop this noise, but the slightest shift in position or angle of the pad will start it up again. Also, I sit with the lap top actually on my lap... and I have to sit with my legs slightly set apart so that the fans can properly ventilate underneath. All in all, an okay product... but next time I will try to find a pad with higher quality construction. This one is just breaking down way too quickly and growing more annoying every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY!","review":"I purchased this product via Office Depot and it's a piece of junk! Almost a month after owning it one of the fans (the right one) quit working; we have to blow on it in order to get it going again, only to have it quit shortly after that. It really doesn't do a good job of cooling a HP laptop; the only way that happens on a warm day is to straddle the CPU unit over the one working fan, and that leaves the laptop unstable; and even then we have to shut the laptop down to cool it off after a while. Of course we haven't been through winter months with it so I can't vouch for that, but when it comes to cooling a laptop in warm weather; this is totally useless, not to mention a cheap product. If I were this company, I would be ashamed to put my name on this item. I am recommending to everyone that this is a two thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid","review":"I've gone through three of these things (only paid for the first, the other two were replacements sent from Targus), each one dying within a week.

The first time, it would make loud clicking noises in the fan. I returned it and got another.

I stopped using it only to have my desk, computer, or me heating up beyond endurance. I plugged in the mat again only to have to check it every 5 min to make sure it was still running.

I did lots of online research and picked out the perfect pad for me, and asked for it. What I received, however, was this miserable piece of garbage by Targus. It is everything the reviews here say it is. Mine is about 3 months old now and I constantly have to fiddle with the power connector to make sure it is working. I don't even bother using it anywhere but on a desk, because otherwise you have to pretty much hold the power connector on with your hand constantly to make it work. It is flimsy, cheap, chinese plastic and could easily be snapped in two with your bare hands. This is probably the worst cooling product on the market. Not that I have tried any others yet, but because I can not possibly imagine a more inferior product. If you really want to get rid of your 30 or 40 dollars that badly, do something more useful with it like lighting a cigar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life span","review":"I purchased this targus chill mat but after 9 months the fans began to make noise starting up.

The on off switch worked one time, once! The fans hardly move any air and still they were noisy, making tick tick tick sounds. If this is the best thing you can find go capture a couple of flies, tie em to a string and tape em to the back of your laptop. It will work as well as this does and instead of having to punch the thing when the fan noise has driven you crazy, just untape the flies and replace them with new living flies.

The fans would just randomly stop working. I would have to tap on it and set it a certain way on the table for them to start working then, in the middle of a game/work/email etc I would shut down due to overheating because the fans stopped working. I realized if I maneuvered the cord a certain way the fans would come back on so this is how I used it for about a month and it not only stopped working 70% of the time but after about 2 months I could no longer plug it in, the little metal thing that you plug the cord into was gone...if I shook it I could hear it rattling around inside. I did not save the packaging and do not have my receipt but I know I paid over $30.00 for this piece of crap. Please, I am begging you, donate the money to charity before you throw it away on this product!!! I couldn't choose less than 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best, dangerous at worst","review":"I wish this thing was built better, because when it works it keeps the laptop cool. But I've gone through two now and wouldn't buy another. The USB connector that goes to the laptop is kinda flimsy, and mine pushed all the way through - inevitable since the plug is always sticking out the back of the unit.Most concerningly is that the fan blades are curved and spin towards the curve. This means that if something sticks into the fan, they can catch on the case and completely jam the fan (bending the blade). Or worse: they can snap off and send a dangerous shard of plastic across the room or straight into your crotch. Thankfully, I've only seen the \\"across the room\\" option, but I've seen it eject across the room twice. Once those fan blades get a little bent (can happen if a piece of paper or something else gets caught in it), it's just a slow devolution from there.Summary: Works for a few months, and then becomes dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted 1 year","review":"I bought this about 16 months ago.

The mat IS very loud, but that was of less concern to me than the fact that the USB connector is extremely un-sturdy and became damaged quickly, necessitating the connector to be held down to make the mat work.

A collaboration with Lauryn Hill (it was written by her and she sings background vocals), this song is simply beautiful, about the many splendor things you feel when you love someone. Mary HAS talent, unlike many of the current R&B trendsetters, Mary can sing and this song is no exception. She shines on this 70's groove song, it will make you smile. Mary sings about real life, about real things she's experienced, and especially on this song I can feel what shes saying, I feel through her music I can truly understand what shes putting in her music.

I know this is just the \\"icing\\" so to speak but it was the final selling point to me as I do not customarily spend quite so much on a soundtrack. The screen saver could have been much better.

I am not a Potter fan but I am a John Williams fan. But this soundtrack I would have to say does not sound like the same Williams I've know since the 80's. When Chamber of Secrets came out so many Potter fanatics were upset saying that the music is not scary enough. Why does John Williams use so many bells? Well those fans will be happy with this soundtrack then. The music is very mysterious. However I like the more action beat and happier songs such as Aunt Marge's Waltz and the Knight Bus. So far my favorite song however is The Whomping Willow. I think John Williams was able to create a much darker film than the second just by the music alone. Of course the difference in the music is also due to Alfonso Curon the new director because the director always has a little bit influence on what the music becomes. This is definatley a series just like Star Wars that will be a collection of great music that will be a must own."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Themes","review":"Never have I heard John Williams use so many different types of music to score one movie! Parts of this album will remind you why you fell in love with the Harry Potter scores in the first place, but you'll also hear music that reminds you of the \\"Star Wars\\" Cantina, and the jazzy sounds of \\"Catch Me if You Can.\\" \\"Aunt Marge's Waltz\\" reminds you of classical music written over a hundred years ago. The dominating sound of this album, however, can only be described as \\"Medieval.\\" No songs portray the feel of an old Scottish castle better than \\"Double Trouble\\" (with lyrics from \\"MacBeth\\") or \\"Hagrid the Professor.\\" Much like he did with \\"Indaiana Jones and the Last Crusade,\\" John Williams reuses his old themes just enough the remind you that it's still the same series. Easily, 90% of this score is music that you have not heard from the first two films, and in my opinion it is the best \\"Harry Potter\\" score yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"I have always been a John Wiliams fan.

Now I have his book in the back seat of my car as I drive around on daily errands I look around for that Pink Cab (and they are EVERYWHERE) with Michael Suib so I can score and autograph.

Right now my favorite characters of the book are Rita,Turk and Stuart these are people you would want to know and have as friends for a lifetime.

Just wanted to say great job and can't wait for the next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"structure problems","review":"After reading 150 pages of the book, KEEPER OF SECRETS: DAY ONE.I returned it to the bookstore for a refund. The book is poorly structured, has too many subplots and obviously no editing. There are frequent shifts in points of view and the excess of far too many characters makes it hard too see where the author is taking the story. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY EVEN IF IT IS ON THE .99 CENT TABLE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing","review":"I tried to read this book and found the plot lines and characters too confusing to follow. I bought this book from the author who compared himself to a favorite author of mine, James Patterson, and I'm sorry to tell Mr. Dunson, but he doesn't even come close. Without saying anything about my feelings, I gave my book to 2 friends to get their opinion. They both gave up without finishing it saying that they thougt it was too confusing and couldn't follow it. Remember, when developing characters and plot lines, sometimes less is more. A very disappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable but too many characters","review":"I purchased this book because I had the privilege to meet the author at a convention this month. Mr.Dunson was pleasant and informed me that the book's setting is in and around the Atlanta area. I read this book from start to finish in 3 days. I did get lost in the sea of characters and felt the need to go back to prior pages to make sure I hadn't missed anything. I look forward to Day two. I passed this book on to a colleague."},{"rating":"1","title":"New writer has potential..........but too many characters","review":"I enjoyed the story plot of politics and all the gruesome \\"dirt\\" that is assocoiated with it. I agree with other reviewers about this book. There are far too many characters in this book!!!!! Reading should be enjoyable and comforting. You should not have to continuously look back over pages to see who is who.The setting in Wash., DC also intrigues me...I feel Mr. Dunson has a great writing style but too too many characters in this novel.Who ...is Sam Chase who was introduced in the last chapter??????? See what we mean, on the last page an new character was injected."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCITING FROM START TO FINISH","review":"I must admit, when I purchased this book I thought that due to having such a busy schedule, it would take me some time to complete. But it turns out that from page one, the book is exciting and a real page turner. It took me a little over a day to read.The characters are complex, but not to the point where you loose track of who's done what. The story line is simple, but not so simple for it to be boring or predictable. And because I live in Atlanta, and have friends in Miami and DC, the buildings, streets, and surroundings were familiar to me and I could easily see myself being there as well.I recommend that avid mystery readers pick up a copy of this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Good...But Definitely Not the Worst","review":"I recently watched this movie with my young niece and nephew. They like Elvis but most of his movies are pretty hard to take. To keep them occupied, I told them that Elvis never left Hollywood to make this movie so they needed to spot the real Elvis shots and the other location shots that featured a double. It worked. Between songs, they had fun picking out the real locations from the bad rear-projection shots of Elvis.\\"Bossa Nova Baby\\" is the only real song worth anything (like \\"Return to Sender\\" was the only real song in GIRLS! GIRLS! GIRLS!). The rest all sound like bad Mexican tunes about bulls or bullfighters. Ursula Andress is hot but she's a long way away from Honey Rider in DR. NO.The best of Elvis's post-Army movies was VIVA LAS VEGAS and the worst--and there are a lot of them--would be HARUM SCARUM. FUN IN ACAPULCO would fall directly in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Formulaic Plot For Talentless Presley","review":"I've come to the conclusion that Elvis fans are simpletons. Here's another in a long, line of Presley vehicles that combines a juvenile plot, silly acting, and endless three chord songs with inane lyrics. This guy's acting was worse than his singing---and that's saying something. The most conspicuous thing about the movie is the amount of grease is Presley's hair and the repetitiveness of his monosyllabic dialogue. He was a real cornball with a gnat's IQ and no talent. Truly, do his idol-worshipping fans realize that Presley's IQ was under 80? If it wasn't for Colonel Parker, Presley would have spent the rest of his days driving trucks and eating fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches. Uh huh, uh huh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonerfull Movie! Fun In Acapulco.","review":"KEN'S Review on Elvis movie Fun In Acapulco. Elvis has his hands full as a would-be cliff diver and former aerialist attempting to simultaneously cure his acrophobia and win the hand of an aloof displaced royal (Ursula Andress). Add to the mix a pint-sized impresario hoping to break our hero as a lounge act, the inevitable swarthy romantic rival, and a sultry lady bullfighter, and you'll see why \\"You Can't Say No To Acapulco.\\"Me and my wife Kathys have all 31 of Elvis Presley movies and this is one of oyr Favorites. Great Music, Dacing and Songs. I would recommened this movie to all Elvis Presley FANS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Numb in Acapulco","review":"All you ask from an Elvis movie is a couple a decent songs and a sense of fun, but this flick can't even manage that. The fantastic Ursula Andress is TOTALLY wasted and Elvis is starting to get that \\"just here for muh paycheck\\" attitude so common in his later movies. Sadly the music is sluggish too - lazy gunk about bold toros and other s'pozedly Mexican themes, with no rockin' hits at all. If you want a first-rate Elvis from this period I recommend \\"Viva Las Vegas\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis almost...not quite...hits bottom","review":"Whoever rates this movie with 5 stars obviously knows zilch concerning motion pictures as an art form (which it is, by the way). Guided with HORRIBLE management from the illegal alien, Elvis \\"shows up for work\\" (exact quote). So sad what happened to this guy. I certainly disagree with the 1 star reviews (they know nothing concerning an up-and-starter-turned-into-product-for-the-machine). This movie can be explained in one word... cheap! Everything about it is cheap. No wonder Elvis would later say. \\"This whole town (Hollywood) is laughing at me\\" (another exact quote). If it were filmed on location, I may even rate it with 3 stars...average. But, of course, that was impossible. Mexico has quite different laws concerning extradition, particularly concerning a possible murder suspect. Why oh why didn't \\"E\\" fire that guy????"},{"rating":"2","title":"A zippy Presley vehicle with gusto!","review":"Fun in Acapulco is one of Elvis' top 5 movies. When he made it in 1963, he still had zip in his step and conviction in his voice. Those aspects faded after he completed Viva Las Vegas.The scenery and songs are good with the South-of-the-Border flavoring, the script is one of the best ones in any Elvis movie, and when he breaks out into a song, it is on stage or in a more appropriate situation-not just starting to sing in the middle of a fight or something.Fun in Acapulco showcased some of Elvis' acting ability as his character overcame his fears. Given a chance, Elvis could act, but his fans preferred to see him sing and dance. You get plenty of both in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"Jack Vance has some great books, but has also written quite a few not-so-great ones. I expected this book, which was originally a short story but later expanded to novel size, to be one of the not-so-good ones. I was pleasantly surprised. The action is fairly constant throughout the first 3/4 of the book. Things slow down towards the final chapters, and the ending is slightly disappointing. Still, all in all, this is a better-than-average story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I had never read anything by Jack Vance before, and I expected this to be a rather juvenile effort. I mean, it was about a sea serpent, dammit! How do you make a decent story out of that? He sure as hell did! Everything in the book is not only scientifically but also sociologically plausible. If this is one of Vance's minor efforts, I can't wait to see his good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Third of a Century","review":"I read this book during a midshipman cruise in 1966.

What surprised me was how much I enjoyed it. Vallone has a way of buckling the reader right into the cockpit with his vivid recollections of the many adventures and mishaps experienced among this close-knit band of voyagers. The book also provides us with a geography refresher and a unique look into Africa's apartheid in the 70's.

There are no major hits here, but the album is solid throughout. If you're not a \\"Bicycle Race\\" fan, take comfort: it's one of the weakest tracks on the album. My favorites are \\"Fun It,\\" \\"Leaving Home Ain't Easy,\\" and \\"Dead On Time.\\" Lots of good songs here. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracks","review":"Side 1: Mustapha (Mercury); Fat Bottomed Girls (May); Jealousy (Mercury); Bicycle Race (Mercury); If You Can't Beat Them (Deacon); Let Me Entertain you (Mercury)Side 2: Dead on Time (May); In Only Seven Days (Deacon); Dreamers Ball (May); Fun It (Taylor); Leaving Home Ain't Easy (May); Don't Stop Me Now (Mercury); More of That Jazz (Taylor)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite all-around Queen album","review":"As the title says, this album shows all sides of Queen in their best light. Mustapha, Dead on Time, Bicycle Race, Let Me Entertain You, and Fat Bottomed Girls all rock pretty hard. Jealousy and In Only Seven Days have lovely melodies. Don't Stop Me Now is a great pop song. This album and their debut album are their only records that I play all the way through rather than just listening to my favorite tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz ... oh yes.","review":"It doesn't really get any better than this. This album has everything Queen were capable of. Rock, Opera, Baroque, Ballads and even dance (or disco)! To me, this is Queen summing up everything they had put onto a record throughout the 70's with a glimpse of the areas they were going to venture into in the 80's and beyond. Fat Bottomed Girls and Bicycle Race are the songs that everybody knows inside and out (heh), so no need to discuss those. Personally, my favorites on this album are Roger's, funnily enough. Fun It is just a really fun song and More of that Jazz displays Roger's vocal capabilities quite well. Just listen to those high notes he hits. Up until a few weeks ago, I was certain that Dreamer's Ball was written by Freddie - it reminds me very much of Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon and Seaside Rondevouz from Opera, but it was in fact written by Brian. Another of my favorites. As I always say, go out and buy Jazz if you want to get to know Queen 70's. It has it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen's Magical Carpet Ride Continued","review":"Jazz is the culmination of Queen's super 70s trip. Extremely eclectic and manic - this album varies from hard rock (Let Me Entertain You) to sweet ballads (Jealousy) to pop rock (Fat Bottomed Girls) to arabic parodies (Mustafa) to top 40 material (Don't Stop Me Now). Somehow, the band managed to cram and jam blend a library of musical genres (with the exception of country and classical) into this collection. The result? The album called Jazz which I guess sums up the free form exploratory nature of Queen's playful side. Impossible to categorise and yet eminently listenable - Queen was only just getting started. Some excellent songs here but the extremes as I read have been tough on some reviewers. Add it to your collection anyways - and enjoy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen In Danger","review":"When this came out, Queen was having trouble and becoming a bit passe. They were unable to replicate their success with NATO or DATR and were under pressure (pun not intended) to put out product. Jazz succeeds sometimes but does not work as a unit as their previous releases did. Also, the artwork on this release was ghastly (awful cover and poster)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't pay attention to the first comment...","review":"...this album is fantastic! The art is good (although I'm not sure if the CD comes with the \\"Start of the nude bicyle race\\" poster that the LP had) and the music is classic Queen. I'm not a fan of their slower, more melodramatic music, so I can't say I love every song, but even the slower songs are pretty good. This album certainly rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"No jazz here...","review":"This special edition is a worthwhile purchase for true Queen fans. The cd and some other funny things are carefully packaged in a very nice fold-out cardboard cover. It also features the famous \\"nudists race\\" poster, a lyrics sheet with all the lyrics in English and Japanese, a miniature lp wrap and an additional track list. I think \\"Jazz\\" is one of Queen's best albums because it shows the entire range of this band. It's a very diverse record and captures both the operatic and rocky side of Queen. Best songs here are \\"Fat bottomed girls\\", \\"Bicycle race\\" and the hard rocking \\"If you can't..\\". The funky rhythm of \\"Fun it\\" obviously is a blueprint for \\"Another one bites the dust\\". In my opinion \\"Jazz\\" was Queen's last great album. Their '80s-work doesn't appeal to me because it's lightweight and commercially oriented, while their '90s-work is over-pretentious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not the best.","review":"I know this is many people's favorite Queen album, but I can't get away from the feeling that this one has alot of filler in it. True Bicycle Race is one of their best songs and lyrically it's brilliant (what other song can combine Watergate and Star Wars?) But songs like Leaving Home Ain't Easy, In Only 7 Days and Fun It are not up to the usual Queen standards. Having said that, Jazz does have some gems. Let Me Entertain You, Dead On Time and Dreamers Ball rank with best of Queen. I just keep wondering if they were all still on the same page all the time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Queen album - But a couple of good songs","review":"Well, this is where Queen sold-out. Freddie got bored and ran out of Ideas after News of the World. The albums before this album have much more Flavour. If you look at the albums after this - 'The Game' - Funk, 'Hot Space' - Munich Disco, 'The Works' - Weaker Song writing, 'A Kind fo Magic' - Better songwriting, very commericalised though, 'Miracle' - Very late eighties , 'Innuendo' - Better ...... You can see a turning point here. The band, writing to order just churn out another album, titled 'Jazz' for no reason. Freddie and Brians Avant -Garde , Bohemian , exploritory flavours ebb away to a commercial lift music album.Not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp Pop Metal","review":"Queens's brand of catchy pop metal was hugely popular in the 70s, but now it all pretty much sounds the same. This album includes the singles \`Fat Bottom Girls' and \`Bicycle Race', a dubious benefit. If you a casual fan, you probably would be best of with a greatest hits, there is nothing especially inspiring here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen's Crown A Little Rusty On \\"JAZZ.\\"","review":"As a former member of the International Queen Fan Club, I think I speak with some authority when I say that \\"Jazz\\" is not one of Queen's best albums. Queen's songwriting well seems to have dried up on this one. The songs are weak, forgettable and lack that special Queen \\"something.\\" It sounds like the kind of album bands do when they owe their record company one more album in order to get out of a bad recording contract. The only time I saw Queen was at the Oakland Coliseum on their \\"Jazz\\" tour. I went to the show hoping they would play their old stuff and a minimum number of songs from the disappointing \\"Jazz.\\" Go play Queen's \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" CD right after listening to \\"Jazz\\" and you'll hear the difference. I don't see any reason to recommend Queen's \\"Jazz.\\" Definitely NOT a high point in their career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the old Queen!","review":"Jazz is one of my least favorite Queen CD's. Besides Mustapha and Don't Stop Me Now, this album is to be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change the Image for the Product!","review":"While everything arrived in time and great packaging, the banner I received was completely wrong. Rather than receiving the old school Mighty Ducks banner, I received the new Anaheim Ducks banner. I have been looking for the old school Mighty Ducks banner for a long time and have gone through 3 returns with 3 different companies, they all had the wrong image on. So I suggest you change it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath Of Fresh Air In The World Of Big Government Spending","review":"There is so much to say and John Stossel does a good job. The huge amount of spending by our ballooning government is destroying the fabric of our country. People do not know that most welfare does not go to low income persons, but instead goes to giant corporations so that they can pay top management tens of millions of dollars. People do not know that the middleclass is being vaporized by governement and corporate policies. The government and giant corporations are in cohoots. People do not know that welfare to low income persons helps the country immediately because the money is put back into the economy immediately. People do not know that the vast amounts of welfare paid to giant corporations do not help the economy because is money is sidelined and put back into the economy very slowly or taken out of the country. We do not need all of this wasted spending."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Dimensional Vapidness","review":"I was given this book as a gift and I simply have to say the this excuse for editorial comment should be avoided at all costs. Stossel attempts to take complex issues and transfer them into one dimensional sound-bytes. He is but another Geraldo but without the field work.If you want good advice go to the source and find those writers in this genre that have both insight and academic grounding.One for the donation bag in my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could you not like this book?","review":"Stossel is the typical American - brainwashed by media and traditional educational systems - until he opens his eyes and starts to learn through actual empirical evidence.This book should be required reading by all high school students in some \\"life experience\\" course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing new here","review":"While Stossel's book is well written and easy to read, save a few typos, the content isn't new.Pick up any book written by an economists in favor of capitalism and you'll find a wealth of reasons why America's government is too big and why social programs don't help, but hinder, the less fortunate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"One of my favorite reads. Very interesting and enjoyable. A lot of common sense... I agree with 99% of what he says. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Pretty much a word for word rehash of his 20/20 segments. For those that watch and agree with him, that can be redundant.

Stossel for president...","review":"I do not agree with everything Mr. Stossel has to say, but his assessment of the economy and poverty is dead on. This book is saturated with the evidence. Buy a copy. Buy another for your spouse. Buy one for your grandparents and friends. Heck, buy a case. This book should be taught in schools (but heaven forbid the government teach anything that undermines its effectiveness)."},{"rating":"2","title":"of course liberals attack impircal data","review":"Why is that a liberal demands \\"scientific evidence\\", but when it doesnt fit their mantra, its a lie, or its pro Bush. Which reduces their credibity more. This is a good book for anyone who isnt lead by their television, and can create an opinion other then one mention on the liberal media"},{"rating":"2","title":"welcome antidote","review":"It's a cliche, but this book should be in every high school classroom, to counter the torrent of anti-free-market thought which indoctrinates our society.Stossel gives example after example of how markets work, and how, usually, government outside its proper bounds, doesn't.This book is readable, enjoyable, makes your blood boil (after reading about our tax dollars squandered), and hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thought Provoking Case","review":"\\"Give Me a Break\\" is little more than a printed collection of Jon Stossel's TV specials and investigative reports sprinkled with a dash of biography. Those who have followed the newsman will find little new material, but for a majority of readers it will be an eye opening case for less government and more personal responsibility.Although the Stossel leans to the right, his viewpoint is more Libertarian than Republican, and members of the left and right will be equally offended and supportive of his ideas. Stossel relies mostly on anecdotal evidence (which makes sense given his background), but includes enough statistical evidence to maintain his credibility.Stossel goes after a number of sacred cows, and readers unwilling to hear his side of the issue will have trouble making it through the book. Open-minded readers however, will find a book that may not convince them one way or another, but will definitely make them think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"If you like John Stossel's journalism, you'll like this book. If you don't like his journalism, then you won't like this book. The same goes for his other book. I too am glad that Stossel narrated the audiobook himself.I have been very disappointed with the subtitle of the book, which calls him \\"the Scourge of the Liberal Media\\", because it implies that Stossel is conservative, which he is not. It also implies that he is not liberal, which he is... in the original sense of the word (i.e. one who believes in liberty)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give ME a break","review":"Stossel is a simpleton, and his hatred of our government borders on the pathological.

Let's see how this clown fares when the public lion wakes up and tears his ligaments to shreds !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompus","review":"John Stossel should go to work for the Fox News channel because this book, and his short stories on 20/20 only give out the information he chooses to give out and never tell the complete story. It is hypocritical to criticize the \\"liberal media\\" when he IS the media! If he doesn't like the media then he doesn't like himself. I saw him on Bill O'Reilly. It was like John's \\"coming out\\" party as a conservative. It was as if O'Reilly was Satan and Stossel was signing his soul over. He looked very ashamed and he should be.

Now it is no longer a wonder to me that such a recent release would be left abandoned on public transit. Pure dreck written in a smug, insulting style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, funny and fast reading.....but a serious book.","review":"This is an amusing and engaging book that seems breezy and light in tone, but it packs a serious and well grounded message.Stossel engagingly tells his career journey from apprehensive stuttering journalist to accomplished big time network anchor (on 20/20) and his intellectual journey from Ivy League Liberal to free market libertarian.The prose is simple and direct, as is his logic and data gleaned from hundreds of investigative stories. The book will resonate with authenticity for those who like Stossel moved from liberal to conservative. For those still in the liberal camp, this book will provide you with a good intellectual work out,challenge your assumptions and most likely get you to move a few steps to the right."},{"rating":"2","title":"deflating the bad arguments of right and left","review":"It is refreshing to see someone like Stossel with a large public audience take on the nonsensical policies and positions of both the right and the left, as well as to admit when he makes mistakes (unlike most of his targets). He goes after corporate freeloaders like Archer Daniel Midlands that politicians of both major parties support; he points out the absurdity of regulations and lawsuits in the name of safety that cost more lives than they save. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me a Reference","review":"This book was a quick and interesting read. It was thought-provoking and I appreciated what Stossel had to say on a variety of topics. There were only a few spelling and grammatical errors.My problem with this book is that Stossel backs up only some of what he says. He provides good rationale for some of his arguments, but sweeps through many of them. For instance, he thinks the FDA should be disbanded, but devotes only one paragraph to explaining why.There are no endnotes and footnotes. One of his tables had no scale on the Y axis! There is no way to check his facts; we're supposed to trust everything he says. It's ironic that an investigative reporter would expect his readers to mindlessly accept his position on so many crucial issues.If you choose to read this book, look forward to being exposed to some valuable insight and ideas. But put on your critical thinking cap first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gouging the American Public","review":"If you'd like a sampling of the kind of deep thinking Mr. Stossel engages in, please examine this link.[...]In this article, Mr. Stossel defends people who price gouge during times of disasters such as hurricane Katrina. This is his notion of a free market. The only thing you will learn from his book is how one goes about cynically exploiting the paranoia and hatred of a segment of popular culture in the name of personal career advancement - and for that there are many and better examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"If he couldn't beat them, he joined them.","review":"First he says he cracked down on all those \\"liberals\\" but yet he admits to loving their evil ways. If this is as wishy washy as he can get, no wonder he and Sam Donaldson get along ! You can't expect to be credible if on the one hand you attack them but on the other hand enjoy a nice and cushiony rich job offer from these same \\"liberal media\\". If he were working as a farmer in Idaho for instance, he'd have more credibility but I'm not so sure Stossel says what he means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious Self-Promotion","review":"John Stossel is a throughly undistinguished little man with a tiny, vindictive mind. For years he was a Geraldo Rivera want-to-be but he never quite mastered Jerry's nauseating fake machismo and swagger. He makes up for that by braying like an old woman in books like this. His claim that he was \\"the scourge of the Liberal media\\" is pathetic and laughable. Stossel has fallen on hard times since his 20/20 glory days and has now become Bill O'Reilly's official shoe shine boy over at FoxNews. If you admire Anne Coulter, Sean Hannity, Glen Beck, and their stellar journalistic standards of \\"fair and balanced\\" you'll love Johnny Stossel."},{"rating":"1","title":"So how did he bust them? Why, he joined them of course !","review":"Of course Stossel can talk big about busting them \\"liberals\\" but his book makes no sense about it because he admits that he never intended to bust them but instead join them. Ever wonder why ABC hires such kooks while rejecting talented youths? Ever wonder why Stossel says that the best way to punish them elites is to give them more tax breaks?

John should stick to his day job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for honest liberals","review":"I admit that I'm a conservative, but that does not prevent me from inviting every thinking, truth-seeking liberal to read this book. It simply exposes the folly of knee-jerk liberalism. The strongest chapters are about how valuable CAPITALISM is in giving us the highest standard of living in the world. (Even our poorest citizens have one or two color TV sets!) Stossel leads with his chin into a lot of controversial subjects (and often pays a dear price) but his experience in seeing and reporting \\"what works and what doesn't\\" makes this a valuable book. I'm going to make sure all of my close friends, as well as all of my liberal acquaintances, read my copy of \\"Give Me a Break.\\" It's honest and simply presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved this Book!!!","review":"This book is a MUST read. I have always liked John Stossel's Give me a break on 20/20, but this book was even better. I thought the he was just another bias network news \\"journalist\\" but he is actually a REAL journalist and is looking for the facts.

Remand it, and discard this dup. Which spelled backwards is..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is This?","review":"I had a lot of respect for John Stossel since 20/20 is one my favorite primtime syndicates. Problem is, Stossel does not write anything convincing and leaves TONS of holes through his book it leaves you asking many questions.Liberal Media? What Liberal media? There is no such thing. Sure you will find a few radio stations and about one or two television stations, but other than that, everything is conservative. And the conservatives complain about this so called \\"Liberal\\" media when it's their own people doing the reporting! Things like this make me very sick and makes me wonder how stupid Republicans can get! Obviously very stupid! What's less believable is that Stossel claims to be a Libertarian. Uh-huh. Right. The only type of people that talk about \\"Liberal\\" media are the liberals' archenemy: Conservatives.John Stossel, your lies and terrible book are the scourage of your own pig-headedness. Give ME a break!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really should be zero stars","review":"The author loves to hate lawyers because they sue for punitive damages, yet he tries to cover up that when a man he was interviewing punched him in the nose, he sued and accepted $200,000.00 in punitive damages. The author sounds all macho when he's in front of the conservative CATO Institute, but really he's just a run-of-the-mill right-winger who engages in \\"risky journalism,\\" most notably protectionism for the chemical industry. This pleases his CATO buddy, Steven Milloy, a lobbyist for the chemical imdustry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big talk big deal.","review":"For all the talk Stossel makes about how he exposed all that he claims to hate, he grants himself a nice big fat deal of a job at ABC. The only reason Stossel switched from liberal to libertarian was his opportunistic behavior. For all that he claimed to expose, it was the ordinary folks doing it for him while he stole the credit. Stossel would be better off exposing fundamentalists in the Arab world if he cared to prove himself worth anything other than a pile of dirt talking dirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"The Title of the book says it all, \\"...Scourge of the Liberal Media...\\"John Stossel is in the media, and he's definitely not liberal.

Gimme a break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stossel for President!","review":"If you have ever heard the expression, \\"there isn't a dime's worth of difference between the Republicans and the Democrats\\", then this book is for you! John Stossel uses many examples of how government and court cases makes life worse for us rather than better. He doesn't promote theories but gives concrete examples of policy and court events and the ending results. He makes a strong and convincing argument for litigation overhaul.He should subtitle this book, \\"A Common Sense Guide for America\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Me a Break","review":"John Stossel has made the same philosophical journey that I have taken in recent years. I enjoyed reading how someone else made the transition to a free market believer."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"This book is interesting and not your run of the mill, non-fiction, the media sucks book.

Part autobiography, part poetry, part philosophical commentary, A Delicate Fade is a masterpiece that may well be Mr. DeVries magnum opus, and grant him the immortality of Harper Lee, Sartre, and Whitman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tangerine Dream's darkest hour?","review":"This album is an unimaginative collection of some 11 5-minuters, nearly all of which sacrifice the traditional Tangerine Dream approach of innovative and varied synthesiser and sequencer programming for a uniformly bland sound world of everyday synthesiser string washes and jangling guitar lines over a relentlessly boring rock drum-machine beat. Gone is the variety of tempo of earlier albums. In fact, gone is any great variety of anything! Only the short \`Penguin Reference' manages to capture some of the sparkle of earlier Tangerine Dream successes, while the incorporation of alto sax into the tracks \`Body Corporate' and \`Red Roadster' give some new interest and also look ahead to the later incorporation of Linda Spa to the group.(For a fuller review of this disc, see its entry on the amazon.co.uk site.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stagnantly digitized and over effected","review":"What's missing from this album in my opinion is the genuine soulful moods that albums like 'Le Parc', 'Poland', 'Force Majeure', and 'Optical Race' provided. What's missed even more is the last key element (the former to the last being Paul Haslinger in the lineup and before him Chris Franke) to that soulfulness most folks don't recognize-- Edgar Froese's uncanny guitar solos! Instead of passionate and intelligent guitar melody countering the syths, Rockoon offers leadened egghead riffiness from a Satriani-esque player, Zlatco perica.I found myself annoyed through this album mostly though I will have to say that I like Red Roadster and Big City Dwarves.I'd recommend Turn of the Tides, or The Goblins Club where I feel the 'New' sound has come together a bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked this CD a lot","review":"I can't understand the dislike of this cd shown by other reviewers. To each their own, but here's a positive review. I'm not a TD aficionado, having only 3 of their works, and I liked the Thief and Sorcerer works too. This album has lots of nice pieces, especially the final two. It may be a departure from their early work, but you can't expect them to keep doing the same stuff over and over. And the length of over 50 minutes gives you more worth than 35 minute ones that cost as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I've been looking forward to the digital release of this classic album by two guitar greats.

There is more joking around as well.Never the less, if that recording, buy it. Else, purchase this recording.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves. With some who are less mature, this the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"},{"rating":"1","title":"noodle & doodle","review":"I was excited to find this selection on Amazon and I ordered it right away. I think Les Paul is a national treasure and Chet Atkins is no slouch either. The music was a great disappointment. It sounds like they just sat down for the first time with no preparation and that each played gingerly for fear of outdoing the other guy. They succeeded so well that, in my opinion, the result is thoroughly weak. I also have very little use for the \\"Boys Club\\" style comments before during and after some of the numbers. This selection should be marketed as the informal practice session that it is. Normally, I complain about cd's offering significantly less than an hour of music. Here it's a relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN CD and Great Music","review":"If you like popular guitar, appreciate icons in American guitar, and enjoy hearing two old masters do their thing, then this CD is for you!

I love books that challenge my thinking and take what I think I know and turn it on it's head, so if this had been an exploration and a challenging take on religion and science and what happens to beliefs faced with reality that challenges those beliefs, I would have been intrigued. But the main character is faced with a world that challenges his belief system - and decides the world is wrong. No discussion, no real thinking about it. He agonizes over what to do about it, but never faces the question, \\"Hmm - I wonder if it is possible to be moral without a God. What if my beliefs are wrong?\\" It was just annoying and boring to be subjected to the false \\"moral dilema\\" over and over. If the author intended this to raise questions in the reader about belief, he played it too straight for me. The only question it raised for me was \\"Why did he waste one of the most intriguing alien societies I've seen on this?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad story, wicked, nefast book","review":"I deeply regret having lost a few hours reading this book. The first few pages can be entertaining, but later you simply can't believe how everything gets absurd and the plot becomes illogic. The scientific details are irritating because they are abundant but wrong, but the worst of all is the unbearable ethics behind the author's thoughts. Some pages seem to be written by Torquemada and the most evil catholic people that ever lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Forerunner of Barney, the Dinosaur","review":"This story was mainly one of concepts; there was very little action. It was written in the 50's. I enjoyed reading the 21st century characters discuss what happened in the late 20th century--they mostly missed the mark, but that's more interresting than guessing correctly. The most amazing \\"prediction\\" made was one of a 9 foot dragon who hosts his own television show. This somewhat comical show was viewed mainly by children. However, some adults (including the protagonist--a Roman Catholic priest), believed this dragon was really a demon. Does this sound like Barney, or what? I found the ending dull and the plot thin. However I appreciated: a) its lack of flowery descriptive paragraphs (always boring), b) its absence of pornography (always stupid and immature), c) its willingness to attack SciFi from a serious religous perspective (the priest was not a buffoon, but intelligent and respected)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book is a valuable resource for students of the New Testament.

This book is definitely a keeper, a good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the text critic","review":"This work is valuable to the serious student of the Word of God.

Panamanians are not proud of the way things happened in 1989. Nevertheless, that was the price they had to pay to end a 21-year dictatorship. The fact that the invasion was not a welcomed action doesn't mean that Noriega was liked in Panama. Don't be fooled: He is as evil as you've heard...and worse! It is impossible to analyze Panama's society with the typical narrow-minded, race-oriented american mentality. Panama was divided, indeed, but not because of race or social status. Noriega's opposition included all kinds of people: poor, rich, old, young, aristocrats, blacks, whites, browns, greens, yellows and blues!

Also, if you have seen the movie then this CD is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soundtrack that makes the feet move & the heart beat quick","review":"This is a wonderful soundtrack that can make even the most hard-core rocker appreciate Big Band music. Rineheart, Goodman, Basie, Ellington, and others were wonderful musicians whose music inspired the soul and lifted the feet to the dance floor. This movie/soundtrack is what first got me interested in the music and people of this era and now I do extensive reserch on the subject. Swing Heil!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing music's great, but score is borrowed","review":"I'm a big fan of big band swing music, and that part of this CD is unparalleled. The classic recordings fit really well with the modern recordings of classic songs. The score, however, leaves something to be desired. It's not that I don't think it's a nice score - it's just not very original. Horner borrows shamelessly from the 2nd movement of Brahms' Requiem - did he think no one would notice? If you don't believe me, listen to the two back to back - you'll see what I mean. This CD isn't worth it for the score, but if you're a swing fan, definitely buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing, kids!!!","review":"Living in Germany during World War II, but don't necessarily agree with the dictatorship? Well geez, let's rebel by dancing. The Swing Kid movement, as portrayed by this movie, was rather bizarre, considering that they were risking their lives and showing it by dancing the night away. However, the music is light, bouncy and rather catchy, considering many of the tunes on this CD are catchy and jazz standards. One of the downfalls however, is that this engergetic music is paired up with what is often over-dramatic and sullen classical music, to supplement the storyline (you didn't think Hitler would let these rebels have their way, did you?). But when you're in the dancing mood, this soundtrack is definitely well worth it, and if you love jazz music, please do go get this. Just be sure to skip the dreaded, down-tempo classical pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing Kids hits the ground running.","review":"Here is an example of how soundtracks should be reviewed on a completely different level then the movie which they are associated with. James Horner has collected a wonderfully periodic grouping of great swing music. His orchestrations are not his best, but they are still supurb by any standard. If you like swing, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hysterical!","review":"I read Dune many years ago, and it stuck in my mind as one of the more original works of SF ever. For that reason, all the jokes in Doon were very funny. Each chapter starts with a journal entry or quote from a book, and those are for the most part extremely funny. The style of Herbert's writing that conveys deeper meaning in the smallest detail is aped here to great effect. When \\"Paul\\" survives the test of pain, his mother comes in and thinks, \\"He lives! My son lives! So does the Reverend Mother! And so do I! We all live!\\"I found this funnier than Bored of the Rings, but I do recommend both of them for some great parody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious send-up of a science-fiction masterwork","review":"Ellis Weiner has written a fine book here.

I've got to hand it to whomever came up with the whole culinary backdrop--it creates a lot of amusement. Some of the dialogue is really well done and the author has given us a few good-natured laughs at some of Herbert's trademark stylistic quirks.So why the lukewarm review? Well, it's funny, but it's not funny enough of the time. Many of the names given were quite juvenile and didn't really reflect adult (as in mature, not as in sexual) standards of humour. I mean, 'Freedmenmen' for 'Fremen'? That just sounds dumb, not funny--at least in my opinion. ('Mauve-bib', by contrast, was pretty good, and the naming ritual was hilariously done.)I'd really just as soon give it 3.5 stars if I could, but I can't in good conscience give it three, so 4 it is. Recommended provided you have modest expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious juggling of the cliches of Star Wars type SF","review":"People who take coming of age stories in SF terribly seriously better avoid this one. Weiner is to SF what Cervantes was to chivalry in this tour de farce of bad puns, heavy-handed foreshadowings and tongue-in-cheek anachronisms. In terms of sustained effect and underlying seriousness, Doon falls somewhere near the at least equally witty works of Stanislaw Lem and Douglas Adams.

This book was clearly written with an agenda in mind prior to its writing, which takes away all objectivity and, I believe, all credibility.Just like in Bugliosi's book, the mountains of evidence that point to a conspiracy (more than one shooting location), and a concerted cover-up, is conveniently ignored. The evidence that is included is largely presented in a disingenuous way.The ideas put forth in this book have been refuted many, many times by researchers and authors like Jim DiEugenio, and others. They have clearly demonstrated that this book is full of inaccuracies and ommissions, based on the real evidence that is out there.*UPDATE*: Gerlad Posner has been fired from his job, and is being accused of plagiarism.

This leads one to question (with good reason) if any part of his book actually contains the truth, or merely the lies Mr. Posner wishes us to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Posner Plays it Safe","review":"Well researched & well presented arguments, but the bottom line here is that the author is on the side of convienence - its much easier to argue that there is no conspiracy since there has never been a conviction in this case.

His whole \\"proof\\" that Oswald was the lone assassin was discredited by the Dallas police shortly after the assassination when they proved that Oswald did not fire a rifle on 22 November, 1963.

If you're debating whether or not to buy this book, as an interested reader, I highly recommend it.On the other hand, if you have already convinced yourself that either the lone gunman explanation or one of the dozens of other theories is set into bedrock, there really isn't any point on you reading anything about it ever again, is there? If nothing will ever dissuade you from the beliefs you now hold, move along.

Posner then claimed that the found jacket was Oswalds and that Marina had identified it as the one Lee wore the previous night at the Paines. How could that be?

In fact, the HSCA concluded that Oswald 'probably did not act alone.' So, Posner was already 14 years behind the times in 1993 when he advocated the US Government's obsolete position.

When I read a book like this, I don't want to hear why everyone else is wrong and that you're right. I want you to present me with logical evidence and explain how it fits in. It also bothered me that all of the things the author accused other authors of doing (using selective parts of evidence or testimony) is exactly what he did.This book, like many other Kennedy books, was nothing more then a school yard argument. At the end of the book I sort of expected him to write \\"nah ah, I'm right!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste the Money","review":"I cannot believe that Mr. Posner found someone to publish this horrid excuse for a book.

This is more representative than an analysis based only on the last 20 reviews. But what is more notable than that is the fact that the five star reviews tend to recieve a resounding thumbs down from the people who have read them.Lone Nut Theorists can only bash and discredit their opposition since their story is false.Posner totally disregards the Parkland Hospital Doctors statements regarding the neck wound as a wound of entry or the massive rear exit wound in the back of the head. He would also have us believe a high powered rifle shot to the head would not cause movement in the direction of the shot. That somehow our body would jerk back in the opposite direction and cause a large entrance wound and a small exit wound contrary to the numerous eyewitness accounts.To expect us to believe this nonsense is insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better material elsewhere.","review":"Invest a few hours with the BBC documentary \\"The Men Who Killed Kennedy\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniquely Written","review":"I have been researching the JFK Assassination since 1974 and this book gave me the tools to research further without any time-consuming websites. I congratulate the author on his writing. Now it's my turn to see how correct his data actually is in terms of eye-witness testimony. So far this book is the best of the JFK Assassination books. However, I'm still of the theory that it was a conspiracy and others were involved. His footnotes gave me the tools to justify most of his data. The national archives will help me justify conclusive points.

I was aware of its critics and the fact that several witnesses and sources cited in the book claim not to have given information to Posner. I found that the book omitted many key and controversial issues entirely, and I concluded that it was written as an advocacy statement, not as investigative journalism. I mentally rated it at about two stars. Now that Posner has been repeatedly cited for plagiarism in several books he has written subsequent to Case Closed, and also now seems to think it is funny that he was caught at it, I realize this book has NO value at all. I am surprised that the Amazon author bio does not mention the plagiarism scandal at all.

I search reading lists and reviews to try and find good books in this genre. That is why when I find one that I really enjoy, I like to write a review incase others are looking for the same. This book had all the elements I like in a story: time-travel, romance, good character development and an interesting plot. My only complaint about the book (besides the front cover) is Robyn's relationship in the present time. I felt that it was rushed and I never really understood why they were so in love. Other than that, I really enjoyed Robyn's relationship in the past and how the present and the past meshed together in the plot.

Quite frankly, this book is simply boring. There is some value (not historical value) in the teachings presented here, but they're not presented very well.

And of course from here, both Perry and Hurley fall in love and inimately want each other, ohh how romantic. The film is decent but is somewhat insipid and apathetic. Serving Sara is rated PG-13 for Crude Humor, Sexual Content and Language, so an acceptable choice for preteens, but perhaps one that should be researched or looked into first.

Honestly, this movie was actually better than I thought it would be. This movie is very similar to another movie starring Matthew Perry titled \\"Fools Rush In\\", 1996, also starring Selma Hayek. The movie is about a man whose struggles to be successful at any cost and slowly learns what is important to him. He struggles to reach his true goals, as Matthew does in \\"Serving Sara\\".

Very nice for short practice days. The DVD is very well chaptered and has more instruction as a separate chaptere after the workout.

Ain't no flow here, folks. This is just a calisthenic routine, and not a very good one at that. It's laughably short.

It is obvious from reading the book that Mr. Rehak did a considerable amount of research.

He is a very talented writer with a wonderful sense of humor. I am looking forward to his next book. (Yes, I think Lizzie did it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Historical Romance","review":"I picked David and Bathsheba up at a used book store, not knowing what to expect out of an out of print and unknown author, and I couldn't have been more surprised. This book isn't just an ordinary historical romance with the same predictable plodding plot. The love story, which isn't a typical one to begin with, as I will explain later, is colored richly with details of Bible-era Israel--from everything to the peoples' everyday way of life to details of the Jewish religion. Dorr brilliantly merges reality with folklore as she tells the story of the two great lovers of the Biblical era: King David and his wife Bathsheba. The book starts out with Bathsheba as a young girl and David as a strong willed rebellious military leader. It details the way they meet and follows them all the way through their difficulties. God is constantly involved in the affairs of the people and Dorr raises an interesting question: should one should trust God or himself, and is it okay to do both"},{"rating":"1","title":"Velly interesting, but shtoopid","review":"I guess Mel Gibson had to pay rent on one of his expensive houses to play in this Manchurian Candidate for Dummies. The cinematography is muddy and the direction is a vacant lot of fast editing and stuff that explodes. Sure Mel Gibson is attractive, but he has yet to make a movie that proves he can act (with the exception of Road Warrior and the Year of Living Dangerously). This film exists in the cinema limbo between \\"films so bad they are good\\" and \\"well made films.\\" It's like Lethal Weapon minus the focus, Cutthroat Island minus the effort, and Deep Impact minus the talent.

Mel Gibson is hilarious in this film. He usually tends to overact but in this movie it fits in perfectly. I guarantee you'll laugh at some of the scenes in this movie.

I enjoy the occasional \\"conspiracy\\" story line. So why did the combination fail? It's easy...writing. I'm no writer of award winning screenplays, but the dialogue in this movie made me want to seek shelter in the script of a Barney episode. Contrived, forced, redundant, cliche, and I'm being kind. Mel is funny and attractive. Julia is also. They're just the victims of a very bad script. Young writers take this one home and take notes on how not to develop a storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Pap","review":"Gibson perfected his maniacal rabid-dog persona in the endless Lethal Weapon series. Unfortunately someone forgot to tell him that this wasn't Lethal Weapon XX111 (or whatever), so we get more of Riggs, only with a different name. As for the story - well, Hollywood has been hoodwinking us for years about paranoia, conspiracies, grassy knolls, cover-ups etc. X-files does it better, and without manic overacting. Let this one sink into oblivion - where it rightly belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiracy Theory, Allright","review":"I would like to postulate a conspiracy theory of my own after watching this journey-ride through incompetent filmmaking. I firmly resolve that Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts could never have possibly decided to make a movie as ridiculous as this. They were impersonated by two cunning imposters who, in conspiracy with Hollywood renegades, have plotted to destroy their careers. At least that's what Gibson and Roberts SHOULD believe, considering that this movie sinks to greater depths than even \\"The Man Without A Face\\" or \\"Dying Young.\\" Plotless, Thoughtless, and not to mention artless, \\"Conspiracy Theory isn't even sophisticated enough to make true believers of the X-Files worshiping idiots that flocked to see it in the first place.

Please take note, Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mel Gibson at his worst","review":"1. I'm one of the outliers here, but this movie is so lame on several key fronts that it's one of the few movies that I never finished.* Mel Gibson's acting was just terrible. I know he's trying to portray someone who is mentally unstable; it doesn't work that way in real life.* The writing was boring and slow, pure torture just watching this thing.2.

The only reason this movie gets 2 stars is because Gibson's performance is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"Super dopey, I laughed out loud. So bad that it's hard to beleive it was made. Gibson, as usual, tries to make the insane seem cutesy and lovable and does a horrible job. Basically, he just mugs for the camera. I, Static and other den members spent days ripping up this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conspiracy Fact","review":"You don't run into to many people that seem over the edge with theories on conspiracies. Mel Gibson, Julia Roberts, and Patrick Stewart all do great jobs in their roles. Gibson is good as the slightly crazy taxi driver with all kinds of theories on government agencies. Roberts is a believable Department of Justice agent. Stewart does well as the CIA operative with questionable methods of programming agents. Not a bad government cover up action thriller. I recommend as a rental before purchasing. The set that includes this and Tequila Sunrise is a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"i was a bit too critical","review":"this is a very entertaining film,if you're not too critical about it. in my last review,i panned it due to thriller cliches (which didn't bother me this time). if you're not too critical,this film is a hoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"With Patrick Stewart, Mel Gibson, and Julia Roberts how can you lose?

The acting is very good and Patrick Stewart is pure evil. Mel Gibson's portrayal of a mentally-manipulated obsessive is right on. One feels his paranoia full on.This is a must see for those who don't believe everything they read. Another excellent conspiracy movie is Mercury Rising with Bruce Willis and Alec Baldwin - who perhaps one-ups Stewart as evil incarnate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conspiracy Theory","review":"Excellent cast that carrys you with them.

This film has it all:romance,action,suspense,romance,and comedy (which are all blended beautifully). The plot concerns a paranoid New York City cab driver named Jerry Fletcher (Mel Gibson) who realizes that one of his conspiracy theories is true and an organization is out to get him. One of the things that makes Mel Gibson's performance so powerhouse is that Mel is a real-life conspiracy theorist. Another piece of info,Patrick Stewart's character,Dr. Jonas,was inspired by the Canadian psychologist Ewen Cameron, who did MK-ULTRA experiments on his patients."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great movie","review":"A really great movie with a great plot.I have watched it plenty of times.Probably should have gotten the bluray version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the Most Calming and Inspiring Music Ever Recorded","review":"I don't know if Gary Stadler composed all of the music on this album, or simple applied his art to someone else's creation(s).

The handy spiral binding is great for working on each individual puzzle. You don't need a working knowledge of wall street, although the themes are often \\"financial\\".

He wanders the earth backpacking a la 70's style looking for himelf and the answers of the world on this jouney. He has many affairs on the way, impregnates a woman, while a wife is left back at home in a mental institution all during the jouney.Apparently he proposes that he found all the answers he seeked at the end of the book---he converts from Judaism to Christianity. Although he didn't seem to really have much understanding about Judaism at the start. I don't get how he arrives at this conversion, he waxes on so poetically, as the beatnick poet he imagines his life to be. And I am convinced he's just as messed up at the end of the book(where he claims he's found Jesus and the answers to his great quest) as he was in the beginning. Or more so.It disgusted me as a Jew that some guy---a selfish loser--- treats it all so poorly. And takes himself this seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blueprint","review":"Are you one of a kind?

She has no family to speak of. She reads about cloning and sets things in motion to convince a Canadian doctor to allow her to be his human experiment in cloning. Here begins the practice of creating ego-clones. The book is written in diary form from the perspective of the cloned daughter, or is she a twin? It is a terrifying journey into the possibilities. What if we could do this? Would you really want to be a clone? Do you have an identity? Whose identity is it then? Government control?

Then, on top of that, what makes the lawyer think he is innocent? The killer layed in wait until he had a clean shot at the victims, shot them and then wants to plead not guilty?Then there is jury selection where SLJ says \\"that's a jury of my peers\\" because the jury is all white. Well, where in the law does it say that someone is entitled to a jury made of his/her peers? It doesnt.And then the final scene where the little boy comes running out and screams \\"he's innocent\\"?

But this is the south, and will justice be done? The girl's father does not think so, and in a fit of passion blows the two away right in the courthouse.No lawyer in his right mind would try to defend him, right? But someone has to do it; he's entitled to a defense. So an idealistic young white lawyer is appointed, and with the help of his aging alcoholic mentor, they set to work to provide a defense for the grieving father. Of course politics, religion and the KKK all get involved.Sounds all rather straightforward, but John Grisham does not write that way. He throws in enough curves to keep everyone guessing, and I'll play fair and not tell you the outcome. You will have more fun watching it unfold that way. Four stars, for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Loved this movie. It really was the essence of how Racism can numb someone's brain to the reality that THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU OR YOUR CHILDREN\\". I was thinking these people are going to find him guilty because as far as they are concerned she is just a little black girl but Samuel Jackson opened his Lawyer's (who also had a daughter) eyes to the fact that this could have been your little girl and if it was, what would you have done?As the Policeman/officer that Samuel shot said, \\"He's a HERO, you turn him loose\\".I recommend it to watch. I honestly could not watch the part with them tyoing up that poor little girl and the blood and her shouting for her dad and them taking turns, it was So Awful, i can't image a man would do that to a child.But watch it!

It's a story of a father that will do anything for his kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film will make you think, question and even cry.","review":"If you're a looking for a movie that will make you feel good all the way through then don't plan on watching this one. However, if you're yearning for a portrayal of an anguished man dealing with the ungodly abuse of his young daughter and his inspired defense attorney's gambit this is it. What Samuel L. Jackson's character did was vigilante justice. I disagree with what he did but I can understand it with my heart. I've heard that some people disliked this movie because of the vigilante aspect. I am never so narrow-minded as to dismiss excellent acting because I didn't feel comfortable with subject material. When I saw this movie with a close friend I was very suprised to see him WEEP when the closing defense was given. I might add, he wasn't the only one to cry in the theater. Sobs could be heared coming from all around me. A movie that can evoke such emotion and questioning of principals has to be a top-notch production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, terrible DVD","review":"Let me say first that I really like this movie. It's entertaining and I like the casting. But the DVD is horrible and beyond cheesy. I bought it to replace a VHS copy. Forget \\"special\\" features - this DVD doesn't even have STANDARD features! About 1 hour and 15 minutes into the movie, it stops and YOU HAVE TO FLIP IT OVER! You've got to be kidding me! The \\"scene access\\" is poor, too. You can't jump to scene 3 if you want to - you can only skip to specific scenes: 5, 10, 15, etc. Finally, and this is minor but only proves a point, the case is cheap. It's not encased in plastic, it's just cardboard. Save your money and don't buy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film from great book","review":"I consider A Time to Kill, Grisham's best book, the rest really leave me dry so I was eagerly lookign forward to this film and wasn't disappointed. Everyone in this film does this complex plot justice in when is there a tiem to kill someone, to take the law into one's own hands. I was just thinking the other day that it would be nice if Samuel L. Jackson got a nomination for an Oscar, he is in what 1 out of every 4 films? He does a great job here. And McConaughey is extremely talented as well, a new comer when this film came out, holding his own and making the film focus around him."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie.","review":"I have seen A Time To Kill 4 times and it keeps getting better. Matthew McConaughey does a wonderful job as Jake Brigance. Sandra Bullock is equally good as his law clerk. The chemistry between the two of them is incredible. My only complaint is Ashley Judd as Carla Brigance. Her performance left me cold. Jake's summation at the end of the trial moved me to tears. It was an awesome movie with a powerful message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I ordered my movie and it got here quicker than most.

Plays well on an el-cheapo player, no memorable stutters. No home-theater components here, can't comment on the A/V quality, but those added features don't disrupt, important to us low-enders.Others have already commented enough on the content, won't belabor those points. A TIME TO KILL is fiction, entertainment and as such succeeds. Memorable are the human issues and interactions; the heat between the Bullock and McConaughey characters, for example, and how that plays out -- excellent. For true-to-life legal action, spend the day at your local Superior Court."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham At His Best","review":"A Time to Kill is my favorite Grisham book, and the movie follows suit.

The DVD package is awful.There are no special features to speak of. There is a miniscule \\"cast bio\\" section that covers only the main players, in a film full of \\"where have I seen him before\\" stellar performances. Oh, there is also the theatrical trailer (1 version).Worse, this disc is a flipper. That means that you have to get up half way through the movie and flip the darn disc over. If you own a 400 disc changer (like one of the Sony's) you almost have to buy two copies in order to avoid rotating the whole cylinder every time to flip the movie.I have no idea why this move has to be a flipper. There just isn't that much information here. It should all fit. Amazingly, there was enough room to include the \\"special features\\" - cast bio, theatrical trailer, and \\"buy these other movies\\" on BOTH sides of the disc.Garbage like this gives DVD a bad name.

Just two examples: The lawyer, who desperately needs help, is approached by a beautiful woman who is very qualified, and who wants to help him for free. So what does he do? He turns her down! No reason for this even hinted at.Second: when they are about to lose the case, they finally get smart and win it by... (surprise) appealing purely to the jury's *emotions*, not logic.

I returned the flawed copy to Amazon and exchanged the DVD for the same product in the hope of seeing the end of the movie. Amazon sent us a second copy of the movie promptly. Unfortunately however, the second DVD had the same flaw at the same exact point in the story.

And at the end they sort of try to make Carman (Alexa Vega) into a pop star singer that really ticked me off. that is why i give it 1 star (really i don't think it deserves any).

This is a terrible movie, if you gave the first movie a 3 or below than skip this. If you gave it a 4 or 5 you might actually think it was OK. This movie is for the much younger set (10 and below.) DO NOT see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for what it is","review":"Any movie with Christopher McDonald *and* Steve Buscemi gets at least a few points in my book.But seriously, Spy Kids 2 is not a bad movie. It's an unpretentious family flick, and it doesn't bog down at any point.However, while writer/director Richard Rodriguez has been receiving tons of praise for his accomplishment, he fails to do one very important thing in his movie: create any real suspense. The threats the Spy Kids run into are more momentary diversions and less life/mission-threatening terrors.Spy Kids also falls into the trap of over-reliance on computer graphics, which oftentimes serve to remind the viewer that it's only a movie.Still not an unenjoyable watch, though. Especially for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical bad sequel","review":"This is one of those sequels, where the screen writers take all the parts of the first movie that they thought were great, and exaggerate them in the second. Unfortunately, they obviously didn't understand what made the first movie good.Double the gadgets: Totally unrealistic gadgets that defy common sense, like a pocket-sized gizmo that unfolds into a control center complete with computers and monitors.Double the gags: Same old lines with very little twist.Double the the Parents: Look out for the geriatric grandma and grandpa spiesMinus the plot!

This movie actually started out fine, and the plot was okay, but nothing can make up for the awful acting in this film. The kids were as good as they could have been with the script-at-hand, and the adults were much worse, especially their parents played concoctedly and horribly by Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino. Some little kids may like this movie, and maybe even some adults. Oh well, I can't explain why, but people do seem to. All in all, this movie simply was a bad movie overflowing with bad acting and an okay plot that doesn't make up for any flaws in the end. One good thing-the film isn't long at all, it's quite short. One final bad thing too, however-Alexa Vega finishes up the film with a horrible little song about the movie.

The studio has verified the issue, and initiated this recall \\"due to a manufacturing error on Disc 3.\\"The defective version being recalled can be identified with UPC # 794051423429, and the new release (which is expected to ship on January 31st) will have UPC # 883929017317.

The writing and acting are top-notch, leaving American TV serious in their dust.

Due to financial reasons (couldn't afford cable and pay other bills) I have not seen series 4 or 5. I am in a better money position now and am planning to catch up what I've missed with these dvd sets. One huge advantage to having the dvds is that you get the whole episode as it was shown in the UK. A&E and BBCAmerica edit the episodes down by about 10-12 mins to fit the American tv format (commercials). During the editing process, some of the action/back story that happens is cut and it leaves you wondering why a character acts or does something a certain way.

Sally has opinions, and isn't afraid to voice them. She's certainly no blonde chick, designed to be 'arm candy' for the hero.

McGowan uses many sources to examine a civil war that has continued for a long time without garnering much international attention. As someone from that part of the world (South India, quite close to Sri Lanka), though, I was struck by McGowan's seemingly imperialist attitude towards the people of Sri Lanka. Sinhalese music is described as wailing; the actions of a doctor treating a scorpion-stung woman are criticized in terms echoing those of nineteenth century missionaries. Throughout the book there seems to be an underlying tone of disdain for these peoples. Perhaps I am being oversensitive, but it does seem that at points McGowan is far from sympathizing with, leave alone understanding, the local people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, I've been thinking about","review":"this title lately.

The blue colored wordings (black would be better) can be quite glaring under the lights making it not smoothing to the eyes.Furthermore, it uses long case studies which could have been shortened by cutting down on the introductions to the companies it made reference to. More focus should be given to concepts at the earlier stage of every section, instead of making the reader running through a lengthy introduction before focusing on the concepts.Important concepts could also have been left out. One example would be the omission of 'Reduced Cost' under the chapters of Linear Programming and Integer Programming.However, this book is certainly catered to users of MS Excel.

It is a job that keeps Martin on his toes as he is fearful of the atmosphere with the dead people around him. During one of Martin's night shifts the police bring in a victim from a serial-killer, and strange occurrences begin to happen in the morgue. Can these occurrences have something to do with Martin's dare-game that he is playing with his friend Jens, who also is a law student, or is it something else that is after him. Nightwatch is a suspenseful film that uses camera angles that maximize the situational terror and push the audience to experience the same fear that Martin is experiencing in the film. This leaves the audience with a cinematic happening that produces chills and horror, and which is of good quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Atlanta Nights","review":"I did not buy this book.

But, he does this with his own author's eye. While the book is chronological, Salzman chooses which moments to portray that will give readers the larger picture of what he and other members of the facility were attempting to do. He does not shy away from his own mistakes, but he revels in his successes as well. For teachers in alternative environments, and even teachers who are simply looking for new inspiration, this book gives insight to many pedagogical options and pitfalls. Salzman asks questions about the purpose of teaching that all teachers should be asking themselves, regardless of where they are teaching their students. This book is a worthwhile read for writers and teachers alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may be for a good cause and all, but...","review":"I love Mark Salzman's novels. I can sense the goodness of the author implied by those works. I can sense the goodness of the reporter of True Notebooks. I think it is great to teach troubled kids how to express themselves in writing. Good work! But that does not mean that I really want to immerse myself in their efforts. After reading a few examples of the students' efforts, I have the picture. But really, none of it is very surprising. The students produce the sort of thing you would expect. There is no development in Salzman's account of his experience either.

To my surprise, I loved it!I figured it had to have somewhat substantial writings done by these kids in juvie, but I never expected them to make such a profound impact on the way I envisioned freedom and justice.The works that Salzman included that were written by the HROs (high-risk offenders) astonished me.This book teaches a vital lesson to society and life in general with the only downfall I saw as beimg the kids don't always get that happy ending that you're hoping for, but hey, neither does life all the time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for Everyone","review":"Mark Salzman needs to be congratulated for volunteering to teach a creative writing class to juveniles in jail for severe crimes (most have committed murder) and being able to share his experiences in this fabulous book. His class becomes an avenue of release for these inmates to vent their frustrations at the system, their horrible family lives and life in general. Of course, he does not ignore responsibility of these kids for choosing to commit these crimes and that they should shoulder the consequences. However, through their own words we get a snapshot into what drove them to their crimes, and how the legal and penal system fails to stop them from becoming career criminals with its emphasis on jail time over everything else. It is amazing to read the high-quality writing from most of the class that would shame any amateur writer like myself and shows the capability of the so called \\"dregs\\" of society if given the chance that Salzman gives"},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal","review":"need this one for school was cheap so I bought it and it was the actual book so that's the good thing!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yay!","review":"cutest shoes ever! i got them in white and everyone always mentions them when i wear them, they are really adorable and don't rub my heels raw like some flats tend to do. love em!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sterling silver celtic design square pendant","review":"This looks nothing like the picture.

It's coupled with using divergences in his accumulation/distribution indicator, which acts similar to On Balance Volume and other volume based indicators. The market timing indicators are all outdated or useless because of changes in the market. For example using the yield of the market (because of tax laws yields will remain low) and mutual fund cash levels (most funds are required to be fully invested with minimal amounts set aside for redemptions). This is not to knock Larry, he is very knowlegeable and you'd be better off with his more recent books.

And we don't know where it comes from or how to treat it. And just like in Outbreak, it has spread fast because it's been carried by airline travellers. And the medical staff get sick & die, too.

The scientists all act like they have no idea what their lines mean or how scientists behave - everyone except for Morgan Freeman overacts absurdly. The plot, such as it is, is beyond ridiculous, culminating in the most pointless and unmotivated helicopter chase I can remember seeing. It's almost as if the director had in mind that he had to put in a helicopter chase, regardless of its role in the plot. There are too many movie cliches to mention. The whole film reminds me of that parody of bad Hollywood moviemaking that Anna Scott reads for in Notting Hill.The highlight of the film is a bravura 3-minute single-shot steadicam tour of the lab (starting at about minute 4). It's a great shot and shows that Petersen still had it; I guess he lost interest in the movie after that shot though.The blu-ray transfer is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the movie, not the picture quality...","review":"Outbreak was as good as I remembered it.

A well crafted movie. The opening scenes set the theme, or do they? A doomsday bomb, a deadly virus, a search for a cure? Sit down and watch - carefully. The first scenes open in Africa and one thinks aha EBOLA, Of course you are correct, but then Tom Clancy jumps in. Immediately you realise that all is not well. The virus travels to the USA, and the plot thickens, and splits into two stories. The hunt for the virus carrier, and then the lack of the military's enthusiasm for finding a cure. Maybe they have something to hide? You bet. This is a fast moving cross between Robin Cook and Tom Clancy, and both benefit. Some great scenes, I particularly liked the helicopter chase, with Cuba Gooding Jr as the pilot.

Even if you do not like screaming, you can just listen to the guitar parts and enjoy the music. I decided to give this four stars though because the singer is not very good.

There is no way this label can be slapped on From Autumn to Ashes. Their style of punk meets hardcore meets nu-metal is probably only even remotely similar to poison the well. This album is incredibly diverse, offering a range of songs from 8 minute scream fests to low and haunting accoustic melodies. They utilize the styles of two vocalists (well, a designated vocalist and a vocalist/drummer) and they both have very distinctive sounds, one having a harsh Killswitch Engage style scream and the other having a higher AFI style croon. This is just an all around great album.

It brings together concepts seen in shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Blade Runner with fantastic elements seen in White Wolf's World of Darkness games.The book is very readable with small bite sized chapters that are easy to pick up and put down. It reads fast and moves at a good pace with ample time given to both fire fights and character growth and interaction.The characters are all interesting and many of them are quirky and just enjoyable to see in action. The novel uses a strong ensemble style with no one character easily identifiable as the main.It mixes realism with supernatural power and sci-fi tech in a cohesive and consistent way that draws the reader in. If there were a team of monster hunters in the real world this is probably who they would be.If you enjoy the modern supernatural sub-genre you owe it to yourself to give the Lonely Winds a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"My girlfriend's birthday present!","review":"Amazing product, arrived two days after purchase.

The introduction, ironically, suggests that \\"there needs to be a productive dialogue between Marxism and postcolonial studies\\", yet the examples of postcolonial studies mentioned in the book, such as Spivak, have of course given serious and detailed readings of Marx that are not taken particularly seriously here. More to the point, the entire tone is one of \\"debunking\\" and not at all exciting. If you're grumpy with all those postcolonial theorists supposedly taking over everything and you want to have arguments with them, or just make yourself feel better about liking your Adorno books more, this might be useful to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"24 Years Old and Still Losing Teeth","review":"I have recently switched from the DeWalt Timberwolf to the Hole Hawg because my friends told me to.

While I will agree that the new Player's Handbook is beautiful and well presented as a book, I generally do not like the 3rd Edition game for several reasons. Mainly, I think that it makes characters a little too powerful. I can understand adding some power to a few classes to spruce them up, but allowing ability scores over 18? Adding a point to scores of your choice to the tune of 1 point per 4 levels? Perhaps the biggest thing is the less than smooth transition of existing characters into 3E and the fact that all of my old gaming supplements don't easily translate. As for the book, the biggest annoyance that i have is that the spells are listed alphabetically, not by class and level. Perhaps that is a pet peeve, who knows. Anyway, I am sure that the new game will appeal to many people but I for one will stick to my old favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LONG time coming...","review":"Well it's been 10+ years but they finally did it.

Thanks, finally!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Rules for classic game","review":"These new rules are great. The new game is easier for the new player to learn, and it's not yet (yet I say) cluttered up with too many, overly spicific rulings.

Right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, not bad","review":"I am what you might call a d and d newbie. When I got this book, i was impressed by all the pictures and stuff, but as I got into reading it is got kinda confusing. It tells you tons of information, and it gets hard to remember. I had to keep re-reading chapters to figure it out. Overall its pretty good, but could be better. If you are interested in playing D and D, you should buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best D&D yet","review":"This is by far the best edition of Dungeons and Dragons (note that \\"Advanced\\" has been dropped from the title). The changes to this edition are so major that you're essentially looking at a brand new game system--but one that preserves the general feel and flavor of its predecessors. The core D20 system provides a unified mechanic to any type of task resolution--from learning a new spell to hitting an opponent in combat--that is simple and clean, and easy for everyone to remember. Combat is fully revamped, and the new class and race system is much more flexible, allowing players to design the character they've always wanted. While I have some minor gripes with the book layout (it deliberatley looks as if it was set down on draft or occasionally notebook paper), and some of the odd ways the PC races are presented, it's not nearly enough to prevent me from whole-heartedly endorsing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rose by any other name","review":"Ok, I was worried that WOC would screw it up. I have been an avid d&d'er since '80. I think that the new cover is the best part of the book. The insides are as different as 2nd was from 1st. Other than a few bells and whistles you still have ad&d as it ever was. The new features, rules, and changes seem to be taken right outta Dragon. If you are a real Dungeoneer you will probably say, \\"whats wrong with the one I bought back in '82?\\". The fact is things change and I bought the book because my game group will always buy the new books and play the new rules. Just bite the bullet and buy it, you know you want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book-ignore all those whiners","review":"Many people are complaining about all the modifications made to 3E. Don't listen to them. All the modifications are improvements. For example, now the AC's are better when higher, which makes much more sense(No more dragons with -8 AC).

If you have the boxed, enjoyed and now crave more then GET THIS BOOK ASAP! Oh man does this book rule! It has 10 classes and gives step by step creation. It is very well layed out (looking better than the 2nd ed handbook and the information easier to find). Admitingly the layout could be better but overall this is DA bomb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! This is Not 3.5","review":"Lacks the polish and balance of 3.5 DnD.

I think they help make the game easier to learn and speed up game play.

It's also well constructed and illustrated beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"D&D Comes of Age","review":"Very nicely designed book. Great artwork. Writing style is concise and to the point, very easy to follow. A must have for any RPG player. The new rule set for D&D clears up many of the ambiguities presented by earlier versions. The highest praise for the time and effort put into this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Life for the classic D&D system","review":"Many improvements over the older system and consistent rolls make this system very desirable. As a DM I have always noticed the problems that newer players, and sometimes older ones, have with remembering what is needed for a roll, that will not be a problem anymore. In addition character generation simplified over Players Option while still allowing players to create new and unique characters. The new classes and race options are also very interesting. There is a greater focus on race sub-cultures, which will give newer players a better understanding of the character they are playing and how they should relate to other races. They have made some tweaks to race abilities here as well. This should make the game more interesting for veteran players. Overall I am very excited about this new system. My only complaint is that I cannot start playing yet because the DMG is a month away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Water Soluble","review":"Everyone is correct in the rules being a major improvement.However, if you get the book wet the water will cause the ink to run off the page. Big Disappointment.I learned of this while reading the book and watching TV, 20 minutes later I went to move my thumb and notice that ink was removed only leaving my white fingerprint. I then pressed my finger in a clear section of the book and transfer the ink fingerprint to the page. I then licked my other finger and rubbed the ink print off the page and blended the fingerprint out of the illumination (the colored border).I would like a acid free copy with a quality print please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice one","review":"The artwork is good, and the use of the same party to illustrate the ideas throughout the book helps keep it flowing and make it an enjoyable read as well as an invaluable reference.The only thing I would say against buying this one is that the 3.5 edn rule books are out soon (or now), so you might be better off with them.This book is also useful as a companion to those of you playing neverwinter nights or other 3e games on a computer - although you really ought to get a real game on with some mates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed","review":"I was impressed with this book. At first I thought it was just going to be a dumbed-down version of the rules but was surprised at how much I liked it. I'm glad they brought back the monk and half-orcs. I would recommend this book to newcomers and veterans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third time's the Charm","review":"The Third Edition of the legendary role playing system is by far the best yet! As a old time gamer, (since '74), I've played D&D as my mainstay game. Every edition has continued to evolve and add new dimensions to the game. This third edition really brings the game to life. The charachter generation, the selection of skills and feats that charachters have to choose from , and the game's ability to capture relatively complicated modifiers in a very simple and easy-to-use system makes this the new 'King-of-the-hill\\" in my gaming diet. This 3rd Edition PHB is a gourgeous volume. The illustrations are terriffic, the charts are clear and intelligible, and the charachter generater CD-Rom in the back cover makes learning the new rules a breeze. Do yourself a favor and get this for your gaming library, it really packs a punch,(Oh, did I mention how cool the new monk class is?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book with Great Rules","review":"Hats off to Wizards of the Coast for taking D&D's wild compendium of rules and tables and turning it into a consistent easy to use system! The third edition is a winner! AD&D players should be able to adjust easily, and new people will find this system much easier to understand.The book is also beautiful with nice illustrations of the characters who are used as examples throughout the books. They really fire the imagination.A must for anyone who wants to play D&D."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Players Welcome!","review":"I've been playing for over 15 years now, and I want to commend WoTC and TSR for breathing new life into the game I love. This is one of the best organized and attractive (both visually and intellectually) role playing rulebooks I've seen since I started roleplaying when I was 12 years old. It's beauty and well-described systems should attract a lot of new players and possibly some older, disenchanted players who \\"haven't played in years.\\" If this book is any example of the quality we can expect from now on, I look forward to seeing a whole new generation exposed to the wonders of D&D and all that it has to offer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gorgeous update of the classic system","review":"I had a chance to peruse this new tome at Wizard World in Chicago a week before its release at GenCon, and now -- it's here!All in all, I'd say it's worth the hype. At 304 gorgeous full-color pages in hardback, with a character creation CD-ROM in the back, this is probably the best bargain we've seen in the AD&D (ahem, excuse me, D&D) line in over a decade.System-wise, the changes from AD&D Second Edition aren't earth-shattering, so people can probably convert their long-running campaigns without too much trouble. At the same time, they are enough different that I'd recommend purchasing this book, rather than merely scanning a friend's.It remains to be seen if the promise shown here will extend to the rest of the system (the new Dungeon Master's Guide is due before the end of the year), but all the same I would recommend this book to any die-hard gamer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Revolution of Adventure Gaming","review":"About 40 years ago Gary Gygax and his brother created a game, known only as Advanced DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS!

Falling off the shelves like overpriced amendments to a perfectly good constitution. It was about time they did what should have happened long ago, admit that the game has changed. Most people starting D&D in the past few years would have had to shell out about 200 just to get a peice of the full Second Edition Library. It is time to get back to basics, use fewer 'standardized' rules, and get the player's imagination back into the game. I would hope that those looking for a strong backbone to role playing will stick to the basic book(s), and use their own ideas to fill in the gaps. If you have them, stick to the old rules set in your old 1st and 2nd editions and save your money! This game is about a players ability to think. It shouldn't have anything to do with the amount of books you can buy. Save your money for miniatures and cool dice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tome Unequaled","review":"I don't judge a book by its cover, however, this book is a work of art. The cover is beautiful, and the inside is even better. D&D characters come alive in the talented hands of artists Grant-West, Fischer, Foster, Lockwood, Martin, Swekel, and the (in)famous Sam Wood. The page layout is very creative. But that's just how it looks.It lives up to its name--Player's Handbook. It really is a wonderful handbook. It's well organized and thought out. This book is filled with all the kinds of information you need for playing D&D. It was worth the wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The update that updates itself","review":"This book has won my respect as a Dungeon & Dragons masterpiece. Although I've not yet red the entire manual, from looking at the descriptions and illustrations, it is a definite improvement over last edition's PHB. The descriptions of each character class were marvelous. The description of the races fared just as well. The new rules (along with the conversion manual that WOTC so generously offered for free at their site) made the game a breeze while keeping the challenges up to the right level. The spellbook section caught my eye first and foremost. The hard work put into this manual shows itself from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"D&D Updated...","review":"It has been some 25 years since Dungeons and Dragons first appeared. With the direction of gaming having changed drastically over the past 10 years, D&D had been left behind. Until now. The systems have been simplified and combined while still keeping the flavor of the original game concepts. There is truly something for all types of gamers in this book. There is story elements, advanced role-play as well as the simple hack and slash that has become the old standby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy 3ed resorce a MUST!","review":"This book has EVERYTHING you need to play. It's collection of spells is marvously extensive. It had feats, skills ,and even a fully photocopiable version of the Character Sheets, preventing you from having to buy new ones. The details on the races and classes are so great that you can almost feel the character, The artwork is 5 stars, if is wonderful. Th charts and tables are a tad hard to read, but still infomation ridden. If you want to play D&D you MUST buy this book.... this book is really affordable. A must for any Role-Playing Fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great leap forward","review":"the 3rd edition took a while to come out, and it was definitely worth the wait. i love how characters are so customizable now and the new systems make the game flow much better now. i can't wait for the dm guide and monster so that i can fully play a 3rd edition game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on!!!!","review":"All I have too say is D&D has always been about imagination. How many of us have bent the rules to fit our gamimg world needs? I look at this book and I take the good to make gaming esier and clear. I take the bad and re-tool it to fit our gaming world as we see fit. This book is full of new ideas that we have all probably thougt of before why don't they do it this way or why can't I have an Elven Palidan he just as religeous as your Palidan. Overall I give it a 4 star rating because nothing is perfect. Don't forget to use your imagination and these 3rd Edition gaming rules can be just as fun. For you die hard fans give it a try before you knock it.

The new players handbook is packed with information all D&D Players and Dungeon Masters need. I'm sure I won't have any new good things to say about it that haven't already been said. With that, some criticisms:-The print is fairly small, could be hard to read for some.-The \\"packed\\" nature of the material can make it hard to find specific information sometimes. This passes with book familiarity.-I heard reports of the ink running when wet. I performed a test on the corners of one of the pages. Indeed, if you have sweaty hands, take care. If you get the ink wet it will smear."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Might Have Been...","review":"Well, I'll say this, WOTC really cleaned up the D&D rules in 3e. There is no question that this is a much better game than previous incarnations of D&D. Having said that, WOTC really blew the opportunity to make this product more approachable for novice gamers. In particular, the rules on character creation are a mess! There is no clear, step-by-step procedure for completing this process - just a jumble of disjointed chapters containing related material. It feels as if no one took the time to synthesize all this information into a logical whole. 3e is a step up for experienced D&D players but I fear that it will only frustrate and discourage new players looking to take up this exciting hobby. All and all, a very average effort by WOTC."},{"rating":"1","title":"The More Things Change","review":"As an older role-player, I find that I have a lot of experience with games that the newer generation of gamers don't even remember; games like Chainmail and the original Dungeons and Dragons. Many gamers view this book, along with it's counterparts the DMG and Mounstrous Manual, as a step forward. I view it as a step backward. It changed too much too quickly. I've heard younger gamers say that the system has been \\"stream-lined for new players\\", but I find that it's dull, less complicated and shooting for a lower target group. Perhaps I'm just getting older and am opposed to change, but I wasn't that happy with the 3rd edition rules.

In my personal opinion, I agree with the reviewers who say that the book is poorly organized and poorly written on the whole, and the new 3E rules are too radical a departure from 2E.However, I wanted to comment on why you might want to consider owning the book anyway. Apart from some wonderful artwork, the book does offer some interesting rule changes, such as the addition of the Sorcerer class, new equipment, and things of that nature. These can be incorporated easily into existing 2E games, and actually make a nice addition!So if you're looking to pirate some new material to freshen up your 2E gaming sessions...I'd actually recommend picking this book up. On the other hand, if you're satisfied with 2E or if you're looking for a better gaming system, steer far clear of D&D 3rd Edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad shipping","review":"Condition said \\"acceptable\\" but apparently that is a matter of oppinion...

It appears that they have merged the FASA and Palladium sytems to appeal to the fans of these sytems instead of trying to rework the 2nd ed rules. It works as a stand alone system and would be ok if you don't know about the previous editions, but carrying the AD&D name is a mistake here.

I decided to pick up this book and see the new D&D for myself. This book is BEAUTIFULLY done. First of all, the book has excellent artwork and has been very carefully edited. Each page is in color and boasts a glossy finish. Physically, the high production value makes this one of the best (if not the best) made RPG books in my collection.The system is very solid. It still has the feel of D&D but I feel that it is much less cumbersome. The high quality shows that this has been heavily playtested. If you are familiar with D&D it won't take you long to learn the new rules.One final point, check out the price. Today, RPG rule books go for around $30-$35. This is only $20. If you enjoy D&D, do yourself a favor and pick it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good_Try!! But.......","review":"I am a player for 19 years. I have seen some of the first edition books and i must admit that the new edition rocks!!! The rules about skills and feats are perfect and i liked also the rules about attacks of oportunity and base attack bonus. However the book is awfully written. The order in which the rules are written is very bad. I did understand the rules but a beginner (a person who starts playing D&D now) will find it very hard to understand some basic things."},{"rating":"1","title":"D&D on life support","review":"D&D is dead, and WOTC's 3rd edition of D&D is on life support. Granted the venerable game has become synonamous with role-playing, but the hobby has advanced tremendously since the 70's, and even this edition of D&D fails to reflect this. The new edition has a good system of character skills, and the new method of handling die rolls, particularly combat, is relatively streamlined and free of charts, which is always welcome. However, the major flaws of D&D are still there. It still relies on character classes (resulting in ho-hum generic characters), it still uses hit points (so after a few adventrues your characters will be wading through armies of orcs without a scratch looking for gods to kill), and it retains the numbers-heavy interest-light 3-18 scale for attributes. There are many good fantasy games on the market now, so if you are looking to make an investment for reasons beyond nostalgia, I recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"After reading all the good and bad reviews of this book I finally decided to go out and get it myself, and I was glad I did. I have been playing 2nd edition for ten years and I'll be honest, this was a giant shock! The rules are overhauled and simplyfied, not just tweaked. I'm not really into the whole Mad Max type artwork but it's your game and you make your own imagination on what they look like. Overall, I think it's a great system and I don't know what all those people who gave it a lower rank were thinking. Give it a shot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great improvement over earlier editions","review":"I approached this book with skepticism, but was completely won over. This new version of the Player's Handbook is clear, well-written, well-organized, and beautiful. The new game mechanics are a definite improvement, with everything in the game now working together almost elegantly. The graphic design is attractive without getting in the way. Perhaps best of all, the book is not overly ambitious and doesn't try to pass itself off as some kind of psuedo-fiction work (so that you don't have to hunt through countless pages of \\"story\\" to find the rules in the rulebook, as in many RPG books). All in all, this is refreshing enough to renew my interest in an old game that I hadn't played in nearly a decade. I think it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbing down the old rules","review":"Third edition AD&D is a double edged blade. On one hand, some of the revamped charts are easier, faster, more convinient. On the other hand, the need to roleplay is completely eliminated. Any race and any class can do anything they want, for instance, there could be a halfling necromancer/bard/paladin. Even then, they get minor access to the abilities of the classes they are not. The barriers between races and classes that make a choice of a character unique are destroyed, and some of the rules that gave the characters diversity have been oversimplified. As a result, the fun of roleplaying your character in certain ways in certain situations has been sucked out and replaced by mindless hacknslash clerical battles. If you like mindless battles and lack of roleplaying boundaries, buy 3rd edition. If you also like AD&D for the necessary roleplaying, stick with 2nd."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING PEOPLE!","review":"Although this is a solid title and a must have for any D+D 3rd Edition enthusiast, it is my job to let everyone know that ALL 3 core rulebooks for the 3rd Edition setting (Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, Monster Manual) are currently being reworked, updated and are being prepared for a rerelease soon. I am not sure about the exact date but I think it is early summer, June I think. I dont know specific details but the Player's handbook is supposed to boast new pages, art and rules modifications to balance out some spells and to even out the character classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT RUINS CLASSIC ROLEPLAYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The second edition was great. It did justice to the first edititon. However, third edition completely changed the systems which were classic to d&d. It not only reversed most of the rolls, but it also cheapens the tradition. I don't recomend this, so buy second edition instead, it's better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, D&D that I'll play!","review":"D&D has been the mainstay of paper and pencil roleplaying for years now. But other games have been gaining popularity recently. Why? D&D (and AD&D) have been too complicated to play. The game mechanics would get in the way of having a good time. But now, Wizards of the Coast and their crew have refined the system in to a game worth playing again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Mark Germino a very under-rated singer songwriter........ his album \`Caught in the act of being ourselves\` is absolutely brilliant but unfortunately not available on CD....... at least I can't locate a copy......... the song Rex Bob Lowenstein is a standout..The service from the seller was also excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"MG ROCKS!","review":"Mark Germino is hands down my favorite singer/songwriter in the world!

But, if you like Willa you'll be intrested anyway:1. Mike Rizzo Club Mix (6.39): Love this mix it speeds up the chorus vocals but keeps the verse vocals at almost regular speed. Really cool beat. Best mix in my opinion.2. Sal Parm {of Plasmic Honey}Club Mix (9.14): Sal doesn't do a very good job. The track is cool but the vocals are way too slow for the bpm (beats per minute). Same goes for his radio edit.3. Mike Rizzo Hyper Vocal Mix (6.09): Hyper vocal indeed. If I didn't know the words to this song by memory I wouldn't be able to understand the verses in this mix. They just go by too fast.4. Sal Parm Dub (7.14): Very, very disappointing. Usually, even when the mix is bad, remix artists have a chance to redeem themselves on their dub but not Sal Parm. I really expected better mixes form him.5. Sal Parm Radio Edit (3.59): See Track 2I'd give 3 stars but the mixes were too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"This song BLOWS!","review":"What is there to say, other than that this song, and all the remixes, are awful.

Frazier, Just Shoot Me, and Wings were all 8--10 comedy shows in my book, but this new show rated at best, a '2' for me. So bummed! But just like when Kelsey Grammer went from Frazier to his next show \\"Back to You\\" (which I thought was hilarious but was a \\"1 and done\\" season follow up) it takes more than 'Stars' to make a great show.

I would reccomend it to anyone who would enjoy a good chuckle."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT in Cleveland","review":"As i'm from Ireland i have never heard of this show but! i know the actresses that star in it. I thought i would buy 'HOT in Cleveland' and please let me tell you i was NOT disappointed with the dvd. The comedy that the girls give bounces of each of them, what i mean is i strongly believe these girls are so suited for their parts.Betty White is just FANTASTIC as the caretaker. her character reminds me of sophia from 'The Golden Girls' ROCK ON BETTY.Valerie Bertinelli is SO HOT!!the other two girls are so funny as well.GO GIRLS!!I can't wait for season 2"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughs","review":"Enjoyed this show a lot - they are all quite funny and a great match of personalities, spunk, and friendships."},{"rating":"2","title":"What did I do without Prime?!?","review":"One of my favorite shows.

Everything came quickly. However, the DVD would NOT play----\\" ERROR \\" screen kept appearing. Apparently the DVD was not compatible with my LG DVD player. Tried viewing on an older DVD and 2 episodes played normally---then the DVDs froze up and would not play any further. I then contacted Amazon to explain the problem. I recieved the exact same DVD again and had the exact same problems. Now I have 2 sets of Hot IN Cleveland and neither will play on either of my DVD players. I've paid for these and now cannot get a hold of anyone in person to explain the problem once again--doing it with the computer didn't work. Not having personal contact with a human being has cost Amazon a future repeat customer. When all goes well with Amazon, I've always been satisfied, but when you have a problem satisfaction was lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not play on my Blu-Ray","review":"Ordered this in anticipation of playing it on my 1-year-old Blu-Ray player, and it would not play.Sent it back to Amazon, they sent me another one, same result.Decided to keep it so I could play it on my CPU, which I did, but overall very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Puchased the boots for my nephew for Christmas.

I double checked the size just to make certain I was ordering the right size as I had read another review with the same problem. In desperate need of my sons snow boots, we waited and waited and waited! Only to receive baby boots! Than, they wouldn't respond to any of my emails so I finally got a hold of amazon and they took care of everything. I gave the boots to someone who could use them! Won't buy from again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Sizing","review":"I ordered the Snow Stomper II \\"Big Kids\\" size 8 from Mack's Prairie Wings and received a way smaller boot than what I had ordered. The size chart next to the product said that this size is for a 9-3/4 inch foot, so it would be the appropriate size for my 11-year-old son. I received a pair of boots that were 6-3/4 inches long, and the tag says \\"Kids\\" size 8 (not \\"Big Kids\\"). I'd read the reviews and some said the sizing was off, but since the size chart listed \\"Big Kids\\" I assumed it might have been an error that had been taken care of. I plan on returning them to Mack's and complain that their size choices are not accurate and do not fit with what Amazon's shoe/foot size chart says, as it is listed with their product. I believe they should provide return postage since this is in their error."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Boots!","review":"I purchased these boots in December 2010. Not even 30 days after purchase the zipper broke on one of the boots. I can't return to the store because they don't accept worn footware. We now have a $15 pair from Wal-Mart, no zippers.

The first thing that drew me in on this was that it was waterproof, and volume. I have really thin-point-straight-down lashes, so I know I should stay away from really wet mascaras and go for volume and waterproof since they have a more \\"waxy\\" build. Though, this does stay wet enough to build and build to get a look I have been trying for, without massive clumping or turning my eyes into a solid mass. The second thing I was excited to see is that it came in brownish black. It is so difficult to find a mascara that is waterproof and brownish black. Usually the only waterproof one is Very Black. It looks just a touch less harsh with my skin and eyes (I have fair skin and dark brown hair), a little more natural.All in all I love this. It holds my curl and the brush is super nice and not too big.I would recommend this to anyone with thin lashes like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"second best","review":"the only mascara that is better than this one is colossal, glam black, from maybeline too... i love it so mich..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with this mascara.","review":"I'm surprised about the amount of women happy with this product.

Never will I buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote these 5 star reviews!???","review":"Lies lies lies. I shouldn't have believed these positive reviews!! This is like mascara from early 90s or something, just black stain on your lashes, that put your lashes TOGETHER and clump. Oh yes it's waterproof so it gets a one star, thats the only good thing about it....it definitely isn't pretty!!!! And NO IT DOES NOT ADD ANY VOLUME. Wasted my money thank u very much! Sigh. I want my money backkkkkkkkkk!! Grrrrrrrr and I bought this for my wedding!!!

The photographs paired with her plan drawings and text make very clear why she made the choices she did. There are a good variety of gardens presented in \\"Garden Plans\\" to inspire your own plans.My one negative is that some of the material is rehashed. Notably Elton John's garden, which is well covered in \\"The Art of Planting\\". It's to Verey's credit that I noticed that -- I flip through \\"The Art of Planting\\" regularly, so I know it well!That being said, if you like ornamental gardens and need a bit of inspiration, I don't think you can go wrong with this paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above and Beyond","review":"This is quite a book containing pictures and plans for 'classic' English gardens.

With great effort i have found only one thing this cd lacks, breakdowns. Those who love unearth, norma jean (formerly luti-kriss), underoath, falling cycle, throwdown, eighteen visions and sinai beach, will not be used to the lack of breackdowns. But if you love blistering speed, great vocals, and mindblowingly intricate music, you will no doubt fall in love with Every Time i Die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true hardcore!","review":"This album sounds like Morbid Angel trying to do hardcore. There's not an ounce of punk rock in it, hardcore stands for hardcore punk and this isn't it. Even old school hardcore bands that utilized a hip hop or an metalish hardcore sound never sounded anything close to this. I wish people would stop trying to do pure metal and call it hardcore. For all these new school supposed hardcore bands just because you slam hardcore style, have a short-trendy haircut with dyed black hair and some african ear piercings doesn't make you a hardcore band."},{"rating":"2","title":"its sick","review":"I bought Hot damn first then went back to this, and ill say that it is definetly sicker thatn hot damn.More complexed breakdowns make this a treat for anyone who is into those.

Overall great cd, reccommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definitive and thorough history","review":"Translated from Italian, this book, with volume 2, is one of the definitive histories of the modern movement.

(Is that a sentence?) See volume 2 for anything post WWI."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF HER WORST!","review":"As a huge Diana Ross fan i have always enjoyed her albums and whilst some have been better than others there normally are a handful of tracks that i do like. However this album emerges as her most indistinctive work of the 80's. To be fair there are two great tracks that save this from being given one star- MUSCLES (written by Michael Jackson and a huge seller on both sides of the Atlantic) and I AM ME. SO CLOSE and IN YOUR ARMS are fairly good but the rest of the album is dreamy and ponderous. This was followed by an even worse album ROSS (1983). These are the only two albums of Diana Ross that i barley ever listen to. The soul seems to have drained from this album to a more light rock sound or in the case of FOOL FOR YOUR LOVE very heavy rock to which Ross undoubtedly has the vocal abilities to carry it through but is simply not the Diana Ross we all know and love. On the whole the album is mediocre with the exception of the few tracks mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just Historical But Some Fun Roots Power Pop Tracks","review":"While the other reviewers are on-target, what's not mentioned is this is a nice collection of roots power pop tracks - yes, 'garagey' but it still holds up pretty well.

Well worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live Norton Records","review":"It's Amazing (not really) that old garage band music is better than any crud released nowadays.

The truth behind the right wing take over of the United States. We all suspected the things we learn in this book, but hoped they weren't true. They are. After reading this, you should wake up sweating every night in fear for your freedom.

Mr. Brock apparently was low on his personal income so he off-handedly decided to publish a pile of mush between two cardboard covers. (Excuse me while i gag on my own tongue.) The economy may have been 'good' during Clinton's reign of so-called Presidency, but who made it good in the first place? Clinton? Hardly! Only through Reagon and Bush Sr.'s well-thought economic strategies was there such a prosperous time. Meanwhile, while Billy was gettin his balls licked by interns, we had terrorists plotting against us and Dot Com companies beginning to bust. Yeah, great job Bill! So after reading this book, tell me: Who's really running a conspiracy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Babbling from the mouth of a fool.","review":"Brock's supposed 'turnaround' is questionable at best. His latest book lacks evidence or proof of any kind to support his, and Hillary's \\"vast right wing conspiracy\\" BS. Admittedly, I read this book with my own, Libertarian, bias. But, being a fan of neither the right or the left, this book, and Brock himself, simply lacks credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELF-SERVING POMPOSITY","review":"Question: Who CARES what David Brock thinks? After claiming he lied in writing other books and articles, he has zero credibility now. He desperate need to purge himself of his past journalistic \\"sins\\" just so happened to coincide with a book contract? Amazing. And as far as I could tell, Brock spends a good deal of time bemoaning the politics of personal destruction, only to trash people who were once his closest friends--personally. David is smearing the right with the same vengeance that he smeared the left years ago. How is it relevant to his change of heart that Matt Drudge is of unclear sexuality? Or that Ann Coulter likes to smoke? Or that Laura Ingraham was once drunk with him in a gay bar? Answer: It isn't. A narcissistic screed by a man in love with no ideology or philosophy except \\"Me, me, me!\\" Obscene."},{"rating":"1","title":"A better title would have been \\"The Stooge\\"","review":"More trash from David Brock.

But the half-truths and outright falsehoods are too many to name. This book never made it into the top 5 bestsellers on the NYT bestsellers list, as Goldberg's book \\"Bias\\" did (how many weeks was it #1 bestseller?), and for good reasons. It made a big stir with leftists then dropped from sight like a lead balloon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was he lying now or then?","review":"The author started out as a liberal then became conservative, then a liberal again. How can we believe anything he says? Most of the quotes from sources, supposedly speaking of others in this book have been denied. Many factual inaccuracies have been found. Unlike Bernard Goldberg's book Bias, who was a liberal and still is, he came foward because he felt the right was getting short shirft, which hurts both the media and democracy.If DB had written that he still believed in conservative principals but, these people went too far in pursuit of those ideals, I'd be more likely to think he was telling the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both Brock and the Daily Show lose a customer","review":"After accidently watching the interview of David Brock on Comedy Central's the Daily Show, I've lost respect for both. He is obviously a slighted political puppet who dives to whatever side will give him the most attention and completely oblivious of the media bias on both sides. He lamented the plight of the poor liberals since the conservatives own fox news. The poor liberals only have ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, New York Times and whoops... he didn't say THAT. I'd be happy with this if it was legit, but it is just political opportunist profiteering. Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"One writer flew over the cuckoo nest","review":"Those rah-rahing over this book might want to check out numerous columns online which are devastating to many if not most of David Brock's assertions. This guy apparently can't seem to tell the truth, ever, to anyone. He also recently was forced to admit that he'd been admitted to a mental institution in the recent past. We're talking rubber room, disassociation from reality stuff here, not depression or substance abuse. So, enjoy it as you might, beware of reading books that just tell you what you want to hear. They're fiction, as is, apparently, most of this book. Brock's \\"conservative\\" books were full of a lot of hooey, but this one is too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duh!","review":"So, when Brock was writing exposes for American Spectator--on Bill Clinton and his use of Arkansas troopers as procurers for him and when he was writing about Anita Hill, he was lying. The books and articles had references and named names--and, at least some of the troopers verified what Brock wrote.He was also not making a lot of money, was the target of the Left, who outed him, could not get a gig on a talk show--period. He was villified as a liar by the Left.Now, he recants and does a suck-up book on Hillary Clinton followed by an expose of the Right---all without references and verification. But, suddenly, he is making the rounds of the liberal talk shows, his books get serious/favorable reviews rather than attacks and screeds, he is a lion of the Left, and is now telling the truth.Excuse me?Does anyone else out there see this for what it is?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Myopic Anymore","review":"The book is good, not great. It confirms my suspicions of the conservative slander machine. The book details the Right-Wing as the hypocritical lunatics they are. A must read for any centrist on the right or left.

Brock tells the American public all of the un-American tactics that he participated in as a member of the right-wing party during the 90's. Brock reveals that there truly was a right-wing conspiracy to destroy President Clinton and to cast a dark shadow over the entire Democratic Party. The book is written in a flat tone of voice, which comes across rather eerie when Brock describes the dirty tactics used by the right-wing conspirators.Recently this book has come under fire by many people from the right. They say that what Brock is depicting in the book is a lie, my question is, if it is a lie, and the events never truly happened, then why is the right making such a fuss. It seems that Brock certainly stirred up something by writing this tell all political novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillary was right!!

When they couldn't do that, they decided to steal one and appoint GW Bush as Commander in Chief.I always had a sense that Brock was a decent person even when he was destroying lives w/ his pen.
