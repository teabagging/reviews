There's a sultriness to these vibes that recalls hot summer breezes, just hanging out, and the natural horniness that days like that arouses. A very outdoor groove abounds here, with instrumentation and chord progressions that recall blaxploitation soundtracks, but with greater flair and always with the lightness of spirit and sheer delight in life that Byrd exhibits so flawlessly in his more upbeat offerings. Easy perhaps to overlook as a funky background music, it's actually an accomplished affair and another example of Byrd's mastery of creating atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT AND A HALF","review":"Be not afraid, musicheads. You may expect these tough ladies to be guarding MilesOn the Corner. In reality, they are hanging with Donald Byrd, right here.The comparison is one of opposites. While Miles was creating a pitch black, funky improvisational brew in the first half of the 1970s Byrd made a melodic, chipper funk, filled with flutes, voices, and his own sailing trumpet, You can even draw the opposition down to the playing: Miles spitting minimal wha wha nails, and Byrd sailing over the top with the same cheer as a bop record.Byrd started this template withBlackbyrd--smooth jazz when the term meant chirping grooves provided by aces like bassist Chuck Rainy and, here, drummer Harvey Mason, and did not mean digital vanilla.There is plenty of flavor-- and substance--to go around on this too often overlooked branch of 1970s jazz, and if you have dismissed music such as Street Lady, you just ain't listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"handle broke","review":"Purchased the cart 6/2009.

The Lid/seat will not attach to the front as shown in the photos, It appears that the plastic used in construction is not flexible enough for the tabs to grasp the edges as designed. I drilled through the Lid and the front at the four dimples, inserted small bolts in the lid and put nuts on them to stay with the lid, when it is attached to the front of the Quik Cart it is held by wingnuts inside. It makes for easy removal and the wingnuts are then kept on the bolts.

Within 3 weeks of use (2 days a week), the front panel has started cracking near the bottom on 3 of them (as described in many of these reviews), including one that has broken all the way across the front, rendering it useless. If this retailed for 10 bucks, it might not be so surprising, but since we paid $25 apiece for these, it's VERY upsetting that they are as poor quality as they are. BUYER BEWARE."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap construction","review":"The first one of these I bought just plain did not work. The telescoping handle did not retract and the corner came apart the first time I opened it. I returned it for a replacement and the new one is just as disappointing. The handle works, but as I was walking along rolling it behind me the first use, I paused for one moment and the pin in the corner of the new one fell out as well. So now the corner of my new one is separated and the pin is IMPOSSIBLE to get back in place even though it fell out efforlessly. The cover is great as long as it is on the crate top, but it keeps falling off the front of the crate where is can be stored when it is not on top of the crate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"Used it twice and it fell completely (and I do mean COMPLETELY) apart.

When open with the lid it can genuinely support the weight of an adult, so it can double up as a stool.

Well we've used the cart twice so far, and both times we spent about 5 minutes trying to get the handle to extend fully. Tonight we used it for the second time, but could not get it to work. One side of the handle feels loose and can slide up and down with ease. The other side seems permanently stuck at halfway. The button that's supposed to release the handle doesn't seem to do anything either. My girlfriend, who's barely over 5 feet tall, hurt her back having to hunch over to pull this cart through our apartment complex from the car.If I had saved any of the packaging this would have been returned after the first use.

It's not heavy duty and not user-friendly. It seems like the perfect solution for an aging parent who needs to haul stuff, but then they have to remove it from their trunk and put it together each time. And then the bottom folds back up since it doesn't actually lock into place. And the lid? It's not attached. AND the whole thing is bulky so you're literally rolling a box around. I also tried this for my daughter to haul her design school stuff around but she complained about the same things. What a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT!","review":"Well... I've have gone through two of these quick carts and both have broken. I will not buy another again. I just hope I can find something the same size. It's exactly what I need but they are truly a piece of junk! They have Cheap plastic and are not sturdy. This cart was used to haul my jewelry cases around. After only a week, pieces of plastic broke on the sides causing the bottom to fall out. I had my father in law make me a piece of wood to fit in the bottom. Worked well for awhile until the whole front piece of plastic broke off. I needed it so I bought another one. The second one I had to wire together after the plastic broke. The bottom also broke out of the second one...luckily I was able to use the wood in the bottom again. Used it that way for awhile until the same thing happened.

Within 20 minutes, the entire front section of the Quik Cart's plastic box supports broke, spilling me onto the ground.Now, my main concern here is: what if I had been using this thing as a \\"stepstool\\", as it states it is safe to do for those under 250 pounds?

Yesterday the \\"hub cap\\" on one of the wheels broke and it cannot be fixed. The wheel no longer turns as a result. It has not been abused, dropped, slammed down or otherwise mistreated. We load books into it, and roll it up ramps to and from the parking lot to the building. I am disappointed that this cart didn't hold up longer than it did. I didn't want to be buying a new one so soon.

When I first tried to open the cart, the side clips and support rails were so tight, I could hardly get them undone. This struggle would be enough to deter me from using the collapsable aspect. In addition, the lid doesn't lock onto the front of the cart for storage even though it is advertised to do so, and it also doesn't snap onto the top securely. From the looks of the wheels and axel, I wouldn't trust the cart to hold up well to any significant weight placed upon them.

But with cybiko you have a free celection.Also I have a neighbor who also has a cybiko so we chat a lot. There is a orgaziner, dictonary translaters and a lot more. Like other parents too they wont let you have a PDA. So cybiko is like a PDA. Not exactly the same but hey, what could you exepect for a cheap toy which is almost like a PDA. Overall I think this is a great toy for kids and adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Personally, I got sick of my Cybiko pretty darn fast. Sure, it sounds cool, with the whole chat and emailing thing, but the reality of it is that if you really wanted to email, go onto the internet yourself, because you already have to plug the Cybiko into the computer anyways. The chat sounds cool, but there is never anyone on. And I mean NEVER. If this toy caught on more, it probably could be fun because there would be more people to chat with. I know what you're thinking: there's still the games, right? Well, the games look cool, but the only one I found that really is remotely interesting is the speed biking one, and in that game all you do is \\"bike\\" down a track. Oh, every once in a while be careful, it turns! Seriously everyone, this toy is a complete waste of money. If you want my advice, you'd be better off just buying... well... something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Me and My cybiko","review":"When I first got it, it was bad because it took me about 2 months to get it right and to download games from the internet to my cybiko but when it work I loked it. Also its kind of bad because if your the only person in the hole city that ha one than it will be touf and it won't work. I recomend the new cybico extreme. My cybiko it said that you can send wireless email ans even use the internet wireless, but only a few sites. Go to cybiko.com and theres many things. Right now myne won't work beause of the batteries I thick I tries recharching, pluging in the electric wire but it won't wor so by the new cybiko extreme even if its more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bargain price for a slightly outdated gadget","review":"I got a couple of these as gifts and tested them right out of the box. As others have mentioned none of them would work without the charger plugged in. However removing the batteries and cleaning the terminals usually worked. I was able to massage two of the three cybikos to life this way, with battery life averaging 4-5 hours. With the third cybiko the batteries were so severely corroded that cleaning had no effect whatsoever.The Cybiko itself is slightly outdated but for the low price of $10 you can't go wrong. Cybiko's website is still running and there are a ton of games to download for those who willing to find them. Its also very durable and can stand up to quite a bit of bashing. However, there is no doubt it is a \\"toy\\" and will never replace a palm in terms of funcitonality. For the geek-minded you can download a full-fledged SDK to write your own progs, but don't expect to find a burgeoning community of developers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cybikos That Never Worked","review":"I purchased two Cybikos. They turned on, we plugged them in to charge, and that was it; they were unable to use. The message on both was low battery. I've called the 800 number three times, each time leaving a message. I have never heard back!! I went to a couple of stores to see if the battery was replacable, not one store carried the particular battery.

There are a few songs they had co-written and up until recently, all of the music they performed was their own. Recently, they have also included a few songs written by songwriters, though the largest percentage is still their own. The title track is a re-make of one of my favorite Rick Nelson songs, and the whole album is great. I constantly hear people telling me that Nelson can't be good, we don't hear it on Top40, have you listened to Top40 lately, it is all the same regurgitated mush, that is the reason you don't find true artists that speak to you through their music on a personal level on Top40.

Kenny Dorham and the work he did on Blue Note in particular represent the most original and beautiful jazz writing... ever. The fact that he isn't singing on any of the tracks (he did a couple of albums featuring his voice) should not dissuade anyone from buying this disc; along with being a great writer, he has a very interesting and appealing approach to the trumpet, and played with some of the greats of the Bop and Hard-Bop eras -- including Charlie Parker and Sonny Rollins.On this disc there is a good sampling of the ground breaking work he did with Joe Henderson in the early 60's, as well as cuts from Whistle Stop and Afro-Cuban. I recommend this disc highly for anyone interested in exposing themselves to a very cerebral writer/trumpet player."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this book.","review":"We borrowed this book from the library several times, but my son liked the book so much we had to buy him a copy.

He runs into Tom Arnold and his family whom he thinks is just crazy life with all of the kids. He thinks that kids just ruin your life. He can't except his girlfriend is pregnant and they are going to be parents until his girlfriend leaves him when he misses an appointment for the sonagram. When he watches the video at home he falls in love, he gets Tom's character to help him get his girlfriend back and prove to himself to her.

What did it do wrong to deserve such selfish, immature parents?Robin Williams is the only one who makes this watchable, but it isn't a patch on his other work.The fight scene between Hugh Grant and Tom Arnold in the delivery room was particularly stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A TURKEY!","review":"Robin Williams, a fine, talented actor, was wasted in this load of pants.

The girl friend is of course all a man could ask for, and yet, this dunce, we are supposed to feel sorry for.And how can the scene of the little girl in the bed doing something erotic to the hero can have passed as not being criminal in its implications. Thats not all, another little girl is found making aggressive moves towards the hero. One more asks him to come up for, not coffee, but sex. The guy is just an incredible charmer!Bottom line, all females are portrayed as either prostitute-like, aggressive, and stupid.

Directed by Chris Columbus, Nine Months follows a young unmarried couple who about to bring a baby into the world. Grant is charming as always and his non-stop flustering is always engaging.

Its witty, romantic and a treasure if you love kids"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious comedy!","review":"\\"Nine Months\\" deserves credit just for being a Columbus film. But there's more to it than that: It's outrageously funny, with the film indeed coasting on Hugh's antics and boyish charm, and Moore's radiant beauty.An aging bachelor (Hugh Grant) is trying to make up his mind whether or not to commit to his girlfriend (Moore) for life. Then, she spills the beans that, oops, she's pregnant! Poor Hugh doesn't know what to do, and therefore starts a roller coaster of hilarious one-liners and silly gags.The movie works because Moore and Hugh have definite sexual chemistry with a lot of snap, crackle, and pop. Plus add Robin Williams as an Russian obstretrician, Tom Arnold as Grant's doltish friend, and Joan Cusack as Moore's pregnant friend (one of her best roles since \\"Addams Family Values\\"). Add a frantic Columbus directing, and you have a charming, hilarious comedy that'll leave you breathless with laughter!Rated PG-13 for frank sexual discussion, innueudo and for language."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"Nine months is an adorably funny movie seen through the eyes of a terrified father to be (Hugh Grant). Robin Williams is hilarious as the couple's Russian doctor. Joan Cusack and Tom Arnold are superb as the \\"breeder\\" couple that helps them through this changing time. Julianne Moore shines as the expectant mommy. An all around heartwarming and funny movie. The end will have you rolling on the floor holding your stomach with laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny","review":"The story has all the elements of a funny movie, and there are lots of good actors around, but somehow it just doesn't come together. Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore are lovers? You've got to be kidding - there is absolutely nothing going on between those two. Grant hams it up desperately in an attempt to conceal the obvious, namely that he is not interested in anything going on around him. Jeff Goldblum wanders through the movie as if at a loss to remember what on earth got him there. And Tom Arnold is just unbelievably, unbearably bad. There are some cheap jokes that may make you chuckle and Robin Williams has a couple of good scenes, but even the slapstick is so poorly executed and overacted it's painful. A total, unmitigated disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nine Months Too Long","review":"Another sappy love story. Boy gets girl preggers, boy freaks out, girl leaves boy.

Sure, the CD may be available in iTunes, but what if I want to listen to it on my iPod AND have a physical copy in case my computer erases all my music? Well, thanks to Sony, I don't have that option.Bottom line: NEVER buy any CD that's copy-protected. I love Art Blakey, but if you need to get any of his CDs, then buy any of his Blue Note releases.

In fact I got him the Handspring Visor Prism at the same time. This module is the greatest idea. It gives you the ability to use your Visor handheld as the first truly universal remote. I say that because there are a lot of so called 'universal remotes' you can buy that may be able to control most or all of your stereo/video equipment, but I have yet to see one that can do EVERY function the original remote for that item could have done.

You will not regret the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep in mind, original remotes are needed","review":"The reason I decided to buy the OmniRemote for my Visor was that I had lost most of my remotes for my electronics on a move recently, and I thought this could replace them all quickly and easily. To my disappointment, I soon realized that all original remotes were needed to program this module. So I ended up having to go to Wal-Mart and buy another universal remote, program it using the included codes, and use that Universal Remote to program the OmniRemote. What a waste of time, effort and money. The Sony Universal remote I bought was much easier to setup and use, it costed about 75% less, and none of the original remotes were neccesary because a list of manufacturers codes was included. Why the OmniRemote doesn't include such a list of codes is beyond me.

I bought some soup bases a few years ago and especially liked the clam and mushroom bases. Unfortunately, the manufacturer sent me a promo postcard years later offering free shipping and cheaper prices if I ordered directly so I ordered a bunch and the only tolerable one was the low sodium chicken. This mushroom base is useless and you will taste acrid saltiness before you ever taste mushroom.

So when I started the water and put an average amount, the kind I would use on other base products, I was startled by the amount of salt I found myself tasting. Yes, if you use a much smaller quantity it does have its redeeming quality but, really, if I wanted so much salt on a base I would have ordered Salt Base. It works in small amounts and do not get me wrong: I am a dedicated fan of Minor's products but while plenty of others are above average on taste this one exceeds the allotted salt limits. I remember having to amplify my creation by a ratio of ten more cups of water to lessen the salty taste. Somewhere in there, lurking in the broth it made, a mushroom flavor was present. Yes, I agree with the first review (2006) on way too much salt. Therefore, 2 Stars at the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"best mushroom base","review":"have used this product for 20 years.

I bought A Great Noise for a relative and am GLAD that I opened the CD insert before giving it away. The cover is kitch(sp) in a Betty Paige sort of way, but the insert goes overboard. The 50's style illustrations of couples having sex are TAME and perphaps humorous, but I don't know how well the full FRONTAL and full REAR illustrations would go over with your middle-aged aunt (or adolescent niece). Not to mention the depiction of DIGITAL stimuli and CLEAVAGE to CLEAVAGE contact. It's pretty much an illustrated sex manual and if the writings that accompany them somehow make them witty ... I wouldn't know,because they aren't in English. The insert really takes away from Marisa's talent ... there is an echo of Astrud Gilberto, Sade and Basia in her work. But, unless I want to send it in a blank CD case my aunt will never know. A GREAT TALENT IN TRULY BAD PACKAGING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Masterpiece","review":"I cannot praise enough this album. Marisa is my favourite contemporary singer and this album shows it. But on that you can trust the other reviews. I'd like to explain about the cover and artwork (I don't know the north-american version, but the brazilian booklet and cd covers are completely illustrated - in the same way the cover is). Marisa has chosen to portray the work of an undergound \\"artist\\", Carlos Zéfiro, who used to write and draw many pornographic comics during the 50's, that were all, obviously, illegal. So he preffered to stay anonymous (C. Zéfiro is a nick he created) until some 5 years ago when he revealed himself only to die a few months later. The joke is, although he had to hide his identity and his work, as the years passed, his porn material became almost light and many people admitted having read them during teenage, so he attained cult status. Now go buy Marisa Monte cd's! They're all worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"* * * LINDA* * * * * *MARAVILHOSA* * * * DEMAIS* * * * * *","review":"This cd was the start of my obsession!

I am sure he would have been glad with the wall of sounds that this album delivers.

The books looks at challenges that society faces and how these problems have been dealt with by modern and postmodern theorists. Social theory is often dense, wordy, and difficult to read.

Set in a rural Danish outback, this police drama-mystery-noir is a top notch production with great story and character development -- in a understated, strange way. Very well directed, produced, acted and photographed.I don't know how to describe the twists and turns this one has -- it's spot on and off beat. You just *never* know what to expect next. Did I say it's a dark comedy? It is. But perhaps less comic and more dark. And it's no wonder it's won numerous awards -- it's earned them.

Well, even if I'm way off base, this is one infectious pop rock album. The band is TIGHT, and Leo's lyrics/voice are honest and soulful...some things sorely lacking in today's run-of-the-mill radio rock.I can't really recommend this album enough. If you like the single Me and Mia (and who doesn't?) you will love the entire album. Catchy as all hell, wonderfully produced, and teeming with hooks, Shake the Sheets reminds me of Frank Black's masterpiece \\"Teenager of the Year.\\" This may well do it one better, as album of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty great","review":"So basically, what you heard is true. This is a great band and this is a great album. Exciting, upbeat, fun are three words I would use to describe their sound.But it's really unique in the way that the issues they address in the songs aren't trifling, and even though it sounds like some mindless punk guitar riffing, it's really much deeper than that...

Ted Leo has done his homework it would seem, as this album has these qualities by the bucket load. Each song is bursting with punk rock spirit and energy, on a one man mission to get you to question yourself, art, politics and all the mess that surrounds us. If you like your rock and roll sharp and witty in the mould of Elvis Costello and other such greats, discover Ted Leo now. 'Shake The Sheets' is a full on 11 track call to arms for you to sit up and have faith that good songs might just save your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prescribe some of that Ted Leo!","review":"This is the first Ted Leo CD I have bought and I think it really showcases the band's ability and style. First off, all the songs are infectiously catchy and buzzing with energy. If this is punk, then I like it. Their musical prowess is matched with blatantly political lyrics (this album was released before the election, after all). I haven't heard any of Ted's other albums all the way through, but it seems like he's taken a more straighforward approach to his music. I'd say this is worth a buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book!

Why did he do this?The answer is: A passenger sitting near the front had smuggled a poisonous snake onto the plane and it had escaped.If you think that \\"puzzle\\" is bad, all I can say is that they get worse, much worse.This would only be mildly amusing if I were back in college and wanted to entertain those who were drunk.

My main problem was with Jim; he's basically the only character and he's so unlikable that after a while you just don't feel like spending any more time with him. In Jim you also see the germ of the fascist leanings so evident in the main characters of the truly execrable--but at least readable--Ballard novels __Cocaine Nights__ and __Super-Cannes__.In my opinion, if you want to read the semi-autobiographical adventures of a boy in an occupied country, you're better off with __The Painted Bird__.

However, in a time of twitter, CNN 1-3, FOX news, and more we cannot assess political communication without these changes.Murray seems to lean toward valuing socialist thought and ridiculing capitalism and capitalist intentions.

The special effects in Savage Planet look like they were put together by the fourth grader's computer nerd buddy. The effects are hokey, and look like they were produced for a 1992 video game.And the acting? Horrendous.

Most modern childrens books about Thanksgiving ignore the central role their faith played in the migration of the Puritans to the New World.This book accurately descibes the religious divisions in England that drove the Seperatists (later called Pilgrims) to leave. Throughout the book, children see the Puritans through the lens of their faith. It's not overt and peachy, but Wisegard makes it clear that this was a group of people who were truly seeking to follow God's will. That is what we teach our own children to do, so we found it very refreshing.Note: the previous reviewer is incorrect about the use of the term \\"Pilgrim\\".

Since most of the pieces on this CD tend towards soft moodiness, you're left with a CD that is hard to enjoy unless you can be in a quiet setting with the stereo really cranked.

The way she treated Gilliam was outrageous but understandable when seen through her eyes.I overlooked her attitude and kept reading to see how it played out and Domning did a splendid job of showing Nicola the truth of Gilliam's role in her father's death.

For a film of this type, it has nothing going for it. There is 90 minutes to kill going through the motions, and then the last 2 minutes has an unexpected twist to finish it off. The overall acting by the cast is weak, and probably of all, Naveen Andrews fares the worst. For the type of a role that Kim Cattrall undertook in Double Vision, it is definitely has Juliette Binoche's name written all over it.

I found both the chapters on his unmasking of \\"Anonymous\\" and the discovery of a \\"new\\" Shakespeare work especially interesting.

Burgess gestures throughout his book at stories, issues, and viewpoints that would be interesting if clearly articulated, but the writing was so terrible and the narrative so unclear and disjointed that I found the book painful to read. It is regrettable that this is the only book available by a former ATF agent providing an inside view (such as it is) of the bureau. I must also add that the book is no longer current, and hence cannot address major changes in the ATF. This is not at all the author's fault, but it is something that should be taken into consideration for potential readers who are interested in the modern bureau."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unreadable","review":"This author could not have had an editor; this book reads like the product of a vanity press.

Caryll Houselander, a modern mystic, in her gorgeous mastery of the English language, her precision in showing us our nature - running the whole gamut from our foibles to herioc, humble feats - offers the simple image of a \\"reed\\".

If you have a preference for traditional gospel there is a track for you on here \\"Don't Let\\" which is the most soul stirring song on the CD. The best slow song is \\"We Must Praise\\". The best jubilation song is a toss for me between \\"You Bought Me\\" and \\"Psalm 150\\". The best mixed music song is \\"Livin\\"; this song is receiving airplay now but the rap at the front is not played on non secular stations. I have not heard it on a secular station yet. This CD is in my player right next to Byron Cage and Fred Hammond but I play this one more. I love all music and any music with a message that gives praise to the Lord is all right with me.

Then I heard \\"We Must Praise\\" and God dropped it into my spirit to by this CD just from that one song. I am so glad that I did. J. Moss is so talented. Another wonderful branch from the Clark/Moss family tree. His singing style reminds me of his cousin Karen Clark-Sheard, but with a twist. I bought this CD a couple of days ago and have not taken it out of my CD player since then. The Word network also did a special on J's listening party and I got a chance to see him perform \\"I Wanna Be\\". There are so many other wonderful songs on the CD, but I believe my favorite is \\"Unto Thee\\". This song is awesome, and J's exceptional voice just sets it off. I was also glad to see that he put \\"Work Your Faith\\" on this CD. I loved it when it was done with the Straight Gate Mass choir. God Bless you J. Moss.

With the exception of a few songs. I thought that the arrangement and backgrounds sounded the same. In addition, I thought they were too computerized. He has produced and wrote so many songs that when he has decided to do it for himself, it sounds like he's copying off someone else (Karen Clark-Sheard). Of course, that's not the case. Those are his songs!! He's just like Rodney Jerkins or Fred Hammond....his style is so evident. You can just tell when these guys have produced a song. Now, don't get me wrong....I've listened again several times, and have changed my initial opinion (silly me). This cd is off the hook. I have a couple of favorites, tracks 1-9. That's more than half! I guess you'll have to get it yourself, to find out the rest. He is a wonderful writer and vocalist. Be blessed J.Moss and continue to do the Lords work."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the most part....great job","review":"The album is pretty good, J. Moss is always awesome with his vocals. Has great range and a unique sound that is similar to a computer program. Those Clark/Moss folks are crazy with the singing. Some of the tracks seemed to sound the same. Being that J. Moss has produced/written for just about everyone in the business i feel like i've heard his CD even before he had his solo stuff. Kind of oversaturated with runs. Keep it simple sometimes. Mass choir sound on tracks when you know he did all the backing vocals himself. Sounds like a million J. Moss' singing. I'm just being honest. I gave it 4 stars because i think sometimes i listen very hard being that i am a singer myself, i got all the little extras. God bless him though, he's got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doin' big things","review":"I have been a fan of PAJAM and the work that they do with other artist, but when I found out that J.Moss was coming out with his own cd I really wanted to know what it was going to be like. I was very pleased with this cd, it offers a good range of music you can bump to music you can worship with. The song writing is great on the album, has kind of that kirk franklin writing flavor to me (which I love so much). Its definitely a cd to add to the collection, well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay CD","review":"I think that J. Moss is a great vocalist, songwriter, and producer, but the only two songs that I like on the CD are \\"I Wanna Be\\" and \\"We Must Praise.\\" The rest of CD was overhyped to me, but I would like to see what he brings next."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTE BLESSING","review":"I love this cd, J. Moss has really touched myheart with We must Praise...no matter who or what we are.....simply beautiful- the entire cd is a must hear....the bonus track Work your faith will take you higher than you have ever felt and you will find yourself playing it over and over again....as he begins with \\"someone needs to hear this\\"......I must say that as a believer I am encouraged and touched and thank you J.

I used to be a big fan of the Dragonlance world, and perhaps I was expecting too much. But compared to how some of those early tales really affected me, this one just fell flat.While the main character, I think, was fairly well developed, all of the critical plot developments were telegraphed from MANY miles away (especially the traitor in Lord Bight's midst). The subplot about the bronze dragon, too, seems thin and easy to guess.Another thing that I disliked was the way the Solamanic Order was portrayed. In all of the other books I read, I gained a healthy respect for the order... in this one, I was forced to question their motives and simply wasn't given a good reason why they were doing what they were.Luckily, after reading this I picked up the great Magehound by Eileen Cunningham, which gave me faith in the genre once again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good high level introduction to CORBA","review":"This book is a good, enthusiastic, high level, non-programmer's introduction to CORBA and the \\"object web\\".

This book contains just enough information to make you think there's probably something here but you'd be wrong. Some of the chapters are so skinny it's not clear why there there at all. For example Naming Services: Naming in a nutshell, 2 pages, How it works, < 1 page.The authors' declared pattern to the book's exposition, which would be great if it were actually executed to a substantive level, is to enumerate the service APIs and then \\"demonstrate\\" the use of the service. But alot of this stuff is actually very deep subject matter. Take Transactions and Concurrency, for example. Reading this chapter (15 pages) will either make you feel that you missed something big (and you did, it's just not in this book) or that you got ...

A former LAPD officer named Jesse Stone becomes the police chief. His main occupation is giving out parking tickets on a normal day. He has a major drinking problem and keeps in touch with his ex-wife every day by phone. Then all of a sudden these murders occurred. We find out in one video that a serial killing couple has an interest in him for some unknown reason. In another, to curb his drinking problem, he looks into a cold case of a bank robbery gone wrong; with surprising results.A very good series. Hope they make more videos of Robert J.

Wegner has hardly any information about Jackson. He \\"reveals\\" that boys would sometimes sleep in Jackson's room (which Jackson himself has said many times) and that Jackson would sometimes hug boys or sit close to them on a golf cart, both of which Jackson himself has shown in his recent \\"Home Movies\\" special.

Even if you signed a confidentiality agreement it would not prevent you from reporting a crime. That's hogwash.This man has proven himself to NOT be trustworthy because of the many variations of the stories that he has told in the book and in interviews on various television programs. Also, why would you wait so long to publish your story?The only explanation is that this man found a way to make a profit off of the terrible allegations that were made against MJ in 1993.

I won't even bother going into detail on the spelling and spacing in the book that in and of itself is hurtful to his credibility.I can only conclude that Mr.Wegner was suffering from visual delusions during his employment with Mr. Jackson and had great hopes of wealth from his attempt at writing a book about a man who has given so much of his time and wealth to the needy selflessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY IT!

These songs are beautiful, passionate, and well performed. The ambience created by their unique Greek style takes the listener to a different reality. Their harmonies are unusual and the arrangements are carefully planned and well developed. There is a lot of musical talent in Greece and this collection proves it. The intensity of the performances break any language barrier.This collection features singers of the caliber of Eleni Vitali. These are singers that should have more exposure.

I really liked the large dragon named Joanna, formeraly a human. And the artifical dragonette constructs, the wyverns, were cool also. I just would not want to pay their feeding bills.And the AI rabbit character from http://www.sluggy.com/ was a total hoot.

Great fun for him and a slower moving, but still quite entertaining read for us.The character development is not quite as well done as in \\"Dragons\\"; the mer-people all blur together, for instance, and few of the new people we meet on ship really become individuals. But it's a good story and Weber gets to include a lot of underwater scenes. Making some of his diving trips tax-deductible, no doubt.The Novella/Short story at the end about Megan's experiences in Paul's Harem is just a bit too much and really not necessary. All the information we need about her is included in the next book in the series \\"Against the Tide.\\" It causes flashback to several gratuitous borderline-pedophilic scenes in \\"Dragons\\" (preteen girl homunculus in the woods, naked 12 year old girl in the public bath) and gives me to wonder, just a bit, what's in the author's head sometimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a VHS copy instead","review":"While i am a huge supporter of this film of trailers, I cannot recommend this Dvd at all.

Worse than any tenth generation bootleg, this tape sucks on every level, from the picture quality, the sound, dropouts, and the titles bleed off to the side. The tape source must have been found in the trunk of a 1980 something Toyota Corolla that was just pulled out of a junkyard. My VHs is pristine compared to this, and they want 19.95 for it?

Having said this I am a terrific fan of his books, and the Dirk Pitt series. Without giving away elements of the plot, I will say that this book weaves elements of \\"modern\\" science fiction together with American Patriotism and Indiana Jones style discoveries and action. If you are a fan of the books then you will understand Cussler's over-the-top plots, but I enjoy these books in much the same way as I do a modern action-adventure movie. Yes, it's way to much, but sometimes that's all you're in the mood for. Also just to note this novel was written in 1986 so some elements in relation to the cold war are dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action adventure","review":"Another Dirk Pitt novel that entertains with lively dialogue and white knuckled adventure.

The main point I liked about Cyclops was the moon colony idea and a massive covert space conspiracy surrounding it. A highly imaginative plotline indeed.

Tom Selleck is always appealing as an actor, and co-star Cynthia Rhodes is as gorgeous as ever as Selleck's partner in this 80s robot flick. This film was made when Personal Computers and the possibility of home robots (which never panned out) were all the rage. Selleck and Rhodes are cops specializing in robots that malfunction, possibly hurting people. The premise is a little shaky, but this is science fiction. Someone is trying to make killer robots, and therein lies the plot.With a good cast and a good writer-director (Michael Crichton, no less) one would expect that this film would be excellent. Instead, it is only OK, and it is hard to put one's finger on why. Perhaps it lacks the intensity of say, \\"Blade Runner\\" or similar serious Sci Fi films.

Gene Simmons is a maniacal inventor tech terrorist, Kirstie Alley (thin and still a looker!) is his girlfriend, Selleck is a tech guru cop with some major phobias out to catch Luther (Simmons) in this dark futuristic mystery.The robot spiders freaked me out as a kid and Cynthia Rhodes was always easy on the eyes. The plot about a microchip smart weapon was clever for its time, and Simmons easily falls into the role of a major twerp!The only part of the movie that is a little thin is all the side storylines in between the major plot trying to establish Ramsay's (Selleck's) job description and back story.Great overall cheap fare...watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the drums","review":"This is an angry, angry album, and that's a good thing.

In addition, Bair has mined the archives to give a fair-minded appraisal of Jung&#65533;s complex and compromising relation to the Nazis and, above all, what it meant for Jung to be Swiss.

Jackie was the first black baseball player to play baseball. Joey is the smart one and the funny one. The Bat Boy is crazy and he hates black people. The plot is Joey travels through time to meet Jackie Robinson. He wants to get as many baseball cards as he can so his dad can sell them. I would recommend this book to my that play baseball. I've read a lot of good books before, but this book honestly was one of the best.

Though I personally disagree with the author on his overall approach and a few major points I still find it mostly helpful. This commentary is not too technical and will work for most serious students of the Bible, pastors and for most Bible College students. It provides good ideas for preaching and preparing Bible studies. The author presents limited perspectives, but then it is somewhat brief and there is no room to go too deep into each point. It is not your Matthew Henry, and brand new Christians will probably find it too advanced.

You'll have to make allowance for her ego, and some of her opinions are hard to take. For example, I've read only one Mickey Spillane story; perhaps if I'd read more, I might agree with her that he's a great writer, but I doubt it.You will receive, though, quite a lot of advice from someone who made her name as a writer, and much of it is good.

She croons here with only a bass and guitar, and although at first I was skeptical, I soon became delighted and began to marvel at the control she so easily exhibits. I'm not a fan by any means of \\"The Sound of Music,\\" but \\"My Favorite Things\\" is handled moodily and in the most sophisticatedly suspended jazz style I've yet heard. This is certainly a marvelously quiet collection for the after-hours, those desperate stretch of hours some of us know at 3 a.m. Sass will keep you more than company. She will warm you more than your flask will. This is a contented collection. A must for any jazz fan and certainly any Vaughan fan.--dan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eleventh Insight: Don't write a book unless you know how to","review":"Redfield's books in a sentence: \\"Suddenly, an orgasmic rush of energy sent me whirling into a new spiritual awakening\\". I'm sorry, but you cannot use the words suddenly, orgasmic, and energy-level 150 times in 10 pages. Redfield's insights may be worthwhile, but I found his rudimentary style of writing to be too distracting to enjoy any of the insights. Although I do admit that the second book was written at a more advanced level than the first, I still find it hard to believe that it became so popular among so many people. Are people really that desperate for spirituality in their lives? If so, they might enjoy a book more along the lines of Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse. At least Hesse knows how to tie a spiritual theme into a novel. One thing is clear, Redfield may have some very inspirational and new-aged theories, but his use of language is atrocious."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tenth Guid","review":"If fear is any part of your life and is creating anxiety for you, I highly recommending this experiential guide as an adjunct to The Tenth Insight.

It is a relatively short work that should fit onto a single CD, and the two other recordings available by Max (Capriccio) and Seeliger (Christophorus) do so. This recording, conducted by Ulrich Stolzel, despite being well under the 80 minute limit is spread onto 2CDs - for no discernable reason. Of the three recordings Max would be preferred by those wanting period instruments, Seeliger for those preferring a more \\"churchy\\" choir sound. Stolzel falls between these two stools. On instrumental playing and soloists it is again Max who wins the laurels.Other recordings by Stolzel than can be more warmly recommended are his two CDs of Telemann cantatas that have recently been reissued in a budget 3CD box along with Max's recording of a Telemann Missa Brevis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent Value","review":"Hard to find any fault with this watch or any contemporary Zodiac product.

It will touch the reader, and they will see God through Mr. Dyess' words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author shows \\"the fields are ripe for harvest.\\"","review":"Mr. Dyess describes how God uses his everyday experiences to bring people to a personal relationship with Him.

I applaud her for getting through some bad times and sharing them with the public. But life story and music are 2 different things. This is my least liked CD of hers. Mary tends to scream through songs when she is trying to get a point across and it takes away from her vocal ability. Also I am ready for her to make some \\"happy\\" songs. I also have a problem with the message young teenage girls will get from her song \\"Father in you\\". Daddy is acceptable to me as a term of endearment but we already have too many girls trying to replace \\"daddy's\\" with boyfriends and husbands.My friends \\"raved\\" about the CD.

But, this cd, like so many others fools me with one or two songs I just can't get enough of put on a cd that I consider largely forgettable.The track \\"I Found My Everything\\" is a haunting, soulful, masterpiece of a song that is reminscent of the days of Aretha Franklin in the late 60s and 70s. NO one will be unmoved listening to this song. It is a superb in its souring vocals, short and focused background singing, and amazingly expansive instrumentation.

Just looking at the title, people may think that this is a dismal album, but truth be told, it's not. Each and every song has a lesson earned and learned.

Blige's great career. Ms. Blige's singing has gained a sense of maturity and she inhabits the songs with feel of someone who has experienced life's ups and downs and is comfortable singing about both. Several of the songs are directed at her new husband, producer Kendu Isaacs. The best is \\"Baggage\\" where she apologizes for bringing all her emotional drama to the relationship and \\"Father In You\\" is superb classic soul where Ms. Blige thanks her husband for the ways he has made up for her absent father. \\"Good Woman Down\\" she plays the role of mentor to young woman who went through the troubles she went through. \\"I Found My Everything\\" is a straight-up anthem with an exuberant vocal. There are virtually no missteps outside of her cover of U2's \\"One\\" which drags on a bit too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakthrough, Epiphany, Shining Moment","review":"Mary did an excellent job with this CD. I agree with other reviewers that this is one of her best CD's. I can truly relate to the song \\"Father In You\\" and am thankful that someone expressed the feelings of growing up not being a Daddy's Girl and how painful it is and how not having a father in your life can make a dramatic difference on how you see the world. On \\"Baggage\\" she is stating how baggage can bring you down and can place your relationship in turmoil if you aren't careful. The blazing track \\"Be Without You\\" truly touches your heart especially if you are or have been in love. \\"I Found My Everything\\" is another beautiful song about love.

But since I got an early copy, I was able to spend some time over the weekend listening to it. I'm glad I did - with repeat listens, the album starts to sink in. It's a much more layered set of songs with detailed and complicated arrangements... and after hearing it since 12/16, I think it's the best album since My Life. It's strong throughout and, as one reviewer mentioned, her voice keeps getting stronger and more expressive. After the dull albums Love & Life, No More Drama and (sorry!) Mary, this is a very welcome return. Any fan of soul/r&b should pick this up. Give yourself time to absorb it - you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no just shut up","review":"this cd was so boring i listend to the whole thing and fell asleep while listening to it um now it was boaring but some songs are good so my advice is buy it but wait till the price go down cuase like i alwys say you will be wastin you money"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars just for effort","review":"Mary J. Blige's album is a good album if your a girl and went through what she did. But I bought this album because of Be Without You and because I wanted to support her but when i listened to it i was disappointed to the fullest. The only good songs one the album is Be Without You and No More Crying. The c.d is really a autobiography with music. It's one of those albums that you know it's good but you dont like it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, at least it was better than \\"Love & Life\\"....","review":"Yeah, go on. Give me an unhelpful vote.But this album as a whole is very average. While it's certainly well-produced; most of the songs DO, as another reviewer pointed out, sound the same; the lyrics are mostly weak, and the melodies are virtually non-existant. The only songs I really like on here are \\"I Found My Everything\\" and \\"One\\" (a great song, even though I don't really like U2); while \\"Good Woman Down\\", \\"Baggage\\", \\"Be Without You\\" and \\"About You\\" are OK.(which seems like a lot when you write it all down, but think about it; 6 good/ok songs on an album with 16 tracks?)But the rest of the songs on here either send me to sleep; or are really unlistenable (\\"Enough Cryin\\" and \\"MJB Da MVP\\" are awful).Maybe if Mary had just released the 10 best songs here as \\"The Breakthrough\\" I'd have given it 3 stars; but the fact is, with all the filler here; unless you're a HUGE MJB fan, you probably don't want this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I was wrong about only looks matter","review":"And Mary J. Blige said, \\"Hey I can be as generic as any other female r&b singer on the radio!\\" On a side note, what jacka** told her she was fine? Don't you long for the good old days when she always wore shades & kept her body covered?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Screech!","review":"The production by Jam and Lewis is grand. I'm a certainly a fan of the instrumentation on this LP. However, Blige's voice is simply screeching. Her vocals seem to induce my brain to want to abuse myself.

Before I listened to it, I thought her arrangement of the songs was bad, because she couldn't use her singles to cover up any of her bad songs. The truth is that there weren't any bad songs on her album. All of her songs were good, except for a couple that were okay. Her album was very consistent and I like how she was able to keep me interested in her album, despite it being 16 songs. The album was good. The only thing I thought was wrong with the album is that her singles are overplayed, which makes it easy for you to get tired of songs like: \\"Be without you\\" or \\"enough cryin.\\"Her only single that isn't played too much is \\"One\\", which is a cover song from U2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brokenthrough","review":"MJ has come full circle.

The CD must be in the drive for the software to work. In spite of advanced efforts to work around this problem, I was not able to. The game interaction is very slow and requires a mouse click or a key stroke for every action which is then followed by a delay. Bets are cumbersome to change. If you leave the sound on the game is even slower. It only has a maximum of four decks which is not realistic for most of today's casinos if you want such a game to practice.

Our heroine, Alice Nestleton is a off-off Boradway actress, and tries to discover why her old friend was brutally murdered. Soon, she discovers it's connected to horse racing.

This cooking DVD defies the \\"rabbit food\\" stereotypes usually geared towards vegan/vegetarian diets and is accompanied by a hardcore soundtrack!

The sound was incredible, and you could hear nuances of the musicians' playing that didn't come through on vinyl.This was Joan Baez's debut album on A&M; Records, and it is a beaut. Long out-of-print on CD, all cuts are now available on \\"The Complete A&M; Recordings\\" collection. \\"Prison Trilogy,\\" which opens the album, remains one of Baez's strongest original songs (the song was also recorded by Jeffrey Shurtleff on his A&M; album \\"State Farm\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"granddaughter loves pigs","review":"I purchased this toy because my granddaughter loves pigs.

We don't see her become her own woman. Some of the things Clint made her do seemed like torture for her after her abusive husband.

There were too many pages written for 1 scene, and I did not feel that Clint and Jenna had the same chemistry that Asa and Elizabeth had or Cougar and Mara from the other Promises books."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent introduction into Ayurveda","review":"I have been really pleased with the Ayurvedic Cookbook! It gives an excellent introduction into Ayurvedic nutritional theory, along with a self-exam so that you may determine your Dosha. There is a great index in the back which lists all foods according to their Dosha which makes menu planning easier. For the most part, the recipes are tasty and easy to prepare. You may find it difficult, however to locate some of the unique Indian spices and food items, especially if you are not living in a large metropolitan area. I did not care for some of the recipes as they were a little strange to my taste, but most were excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors in the recipes","review":"As with her book, Ayurvedic Cooking for Westerners, there are recipes with glaring errors in them in this book. In many cases proportions are off, there is too much liquid in the recipe or not enough. Not so serious for kichadis or curries, but for some of the desserts and snacks, such errors create a disastrous mess. When trying new recipes from this book I always have a pencil nearby so that I can note bad recipes. The book is an excellent reference for eating for your dosha and there are some recipes that are very good. But beware of the bad ones! Less experienced cooks might find it frustrating to cook from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful healthy cookbook","review":"This cookbook really explains why foods affect people differently and shows how, with delicious recipes, to balance yourself with many healthy Indian style dishes. So far I have tried the 15 min veg curry, Plain indian rice, Veg Barley soup, sesame sweeties and curried parsnips and carrots. Every recipe has been delicious - my son 11 is a big curry fan now.

All three novellas here are just wonderful. I think my favorite is probably \\"The Wooden Anniversary\\" because of the ending. I usually don't bother writing reviews for Amazon because they seem to just go down a black hole. However this ([...]) article about white (straight) male writers being disproportionately reviewed in the NY Times Book Review made me want to save a gay book from the gutter. Don't get me wrong, if you haven't read Armistead Maupin's Tales of the city, do that first, but this book is a wonderful gem that captures people with so much depth. IMHO, a good story implies that there's so much more to the story than is said, and that definitely happens here. However, as I recall, the sex-stuff might ick out the more squeamish, but I think whether you find the sex stuff icky or sticky, you won't find it dull. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb writing - a little too foreign for a straight person.","review":"I may be the only straight woman who has read this book, but I enjoyed Leavitt's writing so much in Family Dancing that I read Arkansas too. I was not disappointed - his writing is still wonderful, although the graphic sex was a little uncomfortable for me -- I don't remember that much sex in Family Dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arkansas","review":"I've read almost every novel and short story collection that Leavitt has written. This one was a disappointment on the whole. The most affecting story was Saturn Street. The Term Paper Artist was the wish fulfillment of a middle aged gay intellectual. The Wooden Anniversary was a real mishmash. I really think that Nathan and Celia should take a vow of silence by now.Leavitt always can conjure up lots of heat. In his best work like Lost Language of the Cranes and Equal Affections, he can create touching characters and emotionally involving plots. I do hope that he has gotten his rocks off in Arkansas and goes on from here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Literary writing has gotten prententious, contrived and politically correct since the 1960's; but--even though you could count on literary writers being pathetically literary conformists--you could also count on the writing being good. But, not only does this collection have all the pitfalls of politically correct literary fiction, it is terribly written! When reading THE TERM PAPER ARTIST, I admit to being turned off by some of the gay sex scenes, but what disgusted me more was the horrendous writing! A lot of it read like a novella written by, not only a 15 year old, but a 15 year old without talent! Dreadful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read in the gay fiction genre","review":"While David Leavitt comes highly recommended, I was not impressed. \\"Arkansas\\" is my only experience with his writing and I can't help but wonder what the fuss is about. The teasing \\"The Term Paper Artist,\\" where Leavitt creates a fictional unscrupulous version of himself, is nothing more than a soft-core wank job. Hunky straight college boys dropping their drawers for a nerd that writes them (gay-positive) term papers? Puh-leeze! Sounds like something out of Blueboy. And the sentimental \\"Saturn Street,\\" where a man falls in love with the AIDS patient he is delivering lunch to, is just too cliched. My advice: if you HAVE to read this book, check it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars from me - but the computer demanded one!","review":"I've spent my life reading books and I have to admit to sending this book to the trash can.There is nothing whatsoever of merit in the words, the themes, or the content. What was Mr. Leavitt thinking of ... perhaps he should have waited until he had something to say. I am at a total loss to understand why the minutiae of sexual addiction could be of interest to anyone. I am not a prude, but for heaven's sake, don't give the gay community a bad name by producing such trashy perversion as \\"normal\\". It's doing those people a gross injustice.

Reasons to wear your frownies.....Alcohol dilates small blood vessels in skin, increasing blood flow near skin's surface.

I don't find their pseudo-scientific explanation of how they work very convincing, but despite all this, I do think they help smooth out the lines between my brows. If nothing else, they at least prevent it from worsening while I'm sleeping.The effect is somewhat temporary and gradual, but it does work. It's not as quick (or as expensive!) as Botox, but in some ways it's actually better. Botox temporarily paralyzes an area so you get kind of a weird frozen face.

I don't find them uncomfortable, I rip them off in the morning with ease without wetting them. They are simple. Sometimes the best things in life are the simplest things, this isn't rocket science....it isolates the muscles so they cannot contract at night thus giving you 8-9 hours free of muscle contraction. Of course Botox would work better but for the cost and the fact that you aren't pumping toxins into your body with possible side effects....I say use the frownies.

Wish I could have my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The Frownie patches were sent to me as a gift. They are very uncomfortable to wear overnight, as recommended. The paper is stiff and hard at the edges so it pokes your skin, and so far, have not shown any results. There's no way you can stretch your skin and think that a gluey paper will hold a wrinkle till it disappears. I can make my own wrinkle mask for a lot less money out of natural ingredients that is good for your skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"Would not recommend these! Have been using them every night for about a month and they don't work at all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frownies made me frown","review":"I don't get how these things work, they are basically just kraft paper perforated into triangles with glue on the one side. Don't waste your money on these things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time","review":"I am disappointed in this product. It does nothing for my frown lines. I guess the only thing that really works is botox or face lift.I would not recommend this product to anyone. I guess like the old saying says if it sounds to good to be true it usually is. I feel duped."},{"rating":"1","title":"my skin hated it","review":"Ihave used this for about a week. I now have \\"expression lines\\" and a red spot of irritated skin on my forehead. \\"fail\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"not a magical, overnight cure but there IS a difference","review":"A friend of mine tried these and sweared that they worked, so decided to give them a try on those dreaded \\"angry lines\\" between my eyes. I was honestly surprised & pleased to see that the lines weren't as bad as usual, when I woke up the night after first trying them. Usually, upon waking, those lines are much deeper and then smooth out a little bit during the day, but it never occurred to me that sleeping was making them worse, more so than just day to day.I can see how these would take a commitment, they only really seem to do good the day after you've worn them over night. But I HATE those lines, so I'll take what little (natural) difference I can get. They do also take a little practice to get them to stay on, but I haven't had any trouble since the second time. I think I can even let my bangs grow out now! I've always kept them just to hide those lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticks to head- no visible difference","review":"I can see how MAYBE this product works for a person with very very deep wrinkles... using this every night may lift some of the indentations. I have very minor forehead wrinkles and this product does absolutely NOTHING for me. I would suggest not wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frownies","review":"I paid $15 for Frownies... Save your money, buy some mailing tape instead and cut it into small triangles. These are cheap tear off forms of the same thing. You could probably buy the twice the length of the same tape for maybe $3. No go for me... the theory makes sense, but doesn't work like you would think. Scotch tape will do the same if you're diligent enough to wear it every night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money---$$$","review":"I bought the frownies made for use on the forehead, and I agree with the previous posters-THEY ARE NOTHING MORE THAN PACKING TAPE!! I tried them for a month, and they did relax the muscles so that my lines weren't as deep, but I stopped using them for a week and my face returned to its previous state. Just for kicks, I put scotch tape on my face for a few weeks, and got THE SAME RESULTS I DID WITH FROWNIES."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I can say is, \\"OUCH!\\"","review":"I followed the directions, and found them difficult to shape to the area I was placing it then holding it until it dried. The next morning I again followed the directions for removing it, and it is NOT as simple as described. It hurt like rip and left the tender skin red and irritated. Skin that I'm sure is not supposed to be stretched like that. lol I don't know if I have a pea sized head or if I put too much water, etc. Did not work for me. I did not wake up looking like a movie star. Quite the contrary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Has Decreased","review":"My first box worked great: lessened forehead furrows temporarily, stayed on all night, felt like really firm construction paper, were difficult to remove. I would have to wet and slowly peel to remove. Second box: didnt help much bc they often came off, felt flimsy. I have to glue 3 together to get the same effect. Very disappointed. I think company changed paper and glue. I wont continue to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"brown package tape","review":"WOW.....this is seriously the biggest ripoff ! This is nothing but cut up pieces of brown packaging tape (the kind UPS uses when send the box). I did give it a try and then went to the local hardware store to buy a roll of brown paper tape....guess what, it worked the same as \\"Frownies\\" as was a lot cheaper. Look at the box ... is there anything to describe what the \\"magic ingredient\\" is? Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"I wasn't sure if I would like the frownies, but based on other reviews I wanted to go ahead and give it a try. I'm pleasantly surprised with the results. Of course, its not magic and doesn't erase what is there; however, I do feel that my 11's are not getting any worse during the night and when I peel the frownie off in the morning, I don't see any wrinkles between my eyes!! What a great sight! LOL Of course, the 11s slowly creep back -- but, I will continue to use these for now and see what happens!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them, they seriously work","review":"I love Frownies. I dont' find them difficult to apply or uncomfortable, and they definitely make the lines between my eyes go away. One thing I've learned is that they don't stick as well if I apply them right after I put on my nighttime moisturizer--just have to wait 10-15 min. Love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT Just Packing Paper!","review":"I've been using these between my eyes for the 11 that showed up about a year ago (I'm 53, so I guess I've been lucky until now). Yes, they feel like packing paper, but they've got something else in them cause after they dry on your skin, they feel VERY hard, which probably explains why they work. I've used them nightly for about 2 weeks now, and the 11 is starting to disappear. You definitely should wear them overnight. They're comfortable and stay on all night.I also tried the ones for around the mouth, but haven't seen any results. This is probably because, after they dry, they're also very hard and you can't open your mouth. I must talk in my sleep because I always wake up and find that both pieces have fallen off my face!I'm sticking with just eliminating the 11 between my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Put it this way - I feel like an idiot for buying these. Some folks have compared them to packing tape - but packing tape would probably work better because these have to be wet to make the glue stick, and even then it doesn't stick very well. It's basically brown paper with glue on the back to lick-and-stick. AND the pre-cut shapes aren't even that good for the area between your eyes (I found them quite wide, and I think I have a relatively normal face).Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Product!!!","review":"I can't believe how those people possibly gave 4 or 5 stars on this product. I ordered it because 77 people gave good reviews. Please don't buy it. It's really nothing more than packing tape except for the color. I strongly agree with TruthSeeker's review.She mentioned exactly what I wanted to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GREAT PURCHASE","review":"I purchased the frownies and tried them a few times. I don't like how they feel and I didn't see much of a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"wast of money..","review":"idea maybe good but one of the worst product i ever ordered from amazon..they r like paper strips,wet it and stick it on your wrinckle. they dont even stick, corners pops up and get hard on skin. its like i use glued paper on my face.. taking it off is hard and after all this no good result..really what a wast. i should have send it back but i was traveling and did not get time to return.."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts a little","review":"The patches are stiff and uncomfortable. I don't like how you have to wet them before use. I prefer Furlesse. They are a bit more expensive but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really works!!","review":"I have been using Frownies for many years and have always found them useful. They really do keep the frown lines away. I put mine on when I get home from work and keep it on until morning. The frown line between my eyes is hardly noticable when I keep to my regime. So I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product is useful","review":"Frownies really help me to control frowning through the night. This is so important because that is what leads to the eleven lines. They also amazingly retrain the muscels so that you are not squeezing between the eyebrows during the day as much. Go to frownies website to see how that works. I have been using this product for about a month now, and noticed differences in my frowning habit right away, but the line that I had is still there that hasn't gone away yet, don't know if it will. I do recommend it and you get a lot of the little patches so your good for a long time, and its not expensive. Delivery was on time, all in all very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regret buying this product. Does not stay on for more than five minutes...","review":"the product is supposed to be moistened and pressed on, product would not stick on face. I consider this a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"product works well","review":"I like this product, my forehead was smooth when I woke up. Just wish it worked all day. Overall happy with product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not do anything to attenuate lines, in addition is dries my skin and leaves a red mark!","review":"I definitively would not recommend the patches. It is a substandard product. It's uncomfortable and leaves a dry red mark on the skin after removal. In addition, I could not see any improvement in the appearance of the fine lines between my eyes. It was a complete waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"H B Ives 430MB Floor Door Stop","review":"It was and is exactly what I wanted and ordered. The description of the product prior to my purchase was \\"right on\\". I am extremely pleased with the product. It is not a cheap knock-off, but a durable item to prevent a door from opening too far. I use it as a stop alongside of my S_Steel Samsung refrigerator to prevent my patio door latch from \\"smashing into the side of the refrig!\\" It is working very satisfactory. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute candles","review":"I got this as a gift for my sister-in-law who is a huge fan of the Nightmare Before Christmas movie. These candles were very cute and were shipped fast (especially in light of the holiday season). She loved them! My only negative was that the box looked beat up and used but the product was unharmed and in pristine condition. I would have returned since it was a gift but it was so close to Christmas that I kept it. I was a little embarassed about the condition of the packaging but once she saw the candles she didn't care what the box looked like. Overall, very cute and anyone who loves the movie will love this candle set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Water doesn't flow!!!","review":"We got this for our 2 chinchillas so they wouldn't chew through it but it turns out the water doesn't always flow correctly. I'm having to check it constantly. I don't have peace of mind using this water bottle. I will be replacing it as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I' ve had the same problem as many reviewers here: the water bottle stops working. Our pet rats had been without water for days because of it, but thankfully we finally realized that something is wrong. I can't believe that with so many complaints and dead animals, the company still hasn't recalled this bottle. Would never buy anything by \\"Super Pet\\" again, obviously they care much more about their bottom line than about pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, but be careful....","review":"Hi. I bought this bottle a few days ago, and was not happy with it, because at first water was flowing through just fine, but then it stopped. I didn't realize water wasn't coming out until late the next day, and my rats were dehydrated. I played with it, until water flowed again, but it stopped shortly after. I figured out that if the bottle is filled above the notch for the springy holder, a vaccuum is created, which holds the water back. Please be sure that the bottle is not over-filled. I like this water bottle, again. It was a rollercoaster ride, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"I just finished viewing the DVD. It just goes over the main topics equivalent to just reading the topics of the chapters and moving on. If you really want to pass this test you need to read the book, so if you like a HTML version e-book feel free to buy,otherwise it is cheaper to purchase the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"tacky, cheap journal","review":"I was misled by the information on the Amazon website regarding this product. By the image and the product information that I saw I was under the impression that it was a beautiful leather-bound journal. However the actual product is far from that. The cover is flimsy cardboard on which has been printed a faux leather-look cover. the pages are nothing special either. if you're looking for a classy journal to spill your thoughts and memories into skip this one.

The venue is beautiful and the way in which it was filmed will make repeated viewings a joy every time.The backstage filming extras allows us to embrace this gracious superstar and his wonderful sense of humor. Here is a young man who's love for entertaining gives him an added dimension unheard of in today's music world.Chris Botti's duet with Mr. Buble is showstopping and his duet with the beautiful and talented Italian songstress Pausini a high light.For once a live cd/dvd's production actually allows us to feel like he's entertaining us in our living rooms.Fantabulous and I would recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Michael Buble is one of the most talent artists out there. His arrangements of the standards are great, and he is giving new life to this wonderful music and bringing it to a whole new generation.

So, the CD's easily come loose and get scratched. don't by this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bubbling for Buble","review":"Michael Buble is going down hill fast. Each CD is a repeat of the same TRITE material and in a word \\"BORING\\". He needs to learn some new standards. I was once excited about his talent, now I am blase\`. Oh you say the DVD makes it worth it. I saw the program on PBS so the DVD was a repeat. His first CD was also with a DVD. The CD is a re-hash of the same tired songs he has done since his first CD. Totally Buble was a god send compared to the stuff he has since put out. NOT IMPRESSED, maybe he should go back to scaling fish in Canada. GET SOME NEW MATERIAL! If by chance you to are tired of Michael, Try Tony DeSare He has a wonderful voice, can play piano, and writes his on material some of which will become standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank must be turning in his grave...","review":"I've been listening to Frank Sinatra for years, and this kind of stuff just leaves me cold - I'd rather here the man himself...Or, for a completely different take on the material, someone with a completely original approach like Shamus Dark, and his album \\"Songs For Suicidal Lovers\\", which sounds like nothing I've heard before, whilst staying true to the fantastic songs.

God bless them..buy this keepsake"},{"rating":"2","title":"The CD was remarkable, the DVD was entertaining!","review":"I was first introduced to the wonderful talents of Michael Buble while I was looking for the song \\"Sway\\" on iTunes. Ever since, I've been hooked to Mr. Buble's music.Michael Buble's performance thoughout the DVD is downright remarkable. He performed the songs that can be found on the CD as well as a few surprises here and there. Somewhere after track 10 on the DVD, Buble performs a cover edition of Maroon 5's \\"This Love\\". I'm a huge Maroon 5 fan and Michael's performance was hillarious when he made up words to the rest of the song because he didn't know (or remember) them.Anyway, if you're looking for a glimpse of what the atmosphere at a Michael Buble concert is like, check out this DVD. It takes place at what seems to be a classy venue and the people in the DVD have so much fun dancing and singing to his popular songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating -- over and over and over and over..........","review":"From the first moment I heard a Michael Buble tune I was hooked.

His timing and showmanship are only bettered by his singing which is heavenly.Fast or slow, happy or sad, Michael B. sings each song so well it has to be heard to be appreciated. Amazingly talented he is.The extra's are the added treat and include Chris Botti's fabulous horn in a duet with M.B.Today in my car I played the live cd over and over and just wished there was more where that came from. Charlie Chaplin's Smile is so good, it starts slow and BANG - it's just swinging as only Buble' can do.I'm buying tickets to his upcoming Las Vegas shows -- I've got to hear more and soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Buble - CD is great but the DVD performance is Busted!","review":"Please understand that I normally enjoy MB and while I enjoyed this show; it was not the liveliest.

The CD is O.K. I really only like about 3 songs on the CD. I think he tries to imitate Sinatra too much, and then goes overboard when he attempts his own style. Amazon delivered promptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Buble","review":"I hated this dvd. The only reason I gave it two stars is because when he is singing it's great. I was very disappointed that it didn't have a song menu so you could jump from song to song. It was unbearable to listen to his banter with the audience/camera man. Too immature! I would have been fine if he were not trying to be so cutsey. Seems like he's full of himself. Would not recommend it for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinatra at his worst","review":"I love early Sinatra. Not the stuff with Harry James, which is mediocre, but the early stuff with Tommy Dorsey, which is great. Later, Sinatra lost his voice to alcohol, cigarettes, and general dissipation, and adopted a style that attempted (not very successfully) to disguise the fact that he could no longer sing. Buble imitates the later Sinatra, after he could no longer sing. Maybe Buble can sing. I've listened to several whole albums, in the snippets provided by Amazon, and I'm sorry to say, not one track provides any evidence that he can sing at all, unlike early Sinatra. So if you actually like Sinatra, post voice, you might actually like Buble. But if you liked the earlier warm, intimate, sincere Sinatra sound, you'll hate Buble, as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUBBLES IN THE AIR","review":"ABSOLUTELY GREAT!

It was very obvious that this young man's talents would bring him far. My wife and I were very fortunate to see him in person at the Folly Theater in Kansas City approximately 18 months ago and our high esteem for Michael was solidified in granite --- we would be fans of his for life.

It will give you the impetus to seek out and attend one of his live performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely awesome","review":"The CD hasn't left my car player since I bought it and I could watch the DVD every day. What an awesome performer Mr. Buble is. His voice is just incredibly smooth and flawless.

It gets right down to business with numerous (and accurate) tables, diagrams and screen shots. This book will teach you everything you need to know about troubleshooting TCP/IP.

The content is most useful.The book is well thought out, and well organized. I particularly appreciate the packet by packet explanations and real world troubleshooting examples.

What makes this release so great is that Luke Jenner really went the extra mile to show every bit of his sassy and surprisingly rangy voice. The music is more refined and has much better sound quality, coinciding no doubt with their growing popularity. So while the album's completion took much longer than expected, it was well worth the wait. This CD is all about making anyone who hears have the unshakable urge to get up and dance. It delivers on its intent with funky bass riffs, incredible vocals, great dance beats and more cowbell then you will ever know what to do with. This album is worth every penny of your money; you will be not be disappointed. Lookout for tracks 1,3,4 and 6; they are some of the Rapture's best work to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rapture still rocks!","review":"\\"Echoes\\" was a great record, but \\"Pieces Of The People We Love\\" looks more open minded and more diverse.

Too bad though; I was hoping it would be worth real money."},{"rating":"1","title":"soulless","review":"It's incredible how a band with so much potential and a great debut could follow it up with such a dud. There is close to nothing capitvating or engaging on this record.

I don't recall the last time I put a book down.If you're interested in other period yarns written from the American point of view, check out \\"The Revolution at Sea\\" novels by James L. Nelson.

This tries to take advantage of the Bolitho, Ramage, etc genre but places it in the new US Navy, 1790-1800. The verbage is silted and the situations illogical.

Trumpet lines in 3rds, mandolins, acoustic guitars, and percussion fills this record. And most of it is pretty good. It also contains a bit of jazz with \\"Desafinado\\" (where Alpert trades solos with marimba player Julius Wechter) and \\"Crawfish\\", which has Herb playing a hot muted trumpet solo. \\"Limbo Rock\\" is calypso romp. \\"Never On Sunday\\" is beautifully arranged.

A very good start for Herb and the TJB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back - don't bother ordering it","review":"First, I really don't take the time to write reviews unless something is either really horrible or really awesome about the product. This dartboard arrived damaged at the corners, the pine frame evidently bangs/dings up fairly easy due to its poor construction. the backing is medium density fiberboard (MDF) which is poorly mounted to the pine frame with additional mdf shims. The pine frame and mdf is all fastened with glorified staples. its light, its cheap, but its also poorly constructed so we didn't even try to hang it on the wall. Once we opened the box, we knew it should be sent back. Guess that's what you get for one of the cheapest backboards out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"Its shown with a natural wood trim but the item arrived with a very poor blotchy medium brown stain.

Low quality, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's made out to be.","review":"I have had read a lot of review about this movie but frankly I was disappointed.

Horrible effects. Dont believe the hype.","review":"I heard about this flick years ago but at the time it was an obscene cost to buy.So finally I looked and found just 2 weeks ago. Wow what trash.I dont know how anyone could be shocked or upset after watching.The bodies were fake as hell. In no way looked real. Only one body that of a man with a Italian stash, but you will see no actual cutting was near this guy, just clever film cutting.I was expecting awesome effects but this looks beyond trash. Maybe this was cool back in the 80's when the crap was filmed but this stands to be more of a joke than anything. Right down to the horrible dog at the start of this crap.Even when he was humping the body, keep your hands to your sides and save the paper towles, if thats your kind of thing.

There is no value to this film at all. The plot is weak (if you can call it a plot), the effects are disturbing but still lame. I've got to say if you watch this film and enjoy it, there is something wrong with you in the head. I can understand wanting to see a gorey movie, but this film goes beyond gore. The entire story is about a guy mutilating a dead female body and having sex with it (it is very graphic). There you go! That's 30 minutes of your life! I want my 30 minutes back! I am boycotting this film based on it being one of the worst films ever made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done extreme horror","review":"Aftermath is the best known of the 3 short films here. An interesting and artistic treatment of extreme subject matter. If you are a fan of hardcore horror this is a must but definitely not for the casual horror fan.Awakening is Cerda's student film.

The story involves Curtis (played by Conroe Brooks) getting back into the drug game after spending several years in prison. To make matters worse, he has to deal with a dealer he double-crossed, other vengeful dealers, and shifty women.The story is unoriginal, and the acting is downright terrible. The film is written and directed by Paul Wynne, whose portfolio includes a number of other low-budget movies that went straight to video.The only reason why I gave the movie two stars instead of one is because of the decent comedic performance by Warren, Curtis' trusty sidekick. The irony is that I can't recommend the actor, because he had his name replaced with a pseudonym in the film's credits out of embarrassment. The only thing I like about this movie is that it's so bad, it's intentionally entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuart knows how to write a Rake.......","review":"Anne Stuart has been writing romances for some time and it shows. The Devil's Waltz was a intelligent, witty and emotional Regency romance.Some may not \\"get\\" the hero of the story, and think he's a jerk. That's because he IS a jerk and is meant to be that way. Stuart writes a TRUE rake.Not a slightly disillusioned hero that really wants to be a good guy. Instead, he's a true cad-womanizing, stealing, killing, blackmail-you name it, he's done it. He's made many enemies and has very few true friends. He's terrible, has his reasons to be terrible, and is desperately in need of something good in his life. But Anne Stuart realizes that someone has to love these guys too, and it's takes a no nonsense heroine like Annaliese to tame the rake and put him in his place-at her side.Adventuresome, dramatic, sensual and a happy ending-what more could you want?4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really a surprise...","review":"Actually, this is new only to some sectors of the English-speaking canon, and its popularization in English-speaking countries. The rest of the world has clearly always known that: a)Greek (\\"Byzantine\\") novels, as well as the works of Lucian and Apuleius hold the seeds of the modern novel; b) the Italian novella established some of its canonic structural characteristics, and c) Cervantes and the Spanish picaresque did the same thing as Richardson, Defoe, Sterne, and Fielding, only 100 years before them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was published????!","review":"This is one of the most presumptious and arrogant works I have ever had to read. Doody's arguments are poorly presented, and the reader gets lost in her difficult, convoluted, circular explanations. The grammar and usage mistakes (fragments, run-on sentences and comma splices) detract from the overall message of the book. The topic is interesting, until you try to follow Doody through her presentation. Questions are posed, and if the reader expects an answer one is DISAPPOINTED. The explanation of the tropes of a novel make several unbending assumptions, and overreach the evidence. Not worth the money...and if it required reading for a class I am very sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"EINS ZVEIN POLIZEI","review":"I JUST WNAT TO HEAR IT FOR A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I HAVE LONG TIME THAT I HA NOT HEAR IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware - only a single Mighty Mouse episode on DVD!","review":"Although the cover picture and the title of this DVD might lead you to believe that there is a lot of Might Mouse material on it, the truth is that only the very first cartoon (Wolf-Wolf) is a Mighty Mouse episode which lasts only a couple of minutes.

Clark, this was worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Brainer","review":"A friend tipped me off to Clark's radio show which I listen to over the net since I live in a small town in California. I was a bit skeptical, but once I began listening I couldn't stop. The best thing about Clark Howard is his realistic view on money and purchasing. He understands \\"deals\\", but more importantly he understands \\"value\\". We all know those people who will do anything to find deals regardless of value. I'm buying two copies of this book, one for myself and one for the friend who told me about Clark Howard. I recommend you buy it, you'll feel better about every dollar you spend, and even better about every dollar you save."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Guide!","review":"As an avid listener of the Clark Howard radio program, I found Get Clark Smart a must read!

The Knife Feels Like Justice, is a big let down. I bought the cd, not knowing what I was going to get, and what I got was a disappointment. The songs have a good beat, but the vocals and the material, is lacking. There are some descent songs on board, the title track, Chains Around Your Heart, and Bobby's Back.

Noel Langley's story of Desbarollda is wonderfully illustrated by Edward Ardizzone. I really like Ardizzone's mice. As with the best children's books, the story is enjoyable for the adults reading it aloud, as well as the children listening to it.

I haven't seen it in years! but I love it, mainly because of Dominique Swain! but can someone explain why it's so damn expensive??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blake Nelson was robbed!","review":"As when usually happens when those Hollywood people make a book into a movie, everything the author tried to get across in his work was changed, compartmentalized, and sugar-coated. I realize it's difficult to capture 1/100th of the essence of a TREMENDOUS novel (in 2 hours, no less), and I give this movie 2 stars for trying. If you really liked this movie, read the book, because they changed all the characters in the movie, and it lasts for 3 years of Andrea's life. (We are talking The Catcher in the Rye for teen girls.) If you already read the book (and REALLY loved it), but have not seen the movie, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I did not know until I read these reviews that this is based on a novel, and perhaps if you've read the story, you can get more from this. But it does not stand as a movie on its own. Absolutely awful. Apart from Swain, the acting is terrible, the dialogue cliched and the characters uninteresting. Tara Reid's character is unwatchable. It operates on a very thin premise, that is further weakened by a lack of real humour or intelligence. The concluding events are sudden and out of place and clearly an ill attempt at creating some shock drama. Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"I recieved this super quick and so so excited that I finally found it!

The book, which reads like a diary, spans several years in Andrea Marr's life. Unfortunately, the movie packs the story into less than a year's time, scraps a good portion of the novel, and leaves many characters, if not all the characters, poorly developed. The story and characters will remind you of My So-Called Life. Andrea and Todd Sparrow, played by Sean Patrick Flannery, are a lot like Angela and Jordan. The movie, however, doesn't match the quality of the show.Dominique Swain is good as Andrea, and the supporting cast, which includes Selma Blair and Tara Reid, is decent, but this movie fails due to bad character development and a choppy story line. Of course, I have read the book so I have trouble reviewing the movie based on it's own merit. If you like this movie, you should definitely read the book, also titled Girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Miscast!","review":"Oh the HUMANITY!...First, the obvious: Tara Reid as Cybill? I don't know who in the film industry owed whom a favor, but it is a mystery how that happened.Secondly, Dominique Swain just didn't act like the Andrea Marr of the book. It seemed like Dominique Swain didn't even read the book before she played Andrea. I also happen to think that she is a very poor/mediocre actress all around, but that's another topic.The movie didn't have any similarities with the \\"feeling\\" of the book, even though the plot was (roughly) similar.Portia DeRossi as Carla? Ummmm.... maybe?Selma Blair as Darcy sort of worked.The only character I felt was well-cast was Todd Sparrow.Anyhow, I re-read the book a few more times since seeing the movie, to try to recapture the feel of the book (and erase the memory of the movie)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book...","review":"Like most films based on books, the book is usually better. In the case of Girl, this is beyond true. The film hardly resembles the raw and truthful book it is based on except for the fact that the characters names are the same, and situations in the book are touched on. Otherwise, it tries too hard to be cool for the teen audience, and gives all the otherwise talented actors terrible dialouge to work with. Read the book...and Andrea will imerge as more than a rock star-groupie, because in the book, she was. She was a little piece of every teenage girl out there. Read the book, skip the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Groupie Flick","review":"If you've ever had a crush on a local, national, or world-wide celebrity...this is the movie for you. Music is important for every day living and this movie proves it. The seductive songs of Todd Sparrow (played by Sean Patrick Flanery) could draw in any one. I give this movie 4 stars. Obsessions are scary but with possession as an option nothing can go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the teenagers of the '90s.","review":"If you were a teenager in the mid-'90s (and enjoyed it), you will probably love this movie and relate to it. It really captures the feel of the grunge era well.If, however, you're one of those people who hates grunge music because it's dark/depressing, you probably can't relate.Since I was in high school from '94-'98, I love Girl. I happened upon it by accident (someone recommended Girl when he actually meant Party Girl), and I was so happy that I did. But I know the time period has a bad reputation. If you loathe Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Candlebox, My So-Called Life, and dyed hair, this movie probably isn't for you.All that said, I'm making my assessment of the movie without having read the book, so if you want a book/movie comparison you'll have to look at other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts me.","review":"I read the book a while back and it is one of my favorite novels. The book was amazing. And while I may be biased, the movie was TERIBBLE. When I first heard about it I was so excited to see it come to life! Then I checked it out and I saw that Tara Reid was playing Cybil. Ewww. I literaly gasped out of horror. Tara is like the anti-Cybil. I'm still horrified. But still, I had hope. Then I saw that Carla was a white blonde and related to Todd (um..Carla was black and cool and definitley not related to Todd). So then I saw it and they left out SO much and changed the plot and Andrea seemed like the typical groupie, which maybe she was but we as an audience want our protaginist to be smart and independent and a little naive and like she was in the book! Not to mention the Color Green songs sucked and what happened to Matthew and Sins of our Fathers? Uhhhhg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I know it's common that the 'book is always better than the movie', but this movie couldn't have done anything but hurt the book.Thank GOD I read the book first or I never would have and would have missed out on an amazing story.The movie cheapens everything that was magical about Blake Nelson's novel and cuts out the parts that they obviously think will travel right over movie-watcher's heads.Read the book please, skip the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THE BOOK","review":"The movie is cute. I am a big fan of Dominique Swain. However, this movie is based on a book by Blake Nelson by the same name. The man who made this film should be shot for what he has done to an amazing book. So many vital parts of Andrea's story are left out of the film. (example: Cybil is gay and shaves her head after a run in with Todd.) All I can say is, if you liked the movie, READ THE BOOK. Learn the real story. Then, write nasty letters to screenwriter telling him what an unforgiveable thing he's done........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh ... I've been there","review":"I gave this 2 stars because I think Dominique Swan is right on - she was the most wonderful Lolita ever - and because as a gal who loves her rock n' rollers I thought this was going to be the greatest movie ever. But, it failed to impress. I was the Dominique Swan character, running after my favorite rock band because I was hopelessly in love with the lead singer and would stop at nothing for him. I've had those nights standing out in the rain or arriving at a show that's canceled because I loved that band so much. And my determination paid off! *Patting myself on the back*But the subplotting lead me to see this as a silly teen movie. The lesbian aspect was tripe, but I realize that were I in her (Dominique's) position at her age I wouldn't understand something like that either. The other characters were shallow, and it wasn't all that swift a story line otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good","review":"I agree with reveiwer Therespollux. I really liked it but I only gave it 4 stars cause at times I thought the movie was ridiculously funny (not in a good way) But I did like the songs (esp Cybil's song and last song that Todd sang and the one at the end of the movie I don't know if it was the same song. )and I wanted to know where to hear or get them if anyone can help please reply to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"I don't know what was wrong with some of these reviewers, but I really enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it a couple years ago. I thought it was really interesting, and it is one of my favorite movies. \\"Girl\\" turned me on to the independent film scene. Of course this movie isn't going to be incredible--it's just an indie. Nonetheless, it was great. I honestly think this is one of Dominique Swain's best movies. I recently watched \\"Dead in the Water\\" and \\"The Smokers\\"--also starring Swain--and they didn't even compare to \\"Girl\\". \\"Girl\\" is so much better. Despite bad reviews on Amazon.com, I strongly recommend at least RENTING this movie. However, I think it is good enough to BUY! It's a must-see for yourself movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl","review":"I absolutely loved this movie! I foresee it to be a cult classic. Dominique Swaine is great in it, as is Sean Patrick Flannery. \\"Todd Sparrow's\\" voice is fantastic, which definitely helps. Tara Reid is in it, and she is absolutely fantastic.

And that is the \\"reality\\" of the music business, its stars and how these \\"stars\\" treat those who love them. Music, and the person who creates it, can affect an individual so much so that the person assumes a role they never envisioned for themself. And the \\"truth\\" Angela finds about the need Todd Sparrow fulfills in her - and the need she fulfills, briefly for Todd, is right on the mark. I found the acting exceptional, especially Dominique Swain and Sean Patrick Flanery in the lead roles. I LOVED the music! Why isn't there a Soundtrack?

Everyone played the parts wonderfully in this flick, especially Tara Reid. Although she never becomes a \\"complete\\" groupie, she does learn much about them and thier motives. She learns about passion, love, and self respect. I just loved how it began with her being so inoccent and her wanting to be someone else. It's kind of an artistic movie and you really can't explain it. So just watch it.

(Esp. great for tiny cramped bathrooms).You'll find they're cheaper than the silver ones you get at walmart, bed bath and beyond, target, etc, but you also get less of a brush and stand.the bottom section looks a bit stupid since it's not totally in proportion to the skinny body of the cleaner, but I suppose to make it more sturdy they needed a bigger circumference for the base.If I didn't have to pay s&h; it would have been well worth it.

It is thoroughly Christian and reminds Mommies to trust in God's sovereignty while equipping them to make educated choices for excellent care of their little blessings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Household Reference","review":"The beginning of this book is my favorite part. Here Mrs. Parker lays out her very balanced philosophy of health care. She also explains, in much detail, and with actual forms, how to keep comprehensive health records for each member of your family. The bulk of the book consists of an ailment-by-ailment listing with lifestyle and supplement recommendations for each ailment. As Mrs. Parker's emphasis is herbal, I personally find the supplement recommendations to be so complex and varied as to be difficult for me to keep up with: I could not possibly stock all of these things in my medicine chest. However, I'm sure it would be of great use if my family came down with anything more serious than a cold (at which point it would be worth tracking down the supplements). All in all, I find this to be handy as a reference, especially in the area of keeping health records, but I would appreciate something simpler as the core of my home health library."},{"rating":"1","title":"1-1/2 stars -- Movies don't get much wacker than this","review":"Morgan (Sean Astin) is a dish washer. Anne (Shannon Elizabeth) is a stripper. They both cross paths and eventually fall in love, and Morgan decides he has to leave because love and commitment scares him that much. Does this even sound remotely interesting to you?If it doesn't, you're right. This movie was made for video and it isn't even worth that. I advise everyone to watch something else. (By the way, has anyone else noticed that Shannon Elizabeth has put a \\"no-nudity\\" clause in recent contracts - and she hasn't worked since?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written, bad acting.","review":"This film failed to capitalize on a good cast and is generally a snooze. Shannon Elizabeth is the one bright spot, though her part is small compared to the two whining dishwashers.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good First Vehicle..but that is about it","review":"Shannon Elizabeth is by far the star of the show in this film. Matthew Lillard was nothing but annoying, and Sean Astin to me was almost as annoying as he was in Rudy. Brian Dennehy, and Richard Moll were about the only other things that kept this film afloat. All too often Astin's character was too transparent, and you constantly cheered for Shannon Elizabeth opposite him. I gave it 4 stars simply because of some nice zingers and fairly well written wit....this was definitely an unpolished film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Inexpensive Conference Phone","review":"I ended up buying a second Polycom phone after having major audio issues while making conference calls at my work in South San Francisco.

My advice is, if you want a book that looks good on your bookself, then this book is for you.

He explained that the alien fed off of his aura and what a feast it must have been! I digress, this book personifies the author. Simply, it is crazy. His idea of government involvement with the aliens in a drug scandal is simply ridiculous and based on nothing but heresay.

Esto se demuestra en saber escoger canciones de otros artistas y hacerlas propias con versiones superiores a las originales (Love Hurts, This Flight Tonight).

I would suggest, if you have to use this only for your dog, check it constantly before taking your dog out to make sure it is fitting correctly. If you go on long walks, check it while walking. If your dog is rowdy, not walking properly with you, then I do not suggest using this as a way to contain your pet. It may loosen too much and the dog might be able to bolt.

Do not expect it to replace a monster corded worm drive saw, but for smaller jobs where setting up extension cords would be a pain in the neck this is just the ticket. By all means use a thin kerf blade like comes with the saw when you get a replacement blade.Milwaukee makes several different 18 volt Li-Ion battery packs. This works with the full sized V18 packs, but not their small compact cousins nor with the new M18 system Milwaukee has recently brought out. I suspect that the reason many V18 compatible tools are available at a deep discount is that Milwaukee is changing its battery pack form factor.Personally I'm thrilled to have this one at a bargain price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough, Durable Cordless Saw.","review":"I Purchased this saw and used it w/ Ni-Cad batteries for a little over 1 year before buying the V18 lithis. Although the lithium battery seems to bring a certain \\"crispness\\" to some of the older tools they appear to bog down & cut out under the heavy load of some tools & this saw is one of them. The tool itself has powered through it's share of tough materials. I was surprised at the power because at 3,200 rpms I felt it was too \\"slow\\" but I was wrong, with quality blades (Freud Avanti & Diablo) it's done the job well, over & over again. Being a left sided blade saw makes it all the more convenient to use as we don't need to lean over the tool to see the cut line. The depth & bevel settings are easy to lock in and the included rip fence is a snap to attach. All in all, imo, it's made to withstand years of professional punishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful but a little heavy","review":"Bought this as an add-on to my Milwaukee 18v hammer drill set. It really completes the cordless set and amplifies the capabilities of being cordless.This saw is very powerful and can cut through a lot more than my older Dewalt. For one thing the blade is much larger at 6.5\\" while the Dewalt was only the odd 5-3/8\\" blade. That size was okay but always was just short of fulfilling the needed cut depth. This size is more conventional and hence usable. The saw itself handles very nicely; especially for right-handers.Cons: It is a little heavy for a cordless so it is harder to use as a \\"trim saw\\". RPM of blade is a little slow so you have to be aware of this so you don't try to jam too much wood through while cutting. But it will eventually get the job done and with the 18 volt battery it will last so you don't have to be so conscious of using up the battery.Bought this at $69 so I can't complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer Board","review":"I ordered this motherboard January 2005 and since I installed it my computer exhibited annoying characteristics, such as slowdowns, degraded graphics and occasional freezes.

The many small details that she notes are particularly noteworthy for a past traveler to Cuba: the lack of toilet seats, the rationing of soap and toilet paper, the constant search for food by the populace,the CDR painted on the cement residential buildings, the Chocolate Factory outside Baracoa, the intimate social activities along the Malecon, the political slogans, the presence of Che Guevara today, the furtive conversations, the marvellous music, the wonderful hopeful spirit of the population.

Even better, she doesn't tell you what she thinks--she tells you what she saw and heard, allowing readers to draw their own conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Enlightening, unbiased,relevant, and entertaining. a great story full of brilliant, humorous characters who display both optimism and cynicism in the same turn of the phrase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"All plastic with metal fan cage.

When I cross-referenced some answers provided with text books and laws, they were not all correct. It was useful to have various subjects in one book to know what to study, but otherwise I would not use it for the actual material presented. I also found that it was not well organized. It seems some others found it to be great, but I scored well on the exam by studying notes, text books, and laws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the money!!","review":"I studied by mostly using this book and scored a 750. I agree that it isn't exhaustive, but it gave me a great idea of what to expect. I like that it isn't this huge, thick text...it kept me from being too overwhelmed, and I was actually able to read the entire thing very quickly. The practice test is helpful as well. If you review your 'best practices' texts, intro class notes, and know your bell curve, you should be fine. As with anything, you can't expect one book to completely prepare you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some helpful information but dated testing advice","review":"I took the praxis exam shortly after I bought the book. My initial impression of the review book was that it appeared dated. After completing the test, my impression held true. This book has very little information in terms of reviewing the questions that will be on the test. It has a copy of an old praxis exam and some review materials.

In comparison to the real exam, the practice test in this book had 4 choices instead 5 (like on the PRAXIS), had such brief, short questions/answers---- a far cry from the real test. I studied for 3 weeks, using this book and NASP Ethics & other School Psych texts, and I was disappointed that I didn't pass. The real exam is lengthy, wordy, more tricky and in-depth than expected. There should be more study guides & \\"real-life\\" practice tests available out there rather than just this book.

I first heard the soundtrack when a roommate of mine played it 5 or 6 years after its release. By the sound of it I thought it was to a film that had something to do with swinging Carnaby Street in London of the mid-1960s. I was floored to found out it was for \\"Butch Cassidy.\\" It already sounded so dated. It was 20 years later that I finally saw the film and I was stunned at how horrible the soundtrack was-- and how horribly \\"Raindrops\\" was shoehorned in. The years have not been kind to this soundtrack and is clearly the worst aspect of this film.

It did work adequately for about 2 1/2 years, but definitely not good for large print jobs. The scanner went first - I am still not sure if it is the software or the scanner itself - but it stopped being able to be used because it froze up the entire computer to where it had to be shut down each and every time I attempted to use it. Then the copier function went. Lastly, the feeder stopped working and I tried everything - including opening up the back and turning it upside down to shake anything that might have gotten stuck in it. All to no avail. So, bottom line - if you need a printer for only two years and don't want to spend much - this could fit the bill.

The tireless jazz archivist Michael Cuscuna (Mosaic Records) thankfully dug out these UA recordings from the early '60s, many of them unreleased, and put them on a Blue Note CD in 1997. McIntyre's writing has a vibe similar to the late, lamented Dolphy. He also played the flute and alto, as Dolphy did. McIntyre's other instrument was the oboe.

He rehashes the same old tired themes he's been writing about for years, and you get the sense he actually wanted the Red Sox to lose so he could promote his pet cause a little more. The reader never gets a sense of the unbridled joy and limitless passion that so defined that season and playoff run, and which is so apparent in other books detailing the magical season. Whatever you may think of the man, the book he has written should be last on the list of anyone looking for an honest account of the 2004 Red Sox.

The fact that the focus is not on the games that every sox fan has already memorized and instead on the background makes it a better book.The players , the front offce are treated as people and their foibles rather than on the images.

And he does a decent job of keeping the \\"curse\\" nonsense in perspective.Shaughnessy can certainly be a cynical Red Sox fan, but frankly we all were until last October. Most of the motorheads trashing this book spend their time listening to or calling into sports radio programs to berate Terry Francona for wearing a sweater too often.The book is a light portrayal of the 2004 season.

In very clear language, Swami Bhaskarananda describes the spiritual concepts that created andsupported Indian civilization for thousands of years. Furthermore, the author dispels many of the standard myths associated with Hinduism. By leading the reader step by step through the fundamental principles ofHinduism, the religion is shown to take on a unifying spirit that is thoroughly accessible for modern times. By filling the gap in the current literature, Swami Bhaskarananda has produced a book that is ideal for introductory courses on Hinduism found in colleges and universities. The author's subsequent book, \\"Meditation, Mind, and Patanjali's Yoga\\", would make an ideal companion. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to Hindu tradition","review":"Swami Bhaskarananda's text offers a fine introduction to some of the key elements of Hinduism in a concise manner that utilizes many different analogies that are very helpful for students. I have used this book in my world religions courses that I teach and students find his discussion of impersonal God or Brahman and personal god with attributes/saguna to be very helpful in understanding the multiplicity of deities in the Hindu tradition.

The book does an excellent job of explaining some of the more abstract ideas and concepts within the Hindu belief. I would recommend this book to those who are only familiar with \\"Western\\" attitudes towards religion, as the author offers insightful analagies that allow comprehension to even the most confused reader. A wonderful overview for the beginner, however, not for those more versed within the Hindu realm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthle$$, but hilarious--a Money Time!!","review":"This book was of no use to me at all.

There is also a front pouch that will hold extra 4-6 AA batteries as well as a thin lithium ion battery.

This is an excellent camera bag for short trips with minimal equipment. The camera compartment is well padded to protect from short drops and light bumping. I have a Nikon D40 with the Lowepro camera strap with quick release, which works well since there is not enough room with the camera and strap, you have to remove the strap and place it in the front zip compartment. This works well for me because I dont like to keep a strap on at all times when using the camera.

In \\"Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature,\\" Deleuze and Guatarri have done the same things they accuse the old Kafkologists of doing, in effect stripping Kafka of his old Kafkalogical baggage only to create a new Kafkology, one that focuses more on a weird interpretive biography of the man as celebrity than it does by trying to understand his works in their modernist setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart Cutters","review":"Ridiculous set of heart cutters.

They like what they see in my own pre-teen son. I have loaned it out to many of my friends. They are thrilled with the results they've had based on practicing the down-to-earth advice given by Dr. Gaurendi. It's practical, humorous (to help take the edge off of stressful situations), and respectful towards the all important job of parenting. God bless this man for NOT taking the road of modern psycho-babble and for actually using his own brain, spine and faith to give us REAL tools we need. This book helps me in many ways how to show my child that he is loved, and it gives me tools, based on actual situations Dr. Guardendi has delt with, which I need to deal with my own son and our own life challenges.

I know it sounds bad, but it really is somthing with one's machine or the way it is installed.I just reinstalled the game after some break from it - and I noticed one thing: when the game is 'almost' installed, it opens a program group with an icon - if you close the installation program now it may not run. When the installation stops (but is not completed yet) and you see that program group open, just minimize it, and make sure you click on the installation confirmation msg. Unless you do that, the SIM CITY button will not apear and you will not be able to run it.I did it on XP, so it must be doable. I may not be right about each and every case of problems on XP, but it is definetely possible to install and play.Cheers and happy 'installing' :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good as the Previous One","review":"This version of the game is not as fun as the previous Sim City was.

I used to play it on a Windows 98 machine until that machine crashed, and I had to upgrade to 2k, and have not played it since.I also contacted EA Tech Support who insisted that this game is/was designed for Windows 98. They suggested I run the compatibility wizard but this was a failure.Why they're still selling this game escapes me. Maybe they've corrected things on later versions though.If you can get it to run, this really is a fun game.

The potential for more diverse building types and a more interesting development scenario add to flavor of the game. In reality though, 3000 Unlimited is nearly identical to the most previous editions to the game, merely adding some interactive features.If you are a big fan of SimCity and want to get even more in depth with your cities, go ahead and buy it, the price is right. If you were easily bored with SimCity 2000 or 3000, maybe you should try another scenario game. For someone who has never played the game before, it's your call.

His field recordings and archives are the foundation of the American Songbook. But he's a terrible writer, and this book is practically unreadable.

If you really want to know about this music, skip the book and buy the CD, which is a phenomenal collection of blues, gospel & work songs Lomax recorded in the South in the 1930s and 40s.

That said, I love to find a lo-o-o-ong novel that immerses me in the characters & story, that I can't put down but dread finishing because it will be over. Kristin Lavransdatter was NOT one of those books. I rarely put a book down without finishing it, no matter how much I hate it because I have to find out how it ends. I struggled & plodded through this book. It wasn't boring, & the writing wasn't bad. It was just far too long for no reason. Kristin was naive & silly, even into old age it seemed.

There is still much between us that can still be put to ruin,\\" I still get teary-eyed. And when Kristin's first betrothed (for some reason I can't remember the names of the men) says to her husband \\"I am less forgiving than you. I cannot forgive those who I have harmed,\\" I'm still awed by the depth of the author's understanding for the complexities of human feeling.

Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.This is an easy to read, gripping story and I encourage anyone to read it. It is about the life of one woman; all her loves, losses, family, children and friends. Though the story takes place in the 14th century, Undset's characters seem like present day folks, often reminding me of people I have known, and in some cases, even loved. At times the story is sweet, exciting, frustrating, infuriating and lovely - with smooth transitions that entice you on to turn to the next page even when it's the middle of the night.

His string of albums through this period are of such quality that it is astounding that A&M has let so many of them go out of print. These desperately need to be reissued, remastered, grouped together in a nice Box set, or something. They're all good, and I love them all, so it's hard to differentiate amongst them . . .so I won't!

I got it back when I was in college(2001?)hence the VHS format. In any format this was a good attempt but fell flat. I wish I could have reviewed the product before I purchased it so that I could see how frenetic the material was. Anyone who has gotten to the point of studying Differential Equations has some decent math under their belt and some discipline to study. A few gimmicks or tricks might be necessary but not as many as they have in the video. It is very distracting and at times hard to keep up with. It tries too hard to be fun with a crazy storyline and a lot of flashing lights and effects. I didn't learn anything from the video, nor did it clarify what I already knew. It was an amusing diversion but not as helpful as I thought it'd be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable pop album","review":"This accomplished 1977 album has long been difficult to find. It opens with the soaring (Your Love Has Lifted Me) Higher And Higher, which is followed by the swinging and swaying The Way You Do The Things You Do. The slow and melancholy Boz Scaggs composition We're All Alone was a hit, I think, and she elegantly covers I Don't Want To Talk About It.One of my favorites is her version of Words by the Gibb brothers, and she renders Sam Cooke's Good Times in an appealing way. The Kris Kristofferson song Who's To Bless And Who's To Blame gets a rousing treatment over some really funky music.All the tracks are enjoyable, including the powerful rock ballad Southern Lady and the closing track, a cover of Neil Sedaka's The Hungry Years, a yearning ballad.

Rather they take great artists who support these standard tunes and allow Green space to play. A great collection. And Sunny Clark, Art Blakey, and Sam Jones add to this release's pedigree.My only regret is that (to my knowledge) this is not offered as a Rudy Van Gelder reissue. The RVG remasters are great and this should be one of them.Still two CDs of great music.

Don't buy this!","review":"This book did not add anything to my collection of Elvis books at all. Yes, there are the standard issues of Elvis records in color, as well as many bootlegs featured. BUT, there are too many records missing to make this book the least complete. Many records are only featured with pictures, no track-listing, why? This information is very easy to obtain on the net. Seems research was very poor.The bootlegs featured, are from the author's own collection. There are great color photos of the covers, and tracklistings on most of the records. But why limit the number of recorde to his own collection? Again, has there been made a research to complete the book with more material? No.If you don't have a discography book with Elvis' records, you could buy it. If you have any before, this won't add much. If you don't have any bootleg discography, this book could be worth buying.There are far too many much better books on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I love Holly Cole and her music is great!

I would rather read books about the drying effects of the sun on cow manure.About the plot. There was something about something, I think. At least, that's what the author wants us to think. The main character was dispicable. The woman he was chasing after was not worth it. Where the title comes from is absurd. Actually, the author thinks it clever to use a small cliched line in the story to title his book. Come to think about it, the book is cliche.To conclude, buy this book if you like to hammer nails into your or your children's eyes (because that kind of person would be the only one who would get amusement from such a book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like anything I've ever heard","review":"This music grows on you ,..It takes more than one listen,..The layers transcend the standard ear.

There are over 100 chapters but most of them are anywhere between half a page and 2 pages. Some of the chapters are on ridiculous subjects. It's as if Warner just wrote down the first thought that popped into his head. The book has no structure. He's not a dinosaur but some of his views are a tad outdated. It's like spending an evening with someone who tells stories that he thinks are hysterical but aren't really. Thankfully, I didn't have to pretend to laugh.

A picture (often dating from before 1900) of a building or structure is shown on the left page, and a modern picture of the same building or structure is shown on the right facing page. A number of reviewers have complained about the fact that the comparative pictures were not usually taken from the same spot. I am unsure how easy it is to take a new picture of a structure from the exact location of a previous photo, at least without special technical assistance. In addition, the spot from which an old photo was taken may have been an empty lot which now contains a building--thus ruling out a new photo getting taken from the exact same spot as the old.Besides the familiar Chicago landmarks, this book contains some pictures of churches. I especially appreciated the photos of St. Ignatius Church and St. Stanislaus Kostka Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for a native Chicagoan","review":"I bought this book for my mother, who has been away from Chicago for many years.

Drewe's evocative prose sustains an amazing unity of effect through water and desert imagery, using these as metaphors for the emotional, physical, and intellectual ways in which humans communicate (or fail to do so) under the stress of life's changes.

It is written by a woman - which is progress for the Catholic Church, who have rarely let women speak on serious theological matters. But that is the only progress I can see. The same issues are being discussed, the same problems addressed, as were the questions which pushed me out of a Catholic seminary over 35 years ago. No progress, either theological or sociological, seems to have been made on the issues of birth control, or women in the clergy, or married priests, etc. The Catholic Church no doubt would see this as a positive characteristic, but the rest of the world has moved on -- and taken a lot of the Catholic faithful with them.This is a good book.

People who choose to ignore church teaching (God's will) should find somewhere else to go - while I continue to pray for them. Mmm... can you say Martin Luther!

Our antiquing amateur sleuth only gets involved towards the end, of course managing to solve a case that the police couldn't crack. There's a drawing room confrontation with the accused at a gathering of all the suspects -- the sleuth has invited the police to attend as she unmasks the killer.Yeah, the plot is hokey, but I really enjoyed the book anyway -- it's a lot cheaper than an actual trip to Maine in August and you can really imagine yourself there.

This locale (the down east Maine coast) is particularly enjoyable and the characters are, in my opinions, much better drawn than in the first mystery (Shadows at the Fair.) There are a few moments of writing that really shine in this book -- something I would not have said about the first -- and Wait shows glimmers of clear, deep thinking and a wonderful ability to articulate -- as in her observations about growing up in the suburbs versus growing up in a little town in Maine. Altogether, a leap forward in quality from the first book, and highly recommended -- if you are interested in old houses, old implements, old prints and the people who transact in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent job!","review":"I also had the chance to see Gino in concert here in Buffalo in 1976. I was lucky enough to win a copy of this lp from a local radio station, and it is still one of my most treasured lps. The opening track Love of My Life is one of the best on the lp, and is what I would describe as an anthem of passion and reverence, not just another sticky sweet love song patterned after the countless cliched hits we have so long tolerated. The use of multi-keyboards provides a symphonic style experience that more than delivers the soulful vocals trumpeted throughout the length of this recording. Very tastefully done, as I am sure all you fellow Gino fans will agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh? What do you guys hear?","review":"This is an absolute piece of crap.

His brother, Joe Vannelli, really deserves credit for putting together all the overdubbed monophonic synthesizer tracks. A real masterpiece in my opinion. Every single track is excellent and the final track, \\"Summers of My Life,\\" with its ocean wave crashes, is a beautiful, dreamy ballad, which I feel is Gino's masterpiece. His backup singers (which kind of sound like Gino with his voice sped up to sound female, and as is the case on his Pauper In Paradies album on the track \\"Valleys of Valhalla\\") truly are tight in their harmonies. (Is that you, Gino?)

Only thing about this camera that I have found that I don't like is the LCD screen, the camera has a very good flash, I have taken pictures in the dark and they turn out perfect.

While the Testament is probably not filled with useful advice for the practice of 21st Century statecraft, it provides a valuable insight into the struggles undertaken to reform and recast a still Medieval France into a modern European state that was united politically under a single Royal government that was itself, in the person of the King, the heart of the nation-state.This was the cause that lay at the heart of Richelieu's long, ruthless, and largely successful career as the powerful Minister to Louis XIII.

But for diehard politicos like myself, this book is a terrific account of the '92 campaign.

I'd say the only thing negative about the game is its control,its repetitive arena(you'll fight 3 bosses in the same area along with missions that take place in the same exact area) other then that its a pretty fun game that you can tell a lot of thought went into making.

It does grip the iPhone without scratching it and the clamp has a decent enough hold to do the job.

The minor chords and deep moods from their previous album, \\"Dreams\\", has been replaced with optimistic harmony. I miss the emotional wailing that brought such honesty to their previous work. Their angst is mysteriously lacking through most of \\"Real Life\\" and only makes an appearance in latter tracks like \\"The Only One I See\\".

I bought the Mantis 1722-00-02 Tiller Weed Reducers with it and can see the benefit in adding these to the machine.

While the beats supplied by Scott Storch, The Neptunes and others are fire, its the delivery over them that I can't get into. Maybe its the fact that his flow is so lazy & laid back and at times I'm lookin for something more and no matter what the beat is, the flow is the same. \\"Breathe\\" is a fantastic single; possibly his best work to date, and Lil Mo sounds unreal on \\"Holla at Somebody Real\\" my early favorite for a second single. Real Talk, much like his previous albums, is very all over the place- directed to the streets, the ladies, the mainstream radio market and it just seems like to much of a mess. Great rapper, poor album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Talk delivers","review":"First off i would like to say that i think Fabolous is one of if not the best lyricist in rap today. His third album real talk is his best album hes ever put out.Every beat is hot and lyrics are on point. The best song is his hit single \\"Breathe\\".Other notables are Don't Stop Won't Stop Baby and Can you Hear me.Anyone that listens to rap should go cop this record and everyone look out for the mixtape which is sure to come out very soon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Street","review":"fab has finally gone street. he always been street but now his album is showin it. my favorite is \\"can you hear me\\" which is the realest song i ever heard. buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know Fabby","review":"Look I decided to get this cd because i fell in love with breathe from the first time i heard it, and i didn't own any of his previous records but i love his slick metaphors and word play so i figured i'd cop this one but on the first listen it is pretty dissapointing and i haven't gone back too much to listen to it again because no song really stood out in my head besides breathe. i got into \\"baby\\" after seeing the video, but the reason why i'm not dissing it altogether is because i may start to like it later on down the line but the prospects aren't looking too good. sorry fab."},{"rating":"1","title":"No","review":"Fab can definetely rhyme, but his songs on this album are the same thing with the exeption of Breath. More songs about women and i am tired of hearing about it. I give him credit for rhyming though so i gave him 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Talk NOPE","review":"Fab ain't the king of New York like everybody talkin.

The whole album is boring and the beats were even pretty terrible so don't buy fabolous's \\"Real Talk\\" insted save the new nas album \\"street's disciple\\" which will be a betta wiser choise, ight?

I found \\"Beam Me Up, Scotty\\" to be somewhat disappointing. The book is quite short, and doesn't have as much Star Trek info as I would have liked. A little more humor would have helped too. William Shatner's books on Star Trek, although some have questioned their accuracy, are certainly much more entertaining to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't trust this guy","review":"You can't believe everything you read, and certainly not anything in this book.

According to Jimmy, he is a devout Catholic (if this is true, how can he be thrice-divorced?) More oddities -- according to Jimmy, every woman (especially any woman who had ANYthing to do with Trek) he has ever met has fallen madly in love with him and begged him to sleep with her. (Yes, he's taken most of them up on it.) According to Jimmy, he single-handedly saved the Allies from the Nazis. Yeah, right. To those of you who LIKED this book, where were your brains when you read it? This book is only good as an exercise in shameless self-promotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"RCA, please do better","review":"I give this 5 stars because of the music, which is awesome. It shows Elvis once again re-inventing himself, this time concentrating on his live performances. RCA could have done so much better, though. There are no unreleased performances that they could package and put out for the fans? Well, there are. They are on the FTD (Follow That Dream) label. The CD's range from live concerts to versions of songs never before heard. They are like bootleg CD's, but done professionally. I recommend them over the stuff RCA puts out every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"The older I get the better Elvis gets...","review":"I'm onld enough to remember actually seeing Elvis video-ed from the waist up on Ed Sullivan. As a teen-age boy and relatively impervious to his appeal I couldn't understand why so many of the girls I knew got weak in the knees at the thought of him. In the years since, I've visited Graceland and watched as Elvis evolved into an icon, a sound bite, a commercial tool and corporate cash cow. At the end of the day, whatever he was in life - or wasn't - he captured the longings of a generation of kids who wanted more than the meager life they were born into. Ironically for him, he got much more than what he yearned for, milked it for all that it was worth, and died still hungry for more. The King is dead. Long live the King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb description of what it was like","review":"Moorehead was first and foremost a supremely talented writer.

I expected them to be more of a \\"matchbox diecast\\" and they arent. My son has been so upset daily at this cars breaking, he spent $14 at the disney store on this and its junk! I would recommend you buy the little matchbox ones from walmart for $3.19 a piece! I have yet to find a mater toy that is made for children. We have every item they have sold with Mater on it.

The writing style is reminds me of the guy on Dragnet -- flat and dry -- \\"Just the facts.\\" The writer advances too quickly, covering too much in each paragraph. The details (sight, sound, smell, and often feelings) are largely left out. I could not get into the characters because I just didn't have the feel of being there, like a do with a good book. What \\"feeling\\" there was to the book was a gritty, world-weary feeling that I didn't care to experience.

It seems that there is a careless attitude running through, words and word pairings were tried, trite and so-what true. A veil runs through every story flattening out the characters and creating a hum-drum meter. The results: Boring, pointless, time-wasting.That the author created not one character of interest - no passions or surprises or insights - makes me think I've been reading too many good writers lately. My expectations have grown higher. If this was a first effort I'd be more lenient. But it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Point of Career","review":"This was the worst thing Gato Barbieri ever recorded. It's nothing but crass commercialism.

More of his music needs to be put on CD.

To be honest, after hearing Second Contribution, with the exception of a single here and there, (Moonshine, for instance), I was disappointed in everything else I have ever heard him do.

If you only want one Shawn album, this is the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward and difficult to read","review":"I also had to buy this book because it was required for a course I was taking. This book is probably one of the worst text books I have ever read.

The author seems to know what he is talking about, but has a poor way of explaining it. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall review, but leaves loose ends","review":"Overall, I like this book. It is well presented and formatted and a better introduction to the concepts than computer-science oriented books like the C.J. Date book. The book is fairly modular and provides chapter references to potentially prerequisite topics that may reside earlier or later in the book.One problem I did have is that there are sometimes some loose ends left hanging. I realize that not everything can be covered, but sometimes a concept will be mentioned and it is stated that a full discussion is out of scope for the book. Fair enough, but the explanation that is given of the concept is sometimes not sufficient to make any discussion of it worth the effort. This is a minor problem, though, because most of the topics are covered with sufficient detail to get a high-level understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Database Design.Needs some update on OLAP,Dataminin","review":"This book is really good for Database Design and certain topics like Query Optimiztaion,Relational Calculus are well dealt.Advanced Topics in Databases are poorly dealt.some of the Topics which really needs some update are OLAP,Datamining and Decision Support,Performance Tuning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Says What It Is / Is What It Says","review":"Excellent quality, all metal construction.

If you are only a fan of their arena rock songs, than you may not like this, but listen to it anyway because you will probably be convinced that this rocks. Don't get me wrong, I like their arena rock sound so much that I just saw them in concert last week. But this is Skynyrd roots southern boogie rock n roll at its finest. Donnie Van Zant sings this album like it is his birthright(which it is). Don Barnes does not sing a single song, only harmonies. For people not as familiar with the band, Don Barnes sang the hits \\"Hold on Loosely\\", and \\"Caught Up In You\\". It wasn't until the 1979 album \\"Rockin' Into The Night\\" that Donnie and Don started sharing the vocal duties. This cd picks up where Skynyrd left off, pure and simple.

Checked it with a watt meter and it only drew 125/150 watts. Yes, I know the first click is high, and fully pulling the trigger is low. Cleaned and tightened the tip, no improvement. On the good side, the return process was great. This was my first Amazon return.

My advice to you is to look at the total description and if you can get the same gun in the molded carry case for the same price or close to it do that. A cardboard box is no place for anyone that needs a heavy duty Weller to be keeping it. This is a case of \\"buyer not paying attention.\\" Don't repeat my mistake no matter who the seller is.

Some people give this game bad reviews, and I disagree. Some people have said it's too hard... BUY AN EASIER GAME THEN. I have been gaming since the days of the 2600, and hove not slowed down to this day. The game is a tough one, but it IS possible to finish without cheats. It's not the best looking game, but true gamers know they need to look at more than just graphics. The story is pretty funny, and the mechanics (while not perfect) aren't all that bad. A game is what you make of it. I would recommend this game for the action type gamers out there. Overall, it's a fun game with some mini games thrown in to add to replay value. I would advise looking at gameplay videos on a video channel online. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeper hit of last year","review":"I can't believe this game got slept on. It's great!

However the controls were a bit jumpy, I wished they had smoothed it out. Also you are able to do stealth kills in the game but it is impossible to pull it off. Somehow the enemies find you quicker they they should and once they know you are around they always somehow know where you are. I really enjoyed the extras of this game. You can play a golf mode and a mini golf mode where you go around and shoot the ball and try and make it in. If you have two copies of the game you can system link and play soccer against each other.

This one's a real shocker. Who would've thought that a game could be so BAD! The graphic's are horrible. They would've been horrible on PS1 ten years ago. It's one of those games in which you can see your characters back the whole time. The camera is able to rotate around you, but you're unable to run towards the camera. The battle system is very incomplete. Pressing the left trigger allows you to perform a cheesy combo. The graphic's twitch when you fight or just perform an open combo when there's no enemy around. Kiddie looking games with adult content are a great idea (I'll take CONKER anyday). However, they often fail in the gameplay department. In this case the game isn't even nice to look at. All the main factors are not present. Gameplay, controls, and graphics all need major work.

What really sinks this guide is the arrogance it both generates and seeks to glorify. Asheville has been a sophisticated and cosmopolitan city for well over a hundred years, yet this guide, and much of what is covered in it, seems to take the attitude that this is something relatively new if not brought to the city by the people and places written about here. Such ignorance and naivete would be mildly amusing if it weren't so flagrant."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good thing, gasping for its last breath","review":"Asheville was a once charming city that has slowly been loved to death with overdevelopment, an ever escalating cost of living (not matched by a significant rise in wages of the chronic underemployment the plagues the town) and a once pristine environment devastated by some of the worst ozone in the Southeast outside of Atlanta (hard to believe Asheville was once a haven for TB patients).This book is not without its charm, but more soften the not it serves as a painful reminder of much of what has helped turn the city into a playground for the rich and trendy at the expense of the people who struggle earning six bucks an hour to serve them and the damage this has down to the local Appalachian Mountain culture and environment. As a result it show how Asheville has been overrun with hype -- hype propelled mostly by those who stand to make a quick, short term buck by aiding along the demise of this once pleasant place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one!","review":"This fun book was very helpful and worth holding on to after the jaunt to Asheville.

He continues on in various worksheets to give \\"jerk points\\" for not measuring up as a Christian.The author also takes pretty much every opportunity to shamelessly plug his personal businesses. It's like watching a movie and having a Pepsi can zoomed in on every few minutes.I really think it is a good template for a book, if the author could have done it from a neutral and respectful viewpoint religiously speaking (or clearly labelled it as a religious self-help book), and left out the self-promotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"If you're the choir, I don't suppose you'd mind being preached to.

Recently I was wondering if it was out on CD. After looking from store to store I couldn't find it anywhere. Then it dawned on me to try to look for it on the internet. Wouldn't you know it, I just found it. Leave it to amazon.com to have it. This place has eveything.I can even say that this is my favorite cult film with a soundtrack that rocks. This is a must buy for people who like things that are weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic of its kind","review":"I've never heard anything else by Paul Williams but this soundtrack to the cult movie stands on its own as a remarkable testament to love gone awry. It follows the story of a man willing to sell his soul for one more chance, a tale of beauty and the beast and Faust and the devil, brilliantly scored and cheesily acted. All the music and lyrics were penned by Williams. My favorite line is the chorus from \\"The Hell Of It\\": Good for nothing / Bad in bed / Nobody likes you / You're better off dead / Goodbye Goodbye. Nice and depressingly loving. It also deals with the idea of stolen music (Celine Dion)."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS!!","review":"This is one of my all time favorite movies,and one of my all time favorite movie soundtracks.Paul Williams is at the top of his game as a songwriter here.The lyrics to these songs actually made me forget that he was responsible for 'Evergreen'.and Jessica Harper has a voice that is incredibly haunting and lovely.'Old Souls' gives me chills every time I hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom of the Paradise","review":"Incredible !!

Paul Williams is without doubt an outstanding composer, with many brilliant works penned for many artists. This sound track is not a great example of this talent. There are one or two tracks that carry the distintive PW sound but by and large it's hard to like without having viewed the movie and even then it's ok at best. Many of the performances are pitchy and one can't help feeling, a little amatuerish. If your a hard core fan buy this and enjoy, if your a moderate or new fan or just plain curious don't start here. There are much better offering of Paul Williams work on his other discs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be deceived","review":"Beneath the flash, campiness, glam, humor, etc. is some very dark and intense emotion. Some of these songs contain deep despair, sadness, and frustration. Williams conveys these feelings with such haunting, delicate beauty though that I, like so many other reviewers here, find myself drawn back to the movie and soundtrack again and again.I don't really know anything about the rest of his work, other than his big hits, but I can't imagine any of it delves into the same places. The only thing lacking in this soundtrack is more songs. I read somewhere that the \\"Never thought I'd get to meet the devil\\" interlude isn't any longer than the couple verses in the movie, but it'd be great to have anyway, along with any stuff that might have been recorded but left out of the movie.P.S.

I had taped about 35 mins. of video and taken a dozen photos on the memory card. All of a sudden, the next time I attempted to record, the viewfinder and LCD had white lines all over and white static on the entire left side. Also, the images appeared very dark in full daylight. It would record, but with all this noise and an unviewable image, both on the tape and the memory card. I called the Panasonic help number in the manual and they immediately said it would require service. I tried it again over the next few days and all of a sudden it cleared up on the sixth day.

I did, however, question the rating on the game. The game holds an \\"E\\" rating which states that it is suitable for any person age 6 and older. I believe that a young child would not be able to solve many of the puzzles and challenges in the game, unless they purchased a cheat book or went on the internet (like I did) to get hints for the puzzles. Plus, some of the creatures encountered in the game may frighten younger audiences, and a scantily-clad priestess in the Maya scene may not be suitable for younger eyes.

I am not into PC games as much as some of the other reviewers are, but I am an intelligent person that enjoys a challenge, and a diversion once in awhile. I picked the WRONG game for that! This game required my finding a \\"cheat site\\" on the web so I could continue on with it, and I have needed to refer to it throughout my attempts at it. And the \\"cheat\\" info was not always enough to get me past an obstacle.

I think they're trying to re-create the style of Myst, but they don't realize that there is a subtle art to making a game like this. The first rule they violate is to make the game possible to figure out on your own. They provide almost no clues for any of the puzzles (It's impossible to figure out where to use the crystal ball in each place unless you try every single screen). They make it so difficult you pretty much have to use a walkthrough. I was able to get through Myst without any help, but I didn't last five minutes in Beyond Atlantis.The only good part about the game is the way it looks. All the worlds look amazing (which is good, because you'll be spending a lot of time in each one).Unless you like to spend countless hours trying to figure out puzzles with absolutely no clues at your disposal, you should avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game, some technical issues in XP.","review":"In regard of the storyline and reasoning behind the puzzles, I would like to refer to the gamespot review under editorial reviews.Overall, I would recommend this game,due to the beautiful graphics and the very efficient game control.However, I did encounter some problems playing the game in XP (the game is pre-XP). In XP the game would skip the beautiful films that are thrown into the story. When running it in 95/98 compatibility mode (via properties) it would sometimes freeze up, due to lack of memory according to the message. Switching back to XP would then solve that problem. Anyway, the game was worth switching between XP and 95/98 compatibility mode ocassionaly (for the newbies: this is much easier than it may sound!).Another problem I encountered was that the game did not want to start up with player 1. But chosing player 2 solved that problem.Excellent game, but definitely surpassed by Atlantis 3 (Beyond Atlantis 2)."},{"rating":"1","title":"great graphics ridiculous puzzles","review":"After playing Riven and The Last Express, Beyond Atlantis was a sheer disappointment. Some of the puzzles were downright impossible and completely illogical. Granted Riven had some tough ones, but they were intergrated into the gameplay. In addition, the acting was embarassingly bad.

The beatiful graphics can't cover the fact that the puzzles are vague and more than a little frustrating,(even with a walkthrough!) and that so-called selling point of 360 degree movement gave me motion sickness. The characters are peculiar looking and some of them undulate in an odd fashion, which, along with the corny dialogue, makes it hard to take seriously. In particular the Mayan women; what is up with the British accents? Had I known this was a Dreamcatcher game I would not have bought it. I was so wowed by the graphics I didn't even notice.

Too many of its puzzles require guess-work and don't require logical analysis. Also there are too many \\"jump-though-hoops\\" steps, i.e. completely random use of an object, not based on any clue or information from any of the characters. In fact, to get the 5th level, I had to go to a hint guide to find that I had to go back through all four previous levels and click on one completely random place in each level.

I consider myself to be pretty good at solving puzzle games, and if I get stuck, I call a couple of friends and we work these out together. But neither of us liked this game very well. the clues aren't detailed enough and many of these puzzles are repititious. You don't know if you have done the puzzle right until the end of that sequence. Very annoying. when they speak to you, it's like your speaking to Confuscious.

This thing does NOT look like the picture at all. While, the materials are definitely the same, the patch work has gone to the gutter. The eyes are not aligned correctly so the dog looks cross-eyed. The front legs are longer than the back legs, which reduces the cuteness. The face on mine is frowning instead of begging. It looks like they either outsourced the handiwork or cut production costs, because their quality has drastically declined. I bought the panda plush at the same time, and it as well has the same problems--uneven shapes, sad faces, obvious seams. I would not even want this stuff given to me, so how do you expect me to give them away as presents? I will no longer purchase products from Aurora again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"Okay this thing does not look anything at all like the picture.

On top of all that the shipping and handling was pretty expensive in my opnion bringing the overal cost of this tiny little 12\\" toy to way more than I think it is worth. I had to give it a bit of a hair cut and move around the toys stuffing for it to even closely resemble this picture and you know what even after all that it still looks nothing like it.

Dogs are measured from the ground to the top of the withers. This one measures about 4 1/4\\" at the withers and about 7 1/2 inches to the top of the head.

Less plot driven and more a 'slice of life', it's gross, funny and at times very disturbing .

And bringing JLo on your albums is a disgrace b/c we all know that she's all image but no talent. Get any of his old albums. Even 14 Shots to the Dome is better than this crud.

I look forward to seeing the other films. Its nice to know that there is a series of movies with style and substance about the samurai. Seven Samurai and the Yojimbo are great movies, but the tone of Lone Wolf with Cub is different.Here, you get a samurai movie as if Sergio Leone settled down and lived in Japan for a period of his life. Its got power and flair in its visuals and the characters breathe. The relationships dont ring a false note. You believe that he loves that little boy, and you know that little boy looks up to him. And, you damn well know that if anyone messes with either one of them, heads are going to roll.This movie was just absolutely outstanding from start to finish.

You waist alot of time running around trying to figure out what to do. After the first hour of game play I gave up and used a walkthrough. The plot is a linear sequence of scenes (about 11 in all). Once you leave a scene you cannot return so if you forget something in scene 3 that you need in scene 11 - well tough luck. You have to start over. The scenes present puzzles that become increasingly difficult as you progress. Unless you have a lightning fast processor you won't be able to complete the adventure.

On longer outings, I use it in conjunction with a small camera bag, with the wallet and camera both tucked into the bag (in addition to lens cloths, filters, etc). On shorter outings I just take the camera and the wallet. Saves on bulk/weight. You can tuck the wallet in your pocket, or loop it on your belt (with its very wide, velcro release loop).I knew that this was an importance accessory, when I bought a second digital camera and could not do without a second D-Res 4 wallet.

Although the graphics and the cinematic seens were impressive, the fun factor was VERY disappointing. Don't expect for this to be a high action, role-playing game with lots of shooting, explosions, and weapons. The actual gameplay is limited with too many cinematic scenes. Player interaction with the game is severely low. Don't expect to use a gamepad with this game: the player is limited to the use of the mouse without the keyboard.

I found points in the game where I knew what to do but the area that needed to be clicked was too small and hard to find.

I don't like being limited to movement by the arrows. Maybe I want to look at something across the way...or fall off a cliff (if I wanted to) from losing my balance after being chased by a demon! I want choices!I had those choices, and so much more, in Clive Barkers' Undying and American McGee's Alice! Two of the best games you will ever play, if you want demented, heart pounding terror.

Anyhow, it's not one of the best adv.games and i wouldn't recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Rather Be Watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer","review":"This was more of a point-and-click movie than a game. With fine graphics and a variety of characters to interact with, I expected more than what this short, easy game offered. While the storyline was interesting to a point (rescue-the-girl is not very original) the end was simply an opening for a possible sequel rather than a satisfying conclusion or even a showdown with Dracula or his henchmen. The most interesting thing to do in this game is to laugh at the unfortunately named character, \\"Dorko,\\" when she says \\"Tremble before the rise of Dorko!\\" In short, beginners and/or people who like pretty graphics more than a challenge will enjoy this game--seasoned gameplayers will likely be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for vampire lovers.","review":"Mina has returned to Transylvania. You, as Jonathan Harker, must follow her and save her from Dracula. Explore a dark forest, find your way through a mine and a castle full of traps and unknown chambers. Puzzles and riddles will slow you down (kind of), as you work your way closer to saving your wife and defeating the Prince of Darkness.Well, not really. Some of the puzzles are very easy, while others seem VERY hard. But if you examine everything and try your best, you should be able to save your wife. No time limites and no way to die.No ending, either. Better go get the next game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead","review":"This was listed as a book on tape (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection). I want the book not the musical!

This book sucked. I detested Magnolia's mother. I hated the racial slurs. The husband was a royal bastard. And the daughter treated Magnolia like a simpleton! But what can I say, she was close to it. Magnolia had no real personality and absolutely no backbone whatsoever. Although she was sweet and I admired how much the loved the river and the theater I could barely stand her at certain times in the novel. I had to force myself to finish the book. Although many of you may disagree with me and certainly the other people who gave reviews do. But I have a right to my opinion and decided that what I thought of this book should be up here to warn off others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nina to eight...","review":"This book is a very nice large hardback book.

I made some following the directions on the pak. The sauce never thickened and I ended having to thicken it with corn starch.

It is written for a Jewish marriage but other faiths can find it very useful. As a woman, I found it enjoyable and enlighting. After 20+ years of marriage it held many truths. It is written for a man but any woman can easily apply the same principals in reverse. A MUST for all to read! >^,,^<"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I made an unfortunate selection in purchasing this storybook before a similar review (H. Hudson Aug 14) was posted. Had I waited I could have benefited from that review. Instead I must post a similar review. The most disappointing thing about this storybook is the CD does not let the child know when to turn the page. We also expected to hear familiar voices for Pooh and the gang rather than just a full narration. At this price there are much better selections if you are going to be turning the pages yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought this for my preschooler and am very disappointed.

It would be okay for children who read, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"Tone\\"","review":"For a Read-Along book, they simply missed the point. There is no chime or tone to remind the child when to turn the page and therefore 'read along'. Also, the narrator has one tone and limited voice intonation -- she makes no effort to distinguish between characters. Cheaply edited, not worth the money. See \\"Disney's Read Along Collection\\" for a better quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No chimes","review":"Not what I was hoping for.

At first I wasn't very keen on it; it has a strange rythym and it took a while for it to grow on me.Little Bear wants to play, but Big Bear has things to do so Little Bear must help clean up as well as entertain himself while Big Bear finishes his chores. When all the work is done Big Bear is able to play with Little Bear. My son listens to this book intently and clearly working on understanding that we 'Big Bears' can't always play with him when he wants us to. It's a hard lesson for a little person, and one that I am grateful to this book for helping him to understand. He refers to Little and Big Bear at those times when he wants to play and we can't, and it comforts him to know that he is not alone in having to wait - Little Bear had to, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"No rhythm","review":"My 2 yr old daughter received this book for Christmas. She doesn't mind the book, but I dislike it immensely. There is no rhythm or flow to the story, making it a chore to read aloud. The author constantly repeats the words \\"little bear\\" and \\"big bear\\" with some action words thrown in for filler. I have never thrown a book in the garbage, but consider it a worthy home for this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game - I want to buy it without the camera - HELP!","review":"I already own the eye toy camera because it came with \\"Eye Toy Play\\".

I've already gone through three different disc, each resulting in a \\"disc read error\\". Through continued research, this game only plays on brand new PS2 units and not former, although less than two year old, units. Problem being that this game is copied on a BLUE disc which is more difficult for the PS2 to read than other titles. I've since sent numerous emails to Sega asking for some reasoning, but they've all gone un-answered. The write up for the game sounds interesting and probably enjoyable if you can get the game to load. Based on my experience, I rate this game a single star for quality and service support from Sega. Note there are other titles like the Nickelodeon game which perform flawlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun!!!","review":"After getting the eye toy set up, which was much easier than some of the other reviews indicate, this game was awesome! Occasionally you will need to recalibrate, but normally my wife and I could switch with each other even in mid-game. I couldn't believe how much fun antigrav is! It's challenging enough to not get boring but easy enough to keep you playing. I highly recommend this game to anyone with a PS2."},{"rating":"1","title":"EyeTOY? I think not!","review":"Eye Toy anti grav was possibly the worst game I have ever bought! There was some complete false advertising too. The commercials said you could walk around the house and outside and it would still follow you. It definitely doesnt do that! It does just about everything but that. It cahnns you out of 50 bucks it barely works without the right lighting, and can hardly follow your body movement. The first eyetoy and eye toy groove were much better, if you are looking for a good game buy one of those not eye toy anti grav.

You get so caught up in the collecting of stars and wings and trying to achieve high scores that you do not realize how much exercise you are getting until you have to turn on the fans to cool yourself. I have been playing the game for a year and it is still compelling. I have not lost any weight, but I am more toned.Once you figure out the best lighting, you are all set.

First of all the humor is great (even though a little crude but who really gives). The environments are huge and when you find secret rooms you can get things that actually help in the game instead of some games where all you get are extras or small movie clips.(The game does have extras too though.)The game almost has no flaws in its gameplay. The game gives you a surprise many times. I also like that sometimes you can choose from a selection what you are going to say to somebody else. Just like in KOTOR. Even though the game is solid I think the 50 dollar price tag is a little too much. So if you have $50 in your pocket and you want adventure video game you mussssssssssst get Psychonauts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gamers begging for creativity and originality need this game","review":"There's really not much else to say that other reviewers have not covered. However in a day and age where sequels of established franchises are the norm, Psychonauts is a welcome breath of fresh air.This game is living proof that a developer can stay independent in today's market and still produce a quality title. It's a shame less than 100,000 sold across all platforms. It was easily one of the best games of 2005. I never thought I'd see the day when a title by Tim Schafer would go relatively unnoticed.It's Tim Schafer doing Tim Schafer, and that's never a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this game!","review":"One of the coolest and most creative games I've had the pleasure of playing.

The graphics have held up over time and range from childlike to surreal to terrifying depending on the levels. The level design is fantastic, which each level being its own universe with nothing repeating.

The band Spooky Tooth sound a lot like early Deep Purple, though their music tends a bit more toward the psychedelic. The shared lead vocals by Gary Wright and Mike Harrison will remind you a little of Robert Plant. There are a lot of good instrumental jams through out the album and the production is first rate. \\"Feelin' Bad,\\" \\"Evil Woman\\" and \\"That Was Only Yesterday,\\" are probably the best tracks, though its hard to choose given the album's heavy consistency. \\"Evil Woman\\" is a classic of guitar and keyboard fury. A great soundtrack for any retro heavy metal party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it because Judas Priest covered one of their songs","review":"I am a BIG Judas Priest fan and wanted to see how the original \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" sounded.

Coming out of the late 60's, this one helped them turn the decade with a bang. Every track is a stand alone piece of work. Guitarist Grosvenor went on to fill the shoes of Mick Ralphs when he left Mott the Hoople for Bad Co. and keyboard man Gary Wright supplied that great Hammond B-3 sound that helped him when he moved onto his Dreamweaver days. Well engineered and produced it was one of the class of '69 that really started moving rock out of peace and love and onto that tough, gritty pump a fist in the air wave of rockers. The '88 A&M disc makes it sound even richer. A great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic late 60's British rock","review":"I actually think this album is a bit overrated but I've given it five stars anyway because it was a landmark album in 1969. It suffers from poor production qualities which gave a muddy and unbalanced feel to some tracks. Also, the wide variety of styles, from country-rock (That Was Only Yesterday) through British soul (I've Got Enough Heartaches) to proto-metal (Evil Woman) is a bit uneven. But overall, the impact of such classics as 'Better by me, better than you', 'Evil Woman' and 'Waiting For The Wind' cannot be denied. The vocals by Harrison and Wright are really outstanding. After 30 years this is still a very enjoyable album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky Tooth. Enough said right?","review":"Got this for my hippy dad for Christmas.

I had this once when it first came out. I can't remember now if I played the poor thing to death, loaned it to a girlfriend and never got it back, or simply lost track of it. Time passed. Then I accidentally came across it again here on Amazon. So, old hippie that I am, I just had to have it in my collection - again. So for me, this is Spooky Two - Two.

On track 1, for example, it sounds like the drummer was using a wet cardboard box. On other tracks, the recording of the backing band fluctuates wildly in volume. Sound quality for the lead musicians themselves is generally fine, but enjoyment is spoilt by these other problems. In my opinion, this CD is for music historians only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent text and reference","review":"This is the best book that I have used for teaching graduate level Elasticity.

When Morris goes to the candy store, the clerk tells him the candy is a penny a piece. Morris counts his money, but counts it wrong. The man asks Morris if he went to school, and Morris said, \\"no.\\" So the man takes him to school, where he learns how to read and count. Morris then goes to the \\"candy\\" store and gives exactly five cents for five gumdrops. This story teaches children that by going to school, you can learn things that you might not have known if you didn't go. It also teaches them, that everyone should have the right to go to school.

(...) First of all, these girls do not portray good role models in this movie by dropping out of school. These girls are filthy rich but can't come up with a good movie. This movie is also unacceptable for kids to see. Go to www.screenit.com to see if a movie will be acceptable for kids to see. This movie is a waste of time, film, money and effort. By not seeing this movie (in theaters and when in comes out in rental stores), we can show the Olsens that we are over them. I sure am. We see them right and left in stores...they are just everywhere!

The twins are brilliant actors with great screen presence and fully contribute to a masterful script. This is probably the best movie ever directed and I ( and about 20 other people ) had the historic privilege of witnessing dare I say, \\" greatness \\" on the silver screen ! The Olsen twins are blessed not only with intellect but a gift so extensive I would need more that a thousand words to describe. Oh, everything I just said was one big lie!

Again.","review":"Think of everything that you would despise in a movie. Throw that all in to one, and you get New York Minute. In addition to an excruciatingly terrible plot line, 3rd grade acting, and horrific accents, you also get incessantly annoying 'actors' ripping an hour and a half of your life. An hour and a half that you can never get back, and that may end in some need for cleansing as a human being and the reassurance that, by the way, the world isn't completely full of morons.Admittedly, I approached the film warily, and I didn't expect much, but I was hoping for a slightly enjoyable film at least, for I am easily pleased. But I was not even granted that relief, and so I sat through the film...hoping against hope that maybe, just maybe there would be a redeeming factor near the end.There wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad movie","review":"Yup.

Watch Full House, that was their best acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER","review":"This is seriously THE worst movie I have ever seen. I don't care if it's inappropriate or not, but it just has completely cliched characters and situations; a lame, lame plot; horrible acting (especially the two \\"stars\\") and, worst of all, sadly pathetic attempts at comedy. The funniest part of the movie wasn't intentional; it was the (incredibly maudlin) part where the sisters have this \\"touching\\" conversation full of cliches such as \\"you were never there for me!\\" and then get mad at each other, and then randomly walk around to music. This was hilarious. Anyway, the ending, sadly, is not MK + A getting run over by taxis but a (can you guess?) happy-ending cliche that is also highly improbable. I don't see why anyone would even want to buy this, but if you're thinking about it, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!P.S.

They have long been on the fence about the Olsen twins, while I have found them to be model Young Republicans. I can only pray that Mary-Kate overcomes her eating disorder and rediscovers the joys of rich food (I know I do!).When we watched \\"New York Minute\\", I knew I would enjoy it fully. Andy Richter provides extreme amusement, and the girls themselves acquit themselves nicely in their first non-kiddie flick. I am convinced this film is more for an older, reflective audience. Why?

However, I'm sorry that the producers and Mary-Kate and Ashley have made a waste of film. Their movie, Our Lips Are Sealed, is great, and I've seen it about 5 times.

It was cool that when I watched it, it was early enough that no one was in the theater because everyone was at work or at school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, are the people reviewing this film here for real?","review":"This movie is hardly worth your $9 to go see. \\"Envy\\" with Jack Black is also a dud, but at least it has some genuinely funny moments. But if you look at the reviews below you would think this movie was a killer. Well, folks, according to the just released box office receipts for last weekend, this movie pulled all of $6M and change. Next weekend should see a big drop from these anemic numbers. Can you hear the thud? To call this stinker a 5 star makes me wonder what the person ate before they saw the film because this is just not a very good film. Weak acting, weak script, lack of good humor. My suggestion to the Twins: stick to the direct to video stuff as that crowd may be more forgiving or swallow your egos and take small parts in larger productions so you can learn your craft. For the true fan, better get to the movie theatre quick because this one will be gone faster than a New York minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller was great.... product is aweful!","review":"If you can get past smelling like lemon scented dishwasher detergent, it's still not a good product.

Try LIGHTHOUSE or TIMELAPSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice try...","review":"The Sacred Amulet is a game that takes place durring the time of one of the greatest empires in world history. However, the gameplay is very poor and there is no true 3d graphics. the graphics engine is comparable to Quick Time VR with 3d panoramic views. This just did not foster good gameplay. Also it was very tedious at times. The included Aztec encyclopedia was a very nice touch. It was not mandatory for game play, but the information is there in case you are interested. It does provide some insight into the culture as you play. The graphics themselves are alright although not 3D. I wouldn't recomend this game to those interested in the action genre or even anyone who engoys RPG games because it simply fails to entertain through its gameplay. However, the graphical content does succeed to allow one to see a small peak into the lives of the Mexica (Aztecs)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope it does not break","review":"Had this machinefor six weeks it is now on its way to Elgin Il for repair.

This isn't too bad, and I like the VHS-C format because you can just plop the tape into the adaptor and play it into your existing VCR. The 8mm and super 8 mm cameras require you either purchase an expensive 8 mm player or else cable the camera to your VCR.

We bought this camera 3 years ago and it never worked right from the start. One of the reasons we bought it was for the built in digital camera. Well my 2 year old son could draw a picture better than the quality it produces. The interface to my computer to upload the camera never worked right and Panasonic was never able to properly troubleshoot the issue. Well my warranty ran out about 3 months ago (had 3 year warranty) and wouldn't you know that it stopped working. Never dropped, hit or nothing and the day of my son's 2nd bday, I went to put tape in and the thing kept humming and spinning the tape but not recording.

It is a well known fact that anti-Catholicism stemming from immigration was a sad reality during the time period when this book was originally written. The language and derogatory terms that White uses were also common. Plus, I find it hard to believe the \\"visions\\" of a woman who was rendered comatose getting hit by a rock when she was little. There's also evidence that suggests she developed lingering mental side effects from that injury If you really believe the lies about evil Jesuit domination and what not, then you really need help."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't have to buy it - you get it in the mail, it's \\"manditory\\"!","review":"Not a review [I wanted to give this no stars, but Amazon doesn't permit that].

The people behind it have a (shabby) website, but nowhere on it is there a way to prevent them from sending it out to those who are not sufficiently desperate and/or gullible to fall for it. The first page of the website states: \\"a manditory directive is coming and will be enforced\\" - apparently they can't spell \\"mandatory\\", so literacy isn't a high priority with them.

One may find the historical background a little difficult at first only if there is not a pre-knowledge of events in history, but then quickly become attatched to the book. There is a sense of purpose for mankind. The understanding of prophecy is open as one reads this account of past, present and future events.

Then I became curious as to whether the church we have today differed and how it differed from the church in the aposlotic age. After going back over the book and reading it more in depth, I find the history to be very accurate. I find the theology to be well-supported by the Bible. I can say I am willing to believe what the Bible says, and to doubt anything that does not completely harmonize with God's Word, whether it is popular or not.

The use of human actors who take on a bit of animal characteristics (not unlike in the story where the animals take on very human characteristics) added so much to this production.As mentioned before, Toad was absolutely spectacular, and really defined the character for the audience.

I have since read the book at least a half a dozen times, and love the story and its characters.When I saw that Masterpiece Theater had done a rendition I was eager to see it, and placed an order for the DVD. Unfortunately this rendition is completely our of character with the book, and misses all the nuance of the original. I'm shocked the Masterpiece Theater would do such injustice to a classic.Every part was poorly acted and overdone, none of Kenneth Graham's brilliant dialog was used, and the scream-play is very poorly assembled. Toad was dreadful and entirely unsympathetic. It appeared that no one involved had read the book (or seen the play).I'm glad I didn't see this first.

One of the nice things about this book was that all of the characters had a savior-part, so you take part in each of their piont of views. I also enjoyed the diffrent creatures Kendall has sprouted from her imagination. The Diggers, egg-shaped plants and many others show what a brilliant imagination Kendall has.

Now that I've read it aloud about a million times and added my own twists and actions to accompany the story (kisses on the tummy, toes, eyes) I'm getting lulled into liking the book too. I LOVE that the white grandmother has a black grandbaby and that the daddy is a super dad and that there is an asian mother and daughter. The illustrations don't grab me because they have kind of a messy look, but they obviously grab my girl, because she just stares and stares at each page. So...take what you will from this review.

The children are seen having lots of fun with that person and screaming for more, more, more. Interesting that the second child, an African-American has a Caucasian grandmother. To an adult, they might be able to rationalize this, but to a child this may be very confusing why the parent does not look like the child.

This book is another example. It is three short and related stories in one. The ways that the adults interact with the children is a little creepy in parts and the story is so long for being so incredibly drab. Moreover, the grammar in incomprehensible as each adult \\"catches that baby up\\" and any pattern to the language breaks down within a page or two. The As you can see from other reviews, it can be a bit painful for a parent to read through.

Even for a guy with a well-known reputation as a musical risk-taker, this is a particularly ambitious and diverse effort that travels down a few different musical paths, and it makes a pretty bold musical statement no matter where it's going. All songs on the album are solid and robust; particularly good are the title track and \\"Mad At You,\\" with their manic-paced, psychedelic-inspired guitar riffs, and also good is \\"One To One\\" which has a haunting, lilting piano riff that would become a familiar trademark of some of the softer, more radio-friendly hits he would have in the coming years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some great songs and some other ones too","review":"After the great \\"Look Sharp\\" and the even greater \\"I'm the Man\\", Joe Jackson released \\"Beat Crazy as this 3rd LP. The effort was credited to the Joe Jackson Band and not just Joe and it was a change in direction. There's a reggae influence here and the title track and leadoff track signals the new direction with bass player Graham Maby singing lead.There are some really great JJ songs here including the title track, \\"One to One\\". \\"Someone Up There\\" \\"Biology\\" and \\"Fit\\". There's 5 other cuts here also and they are not up those high standards. Of course, the changes in direction continue to this day. This is not as consistently wonderful as his 2 first LP's but there are some essential JJ tracks here."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son LOVES it!","review":"I felt compelled to review this, because unlike two of the other reviewers, I LIKE that there is no indication to \\"turn the page.\\" The book is good, but the audio CD is even better. My son got one of these (actually slightly different, it has the \\"Nemo\\" story on it and one other that is different) for his 3rd birthday, and wants to listen to it EVERY night while he is falling asleep. I was looking on amazon to buy another one (with different stories). The woman's voice who is the narrator is very pleasant.

You can listen to it straight through, the only song that isn't as great as everything else is Press Pause (track 9) but other than that I think it's been one of the best r&b releases this year. The only thing is I wish they had So What, I Wish, and Want It From Me (take it further) on the album. Chances are they are savin um for a special edition release or something.

They need to go away!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first album, Danity Kane!","review":"In regards to Forest Law, if you look at all his reviews he practically gave 1 star in almost every review including Goo Goo Dolls and Mariah Carey but gave 4 stars to artists that people don't even know like She Wants Revenge. Apparently, he does not know what he's talking about.I'm giving this review 5 stars because Danity Kane has managed to deliver a great debut album. Not many artists can do that. They worked with producers like Brian Michael Cox (Mariah Carey, Scott Storch (Christina Aguilera) and Rodney Jerkins (Beyonce) to name a few. \\"Ride For You\\" is a great ballad that everyone will enjoy. \\"Hold Me Down\\" is a great example of what r&b;/hiphop sounds like.Unlike other groups out there they all actually sing! So there should be no comparison to PussyCat Dolls as they only have one lead singer. I have to add that Danity Kane can dance. They're like a hiphop, female version of Nsync with no lead singers.Diddy did it right this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making the Band 3 attempt looks like a hit","review":"If you followed the show and said to your self this girl or that girl would have been better, not so! These girls can dance and sing a rare thing in the land on female pop groups. I own the cd and can only find 3 songs out of the 14 tracks (including interludes), that were so so. I just hope that that D. Kane learned from the now defunct Da Band what not to do. Bottom line if you want a female group cd with 5 girls that can sing, buy danity Kane. If your looking for a female group with a lead singer and 4 back up dancers/singers buy pussycat dolls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I loved this CD, especially the ballads \\"Stay with Me\\" and \\"Ride for you\\" I love Aundrea and her voice is beautiful in these songs, and meshes well with Dawn's voice. The others are okay but to be honest Aundrea and Dawn make this CD great, if it wasn't for them it would be mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE DK","review":"I love love this group.

I like the album and I think people should give it a chance and not look at it like some manufactured group because, yes, they were created by Diddy but they def have the talent to back them up and they are cool chicks. My fave songs on the album are Want it, Show stoppes, One Shut, and Right Here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Girls are pretty, but this release feels super empty.The lyrics are bland, and the production is all over the place!How any sane person (especially males) could get into this crap, is beyond me.I was actually rooting for them on the show though; they seemed to get closer as girl after girl left the group. I wanted the Pisces, Dominique to make it so, so bad because although she was no dancer, she had one of the best voices on the show!Anyway, glad Aubrey made it; she was the prettiest, had a nice, like-able and friendly demeanor and she could sing decently.I guess Show Stopper is solid. No substance, no depth but it's fun and it's catchy. I give them points for this one.The rest is **** though.Don't buy this.Here's some advice. When you go shopping, and you come to the music section, don't even look at this damn thing!! It's phony, generic and quite soulless.1 star. Wish I could give it less..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ladies are HOT!","review":"Hand-chosen by P. Diddy and vocally-trained by Betty Wright, these five girls came to throw down some vocals on some hot tracks by today's funkiest producers, and they do just that on this, their first release. Granted, this cd is like many on the market today by the divas nouveaux, with its check-my-ride and you-done-me-wrong songs, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. In my opinion, it's one of the catchiest, best hip-hop-pop albums in the last 12 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Tolerable but do you really want to listen to that?","review":"I will be the first to say that these girls have some talent- they can harmonize definitely. Okay, so what? That does not negate the fact that the songs are formulaic and the entire CD lacks heart- something that cannot possibly be found from such contrived set-ups as this. Also, has anyone even listened to the lyrics? \\"Showstopper\\" is a female version of the standard male-rap song of today- while it definitely is not meant to be taken seriously, the lyrics are downright laughable (or sad) depending on your take\\" \\"jiggle them keys\\", \\"to all my ladies in the rainbow mercedes\\"....if I had the talent those girls do I would be ashamed to be singing those lines. But then of course, if everyone makes money credibility as an artist doesn't mean much, does it? To summarize: the harmonies are decent but if you actually listen to the words or look for any real emotion the CD becomes painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here Today, Gone Tomorrow","review":"The non-talented forever sampling can't rap getting over big time Diddy has presented to us another one of his foreseeable failed projects: Danity Kane. Really, look at the girls on the cover and you can actually see the friction between them. They look like they're racing down the catwalk to see who will become the Ultimate Diva. Well, they better enjoy their stardom as long as they can because they have 2 minutes and 10 seconds before they fade into obscurity. Anyway, this CD is wack to the ultimate max. It's very formulaic and sounds like everything else being played on the radio. Every song on here is forgettable, so Danity Kane can even forget about being at least one-hit wonders. This is garbage and it's not R&B- just watered down pop. Skip this at all costs and get En Vogue or the Mary Jane Girls. At least MJG had Rick James working with them and you can't deny that he had talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all meeting my expectations","review":"I would have thought with all of the hot producers on this album that the album would have had more catchy beats/songs ... yeah i'm sure once the radio plays out the songs they'll get stuck in peoples heads. Overall I'm not impressed. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"once again the quality of music drops!!","review":"Being one of the many drawn to these girls for the one and only reason of them being on a T.V. show, I am absolutely positive that I wouldn't have evened listened to the album if it weren't for mtb3. But the quality of the album doesn't surprise me at all because they never could sing on the show. I feel bad for all of the wonderful producers and the great beats they have given these girls only for them to put their less than mediocre voices over them. Showstopper is the best thing on here. I was kinda hoping that since they sounded so terrible on the show that maybe all the high tech studio equipment could work some magic on their voices by the time the CD came out but I guess not.I have no doubt that these girls will be successful because you don't need talent to be successful in the music business today. So I hope their dancing stays on point because their singing is so bad. They better ride the beauty equals success train until its wheels fall off!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very suprised....","review":"I watched this show and the clips of the songs that they played seemed very good, however, all of the songs pretty much feature Dawn, the one with the deep voice. The other girls have such great voices I felt that they were backup. I was not impressed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Family members stop reviewing this CD","review":"This CD is the worst.... the only song that I like is the shortest one #10... that should have been the lead singer whoever it is... It must be Dee she is the best singer even though Puffy said she was fat... she is the Prettiest & the best..Save your money this CD is my newest Cup Holder!!! 2 stars, for effort!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly a good CD","review":"I never wanted to watch any of these reality TV shows given Diddy was probably going to create a band who will sell but aren't musically gifted. It was only til I saw some highlights on youtube that I realised that they are pretty darn good. Put on top of that the host of producers Diddy has brought in and we have a hit album. This album is a good one to listen to pretty much through, not too many stand-out tracks, but a solid RnB album and worth a listen.I am dissapointed for two reasons however, they knicked Cheri Dennis' track 'Back Up' and they weren't as good as her. They also ruined Sleep On it when it sounded better on the show, it wasn't made as well into a track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Bangin! Wish they'd do another one!","review":"I was late in getting in with Danity Kane, I didnt even know of them until a 2011 Amazon recommendation. Now I'm a hooked convert.

Great for parties,cruisin, anytime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Listen","review":"I'll Keep it short so all i have to say is that this cd is a great buy! You definately get your money's worth since i think all the songs are great and definately not \\"fillers\\" The cd is one of the best to be released so far 2006. Aguilera, Beyonce also are great albums but this review is about danity kane and boy am i in love with this cd, just pure delight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"Surprise, surprise this is actually a decent CD. I liked the show-whenever-I happened to catch it but I didn't see whatever it was that Diddy saw or where he was going with this group. Especially when he just threw five people together and then gave them five weeks to put something together. Then again, maybe that tells you something of the state of the music business. Let's throw something together and stick a sticker price on it. Anyhoot, the vocals are very good, the 'just add water' tracks are just okay. A few songs do get you to bob your head-so it never actually becomes white noise. A good effort as far a debuts go-but they are going have to step up the game a little to make an lasting impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"(:D)","review":"great CD i think diddy finally got it right this time i hope they keep up the good job and release another single and not just have one...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this one...","review":"I have watched all three seasons of the show and I grew really attached to this group before they released the album so I was going to get it before I heard anything...Now that I have heard it, I love it! I haven't listened to anything else since I got it four days ago. All of the songs have a good beat and all the girls in the group are fantastic singers...It's hard to go wrong! Not including the two interludes, there are only two ballads but they are both beautiful (Stay With Me is my favorite ballad on the album, the other one is Ride For You which is the one that they performed and I think it was called the Village Underground on the show so that one it good too). The other eleven (including the bonus track of Sleep On It) has high beats, they're fun, songs I love to sing along to (though I don't sing as well)! Over all this is a solid album!

I would think though that with them being aligned with Diddy that the album wouldn't be as \\"poppish\\", there's not much r&b, but whatever. Aundrea, D.Woods, and Dawn definitely got their shine on.

I think they are all very talented, beautiful, and are ready to work hard to make it in this business. With that said, I was rather disappointed with the CD.. Some of the tracks don't sound very \\"clean\\", they sound like drafts still rather than being polished. There are a couple of good tracks on there but I'm surprised that with the kind of talent that went into creating this record that it doesn't sound better.

When I found out the album debut at #1 I said hold up what's going on. A friend of mine let me listen to hers and I must say I was SHOCKED. The CD is actually good. From the first listen I fell in love with \\"Right Now\\" This is my fav song on the entire album...why cause of the mellow sexy mood and the harmonies they sing. I also like \\"Want it\\", \\"One Shot\\", and \\"Sleep on it\\". I must say the CD was very good and I hope they do break that Bad Boy curse and stay in the lime light.

To do this, she seems to find it necessary to downgrade Diana. Personally, I like Charles. He seems abundantly human, a good father, and how many people could wake up their children and have to break their hearts? He did an impossible job very well. However, on page 51, Junor writes \\"Apart from the companionship,... Charles had no need for a wife. His life was ordered, his meals were cooked, his clothes bought, laundered and laid out for him; his every whim catered for...\\". Is this what Junor thinks a wife does? If so, it's no wonder the marriage failed.

Sure, the actors are dressed to look like Mario but they hardly do anything that relates to him besides eating pizza and doing \\"plumbing\\". The animated parts are a little better, but not by much. They are mostly just parodies like \\"Koop-zilla\\" or \\"Pasta Wars\\". The enemies are colored wrong and look awful. After a parody it switches back to the live action part to end it.

Get The Adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog, that one is really funny and wacky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kids' show EVER!","review":"I loved this show when I was a kid. It's funny when I think back to watching it; I hated the live action sequence. All I wanted to do was watch the cartoon portion. Now, the main reason I purchased this set was for the live action part. Captain Lou Albano and Danny Wells make for the best comedic team! And you have to just love the music...and the way the two of them dance to it is priceless! This is a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Mario Bros Super Show disaster","review":"2 of the DVD's in the collection were badly scratched and not usable.

It was free with Amazon prime. They went to continue watching, where they left off and lo and behold, it's 1.99 an episode. What's up with that, Amazon? You get kids interested in something and then cash in on it? Very disappointed in you guys. This is the first negative review that I have ever posted about Amazon itself. Hopefully it'll be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great memories","review":"This is a must buy for anyone born in the mid 80's or just plain fans of the video games. Super Mario bros. goes way back. I love this show. The cartoons are reason enough to buy them. Although at some points the cartoon \\"glitches\\" a bit, with problems like mad discoloration, and wrong voice dubbs. It's actually outstanding how they messed up some things. The real-life show portion of the show is extremely cheesy but entertaining. The entire show itself is overall enjoyable. It certainly brings back alot of memories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My modern 4 year old son loves it","review":"We found this on Netflix (its an instant download). I find it nostalgic and embarrasingly lame. Cindi Lauper does a guest apparence. However, my 4 year old son LOVES it to pieces. His love for it is unbelievable. I think he is influenced by ads for Mario Galaxy II for the Wii. The datedness of this live action/animated show does not phase him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bike tube","review":"Previously I had purchases several bike tubes at Walmart and they didn't last very long. A bike rider recommended this brand and I'm pleased that I followed his recommendation. This tube is superior to other tubes purchased in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Tubes.","review":"I ordered two of these tubes to refit my road bike with. Prior to mounting onto the rim, I inflated both of them to 20 PSI. I instantaneously noticed three bulges on both tubes. Two were located next to the valve stem and one located about a quarter of a turn away from the valve stem. I installed the tubes anyway, inflated them to 60 PSI, and then put my road bike back onto the bike rack of my car. This bike rack keeps the bike off of the ground, ergo, no pressure on the tires. The next morning when I walked by my car I noticed that the rear tire of the bike was deflated. After removing the tire and tube, the tube had a 3 inch long tear right next to the valve stem where two of the bulges were located.I can only imagine how un-safe these tubes are in actual riding conditions considering the fact that they burst with no load on them and having never been ridden. I would certainly steer clear of these and choose another brand before trusting yourself on something such as these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunlite tire tube","review":"Bought these tubes to replace some older tubes when I replaced the tires on my bike. Tubes seemed flimsy. When I inflated the tires the tube on one tire imediately popped like a cheap balloon.

I bought these to replace two flats i had on my road bike (28c) and one of them went flat in less than 24 hours. I know it can't be the terrain because i live in a city and i purposely road very carefully the one time i rode it. As soon as i woke up the next morning the tire was flat. What the? So i took out the tube and was checking for leaks by inflating it- lo and behold there was a leak the size of a pen dot right under the valve.. i checked my rim and tire- nothing. Just a crappy tube.

Wasn't worth the trouble or money to send it back, but was annoying. Amazon should stick to books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Hold Air","review":"I read the reviews of this product and wasn't sure. I ordered anyway because it seems difficult to find tubes that receive consistently good reviews. I installed this tube without any problems, and I suppose it's working. However, it's been a couple of months, and I have to give this tube an extraordinary about of inflation prior to each ride. The tubes that came with my bicycle did not require nearly this much inflation, and I had those for many years. I suggest looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"Horrible tubes. Very annoying to inflate.

Frequently throughout the book, letters are substituted for one another, leaving the reader scratching his head as he tries to make sense of a sentence. For example, th is frequently replaced with m, changing \\"the\\" to \\"me\\" and \\"teeth\\" to \\"teem.\\" In several places \\"thing\\" is replaced with \\"tiling.\\" If you don't mind a little crytography with your reading, a fascinating novel is still there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review of Compelling Evidence","review":"Grisham fans will love this book. Expertly written and more descriptive than other Martini books, the tongue in cheek humor flows freely but still keeps you guessing until a very unpredictable end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged = Choppy","review":"The abridged audiobook should be avoided. The editor has completely mutilated the story by causing severe gaps in the storyline. This is most evident when the author tries to change scenes and it takes well into an entire paragraph, about 15 seconds, before I realize that an entire week or month has just passed me by in the story. I then spent the next 15 seconds trying to figure out who is in the new scene and where it is located. In another 30 seconds, the whole scene is over and you get to start again. This makes for some painful listening.Don't listen to the abridged version. Get the book or find the unabridged version somewhere else.If you are thinking you'd like to read more of the series, definitely read the first book though because it is here that Martini has developed and introduced the characters that are so relevant in the second book. Without the background, you miss some of the intended depth Martini tried to portray in this first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably dreadful!","review":"I am baffled by the 5 star reviews of this book. I tried to finish it but could not. The author over describes and over analyses absolutely everything. It is written in the first person, present tense and is really annoying. There is more padding in this novel than in an arm chair. The author gives his ridiculous thoughts over and over. I found myself screaming out aloud 'just get on with it, for pity's sake!' There is a gas chamber execution scene at the start of the book - if only the lawyer had been in the chamber, instead of as a witness, we would all be a lot happier. I will never read, or attempt to read, another offering from Mr Martini."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiobook review","review":"I was never a fan of Steve Martini, and, unfortunately or not, I will not be one after having listened to this audio adaptation. Now, sometimes bad audio versions of book can be due to the ineptness of the reader. But Joe Mantegna&#65533;s reading was full of energy and nuance, what there was available. I believe the problem lies within the source material. Martini has committed the cardinal sin of courtroom thrillers--he&#65533;s made them boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry but the book was horrible. I couldn't get into it","review":"It was horrible. One of the worst books ever. Thank youBelly Up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Miss Welty--how you can tell a story!","review":"It's true--hardly anything happens in this book--but I found the natural descriptions so beautiful--almost impresionistic and the unraveling of all the \\"tales\\" so fascinating! At first I was wondering how I could possibly be interested in the jailbird--Jack Renfro. But his own family loves him so. And I loved his darling little red-headed ex-schoolmarm wife. The irony of him saving the judge who sentenced him! It's so very funny. I laughed out loud. It's hard to tell who all the uncles and aunts are--but just read on--the stories will get told and it will become clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"This is by far the best book I have read which deals with Southern culture. This book is very funny. At first it was hard keeping all of the characters straight but after awhile it becomes easy and you really get to know them. I am sure for those who have read this book that they thought of certain individuals in their families which reminded them of the characters in the book. There are also just enough twists and turns to keep you interested. However, like someone previously stated, this is the most entertaining book in which absolutely nothing happens. Welty utilizes a sort of Hemmingway-esque dialogue with just enough of a Southern twist to make the characters come to life in a sort of familial (inbred) manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I having a bad hair day or is this novel boring?","review":"What's wrong with me? I love Eudora Welty's short stories. But this novel was exasperating. The story opens at a family reunion in backwoods Mississippi, where the author \\"overhears\\" endless conversations about nothing carried on by the Renfros and their kin. For hours, they debate whether the family antihero,, Jack Renfro, will appear at the reunion (after several years in the penitentiary).For 60 pages, I waded through trivial dialogue as family members eagerly awaited Jack's appearance. I gather from other reviewers' comments that the family bad boy did show up eventually, but by that time I'd left the party. I'd closed the book and drifted off to sleep.If you want plot action, this is not the book for you. I'd suggest you pick up Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor or even William Faulkner."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much dialogues","review":"If you like descriptions, run away from this book. They just talk, and talk, and it's so boring. Make a play with this, and perhaps the characters act in the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"a soap opera of poor people","review":"Ms. Welty has written, seemily, a book of her people, but I just could not read it. The Renfro clan was having a reunion on the day Jack Renfro was to arrive home from prison. It was also Granny's birthday. The best part of the story I read was of Jack's indiscretion tha led him to be incarcerated. I just could see this story going around and around, making mistakes of judgement and choices that run counter to the gerenal law of the land. It reminded me of \\"Tobacco Road.\\" It has a simalar hapless band of amilies that can not rise above the sorry state of life they are living. It is like a soap opera of poor people and it just does not strike me as interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring book EVER","review":"Our entire book club tried and tried - and we have all types of readers..........no one could get thru it. Too much like a play and surely not enough PLOT..we all finished it by duty.....I hear her short stories are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lose this book","review":"This novel is hideously overlong and completely unfunny. Eudora certainly knows how to create an atmosphere, that much is true, but this is an atmosphere I was eager to be done with, featuring the most miserable family reunion and godforsaken little town I've ever heard of. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Spring -- my first Henry Miller novel","review":"I just finished reading BLACK SPRING. It blew me away. Henry Miller's storytelling style is so personal, it's kind of like taking an unexpected medium punch in the gut. The geography becomes local, the imagery is rough, obscene and poetic, and goes on for pages at a time. Miller becomes larger than life, powerful through his honesty and vulnerability. I am amazed with his unique ability to effortlessly paint such vivid pictures, wander aimlessly through haunting nightmares, and relive pleasure and passion. From sitting around in the Parisian home of friend Jabberewohl Crondstadt celebrating each other's conquests and madness, to wandering the dark bum-piss hooker-lined streets of forbidden America, I found myself constantly stopping, re-reading and wondering how he took me there. Eventually I stopped raising my hand to ask questions, and just sat back and listened."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Horse in The Pissoire","review":"Black Spring is one of Miller's earlier efforts belonging to the Paris-written era of The Tropic's of Cancer and Capricorn. Whilst hilarious and enjoyable to read it suffers from too much Capricorn-esque angst-ridden soul rimming. A great book to read, but I would recommend Quiet Days In Clinchy as Miller's best French novel. It is equally humourous and has no extra pussyfooting around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Henry Miller - Black Spring","review":"I thought \\"Black Spring\\" was typically repulsive to read. I have only enjoyed reading \\"Hieronymus Bosch and the Oranges of Big Sur\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non est ars quae ad effectum casu venit . . .","review":"Snuggled like a tumor in between the two 'Tropics' came Henry Miller's grotesquely dull work of semi-self-indulgence, 'Black Spring.' He must have been suffering from some kind of social disease that he humped-up in Paris when this otherwise 1st rate, 2nd rate author vomited up this indigestible piece of trash.I hated every page of \\"Black Spring\\" save one paragraph in the first quarter of the novel in which Miller describes the coal-stained hands of a hot-coffined labourer. Notwithsitting that small bit of grin, I stand by my chopfallen displeasance for not having been forced at gun point to read 'Black Spring' from cover to shining black cover . . I volunteered to spend my time with this grotesque, libidinous assemblage - indeed, an air-conditioned nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too promotional","review":"While I agree there are some very good articles, I find this magazine to be way too promotional with most of the promotions pointing to RAND products and classes.

I cut my teeth on descriptive notation but it has been abandoned for good reason.

It was a little longer than I prefer, but a real page turner, great character development, a really good story that tugs at your heart and conscience. The only thing that prevented me from giving it 5* was the beginning, but plow on through and you will love it.

This book was terrible. No depth at all to the characters or the story, and the plot was completely unbelievable.I didn't like any of the characters, especially Cory, who I found incredibly annoying and obnoxious. It's hard to be sympathetic when you don't even like the character. Jack was an idiot, and Marion didn't make any sense. How could she not figure out what CeeCee/Eve had done? And why would CeeCee/Eve do something like that in the first place? What a dumb plot.I don't think I'll ever read another one of this author's books again - I returned this book for a refund, it was so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't disagree more.....","review":"Wow....I couldn't believe how much I disagree with the other reviewers. I also like Diane Chamberlain's books, but this was not one of her best. I thought the characters were not very well developed at all. I think because of that I also could not get past the fact that they were not really likeable. The writing did not captivate. I had to force my way through it.

Some of the essays are by such notorious writers such as C.S. Lewis and M.Z. Bradley. They look at Tolkien's world, races, characters, and the meaning of power in the trilogy, and the tones range from admiring to a little bit smug (surely, Lord of the Rings isn't \\"literarature\\" because... and then looking at a fixed idea, at the time, of what \\"literature\\" is.)

It is a classic movie and won Ernest Borgnine an Oscar. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's Hope for Everyone!","review":"Marty is a refreshingly real movie about a middle aged bachelor-butcher, Ernest Borgnine, who has gone through life being mistreated by indifferent women. He lives with a mother who has married off the rest of her offspring and harasses the low self-esteemed Marty about his single status. \\"Marty\\" follows the bachelor life of this butcher as he tries to make everyone else around him happy until he meets a \\"dog\\" of a woman that is his female equivalent.\\"Marty\\" reminded me of the current wave of independent films that follow realistic characters around in there depressing lives. Except, this film is truer to life in that it has real ups and downs. Life isn't really as those independent films portray with no hope and full of malignant people and depressing circumstances. Many people lead happy lives with hardships and trials similar to Marty; there is hope and happiness out there amidst the hard times."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is about the character","review":"Allow me to explain this film by stating that it is about the character. You must be able to identify with the type of person that Marty is to enjoy this film. He is a lonesome person that longs for a companion. Most people do not have such difficulty in finding the right mate; ergo, they would not be able to identify with Marty. You must be an empathic person to enjoy this movie. For instance, in Rebel Without A Cause, you must be able to understand the loner nature of Dean's character. In Gone With the Wind, you have to feel for Leigh's manipulative Scarlet O'Hara to enjoy the movie. Believe me, Marty is a fantastic film worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An acting tour de force by Ernest Borgnine.","review":"This is a simple, unadorned but effective mellowdrama.

They bond through simple conversation & find they have a lot in common. His mother, afraid of losing her boy to another women trys to break them up.

It was the scene where Clara goes home to talk to her parents about Marty. It was one of the nicer scenes.

I fell in love with Marty Piletti, a homely guy with low self-esteem, a pushy Italian Mamma and a heart of gold. The true mark of a masterpiece is when the viewer is inmersed in the story and emotionally connects with the characters on screen.

The scene that I am refering to is right after Marty takes Clara home there is a short scene where she tells her parents about her date and how happy she is. This scene lasted about a minute or two. I don't know what's wrong with MGM lately. They forgot to include the original subtitles in \\"Spinal Tap\\" they butchered half the \\"Bond\\" films with either missing scenes or non existent subtitles and now this. I think we as consumers deserve better than this. We've had to endure MGM's blunders for far too long.

Marty (Ernest Borgnine) has the normal desires of most men (of his day) -- to find a nice young woman and get married. This can only be achieved when he stops looking at women through the eyes of his friends or family. Borgnine delivers a powerful performance on lessons in non-superficial love.Costar Betsy Blair's name appeared in the \\"Red Channels\\" during the McCarthy era, effectively ending her acting career in the early 50s. Against all odds she won the role of a lifetime in this 1955 cinematic classic MARTY after dance legend Gene Kelly, her husband of 17 years (1940-1957), threatened to stop shooting pictures for MGM if she wasn't allowed the lead part despite the blacklist. It is a shame that even with the award her movie career and marriage came to a close.Movie quote: \\"You get kicked around long enough, you become a professor of pain.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Picture of 1955","review":"I knew very little about \\"Marty\\" when I bought it for my Academy Award Best Picture DVD collection. I was very pleasantly surprised by a wonderful performance by Ernest Borgnine, and actor whom I have admired for a long time. He plays a very gentle, kind butcher, unlike some of his other tough guy roles in \\"From Here To Eternity\\" and \\"The Wild Bunch.\\" The movie is only 90 minutes long, and it is a very simple story about how Marty meets a girl. It is very character driven, and I found myself identifying a lot with the prinicipal characters. Frank Sutton (Sgt.

There wasn't even a program notes sheet in the DVD case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!!!","review":"Marty is a great movie!

It has generated in me an interest to discover more about Zelda Fitzgerald which appeals to me personally, however, I do understand that some readers would find this biography frustrating in the way it leaves some questions unanswered. I think perhaps the author has set herself one goal and gotten caught up in another - ie. her introduction promises to reveal more of Zelda herself than her husband. What results is more an analysis of the marriage, as the subtitle indicates, but as a result neither Zelda nor the marriage are completely exposed. I certainly would not discourage anyone from reading 'Sometimes Madness Is Wisdom' because of this dichotomy. I would make two recommendations: 1)That this title will appeal to readers with an interest in history and/or literature as an academic pursuit more than readers of pop-bios 2) Wait for the paperback!"},{"rating":"1","title":"zelda fitzgerald","review":"This book, if one wants to believe, provides new information that is interesting, but a lot seems to be sensationalist conjecture. The author writes about the treaments of Zelda's disease used at the time, which one can believe she went through, but her interpretations of Zelda's thoughts and actions cannot be backed up with any proof. The author's analysis is sophmoric, and full of factual mistakes: \\"Noonie\\" was Zelda's neice, not her cousin, for example. If this author can write a biography, anyone can. Mitford's book still remains the best source on Zelda, and if that book disturbed Scottie Fitzgerald, this one would have made her hair stand on end. If you like yellow jounalism, you'll like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling Wisdom","review":"I am impressed with Kendall Taylor's supreme effort in writing this book. She has invested a great deal of her life, some thirty years, in researching all the material. It is a very interesting biography, but it seems she tries to do too much. There are so many details of the Fitzgeralds' friends and contemporaries that one gets bogged down in details. There are many repetitions of facts, and areas where one sees poor editing and sentence structure errors. It would appear that the author spent too much time on the book, and therefore its presentation is somewhat disjointed and disorganized. I would have preferred to see more emphasis on Zelda herself, instead of anecdotes regarding her frivolous lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Ramble","review":"Although the author, Kendall Taylor, begins her biography with a disdainful look at how all biographies of Zelda are about F. Scott Fitzgerald, she proceeds to do the same thing, badly.Not only does she discuss the friendship between the Fitzgerald's and the Hemingways. she also discuss all of their friends, enemies and the possible lovers of these same friends and enemies.There is nothing new. The biography is not well written, which I generally expect from a English professor (too self-involved.} Beside the mediocre writing, the proofing is terrible, as is the editing--if there was any--leaving mistakes and errors galore.If the reader is interested in Zelda and her descent into madness and what happened after Scott died, chose another book.

It had so many good ideas, potentially interesting plot points or character points or just something I hadn't seen before, but it never quite got off the ground for me. I liked the introduction, liked meeting Sebastian and learning about him, but his and Olivia's interactions didn't work and I didn't believe their relationship or care enough about either of them to spend 300 + pages. I started to skim, then jump, then jump backwards and even with all that dancing around, it didn't add up.

And of course after she's locked in, a bad storm erupts, flooding her cell and forcing her to move with the water thru a tunnel that empties out over a cliff. Our hero, upon seeing her clinging to the side of the cliff, knowing what happened states \\"I'm going to wring her neck\\". SERIOUSLY? For what, surviving? And he goes on in that vein, calling her a fool. That's just one example, though I could have put MANY.This book isn't worth reading even if free.

I guess I am particular. But one thing that has to be strong in any book is a desire to finish! And one needs to be interested in the characters. Sebastian Alexander is perhaps one of the most unlikable hero's (and I use that term loosely) I have ever read. Sure, handsome, but there was really not a facet of his personality that came across as likeable so unless our feisty spinster Olivia has a martyr complex, why be interested?

I enjoyed the characterizations especially and I don't count the intimate scenes when I read a romance. I am drawn to the characters. I am very drawn to a beautiful hero who's dark, taciturn, perhaps even cold but who is warmed by an equally beautiful heroine who is stalwart, kind, and intelligent. Hey, if I wanted reality I wouldn't be reading romance! I think the use of amnesia was very believable even though I could spot the murderer a mile away. But it was a good read. Carolyn Jewel's earlier novel Lord Ruin is worth a read as well. Give The Spare a try.

The tone of the book is insulting, and the inferences drawn from survey data are often leaps of imagination. This book, apparently written by aging boomers who are fearing for their jobs, treats gamers like an alien invasion. There are nuggets of useful wisdom, but you have to pick through the work with a fine-toothed comb to find them. The book's central message - that games are a part of American culture now and are as much a driving force as movies and television - should be obvious to anyone who does not live in a cave in the mountains and is not worth the pages of repetition the authors spent on drilling it home."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome, beautiful book","review":"i picked this up at borders in the bargain area and i'm thinking about going right back to give more as gifts. this a one of the most beautiful books, but more than beautiful great ingredient combinations. i love the european streak in this book. i find there are so many of the recipes i definitely want to try and i almost didn't buy it because it said 15 minutes or less, which i thought i would be discouraged about because i don't skimp on recipes, usually i don't care how long it takes as long as the food is memorable. this is a great cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I found most of the recipes in the book hard to prepare... definitely takes more than 15 minutes from start to finish!

The protagonist, Elvis, is slowly revealed through wonderful flashbacks as he tries to discover the identity of a murder victim who claimed, with his dying breath, that Elvis was his son. Since Elvis never knew his father, this is possible and the situation builds reader curiosity.The dialogue throughout is great. It is real and tangible. Crais knows how to set up a scene. Reading the book is like watching a movie in your mind!Each chapter brings the reader a bit closer to the identity of the murder victim. Even as the murder man's identity is revealed, the plot moves to finding the murderer and the motive. A fascinating ride of a book.Jump on, you'll be pleased you did. Crais is every bit as good as Lee Child and Elvis might even be a bit more believable than Jack Reacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone, but not forgotten.....","review":"Robert Crais possesses the sure hand of a master when it comes to spinning a gripping, tension filled and emotionally involving story.The main plot of his latest yarn has to do with Elvis Cole trying to determine the identity of the man who has made a dying statement alluding to the fact that he is Coles long lost father, a man Elvis has searched for most of his life. Is he or isn't he?? His attempt to get at the truth finds Elvis enmeshed in a spider-web of mystery and suspense.Returning characters introduced in previous Crais books include, Carol Starkey, maimed cop of Demolition Angel fame, and her \\"not so hidden\\" feelings for Elvis; Lucy, the love of Elvis's life, who loves him but can't seem to accept his choice of profession...and of course Elvis's best friend, the ever wonderful Joe Pike.

The story involves Elvis Cole's search for his father, which leads him to a crime committed years ago. Shades of Ross MacDonald. A lot of the action takes places in the seedier parts of LA and involves how the escort business operates in the city. Here there are echoes of Raymond Chandler's mean streets. And the book is full of snappy dialogue like the best novels of Robert B. Parker. Plus there's Joe Pike to do the dirty work a la Hawk.It all adds up to a really fun, exciting read from a mystery writer who always seems a little underrated to me. This particular outing in Crais' Elvis Cole series was a Shamus Award nominee and deservedly so. If you haven't read any of the Elvis Cole novels this would be an excellent place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"I've read a few Crais books and when he's good, I'm a huge fan. There is always some satisfaction in visiting old characters but this one stretches it pretty thin. In fact the book feels so weak and the story as a whole so pointless, you wonder what the point is. It's the kind of book from a good writer that can kill a series and makes you question the genre. It's not thrilling and it's not mysterious so what is it? And chapters that are half a page? Come on. There's just not allot of meat on the bones and I felt myself working hard to just get through it. Usually on holidays I roar through books like these. This one?

I am not an avid fiction reader but I have read almost all John Grisham plus some of the gritty stuff from Peleconos. I loved Grisham's earlier writing plus the latest Ford Country. I also mostly liked Pelecanos ( though not as much as the Wire). So I am not biased against the genre itself.This book totally disappointed me. The characters are not interesting, they are gaudy. All their musings are cheap writing nothing profound or even interesting there. The drama is not engaging and the suspense is not thrilling. The twists and turns in the story are as artificial as a fake stream in Disney land.I know a lot of people just love this writer. All I am saying is he did not do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much there","review":"I really did not enjoy this book and am glad to be finishrd with it .... the story line was interesting - unbelieveable but interesting ... the action and character development was weak ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"\\"The Forgotten Man\\" is a far cry from \\"The Last Detective.\\" It wanders for 356 pages to a ridiculous ending. Overwritten and not at all helped by the whining Carol Starkey and her fantasies about Elvis Cole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair at best","review":"I was a fan of Crais' up until Hostage and The Last Detective. Thought I would try one more book and bought the e-book version of the Forgotten Man. The book feels forced to me. The plot seems superficial and simple with no real relevance except to offer a stage for character development. Pike is relegated to a throw-away character with no real role which is a real shame. Carol is back but for no good reason. I would recommend that you stay away from this one and read the early books with real mystery/detective stories and where the relationship between Pike and Cole takes center stage. Also, do not buy the adobe ebook version if you plan on reading this on a Palm. The conversion is Horrendous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't be listed as a mystery...","review":"This book would have made a nice side note in the series but it's not really a mystery. The whole premises seems stupid as to why he is even involved in this case in the 1st place. I think if we wanted to investigate Cole's origins, it could have been done in a much better fashion -- say Last Detective style. I guess I can't stop thinking at how long we've waited for this book and this is all the fans got? It's not much of a mystery and Joe barely has any space in the book. He really shouldn't of even been mentioned! And is it just me or was Carol Starkey always that dumb and co-dependent? Because she is really, really annoying in this book... hope that Robert Crais has fleshed out these characters demons and we can get back to a good mystery one of these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of the Better Elvis Cole Novels","review":"I am a big fan of Robert Crais, but I feel that the quality of his novels has been slipping recently. \\"The Forgotten Man\\" continues this downward trend, in my opinion. The plot in this novel feels contrived and forced. When the \\"real\\" criminal is finally exposed at the end, this \\"surprise twist\\" is not realistic - mostly due to weak character development.Joe Pike is my favorite character, and he is completely wasted in this novel. Carol Starkey returns, and the inclusion of her character is totally unnecessary (and, quite a distraction at times). Crais always has good dialogue in his novels, and even his weaker works are better than most authors' best attempts. However, I strongly recommend his earlier works for those who have not yet read any of his novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Crais I'll read for a while","review":"I enjoy reading authors who have recurring characters and Elvis Cole and Joe Pike are great. I read every book Crais wrote from the beginning and have found them to be fun to read and hard to put down. But with this book I have lost my desire to continue. His books are getting a little too violent but most of all I don't like the way his books end now. The heroes win but pay too great a price. I recommend the earlier books but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taut suspense . . . and a fine plot","review":"Elvis Cole, former cop, current PI, gets a call: a dying man asked for him, claiming to be his forever lost father.The characters have depth and the plot has more twists and turns than a forest trail. And it all holds together.Crais has acheivied that relative rarity: a page-turner that you don't want to end.Jerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader sounds bored to death","review":"And succeeded in boring me as well. I have always enjoyed Elvis Cole so am not sure it is the storyline or the awful dead-tone narration but this is the only time I've left Elvis to discover the ending without me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgotten Man Should be","review":"I have read every Crais Book based on Elvis and would give each one 4.5 or 5 stars. Elvis is a \\"character\\" as is \\"Pike\\" and I found each previous book impossible to put down.I did not care for Forgotten Man as we learned about his past (Elvis) and much relived via flashbacks. The story was a bit convoluted as an excuse to tell us about the Elvis as a child, etc. Don't need it.Frankly, I do not care about the past of Elvis because I enjoy him as he is. Also felt this book did not give us the wisecracking gumshoe that is so much fun with Elvis and Pike.I guess I don't think you need to flesh out something that is perfect to begin with. As they say, \\"if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.\\"Elvis lives but not to my taste in this book.Bring back more of what we have in the past. I would find it hard to recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"Robert Crais writes yet another great Elvis Cole thriller that is sure to draw you in from beginning to end.Crais has the ability to give his characters life which gives his stories that extra power. Keep up the good work.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I started reading Robert Crais books strictly by accident, having bought the first one at the Hospital gift shop for 25 cents. After the first, I started buying more as they all had that quality of suspense and surprise endings I'm fond of. The Forgotten Man was one of the best. Having started with Elvis getting a call from a cop saying his father had just died. And from there it just got better."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT BOOK","review":"Please ignore the first reviewers comments. He must be reviewing the wrong book. This book as NO advertisment in it so it must be another book he meant to review so I will not fault him for giving this book such a poor rating. This was so good that I had to look it up on Amazon and write a review on it. I bought it at the store but I do a lot of shopping on amazon. This book has tons of factural information and a lot of good stories about hunts and how they were planned and how they went. The author of this book was very subjective in his words and appears to be an expert on the subject. I would reccoment this book above all others on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Largely Disappointing","review":"I'm very glad I found this at the library before ordering it. This book is essentially a bunch of commercials for companies whose products the author uses and/or which are owned by his hunting buddies (e.g., the section on blackpowder which is one big ad for rifles made by pal Tony Knight) interspersed with yarn after yarn which relate ad nauseam what a deadeye Richey is in a ground blind or treestand. I understand that an instructor has to establish his credibility AND illustrate that his lessons work, but the me-great-hunter stuff gets old in a hurry. If you were to cull the useful information out of this book of stories, it would amount to about two type-written pages.This Lyons Press edition is also a retread. The work was originally published in 1986 by Outdoor Life Books as Hunting Fringeland Deer. That was a much more accurate title; I'm afraid this one isn't the \\"Ultimate Guide\\" to anything. See any of the Greg Miller books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"First time I heard it, I liked it. On subsequent plays, I liked it lesser and lesser to the point that I don't listen to this CD anymore. I just can't. SHK's touch on the sitar is too soft for my liking. I really had to strain to hear his strokes over the drone and tabla (contrast that with the crystal clear crisp note rendition of Ravi Shankar) in the second track. The other issue is that I find his playing to be very repetitive. Particularly when contrasted with someone like Ravi Shankar, whose creative genius leaps out in the way he improvises, in SHK's case, there isn't nearly enough of improvisation. That said, the compositions he plays are truly very beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fanny Pack","review":"Just the right size for lunch, medical pack, and extras. 2 water bottles are a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic pack!","review":"I love the High Sierra Ridgeline Lumbar Pack. The zippered compartments are big enough to carry all my essentials while taking the dog on a long walk or while hiking. But it isn't over big. I love the 2 bottle holders. Sometimes I like to take water and a sports drink so that is great. Other times there will be 1 bottle water for me and 1 bottle water for my dog.

Ended up getting this cd for 1 penny. Best freakin penny I ever spent. This should be up for best album of 2004. Fav tracks are \\"Staring at the Sun\\", \\"The Average Man\\", \\"The Commuter\\". But all the songs are great. If you are looking for something refreshing and original get this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Disc","review":"If you're a fan of Bob Dylan, Badly Drawn Boy, or anything left of the mainstream, Simple Kid is for you. He's got a quirky vioce that smacks of Neil Young, and a sound that bounces all over the place. \\"Staring at thr Sun\\" and \\"Truck On\\" are the most accessable tracks, but others like \\"Average Man\\" and \\"Drugs\\" are socially irreverent and fun. Buy it if you dare to be different. It's bound to be popular, and that starts with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Kid on the block","review":"With interest in the likes of Drake and Buckley being invigorated in recent years, there has been a surge in the number of troubadours in the music world. While most seem to happily follow the footsteps of Messrs Drake, Buckley (x2) and Dylan, Simple Kid embellishes his influences with his own experimental samples and insightful, unique lyrical style. Imagine Dylan and Badly Drawn Boy fighting with Casio keyboards and you start to get the idea. Standout tracks such as 'Staring At The Sun' and 'Average Man' are thrilling and joyous, and the rest of the songs are great fun. An assured debut that is not afraid to be different, and promises much more in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best original album i've seen in a while","review":"If you like bands such as radiohead and the vines, you'll love Simple Kid. Simple Kid combines a very original mix of electronics, acoustic/electric guitars, and a somewhat vintage feel to create these 11 awesome sounding tracks. Songs such as \\"Truck On\\" and \\"Kids don't care\\" offer a break from your typical \\"made for MTV\\" music. I DEFINATELY recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fit for Panasonic SDR-H200 camcorder","review":"I compared several cases (Lowepro Edit 110 Camcorder Bag/Edit 120, Samsonite, Case Logic TBC-5) for the Panasonic H200 camcorder at a BestBuy store and a Walmart supercenter. Amazon suggests Lowepro. Case Logic seems to be the cheapest out there with good quality, though it is never among the best sellers on Amazon. I wonder why! I finally bought this piece on a Walmart sale much cheaper than anywhere else. It has got more space than the Lowepro models. I could put in my Canon A620 digicam as well and the cables and the accessories I had for both of them. A quick charger could go in as well, making it a very good fit for my camcorder.The previous review explains several features in detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased!","review":"This was not my first Case Logic purchase.

I like to be able to carry both my camcorder and digital camera, also all the accessories that are needed when out on the road. It is not bulky, very comfortable to carry and does not take up a lot of space. This is a very nice case and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't wait to watch this again...","review":"As someone who is a lover of biographies, especially political biographies, I was thrilled the first time that PBS ran this series on the Rockefellers. I only knew bits and pieces about the family from articles that I read. But, watching the miniseries really sparked my fascination. To see how the family evolved from the patriarch, old \\"devil\\" Bill Rockefeller, into the philanthropic dynasty that we know was a particularly interesting journey. I would encourage everyone to buy this series because it combines all the elements of a good story: love, sex, angst, losses and victories. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suffers from typical PBS faults","review":"The program is annoying in a number of ways. First it is quite superficial. It never goes into any detail re how the fortune was built up. Rockefeller just suddenly owns a big refinery and is on the way to riches. You never learn how he managed to assemble the money for his first refinery. Then it has a parade of pointless commentators. Why do PBS productions always need a parade of people making one or two minute comments all the time. They are simply identified as \\"historians\\". Affiliated where? What justifies calling them that? Do they just appear and say \\"I am an historian and want to be hired to make comments\\"? Most of the comments don't add anything to the story and some of them obviously dramatize what little they have to say to shine in their two minutes of glory. The background sounds are excessive. The content is so thin that everything the DVD says could be said in half the time. Another PBS failure of a production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud background music.","review":"\\"The Rockefellers\\" It's a lousy product. I could not watch it without interruptions. The worst thing is the background music. Most of the time it is very loud. Moreover, the choice of music does not match to its contents at all.It makes me DIZZY time to time; sometimes it makes me feel I'm going crazy. And this is not the only one. There are some other PBS DVDs with too loud background music.The contents? It's OK. Four stars.But, still....How could anybody watch a DVD when it discomforts you so much? This product deserves ony one star, overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of two great albums by this band","review":"Pablo Cruise was under-rated when they were around and are undeservedly forgotten now. They produced two great albums, 'Worlds Away' and 'A Place in the Sun' at a mid-point in their career. Earlier albums were uneven, at best, and later albums didn't have more much to say but I'm proud to have these two albums on my shelf. 'A Place in the Sun' had it all: strong melodies, unforgettable hooks, versatile musicianship on every instrument, and great vocals. Though typically regarded as a straight pop band Pablo Cruise smoothly blends elements of pop, jazz, surf music, reggae, and even country music into the mix: so smoothly, in fact, that a lot of critics didn't even notice. One other thing: I'm a notoriously grumpy person and listening to this album puts a smile on my face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Withstands the test of time","review":"This was the first album I bought with my own money, and I must say that it has withstood the test of time.

The Fellowship had a significant impact in southern India, saving many children from the abusively destructive fate of Hindu temple prostitution. Gold Cord is an inspiring and instructive volume on the topic of being wholly dedicated to Christ and how to follow His guidance in a practical way in the midst of opposition and difficulty."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gold cord book","review":"This book is very needed in the life of a Christian.

From the drill instructor with a mind at war to a genetically enhanced fish with Godzilla on its mind every level plays and looks very different.The voice talent is top notch and most of the characters are kind of freaky in a hilarious way.If you like games with humor or ones that are slightly weird you need to pick this game up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychonaut means traveler of the mind","review":"Don't let the Cartoony Character Designs fool you! this game is great, and deserves a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"psychonuts","review":"This is a fun game to play but the one thing that REALLY got on my nerves was the 35 second load time.

Well, this is a 2006 French film about some gangster types that take on, well, a bunch of strange stuff, like the living dead & some other supernatural beings, I guess. This is super duper low-budget & I had to laugh at the part where there's a metal ball attached to a chain and a close up (bad move) reveals that it's actually a tether-ball. Despite the low budget and limitations, once you're past about the first 20 or so minutes of this it gets strangely appealing, in a Euro-trash kind of way. Lots of gunfire, lots of creepy make-up and plenty of weirdness overall. Definitely this won't be for everyone though.

Were I asked to describe this book, I'd say this book reads like a (long) conversation you might have, were you to sit on a park bench with someone who worked at Los Alamos during WW II... The book provides a glimpse into what life was like at the labs - you won't learn about the physics of the bomb, but you'll get highly personal views on the politics of that time. Were I to have a complaint about the book, it would be that the book relies heavily on one primary source for a great portion of the book, and while that character did have a very unique and interesting perspective, we are left with \\"her\\" opinions of others thoughts and motivations - not a problem, and really unavoidable given the wealth of source material her primary source left her.

Rather than pretending to give advice that will supposedly change your life for the better (laugh) Larry takes the approach in this one of just plain rambling for the sake of it. I'm sure he figured that if he churned out another book, many of his sheep, I mean fans, would snap it up in a heartbeat just to get the latest dose of Larry's wisdom.Do yourself a favor, save your money and stop buying into this garbage. Larry is about as interesting and original as watching paint dry. The shock value, in your face stuff, and the point-out-the-obvious routine has already been overdone for years now, it's not refreshing and it's not funny.Typical Larry Winget, and by that I mean utter and completely garbage.

Or in games with a lot of people. weapons can be hard to come by, so Ammo Regen is preferred. My biggest problem is getting connected.

But I thought it lacked a lot of the interest of the other AG mysteries. The story switches between a ghostly legend and a search for treasure, both of which plots would have been better on their own but were poorly combined. There were a lot of fortunate coincidences in the plotline, and Josefina essentially followed around while others solved the mystery. She was not proactive like the other heroines, such as Kirsten, and seemed unsure and almost melodramatic, which is out of character. Frankly, I found myself bored and hoping the story would pick up, but it never did. For much younger children this may be an interesting story, but I'm personally hoping Josefina will receive a better mystery soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fanatsy at its best.","review":"Santos hypothesizes that Atlantis was in Indonesia. Even though he claims the hypothesis to be scientifically based, its actually a supernaturalistic view, not scientific in the least. Much of the evidence taken from scriptures. He goes through the ancient legends, religions and myths and collects what suits him best. Like most speculations about Atlantis, his evidence is thin or non-existent. In fact one could classify the author as a creationist. The best scientific evidence for Atlantis points to its identification with the Greek island of Santorini (Thera) and its advanced civilization which suffered a cataclysmic eruption about 3000 BPE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"Isn't it accepted by now that \\"Atlantis\\" was on Thera, which blew up in the mid-2d millenium BC, becoming the Santorini archipeligo?

Instead people rush out to read silly pseudo history written by a guy who titles himself \\"Prof.\\" What kind of nonsense is that: \\"Prof.\\"? Not Doctor, or even Professor? No letters after the name is generally a sign that we're dealing with an amateur historian, which isn't so bad, if you think that Troy was located by an amature, Shakespeare's identity plausibly argued by an amature, and Homer's Ithaca arguably located by an amature; however, Southeast Asia as the location of a Helladic civilization?

Having had the amazing privilege of being able to see this band live in Invercargill, New Zealand on 3 separate ocassions in their early days (ie 1975 - 1978) I would point out that what comes across on this album and all other albums of there's is only a small sample of the incredible talent within the Enz. All their other albums are also a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"Split Enz is certainly a major group that influenced many later artist.

I ended up gluing rubber patches to the inside of the strap to improve this.Worse, the strap tensioner actually broke apart after just over a year of use. The pivot pins are just not up to the rest of the build quality.Pros- Good light for sodium lit city streets- Really waterproof- Solid caseCons- The 'no tools' strap simply sucks.- You'll need another light if it is genuinely dark where you ride.Not really worth the investment.

However, these are not powerful enough to illuminate a trail, road, or pothole. In short, the light is excellent tool to acknowledge your position to oncoming motorists and other cyclists. The flashing mode is especially easy to see. Yet, the light is simply not powerful enough to illuminate the ground before you.

Rogovin's sympathies are distinctly with Trotsky, but this does not impede an objective account where the facts of the terror speak horribly for themselves.

The Beatles made it up themselves.. It helped their \\"Record Sales\\" at the time.They had stopped tourning \\"Live\\" , cos they were \\"Burned out\\" with the live audiaunces. They could not tolerate all the \\"screaming and yelling\\" from their fans anymore.John stated, \\"They can't even hear us on stage , so what's the point of being there.\\" So they stopped in 1966.that was the year I saw them twice on stage. > Wow.. nothing like it since...>But this book covers all the clues and all the little things about Paul that you may not know, when they were \\"planning his dimise\\".I would pick it up, it is very Intresting to read.I learned some things I did not know...Read it. It is \\"Enlightning\\"\\"Beatles Bird\\"2006"},{"rating":"1","title":"IS PAUL DEAD???","review":"This book is very well researched and written, but I believe the writer missed a golden opportunity to put this rumor to death once and for all. Instead of examining the physiological differences, if any, between the pre-1966 Paul and the post-1966 Paul, the author simply rehashes old \\"clues.\\" Although interesting, the \\"clues\\" do not shed any new light on this subject. Is Paul dead or isn't he? The question still persists, and the author of this book never addresses that issue. It would appear from his writing that the author simply accepts the fact that this was a \\"hoax.\\" However, not everyone shares this view and this book does little to sway the reader one way or the other. If you're a die hard Beatles fan, don't bother reading this book, but if you're a non-Beatle person looking for information on this piece of Rock-N-Roll history, then I think you will find this book very interesting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A completely pointless book","review":"What is the point of this book? Its premise is a hoax. Paul didn't die. Sure, there was a rumor, and once started people started looking for facts to fit the bill. But, I repeat: Paul didn't die. He never even pretended to die. It wasn't a PR stunt, it isn't a proper Beatles story worth spending the time of day on -- it's just something that originated with a casual joke and gathered its own momentum. It had more to do with crackpot fans and conspiracy theories than reality. However well written a book about nothing might be, at the end of the day, it's still flimflam."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must","review":"This book is a must read, if like me you stumbled on to the paul is dead rumor on the internet and got stuck to it, you must read this book.

As a young beatles fan, Im only 24, I love reading books about them, in fact I collect them as well as videos, so I can see how it was all on those great times I missed by far.

Look no further! This book has every clue imaginable - including clues that have sprung from the internet age. This is an exhaustive look at the hoax from many different angles. One of the most pleasurable aspects of the book (beyond the guilty pleasure of the subject matter) is the short and easily digested chapters, making this a perfect nightstand read.The author, to his credit, doesn't have an axe to grind here. He doesn't try to convince you to accept any theory (Is Paul dead? Was it all coincidence? Was it a hoax by the Beatles to sell more records?), but just presents the historical facts and on-the-record comments as best they are known.

The answer, I think, is that when not filled with a kind of self-congratulatory contempt for the ego of successful writers, (and, by the way, this book is all about how writers crave fame and not at all about many writiers, male and female, who write because they need to write), it reeks with contempt and scorn for unsuccessful writers. And the wives of writers. And the narrator's own troubled children. In fact, everyone.The voice here is so cynical, so knowing, so obsessed with reputation, that I found it unbearable. I'm not a writer so maybe I'm naive about this, but I don't buy that even in the muscular era of Norman Mailer,Philip Roth etc., all writers cared about were prizes and sales and...other people's wives."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the male perspective","review":"Because of my business (author) and genre (relationships) I try to keep up with books marketed to women.

I'm not giving anything away by noting that Joan Castleman, the narrator of this story, decides to leave her husband - this detail is revealed in the first chapter of the book, very early on. From there, she goes back and forth between describing the past (how she met her husband, his literary career, etc) and the present. It is the ending that seems so unbelievable to me and a throwback to earlier types of fiction, where women sacrifice themselves for love. A tale of two deeply dysfunctional people, in a marriage that lasted far too long, not particularly enlightening or engaging to read about."},{"rating":"2","title":"No surprise to me...","review":"I'm not quite sure how anyone could have been surprised by the alleged twist ending of this novel. I caught on very early-- Wolitzer drops clear hints throughout that make it pretty obvious to the careful reader.

She builds the case very carefully for us and it is important that she do so because we might be inclined to think she's just a sad, aging whiner.

It is also very difficult to get my gear out of the bag, which makes me want to take less pictures, which is a VERY bad thing. That is the ultimate reason why I gave it two stars, and why I was thinking of only giving it one star. What is the reason for schlepping a camera and accessories around if you are never going to take them out of the bag? I was disappointed, since I have only ever purchased Lowepro camera bags.

Inside, I carried my XTi with the 28-300mm lens attached, my 50mm, my fisheye, my macro add on, about 5 of my filters in their individual cases and for a short period of time held my gorilla pod inside! I also kept my batteries and charger on the inside. I got a new wide angle lens for christmas and though it does fit in the bag it is incredibly tight and I now have to put my tripod through one of the easy lock features on the side of the bag.

The other manufacturer units I had gotten for other rooms didn't have this large of a gap.

This is one of the few albums I listen to over and over again and never tire of, these guys kick ass and they make it seem so easy. Highly reccomended.

I have played in adult flag football leagues, in a whole other part of the country, and the rules were consistent with the NFL Flag Football rules and guidelines.

Danny Elfman rocks with his new Oingo Boingo rock band in the 80's who would soon become one of the best pop bands in the 80's with Danny Elfman and Steve Bartek playing guitar, Vatos on drums, and Oingo Boingo's incredible horn section.This is a fan favorite. Boingo's first album is mainly Devo and XTC-influenced punk with wild songs about dispicable people and outsiders. Funny, satirical. This album rocks hard. Later Boingo would introduce different sounds into their songs.Lyrics definately Danny's.

Do you even keep your draft picks, or trade them away for the established star? Do you raise ticket prices (and potentially alienate your fan base)? And what do you spend to keep your players healthy and on the gridiron? All these questions - and others - play a large role in the game.Football Mogul is a fabulous game if you were a fan of text-based simulations, and I'd recommend it. But if you're looking for a Madden-like experience, this one's not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant Director's Early Effort an Appalling Mess","review":"Boxcar Bertha, director Martin Scorsese's second film, is an appalling mess. The acting is terrible, the editing sloppy, the story uninspired and dull, and the directing, dare I say it, is unsure and incompetent. Thank goodness Scorsese was able to learn from his mistakes and move on to the artistic brilliance he showed in his later work.The entire film really suffers from the Roger Corman production, who often gave his directors only 7 or 8 days to shoot a film, and the editing really needs the sure hand of his future editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who is one of the secrets behinds Scorsese's success as a director. I still think Scorsese is one of the most brilliant directors in the history of film, but sadly, with this dog of a film, he was saddled with a dull story, poor production, and stiff acting. Only recommended if you are a die-hard Scorsese fan and want to watch his entire body of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Fabulous","review":"Love this book, as well as Weekend With Wendell.

My five-year-old brother enjoys himself very much with its CD-ROM version, including interesting animation, melodious song and a *treasure hunt* game.The story teaches us what the word *brave* really means. Sheila Rae thought that walking backwards with her eye closed, riding bicycle no-handed with her eyes closed, etc., were *brave*. Actually I prefer the word *foolish* to *brave*, because she might get hurt. On the contrary, Louise, his sister was called a *scaredy-cat*. However she was the one who save Sheila Rae from getting lost. She was the real *fearless* girl in the story.After all, I think Sheila Rae, the Brave is very fascinating, which is a great book for kids at the ages of 4-8."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"There is something deeply troubling with this book - it seems benign but when you consider it -- it is very violent and dark. Sheila Rae pretends that the cherries are the \\"eyes of dead bears\\" and she climbs trees who she imagines are evil creatures and breaks their fingers off. How gruesome is that? I won't even read this book to my children, because I know they'd be very disturbed by the mean, violent imagination that Sheila has towards animals and nature. My children are softies when it comes to animals and creatures, I suppose, but isn't that normal?Old Bear by Kevin Henkes is one of my children's favorite books, very sweet and poetic...so I'm puzzled that this book is so disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"This book is not what I thought it would be. After reading several books from this same author, I thought the book would teach a lesson and be entertaining. Although the book has great illustrations and is quirky, I don't like how it goes about teaching a lesson on how to be brave. There are certain things to the story that I don't like and I don't think it would help kids. I even think it may be a little hard for young reader's to understand what the author point is."},{"rating":"2","title":"a positive spin on true bravery","review":"A little \\"Girl\\" (really mouse) learns that even those who are brave sometimes are not, and that those who don't think they are can be when they do things that are hard.

It came on a small pallet that the delivery person left on the porch. The packaging was damaged but the bar and weights were free of any scratches, dings, etc. The bar is solid and so are the weights. The whole set is perfect with one exception: the triangle pattern of the three hand holds. I really wish that there were just two hand holds positioned exactly across from eachother so that i could use each plate as an individual free weight. Since the hand holds are somewhat offset it makes this slightly more difficult. It is not too hard to work around but the set would be ideal if this was changed. Other than that I would highly recommend these weights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious.....","review":"So, since I'm from Luxembourg and have the opportunity to see this on German TV, it is the synchrone version.

So little of serious, critical and insightful nature exists about Taft and his times. That said, Hamby's work has the sure-feel of insight.

Wakeman shouldn't try to write \\"songs\\"; the lyrics are usually too simplistic, and the story is thin. This is the case with both this album and \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth.\\" None of the vocalists have particularly strong voices in either set. The cumulative affect is music where the voice overshadows any of Wakeman's music. His best works are \\"Six Wives\\" and \\"Criminal Record\\", where vocals are nearly non-existent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"As a long time Rick Wakeman fan it always puzzled me why King Arthur was missing from my collection, now I know why. Compared to the 'Journey' album this is a disappointment, the vocals are muddy and there is no story being told, just a collection of Wakeman tracks with an orchestral backing.

The powerful motor - a gas guzzler by all accounts - is too powerful for me. It's also a little too noisy.If you really want to get this one instead of the oral b, would suggest giving the soft bristles version a whirl instead - the softer bristles might be a little less abrasive on the enamel than this is.But the price and the fact that it does do its basic job - cleaning teeth - keeps me from giving it a 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"I've read several of Clancy's Op-Center books.

Too much on stocks and currency and not enough action. The whole idea of a Japan rising is old too and just a bit cheesy...maybe in 1985 it would have been more topical.I love Tom Clancy books.

I will say that this book was harder to put down because, like so many others up to this point, I'm a raging Clancy Fan.I own both the hardcover and audio tape of this book. I love the audio. The suspence is non-stop and really brings to life the characters of this novel. The reader (his name escapes me) should receive an award of some kind. He gives the novel the justice it deserves. I hope he reads other Clacy novels in the future.One final note, I actually woke my wife up to tell her how the book ended. I was amazed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm really disappointed Tom","review":"Clancy's plot never really worked out. While the ending was something different, the ability to solve the crisis with Japan was completely unoriginal. Another problem; the book is WAY TOO LONG!!!!. for 990 pages, I expected more. The book could've been written in a lot fewer pages and a lot more trees would still be alive. This book brings to mind another Japanese conflict: the Russo-Japanese war. Russia looked all too powerful when taking on the Japaese. However, just like Clancy's book, the got beaten badly and only saved face due to a few twists in negotiations from the President of the United States"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book.....read his other books","review":"very surprising for me to write this since I *really* like his other books. This book is verbose and meanders off into too many separate stories. Save your money and read something else. Having read his other books, I seldom look at the reviews, but I should have paid closer attention to some of the recent ones. If this is your firct Clancy purchase, don't start here. Red Storm Rising, though old is a classic. So is Hunt for Red October or Without Remorse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Clancy writes about Strategy like Clive Cussler","review":"Debt of Honor by Tom Clancy is another successful Jack Ryan book. Inthis book a wealthy Japanese bussinessman out to avenge his parents deaths at the hands of the Americans makes an unlikely enemy for Ryan. The possibility of weapons of mass destruction being used against the United States is not a pleasant thought. Clancys writing shines as he describes Ryan as the US National Security Advisor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, believable","review":"Another one of Tom Clancy's action-packed novels. Could war really break out between the US and Japan? It sounds credible. But the ending will really surprise you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much confusing data - not enough plot and story line","review":"Clancy needlessly wastes words and pages explaining details that are far too intricate to be truly necessary to advance the story line. He's still a great writer, but this material should be in a technical manual not a work of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS ANYONE STILL AWAKE?","review":"Basically, this book is for people with sleeping disorders who don't want to take sleeping pills. Common! 400 pages of economics lessons, Geez! Read Red Storm Rising. One of his few novels without Jack Ryan worship and one that is not as boring as Debt of Honor. And that's truly sad for Clancy fans who've come to expect more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book!","review":"Tom Clancy in my opinion, has great insight about the government and military. His books are very captivating and exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOORING","review":"I had never read a tom clancy book until I read this. From the beggining this book was horrible. I stopped after 70 pages. I thought I was reading non-fiction. I think Clancy might have gone overboard with the details on this book. I dont even know what the story is about. Maybe it's just me but unless you want to be board to death dont read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy gives the cash-cow a kick","review":"I'm an avid reader of Tom Clancy's fictional and non-fictional work, and IMHO he has never missed the mark.....except with this one. The plot becomes more preposterous with every turn of the page. The description of the Japanese \\"sneak\\" attack on the U.S. (I won't spoil it) is ludicrous, and I actually laughed out loud at the scenario. Some of the extremely over-simplified technological and financial situations border on insulting the average readers' intelligence. I came away with the impression that Clancy had some good ideas, but didn't have the time to develop them individually for his publishing contract. The result is a foul stew of pure tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too lengthy...","review":"Just like the other Clancy's books, this book is too lengthy. Could Clancy consider cutting his books a bit? I am not talking about the technical stuff. I am talking about getting rid the scenes which have no use and serve no purpose. The scenes are too disconnected. Each scene is too short. Sometimes just two small paragraphs. You just can't get into it. Why doesn't Clancy put Jack Ryan in the middle and make everything go around him more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book I have ever read","review":"I thought Tom Clancy was a great writer after reading Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Rising. But this novel I found virtually impenetrable. It takes hundreds of apges for anything to actauly happen. Japanese men soaking in hot tubs discussing economics isn't my idea of a gripping read. And for the family killed in a car accident to we really need to know that the baby \\"did a job\\" beforehand? To me that's simply pointless detail that slows down the narrative to a crawl. And at 1000+ pages that style of writing is going to really wear a reader down. In all truth I skipped about half this book out of tedium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific teacher resource","review":"I love this teacher resource book! I have never been especially fond of math so for me to love this math resource book is a strong testament to its interest level and the way the author can weave math into so many other subject areas. The book is jammed with interesting facts that lead to interesting mathematical investigations. It helps both my students and me see math in everyday experiences. There is also a thorough biliography with references for more materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I had to rate this product with a single star because there is not option for no stars.The package contains a single plastic rectangle with an adhesive backing. The intent is the user is supposed to clean the pda screen and stick the plastic shield to it. The instructions indicate that any bubbles can easily be pressed out using a credit card (there is a small cardboard card enclosed).Well - the protector installs under the screen frame tightly so any bubbles are permanent. It is very hard to get off as it has an adhesive background and the edges are not accessible. I had to use a Zacto knife and that damnaged an edge of the protector thereby defeating the purpose (and ruining the protector) - to protect and provide clarity.I do not recommend this product. It was too frustrating and frankly, way overpriced."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ozark's, 'It'll Shine When It Shines'","review":"This is the Ozark's brilliant 2nd album. The playing and muscianship is second to none with perfect timing. The harmonies of the group are up there with CSN&Y. For me there is only one song which I am a bit complacent about and that is Jackie Blue. It is the more populist of all the songs and at the time got a lot of air play on radio which probably explains my lack of enthusiasm for it. All the other tracks are unique and faultless. If you love this brand of country rock which is infused with bluegrass and roots derivitives, then you have to add this to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 70s Sound","review":"After listening to this CD, I felt like I was a teenager again.

It worked as reported and was easy to install (under a minute). The swivel head worked well. Glad I purchased it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tall for my sink!","review":"This aerator/sprayer was the right price and I do like the spray control, but it caused my sink faucet to be so low that I couldn't fit tall things underneath it - like the water tank for the coffee maker and basic half gallon pitchers. That might just be an issue with my own sink, but it was inconvenient enough that I ended up replacing this with a basic aerator after a few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so universal fit","review":"This didn't fit on my kitchen faucet and there's no notes about whether there's an adaptor or something I can use to make it fit.

The downside is that the compositions themselves have not all stood the test of time, although I would recommend \\"Anne Boleyn 'The Day Thou Gavest Lord Hath Ended'\\" to anyone, anywhere, at any time. If you are a fan of orchestral rock, as typified by Wakeman's involvement in Yes, I recommend this album as a worthy companion to any collection of that music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Wakeman with \\"Yes\\" and \\"Strawbs\\" but not alone","review":"I saw Wakeman on stage at the time of his solo career, and I didn't like it.I heard his solo albums and I never liked them.Why? I think because it's too much influenced by old classical music, the kind I also do not like.With the bands \\"Yes\\" and \\"Strawbs\\", the progressive trend and orientation of the rest of the group was perhaps forcing Wakeman to dig in that same direction, and that resulted in some really outstanding musical discoveries.But left alone...Maybe another reason for me not to like the solo albums is my tendency to favor music in minor (which sounds rather sad) as opposed to music in major (which sounds more \\"happy\\" if I can say that)Apart from this, I have to agree that Wakeman is technically very powerful. And lots of my friends did love these albums at the time they came out.So I suppose it's purely a question of taste in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, so","review":"I bought this on a whim after owning \\"Journey To The Center Of The Earth\\".For me it wasn't all that great. I wished I never bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and dull beyond description.","review":"There is no questioning Rick Wakeman's technical skill or importance as a progressive rock instrumentalist. However, this is what you end up with when your technique is more important than your creativity: dull, rambling, dated, unmelodic organ runs and cheesy \\"classical\\" piano instrumentals. If you're still someone who thinks \\"Fragile\\" is the greatest album of all time, then this is for you. If you have any taste in music, avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy, What A Stinker!!","review":"I roll my eyes every time I hear someone speak about Ricky's \\"musical textures.\\" This is still another example of Wakeman's pretentious attempt to become known as a \\"serious rock musician.\\" In the words of a famous Roman emperor, \\"I listened, I broke up laughing, I kept the receipt and got my dough back from the record store.\\" This album is the Pulp Fiction of progressive rock, the Mickey Spillane in a genre otherwise mostly populated with artists with a sincere vision and edgy creativity. If Anne Boleyn could have known that this album was on its way in the future, she'd have spared Henry VIII the trouble and simply hanged herself. A truly laughable stinker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rick - outstanding, cd music quality - crappy","review":"I really love this selection of instrumental pieces by Rick Wakeman. His music is unique and, well, simply brilliant. I was thouroughly dissapointed with the quality of the music on the CD though. It was flat and sounded like some garage recording on cheap outdated equipment. My recomendation to others is try to find a remastered copy of this work (if it exists)."},{"rating":"2","title":"blows you away!!","review":"when i first bought this record i did not knew what i was getting, but then i played it and let me tell you something it was great, i mean all of the pieces were amazing, i personally enjoyed track number 5, i don\`t know it justhas something mystic about it, how it changes tempo, it blew me away, this type of work really tells you what kinde of musician was rick, he\`s great, good \`ole prog rock to really expand your mind!!after all he comes from one hella\`va of a band"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wakeman CD","review":"Good CD with lots of classical and rock crossovers.

Rick Wakeman is magical"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Nearly 5 Stars","review":"If you are a big fan of keyboard-drenched songs, this album is close to heaven. Rick Wakeman's playing is masterful as always, and the songs are wonderfullyarranged and produced; this is one of the rare older CDs with excellent sound quality. Wakeman is not the only star, either. The other instruments (guitar, bass, etc.) all stand out at times, and drums are particularly excellent. All the songs are good. This is a must for Wakeman fans, and many others should check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"innocuous","review":"This is pleasant album of instrumentals from one of the keyboard stars of the early seventies. For would-be keyboard stars of the late nineties and beyond I recommend PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong, Overdone, vaguely pompus...","review":"I too heard this album upon its original release in the early 70's and was quite impressed with it at the time. Having recently purchased the CD I still do find the recording interesting. I do not believe it has aged well though, being overblown, overlong and vaguely pompus. Although the compositions are well done \\"mathematically\\", they are sometimes strangely devoid of actual melody. No doubt that the composer had some clout and influence, in those days, as one can clearly hear echos of his style and technique in later music ranging from groups as diverse as Queen to (particularly) Kansas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great early Rick Wakeman","review":"This album helped establish Rick's unique place in the music world. He used an amazing range of keyboard instruments on this, electronic and non-electronic. He does a great job of creating a musical painting of the era. If you like this, you might also try Steeleye Span."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book in series...","review":"I'm suprised to see so many other people praising this book. I've completed 8 other RL books so far and this was far and above the worst of them all. I truely had to force myself to finish the book hoping for some kind of redemption at it's conclusion. If this book had been a short story, it would have been much better. The finaly was good, but not nearly enough to suffer through 300+ pages of borring, mindless, rambling. Compared to \\"Vampire of the Mists\\", \\"Knight of the Black Rose\\", or \\"I, Strahd\\", it's safe to say this book [was horrible]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhilarating Experience..","review":"This album is an exquisitely crafted work of art by an extremely gifted and skilled musician. To me, it's a must hear/keep for all world/jazz listeners. It is very different because in Prasanna we have a very unique guitarist so well versed with the nuances of both the eastern carnatic and western jazz. All the songs in the album convey the artist's strong and very melodic carnatic message packaged in the overall jazz & blues context. The fusion is totally seamless. So to a listener unexposed to this form of eastern music, it may also come accross as a new exotic expression to jazz, which it is in many ways. And guess what, the singing too by both Prasanna and his wife Shalini sound very smooth and fit well in the album.Not to forget,what makes the album stand out is also the top brass accompanying artists on the rythm,bass,wind sections. The excellent arrangement of it all makes the album a sure winner.Kudos to Prasanna for this beautiful piece of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fusion at its best!","review":"Prasanna matures with every release. \\"Be The Change\\" has been in my CD player for like 2 months in a row.

This one has action and wonderful story line from a time in our country when patriotism was high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for little kids, for a short while.","review":"This is fun for a three-year-old for a very short while. There is really no racing involved, the two bikes are absolutely identical and have only one speed. This means that they never end up any farther from each other than where the began, so it's not like you can really race.Little kids will be amused by this for a short time, but once the novelty of a moving bike wears off there's nothing else to sustain the entertainment value of the toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicco Dicati","review":"Purchased this toy for my 3 year old. Motorcylcles move too slowly and most of the time, they don't work...would not recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept, bad product","review":"My boys were so excited about this toy. I have three year old twins and they couldn't wait to race their motorcycles, but this toy has been a total letdown. One of the remote controls arrived with the battery compartment messed up. The springs were on BOTH connectors for one battery and neither connector for the other battery. My husband is a bit of an electrician and managed to fix that. When we were finally up and running, we discovered that the motorcycles consistently fall off the track at the \\"bump\\" in the road, making it impossible to race. The plus of the toy is that the remote is really easy to use, even for a three year old. My boys enjoy the toy as long as someone is sitting there to pick up the motorcycle and put it back on the track. The inability to actually race the motorcycles, however, is a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your cash","review":"I used it once and never used it again.....

So I returned the drill right away - guess I'll do the old Home Depot trip for this gift so I can be sure it works like it's supposed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Speed/One Torque Setting","review":"This drill is good if you only want to drill holes. Not really useful for driving screws as there really isn't a \\"torque\\" setting. The site describes this as having 9 torque settings, but this is not true. It has one speed, and that's it. I really couldn't tell how long the battery will last before re-charging since I won't use this to drive screws. You are more likely to strip the screw head and better off using a manual screwdriver. I'm embarrassed to say I bought many of these to give away but now I wouldn't. Only because of the torque setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap drill","review":"Lack of variable speed made me return this drill immediately. Spend an extra $20 and get something half decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do you expect for $10??","review":"Just received this drill. For $10 it's an incredible value. It is a single speed drill which means that when you pull the trigger it immediately goes to its 1 speed but this does not impact the use of the drill that much. If you want to drill or drive screws at a slower speed you just need to pump the trigger.For drilling, single speed is fine for most applications. For driving screws, you just use the torque adjustment which allows you to sink the screw to any depth you want. Its a well built drill for $10. Heck, lunch now-a-days cost you more then $10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot ask for more.","review":"I used the drill to insall a 6' vertical blind valance with ease.It works specially well when the screws into the dry-wall are not over-torqued: the drill skids at the second setting which is just right for me.Compared to any corded drill, it is much more convenient and light.I got one for my friend and would get more just for the battery to spare.What can you ask for a nice toy at $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one scene of this movie is good.

Then one of the guys shot the girl who wanted to use a hostage as a shield. The music caught my interest. Bsisides these, the whole move was filled with bad directing. For example, in the last scene the gang leader was shot to pieces by tens of people but he still managed to kill the bad guy who bought the town!This movie is worth watching only once. \\"Quigley down under\\" and \\"The good, the bad and the ugly\\" are still the best Western movies of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brotehers in arm","review":"I really like the movie.the movie is not negitive as the reveiws stated.i like all kinds of movies,music in all cultures."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish it, and couldn't click less than 1 star","review":"I have seen my fair share of b rate movies, but this has to be by far the worse movie I have ever seen.

Rafi's song \\" Yun rooto na hasina\\" and it's picturization on Shashi Kapoor is one of the highlights of this movie. The movie is unusual in one respect : This is about Indian Muslims about their culture and lives. The actors are all Hindus, Shashi Kapoor , Nanda and so on. A truly secular movie and was a hit in those days. Shashi and Nanda's youthful enthusiasm is one of the best points about this movie. Omprakash portrayal as hajam Nawab is quite humorous. Balraj Sahni gives a subdued performance. This movie also enshrines the principle of equality of all humans and the differences made out among humans are all man made and artificial.This movie is of great nostalgic value to the reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all fans of comedy on television, this book is a must!","review":"Allan Neuwirth has done a fantastic job with this book.

The character of Duke Togo is a professional assassin who like James Bond, doesn't let emotion get in the way of his job. Now I'm not comparing the overall movie to James Bond though the opening title sequence of Golgo 13 is very similar to a title sequence that you would see in a Bond flick. Anyway, the plot held my interest to some degree but even for 90 minutes the movie seemed to drag at times. Duke Togo sleeps with the women he comes in contact with, even the one he is assigned to kill (James Bond anyone?). Golgo 13 starts to pick up near the end and I have to give this movie credit for having a good showdown between Duke and the hired hitmen out to get him, especially that Snake character.

Most of the songs are unchanged. The bass and kick drum are more present in the 2008 mix than the 2000 mix and \\"Rest will flow\\" is slowed down just a bit, that is it.The album delivers a wide variety of music, from the harder riffs in \\"Hatesong\\" and \\"Russia on Ice\\" to a softer edge with \\"Last Chance....\\" and \\"Rest Will Flow\\". This album is very diverse and well rounded. While I personally do not consider it to be one of Porcupine Tree's strongest works, it is by no means weak. Any fan of PT should purchase this album, it is fantastic!The re-master also comes with a 5.1 DVD-A mix of the album. Which also contains 5.1 mixes of the original 2000 recording.

But it just doesn't cover the entire story.Chances are, if you really like this band from their spacier explorations, that you've already gotten this disc. However, if you loved Porc Tree for the depth of sound and space--this release does NOT continue that sound.This really disappointed me. Yes, I know that last year's release also was more song oriented, as is Lightbulb Sun. But this one is SO introspective, that it sounds like Steve Wilson's life has gone to hell. Very limited instrumental space. It seems that \\"voyage\\" of the tree is over.So if you're looking for more Floydian/Porc Tree atmospheric music--it ain't here. If you want a collection of really sad songs, buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre pseudo prog.","review":"Porcupine Tree's preceding effort, Stupid Dream, had it's flaws but was far superior to this aimless effort. Wilson has his talents but needs to pay some serious attention to improving his guitar work. He would also be well advised to wait until he has something to say before stepping into the studio.

It seems to be mostly about taking pills and watchin tv and this band is at it's worst (in my opinion) when they are noodling through piano and synthesizer parts with the plodding ambient etheral effect. his voice full of reverb and whiny and tinny. Fear of blank planet was sooo much better, it moved and had more foundation to it. this album sounds like the structure is gone, it just rolls one song into the next getting more depressing as it goes.

Lead singer and guitarist Steven Wilson dominates the songwriting and sound of this album with his Pink Floyd inspired guitar lines constructing a sonically beautiful album. The rest of the band is superb and the production is excellent. Lightbulb Sun is perhaps Porcupine Tree's most mature work to date. And while the band sounds, at times, like a throwback to the 70's art-rock and psychedelia, the music sounds fresh and is nothing short of genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 stars!","review":"This is one of my favorite PT albums.It is commercial but that's o.k.

Controlled power, properly annotated with rythm and sarcasm. It's all you want, and I know what I'm talkin' about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tubes at their Pinnacle","review":"The Tubes' Remote Control was produced by production master and musician Todd Rundgren and this album really sounds like Todd. Todd played a big part in the making of this record, co-writing the material as well as creating the concept of having all the songs relate to television. The album was a commercial failure due to lack of airplay and promotion resulting from the negativism about television on some of songs. This is by far the best Tubes album being the most cohesive and well-produced. A must own for any Tubes fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible audio quality","review":"I love the Tubes. I love Todd. I love this record, but this CD rendition is so sonically flat that it is almost unlistenable. NO highs. NO lows. Muddy (at best) midranges. I had this in my car CD changer on a road trip and it followed Completion Backward Principle and Love Bomb, both of which kick hiney at volume. When Remote Control came on I thought my player had malfunctioned. A *major* disappointment that didn't have to be...the material is magic, but this representation of the material is just beyond poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Todd met Tubes; Call it UTUBIA!","review":"Recommended for fans of Todd Rundgren's power pop soul (with hints of Prog instrumentalism) and for fans of the Tubes high concept rock showism. Basically a concept album about TV, in a Tommy like reactionary tale of brain drain and ultimate consumption. But with great hummable tunes and cheeky lyrics. Standout tracks include \\"Turn Me On\\",\\"TV Is King\\" and the almost punk rockish \\"Telecide\\". Funny but not goofy, intense but not pretentious, Remote Control is a secret fave now back on CD. Yeah.Paul MyersBerkeley"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn Yourself On","review":"Turn yourself on to the Tubes with the album that synthesized their formidable musical talents. PLAY THIS LOUD. A classic neo-punk prog-rock masterwork that really rocks. To understand the amazing guitar-heavy jam that closes Telecide, you have to imagine the Allman Brothers on steroids, hopped up on amphetimines, playing with the Ramones. It's that spectacular. If you do not own this tragically overlooked CD, you have no business calling yourself a music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! Remote Control is affordable!","review":"I've been searching for Remote Control on CD for years, and it was a foreign item that was about $40. This is arguably The Tubes best album, in my opinion, along with The Tubes and The Completion Backwards Principle. The album is clearly produced by Todd Rundgren, and bears his hallmark layered harmonies, tasty hooks and an emphasized Prairie Prince snare drum. It's also got the typical Tubes funny lyrics. My favorite song is I Want It All Now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album, disappointing sound","review":"This has to be one of my favorite Tubes albums as I am both a Tubes and Todd Rundgren fan. The sound of this reissue, however, is a major disappointment. I remember the clear crisp sound of my vinyl copy and this CD does not come close to it. My vinyl copy was misplaced long ago so I was very happy when this reissue surfaced. This CD sounds like it may have been remastered from a cassette tape of the album. The Tubes trademark synthesizers have no sizzle at all. All of the snap and punch of the drums and percussion were absent. When I first opened the CD I thought it was a bit odd that there was no mention of the person or studio that remastered this disk. After my first listen, I realize why."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE Edition","review":"The diagrams in this edition, which are essential to understanding many of the examples the author gives, are illegible.

The sleep deprived crew is counted on to make the right, split-second decisions in the middle of combat. It was not all ice cream and rounding up prisoners.He also shows what the struggle was like for a young man returning to the \\"sanity\\" of America and trying to work out his feelings about what he had to do to keep himself and his fellow soldiers alive.Chet Brown has elements of Catcher in the Rye in his back-in-the-states persona. He is complex and does things he does not fully understand because of his inward struggle. It is a brutal portrayal of someone fighting his demons about actions that he truly had no control over.I agree with an earlier review that called for the copy editor's head for the spelling and sentence problems that were left in the book.I look forward to reading more from Charles Sheehan-Miles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, could have been better...","review":"\\"Prayer at Rumayla\\" was a good concept, but never materialized into a good book. Too many obvious print/spelling/grammar errors were present that an editor should have picked up, and the story was just too quick. Characters could have been developed more, and the main character (Chet Brown) used the same phrases over and over. On the positive side, I like the way it moved back and forth from past and present. It was a quick, and reasonably entertaining book. I would recommend it as a read because of the insights that come through from the authors experience in the gulf."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real deal...","review":"War is sometimes necessary. But it is never as glorious as we are often led to believe by our political leadership and by a press which oftentimes tends to be one-sided. Particularly a war as swift and \\"clean\\" as the Gulf War was lends itself to quick sterotyping. But the men and women who actually fight those wars know the real deal.And so here it is for the rest of us. Prayer at Rumayla is a novel that tells it like it was, from an author who was there. Charles Sheehan-Miles was a member of a tank crew which took part in that famous \\"left hook\\" through the Iraqi desert. Written from a soldier's view, it tells some of the stuff that the news reports never did. And it does it within the universal theme of war's tragic consequences.I would have preferred that the book be longer, with deeper characterization. But this is a good effort.

Turrentine is in top form here, playing with great confidence and feeling throughout. You definitely feel as if he's singing through his horn. The arrangements by Eumir Deodato are superb and varied (the man is simply a genius), and played by top-notch session players like Ron Carter, Airto Moierera, and Billy Cobham, each of whom is a superstar in their own right.

In context, this makes no sense at all until one reads the end note and the dedication and realises that his lover is the author of that book; evidently he felt that it was appropriate to conclude a book that claims scholarly status with an arbitrary plug for his girlfriend's unpublished novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Loser","review":"I bought this after purchasing my first kettlebell. Bob's instruction was done from a small dark room, he is far from encouraging, he makes fun of the girl demonstrating his moves because she does them wrong often. Hard to follow because the girl doing the moves can't even follow Bob. Not helpful at all, buy Jillian Micheals kettlebell video instead, she is encouraging, offers different levels, and shows you how to start with a regular weight if you aren't sure about purchasing a kettleBell. I will never buy one of BOB's videos again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"I tried this workout DVD the first time last week and I was not expecting much.

Some of the other commentors have said stuff like: boring set and no fakey-smiley faces. So what? Are you here to be entertained, or are you here to work the flab off your chubby behind? I'm here to work, baby. Please, Bob - make more kettlebell DVDs!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"basic workout","review":"I personally think Bob Harper is totally under rated!

You will sweat! I reccomend the inside out method \\"Body Rev CARDIO conditioning or \\"PURE BURN Super Strenght if you want something a little more challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blabby Bob","review":"This video is a hard kettle bell workout, however I got it to learn new exercises, which I did not. First of all, Bob Harper talks WAY TOO MUCH! He wastes at least 5-10 minutes out of the 50 min workout with his wordy, repititious instructions. Also, he only does approximately 5 different exercises and just repeats the s*@% out of them. Overall disappointed with this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough workout but doable","review":"I hate it when I get all excited about a work out and then end up giving up halfway through because the moves are too difficult. I am an avid fitness DVD user, but because of my less than optimal eating habits and job that entails day long sitting, I would only rate myself about a medium on the fitness scale. With this workout, which involves Bob Harper taking you through a strenuous but doable kettlebell workout, I never felt that. There were periods of less strenuous toning exercises mixed in with the more difficult cardio moves that gave me some breathing room. As in all of his workouts, Harper was a mix of tough and encouraging. The production values weren't much to look at, it looked as though Harper and the one woman he was training were in someone's basement rec room, but the workout that felt good and made me feel excited to do it again made up for the less than scintillating visuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for beginners","review":"I bought this dvd because when I bought Jillian's kettlebells their was only an instructional video not a workout. I find this to be difficult and have yet to make it through the whole dvd. What I have done is good but a little boring because you stay with one move so long. If you are a regular or experienced kettlebell user you may find the workout easier than I have. The instruction is good it is just beginners may not have the muscle stamina to power through for 50 minutes. It is definitely a challenge which is good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob Harper kettlebell Sculpted Body","review":"I bought this DVD recently and I found it which is the boring DVD I've ever had!

Cheever, who turns out to be employed where the author, Amby Burfoot, works as an executive editor, that is, at Runner's World magazine, hence Ben's glowing description as \\"One of the five best books on running\\" which caught me in the Amazon description is not unbiased. This book is without worthwhile substance and is a rambling waste of a read. It is also tiny and short.

It is boring, there is little depth to Paddock's characters, and no connection of early events in the book to later events. Paddock does a nice job giving every detail about what her characters are wearing, eating for breakfast, and the hotel rooms they stay in, but lacks detail and depth in developing her characters and plot. About half-way through the book, I was barely skimming to find anything worth reading.

All in all, just an excellent read. I would love to read even more about these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not for me","review":"While reading Paddock's novel, I kept hoping it would get better. Sadly, it did not. Paddock began with a great premise for a story -- three girls brought together by a tragedy. However, poor narration, weak character development, and lack of actual story line made this book into the mess that it was. She tried to make the characters realistic, but was unable to develop them in a span of 15 years. She tried to intertwine three separate story lines in just over 200 pages, but wasn't able to do that either.I generally have a great appreciation for \\"chick lit\\" type books, but this was terrible. I didn't connect with the characters. The characters did not connect with each other. I think that Jennifer Paddock got lucky that her publisher liked this book, because I did not find much in this novel that would entice me to buy another one by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Do It For Me","review":"After seeing this book mentioned in several reviews for other books I had read, I was excited to read it. While it was easy to get through, it didn't have much else going for it. Bland, undeveloped characters, no plot to speak of, not to mention an event toward the beginning that supposedly ties these three characters together although they barely discuss it--sorry, but I just don't agree with the glowing reviews. After reading this and the relentless, excrutiatingly long The Time Traveler's Wife, both of which got rave reviews, I'm starting to wonder if I'll be able to pick out a truly good book again. I just bought The Kite Runner and The Memory of Running, so I'm cautiously optimistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I quickly lost interest in the book","review":"I had high hopes for this book after reading all the reviews, but it never engaged me. I found myself skimming through and even skipping pages, unable to relate to at least two of the characters. I found the stories of Leigh more interesting- she was the only one who seemed to have any depth. The other two characters were very shallow and self-centered. I also found the text murky- had to re-read certain lines several times to figure out what the author was trying to say. The way the book was written did not allow the reader (me, at least) to feel like the characters were realistic. I felt very removed and distant from them and didn't end up caring too much for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give less stars!","review":"This book is absolutely horrible! The other reviewers who found it bad at least managed to say a little something positive about the book, but I just could not. This book really surprised me since I thought it would be great judging from the other reviews. It really missed the mark. It seemed to merely a group of sentences that described actions, i.e. \\"I walked into the room, I sat on the bed, We drank wine\\",......blah blah blah. There is never any explanation as to what drives these characters and what their purpose is for living. These women depressed me and this book made me glad that I checked it out from the library as opposed to buying. PLEASE do not waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"A Secret Word is a waste of time. It starts out with the 3 female characters being forever linked by the incident in the first chapter. Their lives are barely intertwined throughout the rest of the story. I waited for a big event to happen with the girls, but it never did. I stayed with it till the end. It wasn't worth the read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read the reviews on this website and another, and based on that, I recommended this book for my book club. When I was finished with this book I was rather disappointed. It wasn't the worst book I've ever read, it was at best ok???"},{"rating":"1","title":"was let down","review":"I had high hopes for this book but was let down. The story just didn't evolve into anything really satisfying for me. Evidentally (if you read back on reviews) I'm not the only one who feels this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"National Book Award nominee . . . or should be!","review":"This novel should be sold as a companion to Julia Glass's National Book Award winner, THREE JUNES. Not that A SECRET WORD isn't original. It most certainly is, and it's as deftly written, with multiple main characters, storylines, and settings, and, yes, everything ties together. Everything! Though never in some cheap way. This is real life, folks. This novel builds just like real life, with story layered upon story. Or more accurately, this novel builds like an Olympic relay team runs in track and field, alternating between bursts of energy, graceful exchanges, and pure fire.I love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Secret Word","review":"Very, very cool. Loved it from the opening sentence to the final one--and what a final scene the author leaves us with. It's a real-life scene that I've never seen before, like something from a French film or from an Alice Munro short story. I was left wordless, breathless, many times. It's just terrific, like Binchy's Night of Rain and Stars and Cronin's The Summer Guest. A Secret Word is that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I too had issues after taking this when I was already suffering from Candida die off. I had to treat my symptoms with diet until they were more under control, then take the Candida Yeast Support to more actively kill the Yeast. It sounds like the person who gave this a bad review must have a bad case of Candida, because the only stuff in this product are bacteria that aggressively kill Candida. And we know that die off can be REALLY hard on your body if it's not managed correctly. I have suffered from Candida overgrowth unknowingly for over 4 years, and now that I have used this product, I can go back to a more normal diet. I highly recommend this product. I would recommend though that if die off symptoms are an issue, that one should start with the anti Candida diet first, and then take the Candida Yeast Support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Gen x cops was recommended to me from a Hong Kong news group. but - Sorry, didnt like it too well. I wanted a tight, well directed movie. Nope - the direction is sloppy. As well as the writing and acting. ON the plus side, There is a large cast and some of the locations and shots are nice. But I was bored every other minute. The fight scenes are unconvincing. Most of the actors vary from over the top to out of character. The whole thing looks slapped together. Maybe tighter editing would have helped. If this is the best HK has to offer - sheesh!Is this the same director who did rumble in the bronx. - that was better, but sloppy too."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little too much gen-x attitude","review":"for the most part, this movie was fun to watch. the only real problem i had with it was at times it had a little too much \\"gen-x\\" attitude. i guess it was made with young people in mind. the story deals with a group of 3 young undercover cops who ary trying to stop a japanese man from blowing up the hk convention center. the movie has the feel of big-budget summer entertainment to it. but, i think most people will enjoy it. the dvd version of this is packed with extras that warrents a purchase. watch the cantonese version instead of the english version"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"I had a lot of fun watching this movie. It's not even half as cool as The Matrix; though, the actors' upbeat attitude was definitely catchy. I disagree with one reviewers posted here. Nicholas Tse is cute, alright.

Watching this movie reminded me of why I should stay away from Hong Kong movies. Eric Tsang Chi-wai reminds me why I should hate the idiot, despite his good acting on Infernal Affairs. The guy is a moron and this movie is moronic.NOTHING makes sense whatsoever and everything looks staged and fake. I like action but this movie was just plain DUMB because the dialogue was retarded and nothing was believable.Please save your money and watch something else instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to find these - very pleased!","review":"My husband has worn ecco shoes of this style for many years. He paid full price for them, but the styles became less attractive over the years. I happened to be looking on Amazon one day and came across these at a bargain price. They look very similar to the first pair he had. The fit and wear are wonderful. We ordered 2 more pair to have for the future. We were fortunate that they had his size. We are very pleased!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy shoe","review":"ECCO makes great shoes that are sturdy and dependable. The only proble I have with their shoes is that they run a half size small. ECCO make their shoes with the removable insoles to allow for more width and length for larger feet, I wair size 16. Most of the ECCO shoes that I have tried on in the past I had to remove the insole and the shoe was still to small. I tried size 17 in other brands but they were to big. When I ordered these shoes I knew I was going to have to remove the insole to allow for a comfortable fit. First, the shoes arrived earlier then reported and when I tried them on , with out the insole they fit! I like that they fit and the shoes are super sturdy. I wear them to work, casual Fridays, and on the weekends. If ECCO made a size 17 maybe I wouldn't have to remove the insoles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endless motherhood","review":"My world is rocked by endless motherhood. Raising four children in New Jersey is a challenge...a good challenge. I've never heard of this book until I read a friend's blog writing about it. Some of the mantras mentioned in her blog from the book were so true to my heart & hit close to home. These are the words I needed to hear. To keep myself from losing my sense of normalcy & to keep my sanity. All my kids are 5 years apart {3 girls & one boy}. Some parents may say it's easier having that big age gap as opposed to having them 2 or even 3 years apart. It doesn't matter. It's still challenging & so after reading this book, my mind, body & soul feels more calm, patient & at ease. I can just stop, ponder & think of all the wonderful things my children have done { & still do} & \\"lock it in\\". What a great book!! I recommend this to every mother!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyday wisdom and common sense","review":"I have almost finished this book. it's an easy, light read. perhaps too easy a read, because I am whizzing through the chapters instead of pondering each one as deeply as it deserves.

It has a bunch of fun tunes on it--great for dancing with children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, but...","review":"This biography is informative and I found the Introduction and first two chapters to be particularly well done. However, the author's writing fairly quickly becomes tedious. His style is flat, unengaging and repetitive. Once he has covered the initial case that brought notoriety to Murray O'Hair, the rest is just slogging through a sad and difficult life. For example, the time when Murray O'Hair was debating the evangelist Bob Harrington in the 70s should have made for fascinating reading, but the narrative here is disappointingly superficial.The tragic end to Madalyn Murray O'Hair's life is reported. There are lots of details, but that's it. It is tedious and Le Beau's sometimes excellent insights are overshadowed by uninspired prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"What a disappointment! This is a book based on the empty promise that the author is going to show some new way to solve the age old knitter's dilemma of yarn substitutions and how to make them. There is nothing new in this book; she solves yarn substitutions the way we all do and have been doing for a million years; swatch, swatch, swatch. This information is available from magazines, books, classes and other knitters!She does show examples of sweaters knitted in two different weights of yarn, and for the novice knitter I suppose this could be interesting, and possibly informative. However, for any knitter who has made even one successful yarn substitution, I feel this book is an expensive retelling of an old tale.I would strongly suggest that anyone thinking about purchasing this book first seek out a copy to look through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is deceptive","review":"For years I've been trying to alter knitting patterns to accommodate different types, sizes of yarn. The only way I knew how to do this was by hours of experimental \\"swatch\\" knitting, comparing stitches, measuring, etc.So, when I saw the book \\"Knit it Your Way: Change the Yarn to Suit Your Style\\" advertised, I became very excited - at last, I thought, charts, explanations, a Method that would eliminate all that \\"swatching.\\"When the book arrived I could hardly wait to start reading. I quickly realized the only \\"Method\\" that was mentioned was - you guessed it - \\"swatching.\\" After a few pages talking about her experience with hours and hours of knitting swatches, the author then regales us with many photos of herself in self-knit clothing. It is not something that I would even pass along to a beginning knitter.The title of this book completely misrepresents its contents."},{"rating":"2","title":"recommendation for students of ancient history","review":"This out-of-print study is a vivid description of the sources of the world before the great pyramid age, analogous to the period of Archaic Greece before the Classical. The small beginnings are as significant as the flowerings. Hoffman makes clear the rapid acceleration in development that took place in the so-called Gerzean age, ca. 3300 to 3000 BC. A charming book for students of ancient history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning...","review":"This is an issue that so many people know nothing about.

Everyone should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs!","review":"It's very seldom I write a negative review. For the most part I know the type of things I like & usually there is some redeeming quality to a purchase. So even if expectations are not met the item is not a total loss. This DVD really floored me.I thought this would be very erotic & sexy, it wasn't. It had to be well shot, it wasn't the whole DVD seemed like a flashlight supplied the total reveal lighting.There was no sense of organization nor are the scenarios presented complete in any way shape or form. Even now as I attempt to review this abomination my mind has already ( by itself) seemingly self erased some of my initial reactions to protect me from further injury. Seriously the Satanic Sluts seemed like a can't miss to me but it did & that feeling we all get when we spend money for nothing hit me hard. One star because that is the minimum allowed, maybe you will see it different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cast, but they get in the way of each other sometimes","review":"I had never heard of this particular recording by Milt Jackson, even though I have CDs of his spanning the many eras of his career (including MJQ). But I happened to see this in the store,looked at the stellar cast listed on the back, and grabbed it.Overall, this recording does not disappoint. But,at times, the players seem to be getting into one another's way. It sounds rather \\"muddy\\" and cacophonous in these places. For example, the strings seem especially intrusive on the first two tracks. This is not one of Don Sebesky's better arranging efforts. What a difference it is without strings on \\"People Make the World Go Round!\\" I particularly liked Herbie Hancock's acoustic piano solo on this track.But the overall musicianship is, as one might expect, impeccable. I would recommend this for someone who has already listened to some of Milt's other recordings. But this is not the best place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classics should NOT be ABRIDGED","review":"The sound quality is very good. What is wrong is that the title cut, Sunflower, is only 8:51! This tune was over 10 minutes on all earlier versions of this CD, or vinyl, release!

We can all relate. It's sure not a dance tune--but it's a goofy masterpiece!\\"Hold On\\" is a sleeper you might pass over on first listen. But it's a fine love lament.

Very Good","review":"This is the OMD most people are familiar with. The big songs \\"So In Love\\" and \\"Secret\\" were chart singles and they both had videos that MTV played in their heyday. But I think this album started OMD on their short up and coming road to stardom. I like the tracks \\"The Native Daughters Of The Golden West\\", \\"Women III\\" and the title track \\"Crush\\" in which Andy McCluskey curses out the rain. OMD continued to have a couple more hits after this. They had the theme song in the movie PRETTY IN PINK (If You Leave) and the single only \\"Dreaming\\" which was the new track on the BEST OF collection. My favorite album by OMD came out after CRUSH and was entitled \\"The Pacific Age\\" which is now unfortunately nearly impossible to find on CD. CRUSH definitely put Andy McCluskey, Paul Humphreys, Martin Cooper and Malcolm Holmes on the 80's New Wave map."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very commercial album for OMD but very solid","review":"This is a good album to get if you want to see what OMD is about.

The content is comprehensive, and Popov does seem to have made an effort to write the book for students. However, the book has just too many errors and typos! A page reference is missing from the Table of Contents, for example. The chapter entitled \\"Yield and Fructure Criteria,\\" misspelling \\"Fracture\\" as \\"Fructure\\" in big letters, really annoyed me. This book would be near perfect if not for all the errors. I bought the book as a reference but returned it a week later after coming across the mistakes. The book is just edited very, very sloppily. A third edition with these mistakes remedied would be great, but Popov is old and I don't see him doing a 3rd edition. That's a pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow and riddled with errors","review":"This book suffers from several major deficiencies. First, it is inherently difficult to follow. The format is designed in such a way that you have to constantly refer back and forth between pages to get all the information you need for an example or derivation. The other thing is the examples are not clear. You find yourself solving the example again because the method isn't clear. In this way, I find the book extremely frustrating. Even after the problems with the contents, the book has errors. Lots and lots of errors. Just look on the inside front cover. \\"Principal Elastiac Equations\\"? I checked the dictionary, and I don't know what elastiac is. Or Ch. 12: \\"Yield and Fructure Criteria\\"? Is that a new term for the fracture of fructose?

The proofreading is very, very, very sloppy. Maybe these mistakes are more a function of editing deadlines rather than with Popov himself, but that doesn't mean that this isn't a bad volume that you shouldn't waste your money on. I used this book as a text and was very disappointed. Save your money and buy Beer and Johnston or Craig instead. Or even Popov's earlier work, Mechanics of Materials, which I liked a lot.

Practical information is useless(even taking into account that bus/train schedules can change frequently, the book tells you next to nothing. The section on the Rila monastery for example states something like \\"try to catch onwarding transportation from there\\". Try to catch??

Who in their right mind makes a movie about beautiful people (Rachael leigh Cook) getting their faces cut off, for SATAN, of all people. Do we have any Rachael Leigh Cook fans out there, or do I stand alone. No offence, but if any Rachael fan liked a movie where she not only gets her life and soul stolen by Satan, but also gets strangled with a rope, gets HER BEAUTIFUL FACE CUT OFF, and gets possesed by the devil, is a little cracked,(no offence).Being the HUGE fan of Rachaels' that i am, I cried sooooooo much durring that movie. i just can't believe that someone would be MEAN enough to put RACHAEL LEIGH COOK in a position like that. I just think that that movie was VERY SICK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE GOTHIC HORROR MOVIE","review":"I capitalized the summary to keep attention toward this review over the other one. THE EIGHTEENTH ANGEL is a horribly tedious and boring Gothic horror yarn thats only good quality is Rachael Leigh Cook. I really hope now that her career is blossoming that this film doesn't come back to haunt her."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD MOVIE!","review":"The eighteenth angel is a great movie, despite several reviews in magazines that I hate. It makes you think it is no different from The Omen, but it really is original. The story is that a bunch of Etruscan devil worshipers want to bring Lucifer to earth in the form of beauty. 17 kids are killed, cloned, and brought back to life, not to mention 'failed' genetic experiments, like mutated rats. The beautiful Rachel Cook receives the greatest privilage of all: being posessed by Lucifer. It really does blend evil with high technology. Great movie, 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop watching it","review":"I saw this movie this morning for the first time, and I watched it three other times the same day. I've thought Christopher McDonald was a good actor ever since I saw him in \\"Happy Gilmore\\", and Rachel Leigh Cook's character creeped me out. I've seen many a horrer movie, and they get repetitive. This movie made me watch the whole thing, from beginning to end. The scenes with the faces grossed me out a little, but they made me want to watch the movie. All in all I thought it was a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best horror movie I've ever seen!","review":"I wish I could give It 6 stars, but there is a limit! The first time I saw the \\"Eighteenth Angel\\" I had nightmares. That means that it was scary even for me (I've seen lots of horror movies, by the way). There are 4 thing that I liked in this film. Firstly, the pretty good acting from both Christopher Mc. Donald and Rachael Cook. Secondly, the general Idea that Satan may come to earth without being noticed. The end may have allready started... Thirdly, the clock scenes (you can understand what they are and how they are connected to the movie only if you see it) which keep the viewer's interest unspoiled till the end. Lastly, the very good ending which is hard to achieve in this kind of horror movies. All in all, this is one of my best movies. You MUST see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the Eighteenth Angel","review":"Rachel Leigh Cook is totally amazing in this movie. The Eighteenth Angel isn't boring, it moves rather quickly and you actually do feel the father's race against time to save his daughter. No this isn't the omen revisited, because everyone know that Damien was born evil. Besides if I even found out that the devil really looks like Rachel Leigh Cook, I'd probably consider converting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, but the deathknell of the band","review":"The fact that \\"She's in Parties\\" is on this album is indicative of how incredibly creative this band was, even when they were falling apart. Some really good cuts all the way around, but all things considered, it is at the bottom of my Bauhaus list (which you means you should buy it because it is awesome, but their others are even better)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic and Full of Surprises","review":"If you prefered the Beatles' Abby Road to Rubber Soul, if you prefered the Police's Syncronicity to Reggatta de Blanc, you will enjoy this for the same reasons; tension and discord at the end of a great band's flight, making for a wildly dynamic album that's full of surprises. Previous albums wallowed in redundant, sloppy, sanctimonious goth sillyness and far too many cuts that were simply self-indulgent wastes of the listeners' time. In this Burning From the Inside, every cut is a master-stroke and no two are similar. It ranges from profound to wacky to haunting to beautiful (though I could apply more adjectives than would fit in this space). The likes of Bela Legosi and Passion of Lovers has been left behind here, though their punk asthetics are still present in earnest except that here, they are applied in strategic highlights rather than in a clumsy wash. Of the other Bauhaus albmus, I only bother with a few songs from each but from Burning...I relish every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!","review":"Being part of the \\"old school\\" of goth (1983~1989), I have been out of the loop for awhile but this brought it all back home.

A \\"cannot miss\\" album, very rich in music; add this towards your bauhaus collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bauhaus bow out to the next stage","review":"This is a really good album but it kinda falters towards the end. Peter Murphy was out of contention for most of the album so the band played on without him. Some of the songs are brilliant and carry on the usual Bauhaus flair but near the end you can see that they were running out of patience with being Bauhaus. Fortunatly the extra tracks here save it from going out on a sour note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, well written, and concise","review":"This book fills a much needed gap between politics and geography, and does it with a straight forward approach. The authors don't clutter the book with a lot of fluff or long winded opinions. They keep it short, on target, and to the point. All the main issues are covered with enough detail to allow the reader to understand without a lot of extra. Don't be fooled by the short length (about 150 pages). This text is a powerhouse of information about such issues as Nationalism, the Cold War, Development, and Security or Conflict. It is also easy to read and comprehend. This text should be required reading for any Political Geography course. I would highly recommend this text to any curious reader of geography, politics or world affairs.

This book was a fantastic refresher and actually explained things in such a wonderfully simple way that some concepts will be sunk into my mind better than in the past. I have also read Electronics for Dummies, which is also good. If I had to choose one or the other I would lean toward Mim's book. His illustrations are a blast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic electronics starter book","review":"Rate this book a four for those who want a very basis starter book covering the subject. Good basic book. But, if you want to know why a component is in a circuit and how to determine it's needed value, this book is too basic and will leave you frustrated. The DIY circuits are fun but again, being able to dissect each circuit to understand a components function in the circuit would be a great learning experience and mental practice if it had been covered in the earlier component overview circuits. As such, creating your own circuits or understanding others will be difficult with this book alone.

I \\"discovered\\" it at the local Radio Shack in the early 80's while attending Navy electronics training. Thankfully this book and its writer, Forrest M. Mims, III made the challenging world of electronics accessible and best yet, fun. With the help of this book, I survived the Navy's training (thank you Forrest!) and it sparked a love for electronics that continues to this day.Especially good for beginners, I strongly recommend this book for anyone looking to feed their electronics interest. In just 128 pages, Mr. Mims with his simple writing style, great explanations and numerous easy-to-make circuits makes the magic of electronics seem possible. Buy several copies because once you read it, you will want to share it.

But around page 20, things start to feel a bit muddy; the author begins to use terms without properly defining them, and the circuit schematics don't make a terrible lot of sense. He explains in a rapid-fire manner what resistors, capacitors, diodes, FETs, JFETs, and MOSFETs are, but he doesn't really explain WHY a lot of them are used. By page 50 I found myself completely lost and looking online for another book.However, this book would probably serve as a good review or reference to someone who is already knowledgable in electronics, so it's not a complete waste, and I doubt I'll get rid of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner Knowledge - but fun","review":"I ordered this book as a getting started into hobby electronics and it does that. It starts at a very beginner level which might be the point, and doesn't get too heavily into any mathematics (which I think is good). Design isn't supposed to be sheets and sheets of equations... it's supposed to be having a general idea of what is going to happen, then mathematical refinement later. This book is a decent base to that ideal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Japanese attempt at mixing humor and eroticism - unsuccessfully","review":"I didn't find this one particularly funny or erotic, despite the presence of some very attractive women.

And I had always wondered why no one in the biz had caught on to her before. Then she gets a meeting with L.A. Reid. He's so impressed that he offers her a deal on the spot. Now...to the record. Now, I'm not usually one for chicky alt-country-poppy music, but I do like this album. Very easy to listen to, even for someone like me who prefers heavier, guitar-driven rock & roll. \\"Can't Behave\\" is an obvious hit. It's easy to HEAR why the female audience will like her, and it's easy to HEAR (sexy voice) and SEE (the obvious) why the male audience will as well. She's doing this the right way, and L.A.

I'm a medieval historian, and while this episode gets the details essentially correct, it completely misses the big picture. Much of this episode is based on Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's book, which isn't very good. Moreover, one of their \\"experts\\" in fact wrote a NOVEL on Montaillou, probably based on Ladurie's book. Finally, I saw no indication that this episode relied on any inquisitorial files opened in 1998--it all came from Ladurie. So be careful with this series, and don't get too caught up in the \\"Dark Ages\\" mindset. No one who's versed in historical study would take this episode very seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"This Perry Mason book is a suspenseful action thriller and a spectacular page turner. \\"The Case of The Deadly Toy\\" is about a woman, Norda Alison who is convicted of murder after her ex-fiancé is found dead and the murder weapon is found hidden under her pillow. This book is very well written and keeps you clueless of the real murderer until the last few pages in the book. Norda Allison is the victim of a conspiracy between her ex-fiancés former wife and her husband. Perry Mason does a great job keeping the reader active and having new suspenseful ideas on every page. Perry, his secretary Debra, his close friend and detective Paul Drake do a great job solving the mystery after all hope is lost. The book is very exciting after Norda's ex-fiancés former wife's son fires a gun shot heard early in the morning and Norda's ex-fiancé is found dead the next morning. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery books and I think everyone will love and cherish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous","review":"This work of Gardner is so great!

An Academy Award winner, it is not, but a romp of a 90-minute visceral ride, it definitely is. Chow Yan Fat's screen presence is magnetic, and Mira Sorvino superbly carries the supporting role with star quality. Emotionally charged, stylishly filmed, and action-packed; definitely a collector's DVD for the artistically inclined.Not much of DVD extras to speak of, but at a discounted price you get both the anamorphic widescreen and 4:3 formatted versions, which is a terrific value. More DVDs should be released and priced this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"DON'T CONFUSE LUCK WITH SKILL\\"","review":"Chow Yun-Fat's Hollywood debut is an unpretentious, pared-down thriller that grabs you by the throat and won't let go until burn-out. True, \\"The Replacement Killers\\" lacks the overgrown plot threads that strangle so many modern actioners, but it's a better movie for it. Chow Yun-Fat is awesome as the reluctant assassin-cum-avenger, and Mira Sorvino...well, what can I say? She's hot. Blessed with a killer soundtrack, a solid supporting cast and some of the best choreographed gunplay out there, \\"The Replacement Killers\\" is pure action-magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"High-octane candy for your senses","review":"This is a slick, charged movie infused with music, action, and minimal dialogue. Yun Fat's performance is muted but smooth--he's like liquid death. When he chooses to carry 7 or 8 guns instead of one gun with 7 or 8 clips, it makes the action sequences even more smooth and professional. Sorvino is no femme fatale--she's edgy, smart, and has a mean streak. The storyline lacks any real surprises and the ending is all too predictable, but the cinematography, sound, and characters make the movie a fun ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Action Packed Excitement","review":"If you like action than you'll love this.

Unfournately, it turned out to be very dumb and poorly acted. Rent earlier Chow-Woo movies like the Killer or Hard Boiled and you will be happier. Also, check out Woo's 3rd and best American film, Face/Off"},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only Woo Directed The Whole Movie","review":"I wont belabor the point that has been made about how this was NOT the best intro of Chow Yun Fat to America, the point has been made in almost every other review. The movie is mediocre and filled with too many bullets and not any blood (on the good guys at least). And as far as director Fuqua pulling off some classic John Woo moments, that's because John Woo actually directed about 15 minutes of this film, which is really the best part of the film. That and the excellent soundtrack partially make up for the fact that the directing is actually scattershot(if you actually watch an older Woo movie you'll realize what good directing of action movies is all about) and in my opinion a rather lackluster performance by mia sorvino, but yes she is hot. The movie is definetly a rental or a late night HBO fest, but otherwise a sad waste of great talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is bad!","review":"The scope of htis film was small. THe way the action was captured seemed cramped and constrained within the frame.Terrance Lam the producer came to my school once and talked about this film. He said that the original script was much better than the final draft. I believe him. The colors and look of the film was wonderful. But the action and plot are less than desireable.On top of that the whole story seemed rushed to me. I would sell my copy for less than I bought it for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks!","review":"I was thrilled when I heard that Chow Yun Fat would make his first American flick....I m biggest fan of Yun Fat. I rushed to theater to watch it. I found it very boring film. Yun Fat was not himself in this film, because of his lousy English. What more, Yun Fat's character in this film was so stiff. I was very disappointed to see him acting like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross.","review":"I guess it was unfair of me to want to see some martial arts in this...but the gun play...well, I guess I'm just not a big fan of people intermittently firing guns and hiding behind walls. And naturally, since I have a vagina, it precludes me from thinking big explosions are something really cool. I was bored...disappointed with Mira Sorvino...whose chest was pathetically visible by leaving her sweater unnecessarily open, but was only beaten in patheticness by her acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindless action at its best","review":"Professional killer John Lee (Chow Yun-Fat) is hired by crime boss Mr. Wei to avenge his sons death. When John refuses to do the job he and his family are put in danger. Needing documents to get to China to rescue his family, Lee enlists the help of forger Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino). Outraged by Lee's betrayal Wei hires two replacement killers to hunt down John and Meg. The result is plenty of shootouts and gunplay Hong Kong style.This is an all out action flick. If your looking for a great plot and script look elsewhere. All of the action scenes look amazing. I really like Antoine Fuqua's style. Also the soundtrack rocks and flows right with the action. The DVD doesnt have much on it (featurette and trailers) and the film is presented in Widescreen or Full Screen Formats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack & okay film","review":"I love action movies, & \\"The Replacement Killers\\" definitely delivered the action. The soundtrack was great, and perfectly matched each scene. However, there were a few negatives. Even though Mira Sorvino graduated from Harvard University with honors, it doesn't mean she's a great actress, regardless of the Golden Globe & Academy Award that she won. Her acting in this movie was poor. Maybe she could shoot a couple of guys with a gun & look pretty while doing it, but it didn't mean that she has stunning acting abilities because of that. Chow Yun Fat had the moves & he had the looks. The plot may not have been captivating, but it still kept the movie together. Overall, a good movie to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Grows On You","review":"After buying this video because of Chow Yun-Fat and watching it a number of times, I really think it is very good. The story could have been expanded to fill out the characters somewhat, but just as it is, you end up caring about John Lee (Chow) and Meg (Myra Sorvino).There are the typical gun and shooting scenes and car chases. But also, some interesting scenes in a Buhddist temple and a sound track that is very good.All in all, a movie that is just what you think it will be from the title and cast. An action picture in a sort of noir style."},{"rating":"1","title":"well if you say who cares about drama, it has cool gunfights","review":"i wouldn't say that, the gunfights are weak and hollywooded up. see A Better Tomorrow 2 for a real gunfight. this movie has more squibs going off on walls and windows than people. antoine did a miserable job trying to make chow yun fat act like sylvester stallone or clint eastwood. he's got more talent than this. but not to say every chow movie has to be like a hong kong john woo movie, but it looks like thats what they were going for and they failed. see it on HBO, chow yun fat is the only reason to watch it even if they limit his acting skills bigtime. check The Killer out for a good chow movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"More bullets than words","review":"The minimal dialog and incredibly boring and predictable script in this movie is simply filler between the ridiculous number of gunfights. There is nothing clever or original here at all. Just one gunfight after another. The only worthy element of the movie is the cinematography."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Better Action Flick","review":"A friend of mine fist told me about Chow Yun Fat a couple years before making this movie. I was talking about Jackie Chan and he told me about Chow and Jet Li and how they were coming to America to make a better class of action movie.To see this, Chow's first American movie i was impressed to the bones, He looked cool he looked awesome. there wasn't an adjective you could use that didn't personify Chow Yun FatI was so hooked that i went out and found his Chinese work, and it was awesome too. I don't remember the name of the movie in it's original Chinese, but look for \\"A Better Tomorrow\\" if you are interested in seeing a good Chow Yun Fat movie from ChinaThe director's cut of The Replacement Killers only adds in a little more background to the charactors that wasn't there (and really missed) in the theatrical release.

I especially like his release entitled \\"Maggie's Back in Town\\" and his obbligato work on Johnny Hartman's reissue of ballads on Bethlehem. Those are great recordings. This is not. The selections of charts here leaves me cold. Nothing really swings, nor do any of the ballads reach out and grab you. Groovin High is probably the best cut and it's sub-standard when compared to so many other recordings of this classic. At times McGhee is actually playing out of tune, especially in the upper register.

I have a lot of trouble with reactions, so I cautiously took only a few grains of the powder the first time and immediately had some trouble breathing and felt ill. I waited several weeks to try it again and noted a similar reaction, although not as severe since I used less powder. If you have any concerns about reactions, don't take it. I am going to send it back, because although it may work well for others, something in it bothers me--I'm guessing it's the yeast. If they made this product without the yeast I woul try it again just to see if I could tolerate it.The oxygen drops were fine, but if you use the full dosage you may notice a slightly corrosive effect when you swallow it.

It was melted every which way and stuck to the wrappers. The Reese's peanut butter cups were flattened as though someone had sat on them so had to be pealed from both the stability sheet, the wrapper and the paper cup.

Marrion Ross should have stayed in the yester year with Happy Days.The Directors should have done their home work on the German regalia. Uniforms and emblems where worng. At about 1 hour 20 minutes into the film it shows a date Agust 21st 1944 and the apparent Russian attck which drives the Germans out. In reality this happened in July 1944 when the Red Army re-took Przemyael.So although this film has good intentions the people who filmed in it should have paid more attention to detail and got decent actors in it and not made it look like a budget movie.

There is little discussion of sail plans, as for example the advantages and/or disadvantages of the topsail schooner sail plan. Why were the fishermen on the Grand Banks the success that they were--or were they? What made the fruit schooners that serviced the XVIIII century tables of Britain so fast, and were they faster than other rigs of the same size?

Medoff briliantly captures a young woman's struggle with weight, looks, men, and all that is supposed to be important to Gen-Xers today. Beneath it, she weaves another, deeper struggle to communicate with her parents and family and I recommend that everyone read this book at one time or another. If not to have an epiphany about what really matters, then to get a few good laughs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll devour this book quickly","review":"Hunger Point is an excellent peek into the life of a rather dysfunctional family. Since most people's families are dysfunctional in one way or another, many times the book will touch on subjects, emotions, or situations that hit close to home. The author's brilliant insights into anorexia and mental instability seem unforced, perhaps drawing from autobiographical life experiences. That's what makes Hunger Point such a good read. You can actually perceive what all of the characters are going through at all times and feel for them. I read this book in one day because it was so gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely incredible","review":"captivating story that offers a reader a dialogue to live by. growing up is hard - but getting a sense of yourself is harder. Medoff takes on subject matter that is not only difficult but timely. As we rejoice with Frannie, feel for Shelley, or want to dine with Marsha, Hunger Point wraps up all of what it means to love another person and, just as important, love yourself. Three million cheers for Medoff - cant wait to see what else is on her plate."},{"rating":"1","title":"there's no point","review":"This book was like a literary long march.

To me, none of them were very likable at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thank you","review":"I found this book to be depressing, I struggled to get through thinking that somewhere in the midst something would change and it would get better. It did not! The main character is a sloppy, lazy, irresponsible girl who through her lack of reality has bumbled up her life and has no desire to get it on track... or take accoutability for having bumbled it up so badly. It was not an enjoyable read nothing was uplifing or thought provoking about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - no likeable characters.","review":"The best relationship in the entire book was the one between Frannie and Max!

Anorexia, bulimia, divorce, messy love, suicide, depression, adultery- are only a few of the topics Jillian covers. She covers them with humerous grace. I thought the book was going to by \\"whiny\\" but it really wasn't. The main character was strong and I truly wanted her to succeed. Jillian definitely got a few laughs and a few tears out of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Done Yet, But It STILL Gets Five Stars!","review":"I haven't even finished this book yet, and I still give it 5 stars!

The only problem is that this is the worst produced album I have ever heard. The songs sound like they're played through an AM radio with a 3-inch speaker.

In my opinion the best part was the shooting of Le Cheriffe"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I've always loved Bond films but never read any of the books. I read this one in a very short time, which is a change for me. The character really comes through the book well. You can picture your favorite Bond (to each his own) noticing every detail and processing thoughts while you read the story. Great book. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"good bond novel rarely recognized","review":"this is a rarely thought of Bond adventure. It is quite well done and provides reading pleasure and adventure as Bond was meant to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Intro to 007","review":"I had seen most of the movies so was intrigued when I recently heard an interview with Daniel Craig (2011/2012 007) where he mentioned how much of a hard time Flemming put James Bond through in his books.I have to say that the book kept me engaged from start to finish, and while the plot is the same, in essence to the film made later, the details are quite different in parts, to keep you wondering how things progress.My only criticism is that there are sections where Flemming uses french or another language for the characters, but relies on the reader to translate somehow, or derive the meaning from the story, not sure. I went with the latter approach, but maybe in my Kindle version I should have searched for an French-to-English translator :)I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys the films and grew up with James Bond from their childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Bond ready for an early assignment?","review":"The first of Ian Fleming's Bond books shows us the agent in his early work. We find Fleming's Bond to be a practical and capable individual, who is more confident in his own abilities and perceptions than what perhaps is warrented. The agent that emerges by novel's end is grim, resourceful and driven. The young James Bond is a far cry from the suave, imperturbable Sean Connery that we all came to admire. His vulnerability makes him more human, and his cold determination makes him less so. I enjoyed the novel and look forward to reading the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Royale Indeed","review":"Years ago I was listening to a BBC World Service interview with Sir Kingsley Amis who was a close personal friend of Ian Fleming. Mr. Amis was asked, \\"Which Bond book do you think is the best?\\"Giving the question a good long think, he replied, \\"I think Casino Royale is the best because...as is so often the case for writers, their first published effort...is their best because the writer has enjoyed more time thinking about their book.\\" Or something like that.Sir Kingsley also pointed to the disastrous outcome of Bond's relationship with Vesper Lynd, who was probably the first woman who Bond ever truely loved.At the end, Bond is talking with his boss and says, \\"The b---- is dead.\\" What does that tell the reader about how James Bond will treat women in the future, as his career develops? I think it says enough to create the foundation of a credible, loyal, and notorious spy. Ian Fleming removed the element of domestic life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"A lot of people have talked about how this book is dated by the sexist attitudes of the protagonist. I don't agree. Sexism hasn't gone away, although it is perhaps not written about as blatantly now, nor included as a character trait of our heroes.This character flaw added to the gritty, down and dirty world Bond inhabits.The book is great. The reader is good. I just ordered 'Live and Let Die' with the same reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond movie is better","review":"Not many times do I find the written story lacking compared to the movie. I kept remembering the movie to provide the imagery of a scene. A fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond, James Bond","review":"I'm reading the whole James Bond Series including the Gardner and Benson books. I'm on Goldfinger now and this is one of the best I've read so far. When the two men in straw hats come in I couldn't put down the book! Fleming's description is great and the baccarat game with Le Chiffre, the torture scene and the surprise ending are the highlights in this one! Overall, Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a pretty good James Bond novel...","review":"If you're a die-hard Bond fan I'm sure you'll enjoy Casino Royal. I don't like giving away \\"spoilers\\" but I will just say this book doesn't have as much action as some of the other Bond books. The gambling scenes are interesting, I didn't know how to play baccarat, and fleming explains some of the intracacies of the game before Bond engages in a great game against his antagonist Le Chiffre. If you have seen the movie, the book is not that similar, there are a few things that are the same, but there are also some neat little surprises in here. Be aware however, even though it's the first Bond novel, Casino Royal doesn't reveal anything about Bond's earlier career that you must know before reading the other novels. I wouldn't particularly recommend this novel, almost all the other Bond novels I've read are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good start for Mr. Bond.","review":"Being someone who has seen a lot of James Bond movies, I picked up this book to see where it all started. And I have to say, I was dissapointed. The climax of the book took place right in the middle, and there was endless detail after detail after detail. And I know it was written back in 1953 and it was a different world back then, but I was shocked as to how politically incorrect it was. Spy fiction was not my thing in the first place, but I can honestly say that I'll be sticking to the movies for the forseeable future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great.","review":"Most of this book ages pretty well. Yes, there's parts of it that are woefully offensive in a modern context, but the story still sizzles. The Craig film, which is great too, will make you appreciate it even more.I used to think of this as the \\"slow\\" book in the series. I've come to appreciate its asymmetrical pacing as I've re-read it over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather good,but not perfect.","review":"This book truely captures the period yet at some points could do with refinement. Declines after the Catharsis into what is essentially an epilogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginning","review":"Great start to the series. Bond is shaped in this book and you see how these details will shape his character for the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond as he should be","review":"I read this years ago and with the new Bond book coming out in June I wanted to read it again. I had almost forgotten how the book actually was due to the movie. However, rereading this just makes me realize how much I hated the movie.Ian Flemming's Bond has always been well portrayed by the different actors, even if the performance was not the best. But Daniel Craig tore the character of Bond to shreds. In Casino Royale Bond is his suave cunning, confident self instead of the brooding pissed off one that Craig played.With this being the first installment in the bond series we get to find out bits and pieces as to what it takes to become a 00 and a glimpse into thee softer side of Bond. As always there is the liquor, Women and of course the Bentley, that makes Bond such a Character. It was a very quick read and a good one to read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Do you want a long review? Well too bad, you're not going to get one here. The first Bond book is great for fans of sensationalist literature. It is not always quick-paced but it sets the tone for suspense and unexpected and much wanted action. Tense moments are the card game with Le chiffre, the bomb assasination attempt, the car chase, and the torture scene. The romantic beach getaway between Bond and Vesper may bore you, but Bond's last words in the novel make up for it. Thank God, for books like this because it was a breeze to read. Back when this book was published they had paperback fiction, where the average paperback book was around 55,000 words. What do you get when you see the average paperback book released nowadays and Barnes and Noble? You see huge Bible-sized books. No thank you. I bought the old paperback edition that can fit inside my pocket. It was great reading it on the light rail to and from work each day for a whole week. I like this book and I hope you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow at first, but gets better","review":"The first 30 pages of this book were hard going & did not hook me added to this there were alot of French references which I struggled with.

It's typically Bond & an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, but good","review":"Was happy to get to read a Bond story, not just see the movies! Story was a little short, but good"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Start to the Series","review":"This is obviously the first in the series. Bond is not a fleshed out character and Mr. Fleming seems almost to be feeling out what he wants to make him. Regardless, it is a very good spy novel. Having read later Bond novels, a few old friends appear, giving it that homey feel.There is what will become the mandatory formula: a beautiful woman, the coolness under fire, chase scene, entrapment and escape that make these novels all work so well. Fleming's writing is superior to most in this genre.There is a great sequence of events surrounding and involving a big-time game of baccarat. Having read prior reviews, I went to my Hoyle's before starting so I would knoe the rules. That is not necessary. The game is simple and Bond conveniently explains it to his beautiful cohort. The game is probably the highlight to the book.A very good stepping off to a great series. An excellent light read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different Bond than we know","review":"I would consider this one of the better Bond books in the series. It has a little more violence than some of the others, and is at points not as compelling, but all is made up for by a terrific card scene and an interesting end of the novel. After knowing the character Ian Fleming created and knowing the character(s) Terence Young, Albert Broccoli, and Harry Saltzman created, I think that the character in the novels is another actor playing the role in another story just like the Sean Connery-Bond or the Roger Moore-Bond play different characters or different interpretations of the role in other stories. If the films are cool to you, the books will be too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who could of thought James Bond could be boring?","review":"I know some people like these books, but I am in no way a fan.

I had every intention of buying a book and when I saw a number of James Bond books in a row, I decided to buy Casino Royale as the reviews on the back were rather convincing. I read 2 chapters... I find it difficult to ...enjoy such a boring, pointless in some parts, story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casino Royale Review","review":"Casino Royale was the first of the bond books. It was strange compared to modern day Bond. It was strangely oddly old fashioned and really never had much action in it. It involved Bond going on an assignment which involved card games. He was trying to bankrupt a Russian Smersh agent. Smersh is a Russian spy killing agency if you didn't know. When Bond was succesful at winning it, one of his assistants, Vesper was captured. I'll let you find the ending for yourself. I would r ate this book as one star. it may be Bond, but it is to boring. It managed to make me get to sleep every night. It could bore anyone to death if they want to read the thrills of Bond. Help! I hate just thinking about it. I do NOT want to see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richly Textured James Bond Novel and Period Piece","review":"This is not only Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel but one of his best.

Clearly, James Bond is a worldly character that lives and breaths in this unseen world described by Ian Fleming in this novel.

Casino Royale is a quick fun read. I read this book 20 years ago and again this year. There is one very violent scene that a reader will remember for more than 20 years. Ultimately most readers should enjoy this as an atmospheric cold war tale loaded with bad guys, beautiful women, cool cars and exotic locations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original Bond (oh oh)","review":"After seeing the movie (which has almost nothing to do with this novel), I was curious to see how Fleming originally portrayed James Bond.

Get \\"Watch Closely Now\\" to here Master Walt at his best. Don't buy this Cd if you love high note trumpet playing.

Crisis! What Crisis! came out at a time when Supertramp seemed to be intent on singing all their songs in an even more irritating falsetto than usual and much of it is pretty inconsequential. That said, the album has more highs and lows than the grossly over-rated Crime of the Century, and two tracks in particular -- Soapbox Opera and Two of Us -- are worthy to be included in any compilation album.

I was hooked when I heard \\"Another Man's Woman\\" on the radio (I remember which block of which street it was) and was blown away by the series of developments that go on through the long second half of the song.There is a great trick they pull with the song \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\\" in \\"A Soapbox Opera\\"-- who would have thought you could make an old song that much prettier by coming in on the wrong beat?I love the Dixieland-like clarinet and sax parts on the second, er, side of the album, it's always struck me that there's true love in the playing there.I've never figured out whether we're supposed to laugh at the most pathetic lyrics or take them seriously. But the music makes it totally worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves to be listened to with headphones...","review":"This is their 4th release, from 1975. It's not my favorite Supertramp albums (my fave is Even in the Quietest Moments) but it's still a near-masterpiece. The vocals and instrumentation sound magnificent on this digitally remastered release. Ken Scott was an incredible producer and this CD deserves to be listened to with headphones to truly appreciate all its nuances. Unfortunately this re-issue doesn't contain any additional tracks or liner notes but it's still well worth replacing your original copy due to its impeccable sound. Favorite songs are the minor hit, \\"Sister Moonshine\\" and the ambitious \\"Another Man's Woman\\". Hodson and Davies made great music & I wish they would get back together."},{"rating":"2","title":"The One","review":"To me this is THE best album Supertramp ever made. I can still well remember that long-ago summer vacation when my ears were first touched by \\"Easy Does It\\" and \\"Sister Moonshine\\". Listening to the CD today, I find that this varied collection of musical excellence has lost none of its magic. The album cover, however, has acquired additional symbolic value in the context of the current music business: This album now appears like an island surrounded by mass-produced trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought this DVD midway through my pregnancy in order to prepare for breadstfeeding in any way I could. I was incredibly disappointed though. While the video did have clips of women having discussions on breastfeeding topics, they were not very indepth. Also, there was very little actual video of mothers breastfeeding and illustrating actual techniques, a huge upset to me as this was my main reason for buying a DVD. I wanted to see( and not just READ from books)exactly the kinds of things I would need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!","review":"This is one of those albums that should never have been made... likeEthel Merman Disco Album.Lalo Schifrin wrote some of the best music I ever heard. Like the classic (and out of print)The Dissection and Reconstruction of Music from the Past as Performed by the Inmates...and the beautifulPiano, Strings and Bossa Nova. He also wrote some classic film music likeBullittandMusic From Mission: Impossible (1966-1973 Television Series).So it was with a blind confidence that I bought this CD.But this is a horrible album where every song looks like an instrumental \\"disco\\" variation on THE LOVE BOAT theme. It has all of the 70's musical clichés you can think of. And this is not even great disco. I love disco. But this CD is trash.I do not believe Lalo Schifrin wrote this album and I keep the disc in hope that someday I'll see some light from the sky telling me this was a packaging mistake.As awful as awful can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cables To Go 25ft.

I was able to work it out on my Vizio Smart TV however, reduced the static to an unnoticeable level, and have had no difficulties with the audio or any other part of the set-up.

I'm listening to the final track of the album right now, and it hasn't kicked me in the gut. The group never really swings; it sounds about like a bunch of youngsters playing at swing for 12 tracks. My tastes are usually pretty pedestrian, but this is a little *too* pedestrian even for me. Jackson's voice, which works well for me elsewhere, sounds lightweight and thin here. Can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Knows Swing","review":"Joe Jackson is one of the most versatile and talented musicians of the 80s and does an outstanding job covering these swing classics from the 40s. Jumpin' With Symphony Sid, Jumpin' Juve and Tuxedo Junction are all gems. Jackson took some risks making a swing album and it is a shame that it did not achieve more radio play in the early 80s. However, this is a must have for any Joe Jackson or swing fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"They the cats shall hep ya","review":"I loved this album before it came out on CD! A collection of old Cotton Club-type numbers, these white guys can really beat it out, and with humor -- (Fat and Forty, but Lordy you're my meat). A must for any hipster's collection. And if you don't respond to this jam ... Jack, you dead. P.S. I'd love to know if Joe and the guys ever put out any more of this stuff..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awkward Effort","review":"After overhearing this album a number of times at a friend's apartment, I'm still trying to figure out why anyone wouldn't simply listen to original swing bands do these songs. The Louis Jordan numbers are awkwardly arranged (as if Joe wanted to change them just enough to give the impression he isn't simply lifting the arrangements) and just sound better when Louis Jordan is in charge. But, if you want to listen to average musicians with below average voices hack away at wonderful old swing tunes, this is the album for ou. ON the other hand, if you have ever listened to real swing music, this album will only make you want to break out the old albums and do it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"granados","review":"It was indeed a sad day when I recently read that Alicia de Larrocha had passed away. I was priviliged to hear her live on several occasions, but the one that really sticks in my mind was in Milan in 1987. It was my first visit to the Teatro Alla Scala but the evening's biggest impression was Alicia's Ravel G major concerto with the Scala's Orchestra. Her interpretations of Albeniz and Granados are legendary and this CD is no exception. My mainly Spanish roots may bias me, but believe me, this is great music and great pianism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Magazine","review":"This is one of the best magazines that I have read which feature airports.

Read all the reviews here..and you'll know what you are getting!....The only plus thing is the reduction in the price..I would say the 12.00 price from amazon saves this purchase from being a total disaster.

I can't believe that real people actually speak the way the authors quote them. I realize that accidents are the leading cause of death for young people but this is ridiculous. I bought \\"Love Beyond Life: The Healing Power of After-Death Communications\\" along with this book and thank goodness I read that one first or I would have been completely turned off this subject. The Love Beyond Life book was really interesting and really opened my mind and heart to the possibilities but this Hello from Heaven was just plain stupid.

My wife thought she was going crazy because our son visited her after he got killed. I began to ask God to let my son give me something to comfort me....that is, to let me know he is ok. Well, a sign occurred that both my wife and I know happened. This book confirms that we are not crazy and that loved ones who have died can and do come back to comfort their friends & family. Read this book. It tells me that there is an afterlife, there is a God, and our loved ones can & will come to us to show us that they are ok.

The mind is a very powerful tool and if a person wants to believe something they will. Many of these people that passed on were either very young, died tragically, unexpected or all three. This will surely play mind games on you, where one can actually believe their loved one was sitting right next them at the kitchen table engaging in a normal conversation.

Believe me a few would have been enough (I already believe).On the back of the book it states: \\"comfort and emotional support for those who are bereaved\\", among other false statements. I believe this book was an annoying, let down and a waste of both time and money, to the bereaved and everybody else.Don't waste your money buying this book. If you think you want to read it (you really don't), get it from the library. The book was a waste of money!

I had a visit from my husband one day while doing a simple chore. I smelled his cologne and body odor. Believe it or not that did happen. I turned half expecting to see him, but didn't and wish I had. I did tell him I knew he was there though. I believe I will see him again one day.

The material is all black and white, well exposed and well reproduced. The story starts with the crossing of the Roer River and moves through the end of the war. For the mlitary equipment buff there are many scenes of tanks in action, of artillery, and a lot of footage of the infantryman in combat. There are many scenes of the German death camps and of the suffering and destruction that the Nazis brought to Germany, but the real value to many of us are the scenes of the American GI in action. No glory, just a dirty, nasty job that was done by a generation now in their eighties. It is fascinating to look back at the young men, the average infantry, carrying heavy loads, always in danger, but working towards the victory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kermit Should Sue","review":"Do you like to make fun of Art Films?

Otherwise I love working with the k-bell and plan to keep using this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I got this video and tried it. It can hang with any of the P90x videos and is more fun, in my opinion, if you like kettlebells. I would definitely recommend it and you are going to be sore afterwords."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected a full kettlebell workout","review":"I was very disappointed in this workout DVD. We are new to kettlebell and expected a full kettlebell routine. In this DVD, the kettlebell moves are interspersed with pushups, high knees, lunges. I have tabata and other cardio interval workouts for those moves. The kettlebell moves are awkward and difficult to incorporate into a smooth routine.This DVD appears to be poorly produced - done on the cheap. I think the only reason this DVD sells is because of the name recognition.I returned this DVD to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for beginners.","review":"This is a great workout; however, if you are not a seasoned exerciser then I would take it slow. I love the workout but I change the size of kettlebells for certain exercises. The girl in the video uses a 15 throughout. That's intense unless you are seasoned. I work out 6 days a week cardio and weights very consistently. Still, after the last set of burpees I'm ready to throw up. Lol. Half kidding, half not! I will definitely keep this as part of my repertoire when I want to change things up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not educational","review":"Got this after reading about kettle bells. There is no real instruction on how to use bells. Just a coaching session with no real direction. If you need a motivator - this may be OK. I don't need motivation - just instruction. If you don't know what you are doing- this may not be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learned the basic moves, but boring...","review":"I bought this with a kettlebell to get started. I would have been better off saving the $11 on the DVD, finding an article online (for free) which taught me the exercises, and put on a random documentary while I exercised.That said, if you like that sort of background while you exercise, this would be perfect for you, but I'd rather watch the History channel or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Workout!","review":"I think this is the first review on Amazon that I've ever written, despite ordering many workout videos over the last five years or so. The reason is that this workout is KILLER. I am a 31-year-old female, 5'8\\" size 10, 172 lbs. I would say in pretty decent shape (but carrying extra weight). Today I did this workout for the first time and I wore a heart rate monitor that measures caloric expenditure as well. I burned 451 calories, which I feel is very impressive. I could not do the whole thing without taking a few short breaks. I am very glad I purchased this video.I gave it four stars as opposed to five because Bob actually forgets to do a set of exercises for the left side, after you do the right side. However, I would not let that deter you from purchasing this video - just pause and catch up. I think it will be really worth it. It really works your glutes, too. I am excited to see the results.Great job, Bob - thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY","review":"THIS WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.

But J.Lo can't act--she's poorly cast as an Italian (and has a big caboose, too). Matthew McConaughey is a joke; his twangy accent makes him seem goofier than intellectual.\\"The Wedding Planner\\" might appeal to women, but it's not for men. The typical wedding jokes and been-done-before romantic plotlines are worn-out, and this movie does nothing to refresh them. There are many obvious plot holes (a wedding planner with no social life, a doctor who never seem to busy himself with anything not to mention the occasional patient). The characters are shallow and stretched thin over a plot that is not emotionally engaging.This is a terrible movie. If your wife or girlfriend insists on watching it, demand a night out with the guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"This movie is the one of the most formulaic movies I have ever seen. It basically takes the usual romantic comedy blueprint and follows it to a tee, not bothering to make any changes or distinguish itself in any way. Usually, in such movies, there is a certain chemistry between the leads. There is no such spark between McConaghey and Lopez. I have seen both of them do much better work than this piece of tripe. Steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lopez is the phoniest talent of all time","review":"Jennifer Lopez is the most overrated, so-called talent of all time. Her acting is even worse than her singing. The day that the public gets sick of seeing her is too soon for me.

Placing a well-mixed martini atop the DVD on your coffee table will provide far more entertainment than this movie, even if you are spending your evening completely alone. I'd like to say the script was terrible, but, to be honest, I don't think there was a script. Lopez and McConaughey, two people with at least some talent, never had a chance in this film. If I had to allow this movie one saving grace it would have to be Justin Chambers as the puppy-lovesick Mossimo, but even he was sadly underserved by this sadly underwritten script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw it for Matt and ONLY Matt.","review":"I don't think JLo is a good actress.

There was no chemistry between the two characters. Also, casting directors have to stop picking actresses like her in movies that could really be good.

Her playing one is just plain insulting."},{"rating":"2","title":"light-hearted, fun chick flick","review":"In The Wedding Planner, Jennifer Lopez plays a perfectionist wedding planner who has been unsuccessful finding love herself. She becomes hopeful after being rescued by a hot stranger on the street, then finds out that he is the groom-to-be in a major account. Will she break the wedding planner's cardinal rule of not falling in love with the groom?At the same time, viewers see her relationship with her traditional Italian father and his kind, Scrabble-playing friends.It's a light hearted movie with a good dose of saccharine.

Was I in for a disappointment!Jennifer Lopez is a terrible actress and there is absolutely no chemistry between her and Matthew McConaughey (who is adorable in How to Lose a Guy). Further more the movie celebrates a guy who is about to be married flirting and drooling and making goo-goo eyes at a perfect stranger. And the ending! I won't give it away, let's just say that there are NO surprises here, you can see this one coming from a mile away!If you want to sit down with a blanket, some comfort food, and a great chick flick check out Bridget Jones, Return to Me, When Harry Met Sally or French Kiss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie!","review":"I love this movie!

Someone had the audacity to call this movie, \\"charming,\\" and \\"light-hearted\\". Puh-leeze. I was sooo disappointed when I rented this from BB, that I walked it over the same night and returned it. J.Lo disappoints in this one-majorly.

We find this movie an unjustified offense against the Italian people. It is ridiculous to describe Italians with the image of a person rough, without style, with no manner....who is not able to eat pasta! Come on....Italy, among other things, is well known for the elegance, style, and good manners of the people and for high quality fashion & food...

But the key word here is GOOD romantic comedy. Sadly, this movie was not good. Matthew tried, J-Lo tried, heck, they all TRIED, but it was just too cheesy to save. Why was it necesary for J-low to mention the m&ms quote? As if this was some romantic thing he had mentioned before. He just likes the brown ones, and for a stupid reason. Let it go. This movie was so badly written it never stood a chance. J-Lo we loved you as Selena, Matthew, you did a great job in A Time To Kill, so what possesed you to make this movie? The world may never know. If you want to see a much better written romantic comedy that didn't receive nearly as much press, check out 'Just Write' starring Jeremy Pivon and the guy who played J-Lo's father, he did much better in this movie.

Ok, the acting for one. Mathew MacConaughy is by far the worst actor in the business. J-Lo's father has the worst Italian accent ever portrayed.

Therefore, I had not interest in watching it until recently when nothing else was in at the library. I absolutely loved it! From now on I will keep an open mind because this was one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in years! I was never a fan of Matthew McConaughey or Jay-Lo before, but they both sparkled in this one. I think I even fell in love with Matthew for a second, he was so charming. Even my husband (who prefers action-packed violence and gore in flicks) enjoyed it. Thumbs up, 5 stars, A+, or whatever- The Wedding Planner will make you smile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flopper","review":"Im sorry, but no. This movie was terrible.

I cannot imagine this movie being as good and hilarious without Jennifer's comedic talent. Matthew McConaughey is a bit stiff, and could have done better. The sidekick actors were perfectly cast.

Highly recommended for those who love happy endings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scripting planner?","review":"I will first off say I did enjoy the movie; I am used to switching my brain off when watching certain types of films; but for this one I had to go three notches lower than I knew existed.The main plot of the movie is fine, pristine; the sub-plot is what throws the whole thing off kilter. The sub-plot adds nothing to the story, and destroys the main character. While functioning in the sub-plot the main character personality becomes homely and stupid, in the main plot she is aggressive and controlling. It appears to be two characters and two stories combined without regard to their contradictions. In places it is actually so bad, the movie is forced to cut to another scene before the actors stop and stare into the camera.It's witty and somewhat funny but not much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there ever was an Oscar for the WORST movie...","review":"If you ever wondered about the precise definition of HORSES**T... ever wondered how best it may be visually represented, you're staring at the answer.

It shouldn't have. The storyline is typical, but so what? They all are. Jennifer Lopez is fabulous as Mary, I loved the character she played.

This flick wasn't cerebal, but it didn't have to be. I wanted to laugh and get involved and it suited my needs at the moment. (I was in a funk.) It's a feel good movie as well as a comedy of errors.

If only there were an option to give a film a negative rating. The character Mary is about as transparent as J-Hose awards show gowns... and it proves once and for all that she is as poor an actor as musician. Just pairing those words along side the Lopez name diminish the meaning of both. One thig I can say for the character Mary, an Itilian by the way, is that she had an uncanny ability to slip unto a latino accent with no warning whatsoever, or... could it be that Ms. lopez is unable to stay in character? I really feel sorry for Mr. McConaughy for being cast in such a loathsome excuse for a film. He did a spectacular job at creating some interest, but one man can't make up for a horrible script.

There is no need for obstacles or pointless drama. Romantic comedies are *almost* all the same. Same characters, same ending.

I have to believe the people that like this stuff have only heard it almost less than once. This guys monotone voice has the quality of scratching fingernails on a chalkboard. It is just flat annoying and is just enough to make your skin crawl with discomfort. Even worse it all, all sounds the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"something different","review":"This album is a breathe of fresh air. It was so nice to listen to this album because it came out during a time when music seemed so dark. It was like an alternative to the alternative rock music that was so popular in 1994.\\"Hannah Jane\\",\\"Hold My Hand\\",\\"Time\\" and \\"Let Her Cry\\" are my favorite songs on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is excellent!!!","review":"This is one of the few cd's that I love every song on it. I still listen to it all the time. I am a huge H&B fan but I definitely think this was their best album by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This album deserves to be one of the best selling of all time.It's too bad the public seems to have abandoned them. They showed great depth on Fairweather Johnson and seem likely to be worthy entrants into the Great American Artists Club.I eagerly await Musical Chairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great 90s album","review":"There is no question that when this album was at the height of it's popularity in the mid 90s it was extremly overplayed on the radio.So much so that it was almost a joke. That is where some of the negative backlash against HATBF comes from. Now 17 years later I find myself turning up the radio whenever I hear a song from this album. This is a great guitar oriented rock and roll album. We were spoiled in the 90s with so many good new bands and great albums. We could use a new band today that could put out an album half as good as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hootie and His Big, Horrendous Blow-hole","review":"The noise on this album is guilty of two of the three biggest flaws that determine doggerel. One: rhetoric, and two: sentimentality. Especially the latter. But it's catchy, I'll admit, if only in an annoying way. Here's a quote, and by this quote I intend not to criticize the lyrics, which are secondary to the music anyway, but the music itself, which is punctuated by the words (if only I could quote notes!): \\"Hooooold my hand/I wanna love you, the BES' that, the BES' that I CAAAAAAAAAN!\\" Dreck. The exaggerated crooning of Mr. Rucker makes him the male equivalent of Celine Dion. And the monotony of the guitar work makes this band not inappropriate for certain circumstances in which this music, does, in fact, sound good: say, in a shopping mall, your dentist's office, or any old elevator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost painfully boring...","review":"Maybe it's because this album was absolutely drilled into my brain from endless radio play, but this was an awful experience. I got it as a well-meaning gift recently and vowed to listen to the whole thing in one sitting. I managed to stay awake, but not without propping my eyes open with toothpicks. A totally vapid waste of plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I CAN NO LONGER FRONT...","review":"It's strange how a band can be the hugest act in America and the most hated all at the same time.This strange pop paradox fits Hootie & The Blowfish like a glove.Down-home South Carolina boys playing unoffensive,very enjoyable,heartland style rock.Hootie offered an alternative to the morose,moody stylings of grunge in the world of rock/pop inthe mid '90s and turned out to have one of the best-selling albums in US history with this 1994 debut,\\"Cracked Rear View\\".Now I know that it's \\"against the rules\\" for a credible musicfan to display love towards a unabashed mainstream pop act butI happened to like Hootie's brand of feel-good frat boy rock!:-)\\"Time\\",the lovelorn hit \\"Let Her Cry\\",\\"I Only Want To Be With You\\",and the criminally overplayed \\"Hold My Hand\\"-all down-home,Americana-styled pop/rock songs that are as easy and cozy as a Southern breeze.Those who bash Hootie seem to be missing the point.They never seemed to proclaim themselves as intellectual rockers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats with all the bad reviews??","review":"Hootie and the Blowfish's debut album \\"Cracked Rear View\\" is a kick ... CD. How could you not like it?? I don't undertand how this band went from almost the most popular band of the early 90's to almost the most hated. What did they do wrong?? That's jst it. They did NOTHING wrong!! Some losers just decided that \\"Liking Hootie wasn't cool anymore\\" and they got people to follow them until everyone thought that way. This CD is awesome. Not one song on here I don't like. If you are a fan of Dave Matthews Band, Blues Traveler, or other bands of that sound, this CD is the best one you can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done!","review":"As a fan of oldies and celtic music, I am proud to say that Hootie holds the distinction of being the only \\"modern\\" group that I listen to on a regular basis. Unlike many of today's groups, there is something very pleasing and refreshing about their sound. Although many of the tracks have a somewhat depressing theme, such as drowning, or the desire to be with or away from someone, the album itself is not depressing. Rucker and his crew manage to pace the album nicely, which only adds to the experience. The songs are very easy to relate to, and although it is difficult to understand what Rucker is saying at times, I still consider this one of my favorite albums. I encourage everybody to buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A snoozer","review":"You have to give this band credit for somehow convincing their fans that they love to hear the same five notes over and over and over.

Yes sir/ma'am: Jackson in prime condition. My personal favorite: Be my number two. This song features Jackson behind the piano with no backup. Jackson turns the lyrics into a bittersweet gem of a lovesong."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Gone but Not Forgotten; (See Rollins v.2)","review":"A deliberate cover parody of Rollins' Volume Two album (see below), Jackson here sets out to blend variations on themes found in previous albums (and cuts) while offering variety which always manages to keep pace steps far ahead of industry itself. It was Jackson who, upon seeing final product of video adaption of Night and Day (e.g., \\"Steppin Out\\"), made decision to literally abandon medium and stick strictly to format of musicality itself. In some sense I believe he is a formalist committed to the craft well beyond the mediocritic (pun non-intentional) and often slick fashioning of sundry packaging. Not as popish as previous or rhythmically jived as live album, Body and Soul figures prominently (strangely, in a quiet way) as transcending the literalness of commercial confines to the figurative of musical genius. Here is one impassioned to the form, the genre, the precision to innovate without fear of consequences. Good job, Joe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than I expected","review":"Nothing of real interest here, neither the production or the writing is much to write home about. It will make a good coaster for your coffee cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to butcher a classic","review":"This must be one of my all-time favourite CDs. And one of the best-sounding albums of all time as well, thanks to Joe Jackson's early use of digital recording techniques combined with vintage microphones. Which makes the mystery all the greater: what on earth happened in 1997, when the record company decided to remaster this?The dynamics of the remaster are, admittedly, more up-to-date. But there are loud popping noises on almost all the tracks, notably on the opener The Verdict (after about 29 seconds). At times it sounds painfully like an old vinyl LP...and yet none of these faults were present on the original CD release. Add to this the poor quality of the sleeve and booklet (what happened to the colours?) and it's a total disaster. I can only hope that someday, someone will release a \\"Deluxe\\" edition like that of Night And Day and restore this pioneering recording to its original glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent, fabulous, frabjous, breathtaking....","review":"Another person who reviewed this album said to start your Joe Jackson collection with this. As your doctor, I must say \\"DO NOT LET THIS BE YOUR FIRST JOE JACKSON!\\". It will only spoil you!!! Great production, orchestration, recording, vocals, lyrics, just a superlative effort. The single, solitary thing that doesn't hold up well is when Elaine Caswell sings \\"..it's not so easy, it's '84 now!\\" Big deal! Just hearing her duet with Joe in that crisp, clean contralto of hers took my breath away just like it did 15+ years ago. Whew!! Takes me back to Joe's shows at the Greek in '89 or '90. Buy This. Play It Loud. Play It Soft. Dig It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dare to be different...dare to be great","review":"while Joe Jackson more than proved his capability as a pop/rock writer/performer, with Body and Soul he chose to swim upstream - against a massive tide of 80's pop. Jackson spreads his musical wings on this work of blues-jazz-rock (seemingly endless influences). The result is so incredible - this is truely one of those albums that will give you goosebumps. Put your headphones on or listen in the car on a long road trip. Unfortunately, because it is difficult to define it is unlikely you will see this - or much of Joe Jackson's material as an Amazon.com \\"essential recording\\". However, for the fan of great music, this will be one of your essential recordings. And don't miss Blaze of Glory and Night and Day - both fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I first bought this album in vinyl in 1985. It blew me away then, and still does today. It's one that I can always put on and enjoy. It's very well recorded, and musically shows a lot of flexibility. The sound is bright and open in one track, then close and intimate in the next. This album is a very nice contrast to his \\"Night & Day\\" album which had a few pop hits a lot of people are familiar with, and also contrasts with his earlier work. They recorded the album in a masonic lodge, and you get both the open sound and energy of a live show, with the excellent sonic quality of a studio recording. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectualizing the Obvious!","review":"Fukyama, Professor of Political Economy at Johns Hopkins, has managed to take three obvious conclusions that most Americans have already reached - absent PhDs or expensive tuition - and create 240 boring, useless pages. These conclusions are: 1)The Bush administration wrong made preventive war the central tenet of its foreign policy. 2)It also badly misjudged global reaction. 3)The Bush administration's third error was failing to appreciate the difficulties involved in establishing a successful democratic government in Iraq.The fact that Fukuyama was a neoconservative supporter does not change the triviality of the conclusions; it does, however, demonstrate that, unlike President Bush, he is open to accepting contrary information.A total waste of time, money, and paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I removed a Gaffrig Speedometer which I had disconnected a few years ago (use GPS instead to get speed) and this fit perfectly in its place.

I took a chance with out calling Sony and it worked great. Very easy to install and mount. My only complaint is that when playing songs from an iPhone you don't see what song or playlist is playing...it just says \\"USB\\" in the display.

However, the author and editors made an unfortunate choice to include one image that crosses the line from disgusting to abusive.

The DVD is. I'm so disappointed in the quality of the DVD that I doubt I will ever watch it again. Not one of the special features works for me. My Sony DVD player will not show them at all, and the special features as well as the DVD-ROM-specific features have never worked on my computers. I'm no technophobe and no idiot; I've tried this DVD in three DVD-ROM drives on three computers, in at least four different pieces of DVD player software, and I have yet to get past Ollivander's without catastrophic crashes and multiple scripting errors.

Since I saw the movie before I read the book, imagine my suprise to find that there were one or two more obstacles for Harry, Hermione and Ron to get through.

Rowling is a great storyteller with a fine sense of pace and a great way of letting us see through Harry's eyes as he discovers the rich world of his birthright that he's just being exposed to. The film gives very little sense. of that. If they'd been more faithful to Rowling's pacing, things would have worked out a lot better. The wild ride through Gringotts would have been great fun.

I found the movie delightful and the actors exquisite - it had appeal to anyone who ever imagined as a child. It impressed me so much (and knowing that any movie couldn't possibly include every detail) that I went out and bought the series.What amazed me most was how both the movie and the books made me feel the same way when they were done; that, I think speaks highly of the production team's dedication to J.K.

What i didn't like and thought that was childish were a few scenes like Neville Longbottom's feather blowing up or when Harry,Hermione and Ron saw Fluffy their scream was synchronized.Also they didn't show the potions part that they had in the book and Harry's fight with Vol(sorry!)

It had very little of the plot in it, and the children were terrible actors. The one reason I had gone to see it was to watch the Quiddich, which was just plain awful! The people looked like SIMS!

It's a little better than okay, but I have to wonder if the asking price is worth what you end up getting. Oh, the picture and audio on the Blu-Ray are astounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversold product of an overactive imagination","review":"Not much of a fan of the science fiction/fantasy genre, an overseas flight offered me the opportunity to see what I had understood to be a delicious, imaginative story of an orphan finding himself. Instead, I found the creative elements to be more boring and mundane than exciting, the kids to be overly stereotyped, and the plot more banal than bodacious.The story blends recycled elements of Dickens with Star Wars and Ben Hur only with tens of millions spent on 'special' effects. Expecting colorful characters, I found only silly characters dressed extravagantly drawn by aging if not ancient English thespians. Fighting off sleep was more of a challenge than the twists of the tale. And the bits of terror are inappropriate for any child under age thirteen, unless you accept that young people need to have nightmares.Thank goodness they didn't charge me for the headphones on the flight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"shouldn't be...","review":"I don't think that this item should be featured as something a person who is in to Left Behind might be interested in. Granted, I haven't seen it, so my rating is not exactly fair, but sorcery and Jesus Christ should not be catagorized together"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, dull, unmagical. Read the book-- or play outside","review":"Thuddingly literal adaptation which races so hard to get every famous incident into the movie that it has no time for characterization, magic, humor, any of the qualities that made the books charming. The kids are relatively colorless and adults who seem perfectly cast (from Alan Rickman to John Cleese) are given next to nothing to do. A more joyless example of how British wit can be turned into expensive American product can hardly be imagined-- this is the kind of movie that, given a choice between showing us a magnificently designed set for Gringott's Bank or a pile of phony gold, encourages us to ooh and ahh over the pile. Well, don't add to this movie's pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rather watch my dog puke.","review":"The characters, the story, everything is stupid in this movie.

So I decided, well... maybe the movie and their little cubbie pop star Radcliff could fix the story line and all a bit up so that it would make a tad of senseI watched the movie, and was utterly dissapointed. If you have a child with you, its a great movie, but when you really think of all the unrealities Harry Potter and his frends could have taken i.e Ron as a Knight and not dying?? To me, Ron not dying is like in the Lord of the Rings FOTR, except its Boromir, and it made 1000's of times more sense.For childish minds and children, great movie. For people who love happy endings or want a family movie.For Lord of the Rings realists, and people that like good movies, a dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"peeves!","review":"did peeves the poltergiest make this movie?.cause hes not in the film.i was so dissapointed with harry potter.i almost fell asleep during the forbidden forest bit even though its my faivourite chapter in the book.snape is a bit dull.dumbledore is dull and mcgonnagall dull.why doe s flitwick look like a gargoyle.ron and hermione are ok but i hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was , \\"BLOODY BRILLIANT!\\"","review":"This movie was really great, these kids are really quite young and they did a great job in acting.

It was catchy and entertaining. However, it takes a twist into a D&D; segment and totally throws you for a loop. I lost interest as my kids who were dying to see it. The ending was really weak, as well. We all know that Harry is the hero, but come on! They could've done something a bit better than that TOTALLY EXPECTED end sequence when the different houses were being awarded for their points. YAWN.All I suggest is you rent it before you buy it...

READ THE BOOK"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the book? Not really......","review":"Let me be honest. When the fourth book of the series was released and people went wild, I had no idea who Harry Potter was. I did my research, saw the trailers for the film, then actually went and saw it a few days after it was released. I was less than impressed with the film.(Take into account I had not read the books up to this point.) Don't get me wrong, the idea, the whole concept behind the film was great, but it the whole movie to me was, well, boring. After seeing the movie I decided to read the books. The sorcerer's stone is a fantastic book. Very enjoyable reading, and as I was reading it, I could picture the scenes of the movie in my mind. I have just about finished the second book, having started it only yesterday, and am actually looking forward to the Chamber of secrets in theaters. I'm going to give the movie a second chance when it comes out on DVD, because now I understand more about the whole Harry Potter phenomenon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie is truly wonderful and anyone who disagrees with it on religious grounds is fooling themselves. This movie has as much to do with magic as Mary Poppins, and that is a classic. In time, this film will be right up there with the best. The performances are great across the board and the three main children hold up the almost three hour film with impeccable force. The movie is scary at times, like all the great children stories and movies (remember Willy Wonka and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang), but it is kept at a family level. The dvd is really cool but it could use alot more behind the scenes, although of course, a little of the magic would be gone if I knew how they did everything. Sometimes the imagionation is our greatest allie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's up with the whining adult reviews.","review":"Appearently too many adults that reviewed the movie failed to remember that this is an adaptation of a childerns book, for those childern. Trying to compare this movie to \\"The Lord of The Rings\\", a movie made for adults from a book written for adults is childish and makes the reviewer peavish at best. Instead of complaining about the adaptation, be thankful the director made the movie for the childern who loved the book and did not attempt to convert it to something for adults which probly would end up not pleasing either the adults or the childern for whom it was written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movies from Books","review":"I usually dislike a movie that is from a book because it is usually missing a lot of important details that the book has which I know cannot be helped. Sometimes things are changed which is a big no no! But picking out key elements is a must have if you are going to be successful with the movie, fans, and readers. I thought the movie did well with following the plot of the book, key elements were targeted and things that were left out weren't really needed. The characters were very convincing and were just as I had imagined them from the book. Other movies from books could take a few notes from this one. I just hope they are just as successful with the next Harry Potter movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie and Kid Friendly, too","review":"As one of millions of adult Harry Potter Fans, I was a little skeptical of how well the movie would follow the book. I was glad that it was pretty true to it.We watched it all weekend long with both of my kids (ages 6 years and 3 years). Both boys enjoyed it and didn't get scared."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book was better","review":"If I hadn't read the book first, I probly would have loved the movie, but as always, I read the book first. The special features are nice but I tend to by DVD's just for the qulity of the movie, not the \\"features.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I saw this movie to see what the Harry Potter hysteria was all about. Fifteen minutes into the show I was bored. There was one interesting part where a character we thought was a bad guy turns out to be a good guy. I think the three kids with the starring roles are good actors and cute kids though. I just didn't think this was a very good movie. I couldn't wait for it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment!","review":"While the HP books were outstanding, the movie had so much potential that it's very dissapointing to actually see the result. The acting was bad, the effects poor, and the direction seemed to think this is a starwars movie. The Quidditch scene was almost exactly the same as the Pod Racing scene on SW-EP1!Waste of time, this is 2 hours of my life I want back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More energy than a tub of dead fish","review":"I think this movie sucked. I'm a fan of the books, and I say Mr. Columbus worried too much about being too faithfull. It had no life of it's own. One example; John Hurt is normally a good character on screen, and he should have been in this, also, especially as the fun character that the wand-seller in the book was. He wasn't. It was one of the most boring scenes in the movie. I only give it two stars because of the Quidditch match.Thanks Chris, for putting Harry Potter images into my head which are far less stimulating than my own imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The movie held true to the book, which I thought was impressive. Although a lot of the smaller details were left out, I can understand due to the over all length of the movie. But there were enough major events included, that someone who hasn't read the books, could follow the events. The movie and all the special effects presented were amazing. The time went by so fast and really kept you involved with the story line. I do wish more of the childrens inter play and conversations were seen. As this reconfirms and helps define each character. In some ways, the special effects over shadowed the characters at times. But I wouldn't miss any of the future movies. Each of the characters are beautifully played and come to life before your eyes. Just as you picture them while reading the book. The costumes, sets and special effects really helped you connect with the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes longer to open the deleted scenes than to play them","review":"The movie's questionable adaptation of the book aside this dvd is appalling. The menus are slow, cumbersome with too many [weak] graphics and pointless extras. The really annoying aspect of this DVD is the deleted scenes which are either too important to the plot line to have been left out or not worth watching at all- to open them you have to unlock them in no less than 18 Steps! I am very serious about this their are FAQ's on how to see them! It takes about half an hour and you would never figure it out without online help because it comes with no instructions. There is no charm, no nostalgia for the film experienced, it is purely infuriating. Just buy the VHS if you really want to see them."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fair movie","review":"This movie, though enjoyable, is deffinately below the standards set by the actual Harry Potter Books by J. K. Rowling. There are some good effects, but the movie in itself is rather kiddish. Deffinatly enjoyable, but not a really blockbuster.I did enjoy it, but I would suggest renting it before actual purchase. The following two movies are deffinatly better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly wonderful","review":"For all of the reviewers out there who have given this movie poor reviews, let me tell you they have no imagination. I have read all four released books and plan to read the rest. As a mother of three I say this story has a fantastic storyline. children both young and old will love this movie. It is the first time a movie has stayed so close to the books storyline. I highly recommend getting this movie if you have children or even if you are a kid at heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full blown letdown","review":"I finally bought the movie. I can't believe what a shallow story line it had. This was a slow movie. I suggest that whatever few haven't seen it yet; to wait for it to play on TV, or just keep a close eye at garage sales, ..., for this.I was really disappointed by the degree of hype associated to this movie. I wished I would have read 'my' review before buying it.... :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter And The Reviewer's Stone","review":"If you like Lord Of The Rings and the book series Everworld, you will LOVE this movie. According to the title, it is the first movie of the Harry Potter book series, however it is a little bit different. I hate spoilers, so I am not going to tell you what is going to happen.The rating does make it's effect in this movie.Violence: Just a bit. The rating PG. I dont think kids under 10 would understand it.Sex: None.I give it a 7/10 because it really is a very good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter is a great movie!","review":"This movie is so awesome. It is exciting, and way cool. I had read the book twice before seeing this movie, and they are both really good. I would totally reccomend the book, too, but for people (like me) that don't really like spending their free time reading, the movie gives you a good idea of the story. This is a really awesome movie. The special effects are way cool, and the casting is totally perfect! This is a great movie to see. And, on this DVD, you could watch it again and again! Even if you're an adult, you should still see this movie. People who say Harry Potter is for kids must have never actually seen or read Harry Potter. Some of the stuff in this movie MIGHT scare kids, but, hey, it just makes the movie more exciting to have some action in it. Anyway, this is a great movie, and I totally recommend it, no matter how old you are, or wether you like or dislike the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but nowhere near as good as The Lord of the Rings!","review":"Okay, I have to admit, I have never read any of the Harry Potter books and the only reason why I agreed to see this movie was for my niece who is a huge fan of the books. Now while the film has some nifty special effects, the storyline is too slow and the film is aimed for a smaller audience. I wasn't a fan of the books and this film won't make me buy one anytime soon. If your children must see this video then watch it only if the books are interesting for you. If you havn't read any of the books, simply let your children watch it while you pick up a good book to read, like The Lord of the Rings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter rocks!","review":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's(Sorcerer's as in America)Stone was the coolest movie I had ever seen.I've read the book before I saw the movie but I enjoyed the movie more 'cos if I had to read anything it would probably be the subtitles(my sister alays puts them on and it's sooo annoying) and not the whole script instead(i hate reading).The one thing I don't understand why people say that Harry Potter teaches children witchcraft and that it worships the devil.Does anyone undertsand that 'cos I certainly don't.Harry Potter just has all the things that us kid could imagine and I don't think us children would worship the devil(we can't anyway,he doesn't exist).But anways,Harry Potter was a great movie and the rest of the HP movies will be just as great :) (that is...unless they have to get some other people to play the part of draco,ron,or harry since tom,rupert,and dan are getting older.especially tom)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb movie but a disappointing DVD!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of the book as well as the movie but the DVD really disappointed me. I'd been expecting to see something special on DVD. But I cannot find any promised unseen scenes. All they can give are some silly stuffs on DVD 2.If you're a fan, buy the movie anyway. But I don't recommend the DVD. If you want to save some money, just get either VHS or VCD (asia)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure","review":"The best person to see this movie is someone who wants to read the book but hasn't yet.Obviously a movie that's not 8 hours long never lives up to its book, but the parts they did use were done quite well enough that I don't regret paying seven bucks to see it in the theater.One of the best integrations of CGI I've ever experienced; of course the fact that the movie is a coloring book of a kid's fantasy tale kinda makes that easier. Just the same...If you're 22 like me, give or take a few years, and you loved Legend and The Dark Crystal and The Labyrinth and The Princess Bride and The Neverending Story, pretend you're a kid with a new VCR and you're momma or daddy just rented this for you. It's sure to be a classic in the same vein as those mentioned to the kids who are seeing it now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for fans!","review":"Extremely happy with this collector's set. Quality of video and audio is worth the extra money. Love the little extras it comes with...the collector cards, mini photo book...etc. Plus the extended version includes the removed scenes and you have the option to watch either version. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME","review":"Great add to the Harry Potter collection we have and will last for years of viewing with me and my kids"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"This movie captures the magic of Harry Potter enough to be a great movie. Third best movie in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"straight from the devil's lair","review":"this movie is loaded with occult practices and beliefs. if your child reads these books and watches these movies they will likely succumb to the evil world of the occult. parents if you think this is harmless you obviously aren't paying attention. the parents of the two columbine shooters didn't know their sons were making bombs in the basement...what are your kids doing in the basement after they watch these movies?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the coolest movies ever","review":"This movie was one of the coolest movies I have ever seen. I am and always was a big Harry Potter fan, and I have read the books about 3 or 4 times each. So when the movie came to theatres, I was a little nervous of what it would be like. I thought that it would probably [be bad] and I would hate it. But when I finally saw it, I loved it!!!! The only problem was that they cut out the part where Hermione helps Harry solve a problem with bottles (which was supposed to be the last obstacle protecting the Philosopher's Stone). I liked that part. But it was a very good movie overall, and a perfect cast was selected. I especially liked Daniel Radcliffe, because he plays Harry so perfectly and not to mention he's pretty cute.The DVD was fun, except the stupid Second Disc was driving me crazy while I was trying to find the deleted scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DVD Even Harry Would Be Proud Of","review":"Let's make this short and sweet. After buying this exact DVD from Amazon, I have played it over and over. The DVD extras are worth the price alone as you can do everything Harry did before getting to Hogwarts. The trivia games will test even the most astute Harry-phile. Not to mention the movie itself is fantastic. After seeing it in theaters, I went out and bought the first three novels in paperback and read each cover to cover. Now I wait for Book Four to be released in paperback, so I can continue my Harry Potter story following. All in all, this movie is fantastic as it doesn't leave hardly anything out from the book. My only sadness is that Chris Columbus will not be directing the third installment, as I feel he has a real knack for this series. So buy it, enjoy it, and as the commercial says...BRING THE MAGIC HOME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magically Entertaining","review":"Hearing that the DVD of Harry Potter featured bonus scenes and additional insight into the making of the film, I chose to splurge on the DVD over the VHS version. Mind you, I did not own a DVD player when I ordered this film. The morning after my shipment arrived, I went to the store to purchase a DVD player and that night, we watched the movie. The quality of the DVD is wonderful and the sound is amazing (we hooked it up to our stereo speakers). The bonus features include a tour of Hogwarts as well as \\"skits\\" with the sorting hat and even web-interactive activities in which I have not yet particpated. All-in-all, this is a great way to watch the movie though the widescreen viewing makes my 20\\" television seem even smaller. I suppose that is the only downside, now I need a TV that can hold its own with Harry Potter's DVD quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD but hard to see the deleted scenes","review":"The deleted scenes DO exsist, on disc two. It is hard to get to them, you have to work your way trough the 'game' of the second disc, starting on Diagon Alley, getting your wizard money at Gringotts and then your wand at ollivanders, then going to the classrooms and starting in Transfigureation, go to the stand with the owls on it. It will take a bit of time to figure it all out but you can finally see the deleted scense, you basically play through the book. I am dissappointed by this, as it took me a long time to figure it out. This doesn't dampen my spirits though, the movie is still \`number one, though it cut out some minor thingsfor the sake of time. Overall it's a great buy, if you have kids, if not, still worth it to keep the movie forever, since DVD's, unlike VHS tapes, don't wear out, only break."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!","review":"Here's the scene: I'm a relatively sane, socially adept woman of twenty-something, sitting with a friend in a crowded (and I mean, crowded) movie theater in November 2001.

Rowling's inspired world. I was living at Hogwart's. I was practicing my wizardry (although, at this stage, only with the popcorn). I was LIVING HARRY POTTER. Can I give this movie more than 5 stars? It was fabulous. And now, I can see it over and over and over again at home!(And, yes, I know all about the Lord of the Rings vs. Harry Potter debate. Lord of the Rings was a better movie technically -- not as in special effects technical, but as in movie-making-as-an-art technical. But you know what? I wanted to BE Harry Potter after the movie. Not so with Frodo Baggins. Sorry all you Tolkein fiends!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha...","review":"Don't waste your money on this, I saw the movie in the theater and it was terrible.

No.","review":"The books are a beautiful work of art- terribly ruined by this horrible movie. \\"Harry Potter\\" has been described as having a new magic that gets kids READING for once, and then what do they do?

It's a prime example of how blue screen digital derring-do can fall flat on its face. The computer backgrounds were uneven, at times almost cartoonish, and the special effects weren't always that special, from the first look at the outside of Hogwarts to the fake-n-bake Quidditch match. Not seeing some of the best parts of the book was a bit disappointing, but that wasn't the main problem with the movie. It's almost always necessary to eliminate some book episodes to keep the cinema pace moving. What grated the most was the ineptness of the not-so-special effects crew.

He has his own series of epic adventures to enjoy with characters like Dumbledore and Hagrid, friends like Hermoine and Ron, monsters like Fluffy and such vivid imagery that capture and mold a young boy's imagination.The DVD set encourages your participation in the adventure.

This is one of the most financially successful movies ever made, based on the equally successful line of books by J. K. Rowling. I'm puzzled by the popularity of this film; the plot is rambling and never really gives the viewer time to get to know the main characters. As such, I found I didn't particularly care about what happened to them. The actors did a fine job (given the material they had to work with), but it just seemed empty to me.Movies based on books always have to omit huge amounts of material but it seems like the characters suffered the most in this adaptation. I'd much rather have had less of the sportplayed with flying broomsticks (and the giant chess game) and much more characterization."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIME FOR SELF-SATISFIED HARRY TO RETIRE","review":"The fourth HARRY film, (following \\"The Trouble With Harry Potter,\\" \\"When Harry Potter Met Sally,\\" and the series' high-water-mark, \\"Dirty Harry Potter\\"), is a mostly hollow exercise that does little to enliven a once-lucrative franchise.

My brain practically blew up trying to find the darn things! Okay, so I have to buy a magic wand, enroll in potions class, mix the right potions, select the right bat...AUGH! IF I WANTED A COMPUTER GAME I'D HAVE BOUGHT ONE! Frankly, the deleted scenes weren't even worth looking for anyway.On to disc one, the movie (which is okay) looks exactly as you'd expect it to look: pristine.

There were several casting errors (Maggie Smith comes to mind) but the reason for the low review is this..My 30ish sister rented the DVD to see the extra scenes. After spending an hour an a half trying to figure out where they were on the DVD she asked me to try to figure it out. After I couldn't do it (I'm the technowiz in our house) I went online to discover she had to play the game to view them.

Those, frankly, are the only reason I bought the CD, and it is extremely irksome to me (who stayed up til 1:45 a.m. working last night) that I can't simply view the scenes I bought and thought I had immediate access to. There should be a work-around for the many adult fans who actually have busy lives. This isn't a Sesame Street movie aimed only at toddlers, and I think the producers ought to have taken the sophistication of its audience into account in designing the special features of the CD.

It is a great movie for everyone of any age. Going to the movies was a great experience because kids were dressed up and ready and excited. Now the DVD lives up to the fun. Hours of extras are included as you navigate through a number of puzzles. Once you complete the puzzles only then are the extras found. The movie itself has a great feel. Both picture and sound quality are excellent. I highly recommend Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting movie for all ages","review":"After hearing all the hubbub about Harry Potter from children and adults alike, I had to see for myself. I was pleasantly surprised by this well-made movie and by the wonderful imagination of the author who created this delightful story. It has everything a child could want in a story--a likeable hero, his two pleasant sidekicks, scary villains, and fast-paced action. Everything about this movie is first-class, from the excellent cast to the writing to the special effects and visual delights which await the viewer. It joins other wonderful children's classics, such as The Wizard of Oz, and creates a totally satisfying entertainment experience for adults as well as children. The popularity of this story is well-deservedl--well-done Ms. Rowlands and everyone who had anything to do with this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Desappointing","review":"It was hard at times to understand what was being said, not because of the actors' British accent, but more because of the quality of the sound.Moreover, this movie was too long, and wasn't able to substain the viewer's interest.I enjoyed the \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" movie much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the Books","review":"If you want thrills, read the Harry Potter series. The movie did not capture my attention the way the books did. J.K. Rowling did an excellent job when she wrote the books. The movie was too dark. There was no brightness, and it seemed dull. Half of the adventure in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was lost in the creation of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Otter","review":"Being able to order this product online and immediately watch it is very convenient.

For someone who hasn't read the book, there are some questions that aren't answered very well.

However it is entertaining and the villain is not who you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Somewhat Dark Family Film","review":"I love dark movies, or those with a dark tone to them. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a PG movie that manages to deliver dark elements throughout while not compromising its rating. The result is a balanced film that reaches deep into the senses and psyche. The whole school of wizardry thing really captivates, and the story is best told through the deep British accents that were used. If I have one criticism of this film, it would be the length. At over two and a half hours, it's a tad lengthy, especially when there's some overindulgence in the length of some scenes. A two hour movie probably would've been better, though I'm not complaining too much. This film sets the stage for the rest of the series; it's a series that has at least one movie that's sure to appeal to someone. A good opening act that I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER...ok not really, but it sucked","review":"Alright, i'm a huge fan of harry potter and i also love films. this movie was just awful. there are tons of mistakes, the effects look waaaay too computer generated, the acting is very subpar (except for dumbledore and snape) and it is just way too long without keeping you entertained, unless you are 9."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKER!","review":"Boy, this movie's dissapointing! The story's not good at all! the one thing about this movie that I like is the acting! Everyone says this is so cool. I got bored too easily.

What a disgrace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My one question- why did Jo let something like this happen?","review":"As much as I appreciate the *hard work* of the three stars (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint)their first time on a movie screen is not their most brilliant. Add that to a director who probably should've been someone else, and the poor author who was too busy having a life to completely take over the project, and this movie falls short. The one redeming quality is Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) who is excellent in every way shape and form! Then subtract two for the two worst things: Richard Harris, who looked like he was going to die on the set; and Warner Borthers, who should die a fiery death for killing everything sacred. With a lame Quidditch scene (there ARE fouls in Quidditch) and tons of plot holes (how did Draco get detention too? Wait, where were they...? Oh never mind!) This might be something you'd rather rent, or not see at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Escape Real Life?

It sepperates from the book millions of miles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok movie for kids but adults will be bored","review":"I was disappointed with the movie. Granted the movie wasn't made for adults, but a good movie should be able to hold the interest of both adults and children. My first problem with the movie was the stiff acting by the three leads. I especially wanted to hit the fast forward button everytime the read-headed kid tried to emote. My second problem was the direction, or lack thereof. When I heard that Chris Columbus was chosen as the director, I was skeptical that the movie would be any good. I was right. The directions had no sense of excitement to them. Given the high publicity that the movie received during the pre-production process, it was disappointing that the producers didn't come up with more talented director, screen writer and actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"problem with dvd","review":"I have not been able to view the entire movie...There is something wrong with the DVD.

The deleted scenes were not easy to find, but they were worth the effort. You find them on the special features disc in the classroom section and click on the symbol on the torch. Going to classes was very interesting. I don't know how many times I got blown up and ended up in the hospital wing in Potion's class! The interviews with Chris Columbus and David Heyman were informative and gave you a view of the building of the sets. I do wish that interviews with the cast had been included.I was delighted that the movie followed so closely to the book. There were a few scenes that were different (students sent to the Forbiden Forest, Norbert, Harry and Draco's meeting, etc.) but that did not detract from the movie. Although I did have to go see it a second time to enjoy it fully and not compare it to the book.This movie is the first in the series of Harry Potter and no fan should be without!"},{"rating":"2","title":"midget tribe of nee","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was the best movie i have ever seen.

I loved this movie! It's nice to finally see a movie that is made from a book, that actually sticks to the story line. It brings to life the true imagination of J.K. Rowling. The visual effects are out of this world. This movie is not about witchcraft and ruining children's minds. This movie is about taking viewers of all ages to another place where they can have fun. We all get distracted in the real world and need to escape for something different, which is why we have movies. This creative and imaginative movie isn't just for children either. If you would like to watch an enjoyable movie without the sex, drugs, and a lot of violence for once, watch Harry Potter. You will be amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book is Better than the Movie","review":"It's a great movie for fans, even though it leaves out some important stuff from the book. I would go buy it right now if i were you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone is a charming movie, just like its conterpart book. The movie is beautiful and the graphics excellent. Each of the characters are wonderfully crafted. My only complaint is that the girl who plays Hermoine is far too pretty. Hermoine was not a pretty girl. Most importantly, the plot sticks closely to the book. I was very impressed with the young actors. They bring the combination of childishness and craft which such roles demand.The DVD is wonderful, with tons of interesting extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Film","review":"Great Film! I loved everything to the last bit. I though the acting was the best with an allstar performance from the adult vets to the young newcomers. I especially liked Daniel Radcliffe who played Harry.

If you have read the books this is a most see movies and if you haven't read any of the books this will be a wonderful start for your collection.

It didn't work for me on the big screen.So I got the DVD to give it a second chance. And guess what? It works better on the small screen for me.The magic and story came alive for me and I really got a chance to look closer at the story and performances. Maggie Smith is one of my favorites and the kids are really good.The DVD extras on this one are the best. Take it to your computer or just explore on your own TV. The rooms and behind the scenes are very well done. There's a game and even a guided tour on this one.I also liked the fact they talked about the sequel coming next year. (Kenneth Branagh will be in it!) Overall this is a good made-for-tv-type film and works very well for home viewing. Give it a shot and ride your broom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And thats a slam for the adults in this fandom","review":"The movie - the movie is great. Chances are you've experianced Harry Potter in some way or another. The video has a few flaws here and there with the transfer - but overall it's minimal. The sound is superb.As for the extras, the box describes all the many features, but fails to mention that you can only do things once you've completed others. The dvd contains 6 extra scenes - but in order to do so - you have to play a game that is as fun as pushing blocks through a hole in the wall. Boredom and frustration sets in from the first momment. Pardon me for felling peeved that I have to WORK for my extras. As for the rest of the extras - they're boring. The wand thing is stupid and it's always the third wand. The transfigure feature is no existant. And the tour of hogwarts couldn't go any slower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as great as the books!","review":"I am a major fan of the J.K.

I've seen both versions and the full screen and widescreen editions, and the full screen is so very not worth it.The film itself, although it's target audience is kids 8-12 was a shock to me, I didn't believe for one minute I would enjoy it and I really did. Check out the movie, but be SURE TO GET THE WIDESCREEN version, otherwise you are just ripping your self off 30 percent of the picture!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of great material and talent","review":"I am astounded that somebody can take such great material as Rowlings books and fabulous collection of actors and make just lie there! The special effects were adequate, and I KNOW what the actors were capable of, so who else to blame but the director? This is a film that could have really come alive, been an exciting and spectacular adventure, but instead it is wooden and dull. It is as if the director read crib notes and told everyone \\"okay, this is the scene where this happens, take your positions, say these lines and for gods sake, don't act, don't so much as modulate your voice or show a facial expression, we will paste it all in later with the animation\\". What a pity the rest are all being done at the same time, in the same way.

Now that I have seen the movie I couldn't agree more. I haven't read any of the books so the movie was completely new to me. Watching this film was a complete and total joy.

The special effects for the most part look as though they were done in the 1960s or 70s, and I've seen better make-up in old Dr. Who reruns. The muzak is worthy of the most derivative drivel by John Williams, swelling to clue the audience to the heroic bits and cloying to signal the sweeter nougat. The only sadder sign of massive cultural collapse than the popularity of this sort of cobbled together candyfloss is the number of people who think that the Harry Potter books are \\"manuals for the Religion of Witchcraft.\\"No wonder Spam is making a comeback in Ms. Rowland's homeland.

I bought the DVD as soon as it was released and watched it a couple of times before loaning it out. The DVD was lost so I ordered one from Amazon. I looked forward to receiving it and was anxious to sit down and watch this much-enjoyed movie. I was sadly disappointed to note that several scenes were missing. It became apparent that the video I got from Amazon was an edited version. The Amazon description of the movie did indicate that it was an edited version. If so, I wouldn't have purchased it. I have since researched other stores and found the full length movie.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Widescreen Edition)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family movie","review":"A while back, when there was the Harry Potter madness, I read the first 3 books. After that though, I was pretty much done and I haven't read another one since. I realized that I'd grown out of these books and that these books weren't very good, at leat not for older kids. Sure, it's great for the little kids, but for me, a guy in high school, you know. Anyway, this movie is based on the first book of the same name. The cast is great and it brings the book to life. So, if you're looking for a good book interpretation, you've got it. As for a family movie, it's good but the Incredibles, Shrek, Toy Story 1 and 2, Monsters Inc., Home Alone, etc..are all superior to this.And for little kids, it's a great movie and excellent book interpretation but while I'm watching this, I'm thinking of good serious movies. 5 stars for the kids, good family movie but not the best. 2nd best movie of the first 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK... but disapointing","review":"When I went to the Movie theater on the first day of opening I was expecting to have just the amazing-est 2hours and a half of my life. Instead, I stood up few times, got myself coke and hotdogs, (which are expensive) and impatient that nothing in ME moved. When I came home, I re-read the book, and discovered what was lacking-- the display of emotions and humor that packs the pages in the book. Like when Harry invisions himself as the game-keeper assistance after being expelled from Hogwarts. Like when Hermione flings herself to Harry, and says \\"You're a great wizard.\\" Not to mention all the songs and funny verses that was in the book. I believe if they did an arousing \\"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy, warty, Hogwarts\\" Like in the book, with a charming tune to it, it would have been so much better. No songs to remember, no place to really laugh, and no place to really cry, makes a not-so-good movie, in my opinion. Yes, the picture was great, but I value the content, not the outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was hooked on the books the first time I picked one up about 2 years ago. I think I looked foreward to the movie coming out at least as much, if not more, than my children. I was not disappointed. I have listened to \\"experts\\" talk about how disappointing it was to have the movie follow the book. I watched the movie hoping and expecting it to follow the book. The book was the reason I wanted to see the movie. The direction and the acting was wonderful. Everyone did what I went to see the move for--they brought the book to life. I am sorry that some people couldn't accept the movie for what it was - a vastly entertaining, exciting, and magical 2 1/2 hours. I can't wait for it to come out on video, and am certainly looking foreward to The Chamber of Secrets coming out.(As well as the 5th book!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Faithful Adaption of the book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is very faithful to the book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It has terific acting,great direction,and a very good story.The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that the visuals were not that great and I like the darker scope of the second better.Despite its flaws(of which there are few),It is a very faithful adaption.Potter fans should be pleased!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie that started it all for me","review":"Before the movie came out I had heard a lot about Harry Potter, but didn't enter this entertaining universe until this movie had come out. I got so much out of this movie and was impressed with its story and imagination tha I had all of the four books that were released at the time read within a month of seeing the movie. One of the best movies I've seen in a VERY LONG TIME.So, why 4 stars? The 4 stars is for the movie itself. The fifth star is for the DVD. I was really excited for the DVD to come out so I could watch the special features. After reading the book, I had wanted to see the scenes that hadn't made it into the movie. I STILL haven't found it and just got tired of all the stupid games it wanted me to go through just to get to them. Buy this DVD for the excellent movie and picture/sound quality. Don't buy it for the special features. I was left very disappointed by them.

My son has read the first 4 novels and we have seen the movie. It does have magic in it but it is good v/s evil. And good wins. I do not beleive this movie is \\"of the devil\\" as I had been told. We are a Christian family. This is a wonderful story in a make beleive world. Just like Peter Pan. It's a fairy tale. Think back to all the tale's told when we were kids, they all have magic in them.

Well, if that doesn't say anything, then I don't know what will.Daniel Radcliffe is adorable in this movie and plays the role so bloody brilliant, it gives me the shivers!Seriously, this movie has got it all; it's got fantasy, excitement, tenderness and drama. All in one!! If you haven't seen it allready; be ashamed, be VERY ashamed, because it's that good, you have to see it AT LEAST once in the theatre!Well, I guess I made my point. And ehm... no comparisons with LOTR, because that's a total different genre and for opinions about that; you're on the WRONG PAGE! HARRY ROCKS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been better","review":"I thought Harry Potter was a pretty good movie. The acting was great (especially Snape and Dumbledore), and the so were the special effects. There was just one problem. It stayed wayyy too close to the story. I've read the books and I love them, but I still think they should have made it somewhat original. I'm sure some people like it completely accurate, but I found it became boring, epecially since most of the dialogue came directly from the book. Still, it was a good movie, even for people who haven't read the book, and I think if you have the time it's worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Why O Why cant hollywood just leave a good book alone. Finally kids were starting to read again. Old and young alike love the Harry Potter series. Many fans are awaiting the 5th book. But no it has been delaying pending the 2nd Harry Potter movie. Not only did this movie leave out characters (peeves) and changed the ending of the movie completely (i wont go into details) it also took a book and turned it into another movie for youngsters to watch instead of reading the book. The book is definately better. Tolken goes into such good detail it could never be made as good in Hollywood and i was dissappoined they even tried. However if you never read the book and never will (a very bad choice in my opinion) is this movie is fine it has a good plot and characters and some of the special effects are cool (I like the candles floating).

Truly a very good adaptation of the novel (for my money, a little too true to the book).The DVD brings Harry Potter home, and while the transfer is very good (I bought, and can only recommend, the widescreen version), I found the second disc frustrating. I still haven't reached the hidden deleted scenes, and their just isn't enough stuff for movie buffs or, for that matter, grown up fans of the books.Even my son, who was so caught up in the movie in the theatre, doesn't seem to have the patience or desire to wade through all this. I'm disappointed that a movie that was so popular with adults as well as children would aim the DVD squarely at the younger set (who don't seem to care anyway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, I'll admit it - I wish there was really a Hogwart's.","review":"I went into this movie thinking it was going to be terrible - but I was instantly whisked away into the fantasy world of Harry Potter.

And, it's great for adults and kids, though it might be a bit scary for very young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really deserves 2 stars but...","review":"...I felt I had to balance out all the 5 star ratings. I admit the movie has some appeal because of the charming concept as well as the atmosphere established by the sets and the score. However, the movie pretty much fails in most other aspects. None of the jokes are funny. The editing and camera-work seem choppy and the delivery of the plot is often corny. Many scenes are overdone, especially the quiditch scenes. Worst of all, Harry seemed to me a totally unsympathetic character. He smiled at all the wrong moments and generally uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wiener","review":"Harry Potter is such a wiener.

The computer graphics aren't very good and the movie doesn't stay to the five-star book's story line. I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan and by watching the movie it completely ruined the book for me. The movie seemed to try to cram too many chapters into a too short movie (even though the movie was deathly long it seemed). The actor that plays Harry Potter [is bad] at acting while the makers of the movie didn't even bother to follow the features (Black hair, green eyes) that the Harry Potter in the book had. The movie is definitly not well made and if you haven't seen either yet you should definitly only read the book if you are 12 years old or older."},{"rating":"1","title":"If not for the heckling, I would have snored.","review":"What should have been a light hearted, whimiscal children's movie becomes an over drawn tale of boredom and eye candy. The major problem is that the director treats his material like Lord of the Rings when it is much closer to Cat in the Hat. Instead of telling a story and giving children a new idea for playtime, every little detail of is spelled out for us. This is not a rich and fully developed world, however, and the more we're shown, the less it is believable. Two and a half hours of film wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Awful.","review":"This was a very terrible movie.After a bunch of horrible books,out comes a horrible movie from the Harry Potter series.I will not watch this junk,will not support this junk,and will not stand this junk.If you like to watch good movies,then this movie is definitely not for you.However,if you enjoy completely awful movies,then be sure to add Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone to your DVD(or video)collection.Peace Out."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD missing scenes!!!","review":"I am most distressed to find that the \\"Widescreen Special Edition\\" DVD I purchased is missing numerous small scenes-scenes that are integral to understanding the story!!I have also noticed missing scenes in both the Chamber of Secrets and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which are \\"Special Editions\\" as well.I, for one, will purchase no more Harry Potter DVD's until this practice stops.

This film however, with the exeption of one or two scenes (such as the very well done quidditch scene), is nowhere near the quality of any of the books, even though some of the actors do in fact look as their characters are meant to, not many of the actors can actually act very well in my opinion and often seem false.

Humor, depth and spirit was lost as the director tried to stick play by play to the plot.

As for the film based on part 1 in the series, I can say that it is a pretty good fantasy yarn that is just dark, brooding, and complex enough to interest (some) adults, but not so much so that the younger members of the family won't find something to enjoy, despite the film's length. I am an avid fan of fantasy, but am cautious of break-out franchises, and before plopping down in front of \\"The Sorcerer's Stone,\\" I was fairly certain I would dislike the film (especially given that it has the misfortune of competing with \\"The Fellowhip of the Ring,\\" which blows it out of the water). Much to my surprise, that was not the case. It's a good film with lots of atmosphere and capable direction. I'm eager for the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, decent DVD","review":"This is one of the few \\"childrens\\" DVD's in my collection. I loved the book and was looking forward to the release of the movie on DVD. The movie faithfully follows the award winning book.The movie looks good with only minor glitches some part of the video. Audiowise it sounded good on my system. The score by John Williams sounds especially good.My one real complaint with this DVD is the special features. I bought this in order to see the deleted scenes. The amount of time I spent trying to access them outweighed the actual running time of the scene. Way too much trouble for nothing groundbreaking. I also would have liked to have a commentary track from the director and maybe some of the stars.Overall this is a good DVD set, but the amount of work to access the special features is very annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfull adventure for children and grown-ups","review":"This is a wonderfull adventure for children and grown-ups; I don't think I would like to have missed it -- it's one of those historic moments in film history where you can feel a rush -- like when you saw Ben Hur for the first time.In a way I was looking for fault's, because a picture so much praised, HAD to have some bad moments, right? Wrong! There's no such thing. It's perfect from start to end.Wonderfully directed by Chris Colombus and with the best of the best british actors it just keeps on rolling. The phrase \\"Never a dull moment\\" takes on a whole new meaning -- and the magnificent J.K. Rawling's creation -- is stunning and -- beatifull? Yes, beatifull.It's a wonderfull fairy tale.

Sad to say, however, that the long awaited DVD was not. The Special Features amount to \\"theatrical trailers.\\" Which is sad for a 2 disk set. I personally found the 2nd disk's \\"game\\" (which is what Disk 2 is) annoying. Unless you did everything right, you would not be allowed to advance. I can understand that the filmakers wanted to \\"expand\\" the harry potter world, and let kids roam freely. In which case why not make a PC game instead? why waste your money on making a DVD game, instead of providing the special features we have all come to expect and enjoy from DVD's? The only good thing about it is a 15min Interview with the filmakers which provides very little into the making of the movie. If you ask me, you're better off buying the Widescreen VHS or something than to waste your money on a 2 disk set with no features."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first timer at Hogwarts","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. My children have watched it about 20 times in the 3 days that we have owned it and I have watched it at least twice. I had never read the Harry Potter series novels and had no idea what to expect from this movie, but I was not disappointed. The movie is fast paced and I found it easy to follow. This movie made me want to purchase the other Harry Potter novels and left me anxiously awaiting a sequel!I did watch the deleted scenes and out takes. I didn't find it hard to get to them, but it was a little time consuming.Overall, I think that this was a very entertaining movie and good family entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, A sure classic.","review":"This movie was entertaining, exciting, and just plain wonderful. Of special note; my grandson, who is a Harry Potter expert, could only find two or three deviations from the book. We went to the film as a family, Granddad, Grandmother, Dad, Mom, Son, Daughter, and Aunt. All 7 of us were delighted. It rate at the top, along with classics such as Wizard of OZ, Tales of Narnia, and Lord of the Rings. Hooray for such a delightful family film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did the writers even read the book?","review":"There are so many differences between the movie and book that the movie doesn't follow the book. It would be nice if some of the film followed the storyline of the book. They changed the book around so much that I'm not even sure that the movie is based on the same book I read so many times and enjoyed reading. The graphics were wonderfull but it doesn't diminish the fact that they couldn't bother to follow the book and the actions of the characters involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read the book dont watch the movie","review":"I am a big fan of Harry Potter books. I read them at least 4 times ( each book). I was very disapponted when I watched the movie. It didnt have the same magic as the book. First of all the important events were not in the movie. They made mistakes while transferring the scenes from the book to the movie. I went to see it with my friend who also is a big fan and she also didnt like the movie. The book is for evryone for all ages but the movie is just for kids. I can recommened the movie if you didnt read the book but if you know the book you will not like the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"AFter anxiously waiting for this movie, it was a great dissapointment. Not only was it boring, but totally different from the book. Harry and his troops were not good at all and did not give any real personality. They were more play acting and it was frustrationg, harry was just like a robot. Did not understand why the producers did not follow the book. If you are going to buy this movie because u enjoyed the book, i would seriously recommend to hire and watch before purchasing it. Lets just hope if they do go ahead with the second part, they will do a much better job. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be able to download to my itunes!!","review":"I bought this thinking it was just a digital copy that I could run from my itunes but I guess I did not see the fine print that it is only for Windows.

First when Harry didnt know he was a wizard he had a horrible life but soon he was in the spell of magic AS always expected Harry was so magical. Youngest wizard soccer player and other things make Harry great if the added one part at the end that they took off i could gladly give it a 100 stars (5 stars now!) but from two left out sceans i must give it four but it should be 5 a wonderful movie you can't not miss it if you do your missing a year a wizardry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A weird mix","review":"The movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was very close to the book. A few missing scenes here and there, but a very good likeness. The actors were well picked. However ... notice that the movies basically follows this equation.1. Harry down and out2. Harry does something vaguely heroic, and is surrounded by cheering children.3. Again Harry finds himself down and out.4. Harry does something vaguely heroic, and is surrounded by cheering children....Eh heb, Repeat.The movie although visually wonderful ... it leaves you with that \\"equation\\" that gets old, only if you don't find it somewhat funny.

My dad ordered the 1st 4 books and I said (at first by the way!) that i didn't want them. I hate turning down gifts though... Then that faithful day happened, I heard about Harry Potter and the Sorseror's Stone. Then I read all of the books out so far. Then I was hooked. Then They said a movie about the first book was in production. I saw the trailers, didn't need spoilers, I read the book. I couldn't see it in theatures. It came out on video and I saw it. I was thouroghly disappointed that they left Peeves out, and made Hermione a smart-@$$ know-it-all. But don't let that remark fool you, I was making a statment. Anyway Quiddich was awesome, Snapes acting sucked, he sounded like some 60's hippe who just discovered crack... The end was also a downer when there was only 2 things protecting the stone, not 4.

I am a harry potter fan so i was really excited. But then i saw it again...and again...and again. Finally i got to the point where i hated it.I realized all that was missing from the book from Peeves(i love peeves) to the potions challenge on the way to the stone. It really disapoints me now. I think it was a good idea to make a movie but what has happend just makes me mad. I would suggest renting this for a two time viewing. If you dont read the books, then dont see the movies. The books were so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget the digital copy","review":"The one star rating isn't for the movie - it's for the packaging.

Some scenes also looked a bit grainy on my HDTV. I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was okay... but the DVD...","review":"For me the Harry Potter movie was pretty good, but the DVD was horriblE! The only good special features were deleted scenes, which took me a long time to find. The rest is just games and activities. It might be nice to put in featurettes on how the movie was made, but no. THIS MOVIE DVD= BAD BARGAIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for people who dislike witchcraft","review":"The theme of this movie re-enforces a magic/witchcraft theme. It is not for a Christian to really show there children since it is contrary to a Christian belief. It has alot of good special effects, but I found my young nieces would be too impressionable with this. Caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hogwarts? Hogwash!","review":"Someday, when the Harry Potter fad is back in perspective and adults no longer wet themselves with excitement about the impending release of every children's book, this movie will be remembered as an inocuous kid flick -- nothing more. I admit the casting seems to have been excellent, but then I never bothered with the book, so I had no preconceptions regarding how the characters should look. The special effects were all right -- especially the flying sequences. As for the story, any comparisons to Cinderella were purely intentional. Listening to 50-year-olds go on and on about how magical this film is stimulates my gag reflex. If you're looking for an \\"adult\\" fairytale, buy a Lord of the Rings DVD. Any grownup who spends his/her allowance on this Harry Potter silliness should be spanked and sent to his/her room without supper."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars","review":"I have to say i loved the DVD, if u don't have it u should get it.

Okay, I admit that to me it was a bit boring because I have read the books and I already knew what was gonna happen. This movie shoud be seen by people who haven't read the books, because you'll enjoy it much more and it'll be more exiting. But I bought the DVD and I loved it! It took me a while to find the deleted scenes and I think that they woud have looked very good in the movie, but then again, it woud have been WAY too long. Anyway, I loved the movie and to those people who think this movie is not for kids, it is. I think that you need to imaginate and this movie makes you imaginate.

This would be one deserving of it! I am 49 and my husband is 54 and we went to theater twice to see this one and I cant wait for my DVD to arrive. The books are great - the movie even better! The child actors are suberb in their roles and then there are the special effects.....And as for children being unable to distinguish between a fantasy movie and Wicca - all I can say isn't it time to stop underestimating our youth?And while the movie is great fantasy on magic - it bears no relationship to Wicca. If you are not Pagan and don't understand what it means to embrace Wicca as a religion - please don't attempt to equate Wicca and fantasy of Witches and Wizards...

I should have liked to see the deleted scenes integrated into the movie, rather than stuck in some silly game on the other disk, but what the heck? There aren't really worth slogging through the rather clunky interface to get to, although the first (movie) disk is worth watching.It doesn't seem to matter whether you've read the books first or not -- my husband hadn't, I had, and we both enjoyed the movie about the same. I can only suggest that you remember that all fiction requires a *willing suspension of disbelief* and that this is fantasy written for children. The supporting cast were wonderful, and I think young Radcliffe shows potential. We adults need to remember that this is aimed at kids, who are usually much less critical about detail than we are. A nice flick, worth a second (or third or forth) look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magically good","review":"This dvd was superb!! Every second was magical and full of new twists and surprises. The general appearance was right on with the book. There were some minor differences from the book and the dvd and that didn't affect the ratings whatsoever.

The special features were amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, not what I expected at all","review":"Usually when a film get's all the publicity and hype this one did it turns out dissappointing, especially when it's a children's movie.

Now I am secretly anticipating the second film.Although the target audience is 8years plus, I strongly feel that people of all ages will, and have been enjoying this film immensly.

There were less special effects than I expected. The movie is incredibly slow and long. It is easy to get bored. I expected Harry to do more spells and \\"witchy\\" work, but it was Hermione who did just few spells. Since Harry was a \\"natural\\" I expected more action but it was more like a quest for something movie. It was like if you were watching Zelda made in a movie.

When the movie is over the seeds of witchcraft are planted into the mind of their child and a wicked life will result. What evil goes in, will come out. Repackaged witchcraft for children, that's all it is. For example; many convicts in prison practice witchcraft with many wizard tatoos and demonic symbols. There is no such thing as good witchcraft as this movie tries to portray. The special effect is yet to be an unpleasant surprise upon the next generation having grown up with witchcraft firmly implanted and recognized as harmless fun. The crime level is going to rise. Just look at the evil spells the Harry Potter movie uses to propel the plot; drinking blood and other witchcraft evils. Hardly innocent and harmless! Is this what you want your children to watch? Woe to those who call evil good and good evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New World","review":"This movie was a lot of fun to watch for the first time in theaters and has been fun every time I have watched it since.

The book literally comes alive with the performance of this children's movie. My kids enjoyed not only the movie, but plays for hours with the enclosed special features such as making potions,clicking on the characters to make them talk and the game. The extra disc (which has the extra footage and bonus games) is a nice feature to keep separate the movie from the extra fun (and less chance of damaging the movie). Overall it was an excellent choice to purchase for the kids!The only complaint I had was that many scenes from the original big screen production was that some scenes had been trimmed to make the movie shorter (ie Dudley's birthday trip to the zoo). I would have prefered the original movie unaltered, but it still is a great story!rick from florida"},{"rating":"1","title":"Magical but also disappointing","review":"I have enjoyed it but only so far. Imagination reigns and you expect unrealistic scenes, but there is a limit. At some stage Harry is given an 'invisibility cloak' left to him by his deceased parents. Soon after he has to hide from the badies. The invisibility cloak would have come in handy there but he appears to forget all about it. My five-year old son commented: why is he not hiding under the magic coat? When flaws are spotted by five-year olds, then there must be something wrong.

The only safe-havens on this disc are an interview featurette (With the filmakers commenting on this film as well as the sequel, which will also star Kenneth Branagh), theatrical trailers, and deleted scenes that I can't even find yet!

On top of this, the contrived hoops don't function, and lock up both my DVD player and the DVD drive on my computer. If they wanted to slip something unadvertised in for those people willing to play their silly games, that would be one thing.

From Madeline L'Engle's Wrinkle in Time Series, through Roald Dahl's magnificent Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, to Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising series, I loved them all.

For this reason I wish that I had the paper version of this book so that I could see the pictures better. Some of the drawings can be viewed larger at the book's website.

It's also a light, fun read about the interesting era of \\"dollar princesses.\\" Highly recommended if you enjoy accessible social history."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievably stupid","review":"Im so sorry but this book's subject matter was the problem. The author simply listed all the wealthy women in late 1800's an early 1900's that went looking for a man from the UK so they might be titled - in other words they paid for a title. Im not sure what they really got from their actions because Brits are a bit hard to take to this day!The first part dealt with actual women and some information but the end dealt with their names, again plus additional names - I had hoped for more of a story. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish it","review":"It started a little interesting, but quickly lost my interest. It's more of a who's who in NY society and how they got there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The authors clearly did a great deal of research, but all those facts did not translate into an interesting story for the reader. I can't imagine how this book received 4.5 stars on the rating scale since it was very frustrating to read. Honestly, I read only about half of the book before giving up! I love reading a well written book where the characters come alive on the page, but that was lacking in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly boring","review":"I thought that this would be an interesting book about those who married into the nobiity, but for the most part, it was poorly written and dragged on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Kindle","review":"This book doesn't translate to Kindle.

I was expecting a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"to marry an english lord","review":"Probably my fault that I didn't like it.I didn't get a sense that this book wasn't a romantic novel from the blurb though. More like a reference book. no storyline whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and convoluted","review":"Perhaps it would seem to be better organized if it were in print, but this book was thoroughly confusing and difficult to follow. Much of the information on American woman who married English lords is presented in illogical fashion. The second half does give the reader some information on the running of the huge country estates, which for fans of Downton Abbey like me is the reason to buy the book. Facts on dressing would be in with facts on who divorced whom or some other disjointed information. I wondered why the book ended with Kindle indicating 54% read. The remainder is a rehash of the women covered earlier and an extensive bibliography. I do not feel I got my money's worth on this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book / awful kindle translation","review":"This book was a fascinating read but it did not AT ALL translate to the kindle well. There were so many typos and the pictures were 1/2\\" tall and blurry so it was disappointing not to be able to see them. Half the fun with historic books like these is seeing the clothes and jewelry as well as homes where these people lived. I feel deprived!

This last part I did not read."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"Love it Love it Love it. Wonderful read and really enjoyed every bit of it, enough to read it again and found it just as great as the first time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining history","review":"What a fun read this was. There were so many young American heiresses who married into the British aristocracy that their lives seem almost fictional. Some were happy in their choices (or their mothers' choices), but most were not. Most were never really welcomed into the family, only their money was. I highly recommend this book for the insight into those popular trans-Atlantic marriages that took place in the 1880s-1900s, and the not so happily-ever-after endings for so many of them. The successful unions are a pleasure to read about for just that reason. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting bit of history but poorly written","review":"Starts out interesting by explaining how & why the ultra wealthy American's auctioned of their daughters to English aristocracy and its historical significance.

Following who is related to whom is another matter altogether. There are some nice anecdotes in the book, but don't try to tie them into the larger picture unless you have several genealogical trees of the American and British elite handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and convoluted","review":"This book is poorly written or edited.

I'm not sure how the print version is, but there were several typos throughout the book. Plus, there was a disadvantage of the picture quality being very disappointing.As for the book itself, I admit that I struggled to finish it. Again, maybe it was the transition from book-to-Kindle that tainted my reading, but the contents seemed sloppy and a lot of information was repeated in different chapters.Overall, it's a very informative book which I think makes for a good research tool, but for reading leisurely it's not my first choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and repititous","review":"Started out well but got bogged down in the endless repeats; would not suggest this to others. pictures were interesting though."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Marry an English Lord","review":"I thought this a very slow moving retrospective on English heraldry.

Beyond that, there's the writing: repetitive and generally uninteresting. Deeply superficial overall!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and readable resource!","review":"'To Marry an English Lord' is a well-researched and accessible book about the phenomenon of American heiresses marrying into the British aristocracy. Crammed full of facts, lists, photos, and informative text, this is the first book people should read if they are interested in this milieu. The text is easy to read and nuggets of history are presented with enthusiasm and humour. Despite the light tone, the authors never talk down to their readers and present their information without exaggeration or sensationalism. The book was carefully researched and the included bibliography is an excellent resource for further study. I am pleased that this well-deserving book has been brought back into print and encourage anyone who enjoys the history of this time and place to purchase it immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc 2 Doesn't Work","review":"I am not sure who is doing Amazon's quality control but literally 1/2 of the songs I download don't play from Amazon.

This tape was way, way too easy for me. I wish had not wasted the money. \\"Yoga for Weight Loss\\" with its 3 levels of proficiency demonstrated, is a better beginning level YOGA video, although there's nothing weight loss specific about it, just basic Iyengar style yoga.

She thought it was as funny as I did, which was a major concern of mine. I hadn't seen it in a while and had forgotton how much I enjoyed it. I absolutely adore Cary Grant, his trademark talking-under-his-breath-to-himself, the quirky eyebrow, his dumbfounded looks.. I could go on forever with this one. Why is it that I never realized that the one Aunt skips when she walks??? I was laughing hysterically at the background noises as well, slapstick at it's finest. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a traditional classic","review":"a great comedy-drama, directed by one of the all-time great directors: Frank Capra. this film has become one of my personal favorites and a traditional Halloween classic. the performances were excellent. it blends comedy and horror perfectly. i highly recommend it.as for the DVD, it has little to offer in terms of extras, offering only production notes. it is still worth the purchase price. the picture and sound are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC MYSTERY/ COMEDY Combo!","review":"Cary Grant plays Mortimer Brewster a mild-mannered writer, on the brink of marrying the girl nextdoor, Priscilla Lane ( Elaine Harper/Elaine Brewster) However, Mortimer has discovered some shocking truths about his guardians: Josephine Hull (Aunt Abby Brewster ) and Jean Adair ( Aunt Martha Brewster ).

Grant is about to marry Ellaine Harper (played by Priscilla Lane), his next-door neighbor, but he's postponed it because he thinks he might have inherited insanity from his nutty aunts. Soon Raymond Massey and Peter Lorre enter the scene, only adding to the craziness. A wonderful slapstick comedy that holds up perfectly after all the years. Worth a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really too silly","review":"I love old movies, but this was beyond silly. I know that it was supposed to be a comedy, but besides the hilarious Uncle Teddy, the rest of it was beyond ridiculous. Cary Grant's performance was even disappointing.

He was a brilliant actor and comedian, and I could look at his face for hours. Sigh. Why don't they make movie stars like that anymore? Did I tell you how much I love Cary Grant?But still, I found Arsenic and Old Lace to be terribly disappointing: a madcap comedy that's neither funny nor clever.

It seemed overplayed and exagerrated. I envision it as perhaps having been amusing on the stage, but on the screen it is abrasive. So many other people review it favorably that it made me think that perhaps I was just in a strange mood when I watched it. So, I later watched it again and had the exact same response.There is a character in this movie who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt. He repeatedly screams \\"Charge!\\" and then runs up some stairs and slams himself in his bedroom. Everytime he did this my two-year old daughter awakened crying and my cat clawed my knee where he rested.

They seemed to really enjoy it! I was able to watch this movie with them after they received it and the quality isn't that bad. Considering that this movie was produced in the late 40s, it has held up rather well. The version was wide-screen, there was a yellowish cast to the film, and in the beginning there are black spots and scratches from where the film has just naturally aged and become damaged. These spots are distracting during the opening scene but fade towards the middle of the movie. A classic Carey Grant comedy involving a family that has a certain criminal hobby, a disreputable brother, a mad-doctor, and bodies in the cellar. Stellar performances, not for the person use to today's hollywood by-blows. Good, clean, comedy. For the viewer with a warped sense of humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arsnic & Old Lace","review":"A Classic screwball comedy with Cary Grant at his best.

Two serial killer spinster aunts (hull & adair) who knock of old lonely men (to be nice), a nustsy brother who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt and Cary Grant in the middle as the nephew who literally stumbles upon everything - all add up to a great comic romp. Grant is in fine rubber-faced form here and there is a lot of physical comedy. ( nice butt, cary). The two aunts are delightful in their sheer sweet insanity and Teddy is a laugh-out-loud punchline.

Cary plays Mortimer, an ordinary guy who on his wedding night finds a dead body in the windowseat of his beloved aunt's home. The chaos that ensues is hilarious! Add to it Mortimer's eccentric brother Teddy who thinks he is Theodore Roosevelt and another brother, Jonathan, who is a murderer who looks like Boris Karloff!

It is so true~~they just dont make movies like they use too!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"Arsenic and Old Lace is one of the funniest comedies of all time. Based on the hit Broadway show of the same name, it is about a drama critic who finds out that his aunts have been poisioning people (hence the title) out of a desire to help them (they only poison lonely old men) out of their misery. Anyhow, the dialogue is truly hilarious (\\"Insanity doesn't just run in the family - it practically gallops.\\") and the cast is great!Even though Cary Grant, who played the lead role, always said he disliked his performance in Arsenic and Old Lace (he complained that Capra pushed him into overplaying instead of his usual more restrained style) I think he was excellent! His expressions are priceless, and it is impossible to keep a straight face while watching his frantic movements about the house. The aunts are also quite good, as are the actors playing the other crazy brothers.All in all, this movie is a must have! If you haven't seen it already, you are in for a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Macabre, Entertaining with a Morbid Plot","review":"ARSENIC AND OLD LACE is hilarious, Cary Grant giving a wonderfully exaggerated performanc. Grant adds to the feeling of restlessness and stress as the fast paced and macabre comedy events happen. Peter Lorre, Jean Adair,Josephine Hull, and Raymond Massey add to the fun.

This was the first Harmony of the Gospels that I have purchased and returned, due to one error, which is the acid test on the research of this topic, because it is confirmed by other research. The actual date of Christ's birth and death is written in stone and correlated by the Jubilee records. For those of you familiar with David Davidson and Adam Rutherford's work on the Great Pyramid in Egypt, dates are given and they are confirmed by tracing the Jubilee years from the time of the Exodus, which proves that Adam Rutherford's dates were correct; therefore, Robert L.

If it didn't cost more in freight to return the unit than the actual cost of the compass, I'd send it back in a heartbeat. I think this is a good example of getting what you paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only it would work.","review":"I purchased this for use in my Ford Mustang and am very disappointed. It's calibration is distorted every place I tried: the rearview mirror, the entire windshield, the dash face and the dash top, all to no avail. Because it is MADE FOR REARVIEW MIRROR MOUNTING, I felt sure there would be no trouble with mounting it there."},{"rating":"2","title":"good compass","review":"For the money it is good. But could not install behind the mirror nor on the dashboard because of some magnetic interference that won't let it turn. The only place it worked for me was up inside the windshield next to where they usually place the oil change sticker. However in dark you can not see what it shows. So if it only shows one direction no matter where you go, it is stuck in a magnetic field and need to move it away from it. The sticker is good so don't be afraid to try on several places until you get it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a JOKE!","review":"This is the worst thing I have ever bought off of Amazon.The compass always points West.What a piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazing compass...not!","review":"this amazing compass only points due north. so only buy if you are using the compass for decoration. also, don't turn the knob of the compass too hard, otherwise you will need to quick glue it back to 1 piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fly high with \\"The Duke\\"","review":"A stirring performance by The Duke in this fictionalized account of the American Volunteer Group, better known as The Flying Tigers. It's typical of the period, a story of American gallantry in the face of the enemy and a side character whose bad deeds are redeemed in a heroic act that ends in death, but for fans of the War Movie genre, John Wayne or just airplanes in general, I have to recommend it as an entertaining flick. The AVG was important to America in the dark times after Pearl Harbor and the methods learned in the skies over China proved crucial for the thousands of airman who were to fly in the war in the South Pacific. Some truly fascinating, behind-the-scenes insights into the making of this movie can be found in a book called \\"Celluloid Wings,\\" by James Farmer, which is also a must-read for aviation-film fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth watching if Laurel & Hardy played the lead roles","review":"Great comedy centered around WW2. Kept shooting down the same Japanese pilots in every fight scene. Dogfights all looked the same. Japanese gunner squeezes off 5,000 rounds and misses every time. Duke squeezes off 1 round and down goes the zero in a ball of flames.(Supplies are short. Must use that ammo wisely) If this is considered one of the Dukes finest it just doesn't say much about the rest of his career. Not a very exciting or good rah rah rah film. Even for 1942."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Garcia","review":"A well acted movie but it is not very historicaly correct. I figure it was not historicaly correct due to the fact that it came out during the war almost within a year of the time they are trying to act.

Other than this it was a very good movie and I enjoyed it....WW2 Historian"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of Wayne's Best","review":"I love the History Channel, have infinite respect for the AVG, love John Wayne films, and lived two years in the part of China where Flying Tigers is set. So, you'd think I might adore this film? I had hoped so, but unfortunately Republic pictures made this opus on the cheap.John Wayne plays a fictional commander of the American Volunteer Group, somewhere between Claire Chennault and Pappy Boygnton. He does his best to carry the film, and does OK, but he can't carry it alone. Bad effects, cheap stock footage, flimsy sets, and bad script all plague TIGERS.Republic made little effort to hide the California filming location and even used the WRONG PLANES! There is little mention of the OSS-AVG connection, and the film was made too early on to be a good history of the AVG, even if it were accurate.The heroes of the AVG deserve better than TIGERS; this film isn't a tribute to them, it's a sloppy, propaganda film that does them little service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying Tigers DVD","review":"This was a Christmas present.

The story of American pilots flying against the Japanese at odds which would make most pilots think twice is a true one. This movie was produced after Pearl Harbor and helped to focus American attention on Japan's aggression, a subject which got little play until after bombs actually began falling on U.S. territory. Well worth finding and watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Duke - The Flying Tigers","review":"OK - we all know that the men of the AVG disowned this movie version of their exploits. We know The Duke plays a fictional role here - but he still does the Tigers proud, in my opinion. Regretably, there is no other movie (that I know of) made of the AVG. Looking at it through today's prism, the movie is corny. The \\"Chinese\\" actors are cliche' and the scenes on the ground are trite. However, the movie was made a long time ago, and designed for movie goers of another generation. The story is still a good one, and gives a small glimpse of some hardships endured by the real Tigers of Chennault's AVG. I'm happy to have it as part of my collection of works devoted to this high-spirited group of fine American men (and Olga).Mike McCaffreyDepartment of State/Foreign Service - Retired"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I bought these for my six year old daughter's zombie birthday party.

Some of the quotes are a bit pretentious, but still have something worth noting.When I have read further, I will report back on my observations.
