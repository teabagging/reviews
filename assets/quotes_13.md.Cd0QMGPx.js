It is a wonderful romance film. Ford did a number of films right after Star Wars. This is the best. Force 10 From Navarone is ok, and the Frisco Kid is cute but... not to many people remember these films, including this one. all i can say is that what really saved Ford from the fate of the other stars in Star Wars was Indy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanover Street","review":"Hanover Street is one of those movies that slipped by me when it was first released in 1979. I caught part of it years ago on television. This new DVD version is excellent. Peter Hyams managed to present this World War II movie differently than one would normally expect from a movie about this subject. With romance, humour, action and suspense the movie literally captures you with it's magnetism. There are several scenes behind enemy lines where Hyams almost performs magic in creating intensity of the moment. Harrison Ford is wonderful in this film. I give this one two thumbs up for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably wrong","review":"This is one of the worst World War II movie I have seen, and I have seen a lot. Not only the love story is farfetched, but a lot of details are wrong!

Because of these loose threads, I couldn't begin to believe in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had seen this movie years ago, but had little recollection of it, so I was looking forward to seeing it again.Unfortunately, second time around it was a real disappointment, particularly the character played by Harrison Ford. He was woody and unbelievable. In particular, the aerial combat scenes, with their attempts at sardonic humour, did not work for me.The action scenes stretched credulity somewhat, but, as in \\"The Great Escape\\", that didn't bother me all that much. You expect a bit of that in films like this, and it's even a bit endearing.The film was rescued to some extent by Christopher Plummer's character, which was for me, the best thing about the film. Lesley-Anne Down also does a reasonable job, but it's not Harrison Ford's finest hour, unfortunately. The story is pleasant enough, but Ford's charactter lets it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable audio","review":"I so enjoyed listening to all these short stories - extremely well read by 3 pros - I understand they won the Audie Award for their renditions.

Kennealy insists *her* view is the only truthful one and pours vitriol on anyone who suggests otherwise. Basically you learn a lot about Patricia, not much about Morrison--the book is about her. (Which the title makes clear.) I enjoyed it for about two-thirds, then got fed up with her (genius woman writer or not!) and couldn't struggle on. I guess I was waiting for her to come around and get some perspective, and when I realized she wouldn't I couldn't read any more. (You won't know what Jim Morrison was doing day to day, but you will know what outfit Patricia decided on for each and every occasion, and which drugs she decided to take.) In a word: oy."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Mental Patients Write ...","review":"I am so embarrassed for Ms. Kennealy. This book, along with the vitriolic, highly repetitive ramblings (rants) on her website, are proof positive that she desperately needs some kind of in-patient psychiatric treatment to snap her out of her delusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"I don't want to repeat what has already been said. This woman is obsessed with a fling she had with Jim Morrison many years ago. It is painfully obvious that it was a fling, not a deep relationship. She absurdly claims that it was not only a relationship, but a marriage. I don't wish to harshly criticise this lonely, sad woman, but I have a problem with her berating the deceased Pamela Courson. She trivlializes Pam's relationship with Jim, rudely insults her, and makes outrageous accusations that she caused the death of Jim. It is all done out of childish jealousy and bitterness. Kennealy is a talented writer. She should apologize for this travisty of a book and retract many of her statements. She should then move on with her life and hopefully become a productive artist again."},{"rating":"1","title":"a work of fiction...","review":"If you read all the books about Jim Morrison like I do, make this the one book you skip. It is clearly the life the author WANTED from Jim and never had. wishful thinking, sour grapes, fantasy, lies, FICTION. It made me sick how she talked about Jim loving her, being pregnant (supposedly). Fact is, jim had no less than 10 paternity suits pending at the time of his death, all women who were obsessed with him. This is just another one of those people. SKIP IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe in HER world she is correct","review":"I think that Patricia Kennealy has no place to write a book about Jim Morrison. She was a fling and she took it too far. Its all in her head. This book is her telling a story about Jim Morrison and her fling. And that is what it is, its just a story. Usually stories are made up and false and in her case she goes above that. She is a fraud who only uses Jim's name to make herself look better. The only reason she wrote this book was to make money. Which saddly she did. If Jim was alive today I can honestly say that this book would not be out becuase she knows that most of it is not true. And i think Jim would have a big problem with all these lies that are in it. So, if you want to read a great book about Jim and his true love, dont bother to read this one. My advise to you is to read \\"Angels Dance and Angels Die\\" By Patricia Butler. Now that is a true book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much more can Kennealy capitalize on her brief affair?","review":"Ugh...don't even bother with this book.

This is a love story between a rock God and a woman that loved him. I myself have read many books about Jim, and in my opinion this is the worst one yet. It tells nothing of what he meant to millions of people around the world. Just what he meant to her. If you want a love story then maybe you would like it. If you want to know about the real James Douglas then read Riders on the Storm by John Densmore. He was some one that knew him on and off stage. Patricia was just a fling for Jim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Kennealy is a fraud in all eyes but her own","review":"Ms. Kenneally has done nothing more than try to cash in on her relationship with The Doors front man Jim Morrison.

I think not.Save yourself the time and hundreds of bitter self absorbed pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disillusioned","review":"Pamela is disillusioned,the fact is their \\"wicca wedding\\" wasn't anything Jim took seriously.Pam courson was his cosmic mate.For all you lame people who say others are jealous of pamela because she was with Jim Morrison you are just as disillusioned maybe more then pamela herself.she didn't know Jim for very long,he wasn't with her that much and his heart belonged to pam courson although they both screwed around on one another alot.But if you are a disillusioned \\"wicca\\" or mental patient this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"rantings of a madwoman","review":"Keneally's diatribe is little more than a forum for her to share her obsession with Morrrison with the world.Though the \\"creatrix\\" claims this is the true story,all but the least perceptive reader picks up on the vibe that this is more than likely, a retelling the way she wishes things were....Most Jim Morrison books seem to be written with a bias of some sort,(Although none quite this rabid) one is best off reading them all and sifting through the pertinent information to put together an objective picture of what really happened.There is some valuable information to be gleaned from this book.One must take with a grain of salt the distorted slant w/ which it is written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Draining the Lizard... Queen","review":"I actually ended up feeling quite sorry for Patricia by the end of this book.What a sad life it must be being so bitter and deluded. She took a fling and clung onto it for almost 40 years. Apparently she has forgotten about all the interviews she gave admitting that Jim did not take her seriously and the correct date the fling started. Also, by looking at photos and footage of her before she met Jim, it is quite evident that she is not a natural redhead as she likes to claim. You should check out the wayback machine and pull up her now-defunct website before you buy this book, clear evidence of the nut trying to pop out the shell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant writer-infuriating book","review":"Although I appreciate another view of Mr. Morrison, the fact that Patricia Kennealy has never let go of him or his memory amazes me. In addition to this book, she has a web page where she spends a majority of time slamming Pam and other people associated with Jim.This could have been a great book, had she not been so arrogant to suggest that SHE was the only significant person in his life.It's really sad to think she has that distorted of a view of the past and chooses to still live in it.I don't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"was this book intended as a joke, or what?","review":"i don't think i've ever read a book as badly written as this one before--ever. you would think from the language and the attitude that this book was written by a girl in junior high. at times i actually wondered if it was intended as a satire on books about morrison or something, because it is seriously hard to fathom an adult woman writing something as immature and ludicrous as this. at one point she talks about how she physically jumped a friend who made a comment on morrison that she perceived as a come on(insecure??) and punched her, and this is literally how she described it, \\"pow! that'll teach her, that (...)\\" (...) is this supposed to be a joke, or what? the title itself is amusing, \\"strange days:my life with and without jim morrison\\". as though anyone cares about her life without morrison. i would actually recommend reading it, because it is inadvertently hilarious and will have anyone with half a brain rolling in the aisles. bizarre."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting, well-written memoir","review":"I found this book to be well-written and interesting. I admire the author's writing style, talent and confident attitude.I believe that memoirs should be taken with a grain of salt. Even people with excellent long term memories cannot remember conversations verbatim from decades ago, so there must be some creative finagling going on. I often wonder how memoirs are pieced together when no one, even those who keep detailed journals, can remember so many details.I enjoyed this entertaining account of the author's time with and without Jim Morrison. Don't stop here, however; whether you are interested in learning more about Jim Morrison or The Doors, there are plenty of other books available. I like to read as many different accounts as possible to learn about different perspectives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self serving,Self Important & Obsessive","review":"A completely self-serving study in obsessive posessive behavior one human being (?) can posess for another.Everything in this book should be taken with a TON of salt.Anyone who the author doesn't personally admire is shredded mercilessly.Those who believe this book deserve to NOT know the REAL truth"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better-written autobiographies available","review":"Whether you are or are not on her side, Patricia Kennealy-Morrison is an excellent writer and makes a compelling case for herself in this book. I've seen some other reviews make snide comments about how there seems to be more PKM than JDM in this book, but did they bother to read the title? It says it right there: \\"MY LIFE...\\"PKM draws the reader in, cocooning her in a web of well-spun words, making it a wrench to come back to the present if an interruption occurs. I read this book when it was first published, and then again recently to see if the magic still worked; it did.I'm not much into celebrity tell-alls, especially those 'as told to' types. Thankfully, this was written by the person who lived these \\"Strange Days,\\" and the writing shows it. It is masterful, personable, and highly interesting. I recommend it to any who are interested in this marvelous author's life, both past and present."},{"rating":"2","title":"View Altering and Mind Changing","review":"What a gift when someone allows a reader into their life and their deepest thoughts and feelings. Patricia goes ahead and spares the reader nothing, her honest and fascinating words filling each and every page. She sets the record straight for anyone interested in the truth.This book changed the way I view so many things in life and in history and am so very grateful to Mrs. Morrison for showing me and every other reader these things and all the while teaching valuable lessons in life and love. Worth reading over and over again.Rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"Ms. Kennealy-Morrison has painted a beautiful picture of the gentle side of Jim Morrison.

In \\"Rock Wives,\\" she told author Victoria Balfour that she'd clock Morrison if he showed up at her doorstep today. Now all of a sudden she's his \\"Lizard Queen.\\" In \\"Rock Wives,\\" she said that Morrison probably didn't take their handfasting seriously. In \\"Strange Days,\\" it's transcendent experience followed by mind-blowing sex. Kennealy changed her story after the Doors movie came out and added the \\"Morrison\\" to her surname as well (something she probably wouldn't have done if Jim were alive). A tribute to her beloved, perhaps? More like greed.This woman's \\"Lizard Queen\\" act has always rung false, and no wonder. See \\"Your Ballroom Days Are Over, Baby\\" from Doors Collectors Magazine for a more accurate picture of Kennealy's real relationship with Jim Morrison."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon Patricia","review":"This book gave a lot of information on how Patricia was absolutely infatuated with Jim Morrison. I have never read so much hatred against Pam in my life!!! I found it pretty sad that she blamed Pam for Jims death. I mean, did Pam force a grown man to do drugs? Patricia stated in her book, \\"How wise you were, Pamela Susan, to have smacked out yourself in 1974, because if you were alive right now, I would be on my way to California to kill you. Be glad you are dead.\\" I mean c'mon. Absolutely un-called for. This woman needs mental help.I believe this book is written in a fantasy that she believed in.Her crazy fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bombastic, Baseless, Boring","review":"after reading this book, i was left feeling disturbed and unsettled by the author's recollections and fierce protectiveness of jim morrison. perhaps if she had left out the stalker-like zeal in which she wrote her memoirs, i would have at least experienced her frame of reference and respected her as someone who was giving her side and account of the situation. instead,i came away feeling very uncomfortable and unsettled. her account is not informative but vitriolic; she comes across as vindictive instead of sincere. anyone who discounts her claims as jim's widow or that she was his \\"true\\" wife and partner is the target of ferocious attack. the end result is a book that should not be taken seriously simply due to the author's literary conduct. and for that, ms. kinnealy has no one to blame but herself.it's quite sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcisstic Memoir. Get over the Fling lady","review":"Patricia seems a smart lady. She writes intelligently, she is no ditzy bimbo but she sure knows how to delude herself, and for 30 odd years at that!Pamela Courson was no angel. She had flaws like we all do. BUt she loved Jim and he loved her.The fling with Patricia was perhaps exciting and to him, I am sure he had some feelings for Patricia but unlike Patricia (who is strong and determined) Pamela was the opposite. He clearly liked to take care of her if he didn't he would not have stuck by her all these years. As for calling her a slut and junkie, how fair is that? This envy is killing you Patricia. Let the dead rest and get on with your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Honest Approach To The Jim Morrison Legend","review":"Patricia Kennealy offers a very honest and realistic approach to the usually over-hyped, over told, and often over elaborated story of what it was like to be inside the world of a legendary artist. Usually when people write a book about the Doors, or Morrison, they tend to concintrate on the 'war stories' to offer to the shallower group of so called Morrison fans an outlet. If you are a real fan of Jim Morrison this book is a must have. It gives you a rare glimpse of Morrison that gives him a human feel. It also gives the reader a good understanding of what it was like for him to try to deal with all the fame, fortune, and notoriety. If you are like me you will like the feeling of closeness you feel with Morrison and Kennealy while reading. And for any true fan of Morrison you will end up with an understanding that you may have never found before in other books. This along with just being a very well written book makes this a definate winner with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a book that gives insight on Jim Morrison the person","review":"\\"Strange Days\\" is the first book to give insight on Jim Morrsion the person, and not Jim Morrison the lizard king. Patricia Kennealy paints a beautiful picture of a love affair, that was cut way to short. Anyone interested in finding out about the Jim Morrison who was a shy, romantic gentleman this is the book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Witch","review":"Having read the book, I am convinced only of on thing.Patricia had an affair with Jim. Weather it was the love affair of all times, no one will ever know. I think it is fiction based on fact. OK, so now Pam is responsible for Jims death, and Kennealy hates her for it so much she would kill her if she were still alive. She trashes that girl so bad it sickens me.Pam inherited all of Jims money, why would she have to prostitute herself? And, according to other reliable sources, she died from a heroin od, but was not a junkie, the autopsy proved that. She is hateful and jealous and it spews onto every page of this book. It speaks volumes of her character. Read 'Angels Dance and Angels Die.\\" A great book, based on FACT."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a piece of trash","review":"If you want to feel what it's like to be kicked in the teeth then read this book, otherwise save yourself the aggravation. Kennealy thinks she's smarter than everyone else for some reason (even though she belives in werewolves, demons and witches) and thinks she needs to tell you that. The truth is is that Morrison wouldn't be caught dead with a cook like this if he were alive (or sober at the timeof this \\"torrid affair\\"). Buy a bootleg or An American Prayer instead of this nonsense. I only wish I could give this \\"book\\" no stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim's been dead almost thirty years now. . .","review":". . .Isn't it time Patricia Kennealy let go of his memory and got on with her life? Yes, Kennealy is excessively intelligent, not that for one moment she lets us forget it. Yes, she is a talented writer. Yes, her story is compelling and she has the right to tell it from her point of view. And yes, I admire her for being unabashedly proud of her intelligence and talent, in a world where women are too often rewarded for being vacuous airheads (Pamela Courson readily comes to mind). But what keeps me from giving this a full five stars is the vindictiveness and smug superiority with which this story is told. Sorry, Patricia, your IQ (a dubious test of intelligence, BTW) could be 3 million, that still doesn't make you better than anybody else. Also, as someone in the Craft, I would like to state for the record that Kennealy's views do not represent the majority of Wiccans (at least none that I know), who are generally peace-loving, caring folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a cheap copy","review":"This book is ghastly, delusional, goofy and written by a stratospheric egomaniac. How many people can actually believe she and Morrison went to a restaurant and decided not to eat because they just wanted to stare into each other's eyes - being so in love and all. If that doesn't make you gag, get a cheap copy to read. It's hardly worth your time but Morrison fans may simply have to get through as much as they can stomach just to say they left no stone unturned. Also, if slandering the dead (Pam) who can no longer defend themselves doesn't offend you wait till you get to the nutty self interview! Oh brother! Morrison once told an interviewer he thought the most creative thing would be to interview yourself. Maybe his self but hers ended up downright psychotic! I almost feel bad for bashing this book because I genuinely do have compassion on mentally ill people. Poor thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put the book down!!","review":"Although Patricia seems to be very caught up in the past (and I probably would be too if it had been spent with Jim Morrison), I found this book extrememly well written and just could not put it down. I also really enjoyed Riders on the Storm and Danny Sugarman's Wonderland Avenue. These books are an entire step above being sensational for just selling purposes. They tell their own story and do not just recount what all other books have already told you."},{"rating":"2","title":"New side to Jim Morrison","review":"I have read this book over & over, since the first purchase. I have read countless books on Jim Morrison, and by far, this is the best. The book recounts a bibliographical synopsis of both Jim & Patricia's lives, before they met. Patricia is very careful to point out that this was HER Jim, and their relationship. Morrison was an extremely complex man, with many sides. This shows us his more real side. The characters are all very young, intensely passionate and warmly human. Patricia also recounts many painful episodes that she did not have to include in this book, in order for it to sell. _Strange Days:_ was written in response to the Doors movie by Oliver Stone. Patricia covers this event, and many more, with wit and humour. I would recommend this book for any Doors/Morrison fan...especially the ones who seem to discount Patricia at every turn. It shows the human side of Jim Morrison, and the love he shared with a very exceptional woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Inside Story","review":"This book is the closest you will ever get to the actual truth about Jim Morrison. Granted, she was deeply offended by Pam Courson...as virtually any lover of Jim's would be. Strange, though, Pam did not appear jealous of Patricia...Kennealy is a very talented writer. You will not be able to put this book down. Even the ghost parts. And the love parts are incredible. She does not adore all The Doors equally, as I do. But then she is entitled to her own observations. Personally, I feel a book with great integrity is John Densmore's \\"Riders On The Storm\\". That one is also jam packed full of Jim info...which I crave.

It is an Aaron Kwok movie.The action is rediculous, sped up, and not very coordinated. The humor is poor, and mostly unfunny. The two male roles are played by very similar looking actors. One of them is introduced as being semi-powerful, but later on he doesn't use any of his power. There are subtitles over a Chinese audio track, but you can't turn them off. There are also two song number in it (I hate musicals).This is one of very few DVDs that I wish that I hadn't bought. I own about 40 kung fu DVDs and this is in my bottom three.

He has just one very brief action scene and it's too quickly edited to follow. While he is always thoroughly entertaining, his talents are greatly wasted in this film. The rest of this movie is just OK, like most of director Wong Jing's movies it is one part exquisitely surreal fantasy, one part unfunny comedy.

This edition of the book is not simply worth your time.First of all, the tale has been badly abridged. In fact, the editors cut the story in the middle leaving out about half of the tale. The black corsair does not have a happy ending, but neither does some of the books from A. Dumas. Anyway you should not cut a story like this.Second, the book is typeset in a small, serif (times roman-like) print that makes it difficult to read.

The draw 2 card is the worst out of all of them with a \\"+2\\" as the symbol, making it easily confused with an actual 2.

It is easy to learn but continues to provide challenging play for years. The rules are easily modified to accomodate diffenent skill levels or time available. This one doesn't need bells and whistles, it is great as it is.Although Mattel would not encourage this (or even suggest it) playing for points lends itself to modest wagers, and to an extent, allows for handicaping with players of different skill levels.The educational value is not obvious, but is significant. It teaches players to think ahead, consider branches and sequels of actions, and strategy.The compact size (like two standard poker decks) allows this one to travel well, and can be played on trains, planes, boats, buses, and in tents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"A classic!!!

The object of the game is to be the first to score 500 points. You score points by getting rid of all your cards in your hand before the other players. You score points for cards that are left in the other player's hand. So the more players you have, the better.The UNO deck consists of number cards and word cards. Each player is given 7 cards and the rest of the cards are placed face down and are considered a draw pile. The top card is placed face up. The object of the game is to match the card by their number, color or word.

Sometimes dubbed as Kerouac's Finnigan Wake, according to particular critics, the book utilizes a style of an architectural text format on the printed page, as well as inventive diatribes and phonetical play on words. However, the book is definitely a challenge (writing close to 500 pages) and requires a lot of patience. Nevertheless, it still is a fun read once the reader overcomes the Joycean first two chapters. The book's highlight is the tape-recorded transcriptions concentrating on Jack and Cody's contentions of Jazz and sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I bought this book because of the NY Times review comment quoted on the back of the jacket in essence saying that this book was the true companion to \\"On the Road\\". While I can say that I was mildly interested with Kerouac's prose in \\"On the Road\\", I can also say that I found this book to be absolutely awful. Why anyone has any interest in the drunk and high reminiscing of the characters in this book is beyond me. Abstract views on sex and drugs are fine, (eg Hunter S. Thompson), but this isn't even mildly interesting or amusing. I had hoped, ultimately, that I would find something of value in Kerouac's style or philosophy, perhaps even something that would enable me to see the world from a different, but somehow valuable point of view... unfortunately, that was not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst, last Kerouac to read.","review":"As much as I love Kerouac, this one is just too muddled to be of much use. That reviewer who said this hooked him on Kerouac for life scares the hell out of me.There is only so much dope-addled rambling a person can take. When Jack and Cody start tossing nonsense at each other, just mumbling stuff, well, that's an interesting take on poetry for a page or two, but not for hundreds of pages.Read everything else by Kerouac. If that's not enough, then give this a shot. You probably won't finish it anyway. Sure, there's a gem here and there, but it's hardly worth the hunt when there's so much other kick-butt Kerouac out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book Yet can be a Bear To Read","review":"I agree with many that say that the first 150 pages are really worth reading. They are beautiful and brilliant with images and gives you an inside seat as to how On the Road came about. Yet after that it is a tough read. The transcripts are long, go on forever and you wonder why they were included. The last half of the book is pretty good.This is defiantly one of those books you will want to read when you have the time, skill to concentrate , and desire for a wild ride. It took the two years to read this book and I am not a slow reader. But I was glad I had read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a review of the audio version of Visions of Cody","review":"read by Graham Parker.Alan Ginsberg thought that Visions of Cody was Jack's best book but whether we agree with him or not, Visions is a long and often tedious free association jazz riff manuscript about Jack and Neal Cassady and friends that can be difficult for some to \\"get into.\\" I agree with the previous reviewers who advise the reader to have a few drinks, put on some jazz and, if you get bored, read it out loud. The rhythms of post World War II American English will come alive.Graham Parker does it for us with his reading. First of all, the reading is abridged into two cassettes and it helps to pare down this enormous, meandering manuscript to its high points. Second, Parker provides the music and the poetry with his magnificently expressive reading and added music. You might be put off, at first, by his English accent but I think you will be won over with his extraordinary vocal rendition of the essentials of Visions of Cody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six bucks for a movie review???

The songs range from highly original folk-rock compositions like Running Down The Road and Coming Into Los Angeles, to moving ballads like Oh, In The Morning. Two highlights are Arlo's rendition of Oklahoma Hills, composed by his father, and the ethereal Living In The Country. The remaining songs are also excellent in their own right and feature some superb instrumental accompaniment by Pete Seeger and a young Ry Cooder. My personal favorite is My Front Pages, which has a strong Dylan influence. This is one of those recordings which grows on you slowly but which leaves a lasting impression. I've had it for more than 18 years and I still enjoy hearing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great companion to Hobo's Lullaby","review":"While COMING INTO LOS ANGELES is probably the best-known song on this album, you'll appreciate the more soulful OH, IN THE MORNING and the bouncy MY CREOLE BELLE.

The logical arrangement of relativity is much better in these books than in MTW, although MTW treats more matters more thoroughly (can't help the puns). Schutz seems more like a physicist, and Foster/Night. seem more like mathemeticians. Both viewpoints help substantially! If I were only to get one of these books, I would get Schutz's first.

If I didn't see the action, I feel like I got cheated. So, needless to say, the script left something to be desired.Also, some of the problems seemed contrived. D.L.

I love the kids singing on the wiggly eels and the salty waves songs and Iarla O'Lionaird adds a somber tone to the disc. The singers and sound effects create a very real atmosphere and the music blends easily with the story, sometimes overlapping. It's good to know there are such high quality recordings for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Notebook--the correct OS","review":"The Sony VAIO is a great notebook.

Also, after dropping it once on our kitchen floor it stopped working. It is cute but just be careful with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, son loves it","review":"My husband got this for our son for Christmas and it is still one of his favorite toys. He has learned to \\"bite\\" the pigs nose to turn it on. This toy being across the room has encouraged him to crawl more. He gets very excited about the toy and knows it by the sound.He has played with it in his highchair several times and loves to drop it to the floor and it's still going great as should any baby toy.It's one of the best toys we have bought in a while"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a laugh","review":"My daughter received this pig as a gift when she was a couple months old and both she and I have enjoyed the cute song and noises it makes and the shaking action is also fun. The batteries lasted for over a year. The downsides of this toy are that it is heavy, so you need to be careful about throwing or dropping it, and the button that you push on the nose to make it work really has to be done by an adult - most kids cannot push hard enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"21 BUCKS CHEAPER AT WAL-MART!","review":"My four month loves the piggy, he goes crazy everytime I press the nose, which is not hard to activate so I have no idea what other people's problems were, even my son was able to press it. But I was shocked to see how much this was online, I got it for 9.99 at wal-mart and it was not on sale. I put it on his jumperoo play tray whenever I put him in it and everytime I press it, he jumps and kicks and giggles. Though I am constantly there to play with him so if your looking for a toy to occupy your baby so you can get work done, this is not the one, but it is certainly worth ten bucks at wal-mart! I tested on my son in the store, as soon as I pressed the button he giggled and tried to grab it. Though my son also rejects many common baby toys like teethers,rattles pacifiers, you name it...so I was over joyed to find something he freaked over."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh I hate this toy","review":"Grandma got this as a holiday gift for my daughter. Grandma is very generous and we love her bunches, but I wish she had saved her money.Please don't buy it. It's awful. You hit the nose and it shakes for 5 seconds. That's it. It's a big, bulky, obnoxious toy. I have no idea how this got through product design.I hate getting gifts that you have to throw away. This isn't even donatable. I couldn't pawn this off on any of my friends. It's that bad. No one would take this for free. I don't know how this is on the market. It's ugly, doesn't do anything, is too big .... I suppose if you have a basement full of toys you can toss this into the pile of stuff the kid will never play with, but if you are space constrained, you just can't have something like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, obnoxious toy.","review":"I hate this toy. My child received it as a gift last Christmas and it's truly awful. She cannot press the nose herself, so I have to do it over and over again. It only makes noise and vibrates for about five seconds.

Pamela Dellal's mezzo-soprano is dark and rich, just what I want to hear for these songs! Zaretsky matches her tonal color perfectly, and Bjerken provides the textures that complete this remarkable performance.

With this series of speakers they could definitely compete with speakers well above their price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, one-of-a-kind book, could stand more detail","review":"The irreplacable book for the travelling football fan. I would like to see some more detail (getting tickets can still be a bit confusing even with the directions in the book), and stadia maps would be helpful for deciding where to sit.

She flits from one job/lover/domicile to another with some internal logic that seems completely inexplicable. I found no interesting philosophical quandary being explored as is true of much of Dick's work, just the flakiest of all his flaky female characters running from or to whatever runs through her mind or passes in front of her eyes with little to no explanation why. I found this book truly devoid of interesting characters, situations or ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brand name, solid build, flexible features and good price.","review":"I am very happy for this purchase. It is truly a pro level product. It has a solid metal head that is easy to adjust. Quick release lock is a big plus. Everything is great and it only cost half of Bogen tripod plus head.The flexible feature I was talk about is that you can easily extend angle of each leg in two stops. See my pictures above.The only thing not so perfect is that the leg lock is by screw, takes a little time but very secure indeed. It gives very stable support, even when the center bar is raised to the top.I found using it as a monopod is fun too, and even one leg supports my 6 lb system very solid.If you are in a market of a $70 tripod, you will be surprised by the quality;If you are a pro and planning to spend $200 - $300 on a tripod plus head, you might be surprised by the price. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite bra","review":"I LOVE this bra.

It's both supportive and comfortable. It actually has cups so your bust is not smooshed into one big sausage roll across your chest like most sport bras. It lifts and separates and is very flattering. The firm support structure is on the outside so no wires or bones dig into your body. It also prevents most vertical and horizontal movement. The only negative is that it is thick and not made of those new high tech wicking fabrics so if you sweat a lot, it will get damp and stay damp for awhile. Although it definitely looks like a bra, you could maybe get away with wearing it without a top.

The band has a nice modern-rockish sound (slightly remeniscent of Cake but much better), good vocal talent, and is complimented by a perfect dash of incidental keyboard spice.

I'm not happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work!","review":"This unit has not worked well for me. After much trying, I've given up and consider my $10 lost. Besides not working, the cap doesn't fit properly, the battery cover keeps sliding off and the overall construction is cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what happened...","review":"I had one of these that lasted me about 5 years, and I was happy to replace my old Wahl with this newer one.I've had the thing for about 2 months, and it's just lousy. I can't tell if the problem is a dull blade or just that the motor isn't getting enough power. At first I thought the blame was with the rechargeable batteries I was using. I've changed the batteries out a couple times, and that's not the case.This thing is junk, and I'm going to have to scrap it and order another one. I'll probably get one by a different manufacturer. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made, Didn't Last, Waste of Money","review":"WARNING. Before you purchase this look at the other reviews of Wahl 5560 as well to better inform yourself. I purchased this product because of the Wahl name. I own their plug-in electric hair groomer and it is powerful and well made. Unfortunately, this nose trimmer is not of the same quality. It is cheaply made foreign junk with the Wahl name stamped on it. The cutter actually did a decent job, for a week or two. Then started having trouble with the little motor, wouldn't turn or cut. I took it apart and the motor looks like a cheap motor from a toy in a happy meal. Waste of money. I am suspicious of all these hyper positive reviews and unhappy i've wasted money on a cheap product. I was very disappointed. Caveat emptor. os"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"This is a very low quality trimmer. It's not made in the USA like some other Wahl products. It does a terrible job of trimming. I have another Panasonic trimmer, and while that one has hurt me, it does a much better job trimming.

Even if you want paper, you don't want this edition -it's badly formatted, flimsy - not worth 5 dollars.

Not only do you get to see a real casting, but the interviews are funny, serious and interesting. Jessica Villines (film maker) did a great job of bringing together musicians, artists, friends and others for a well-rounded, exceptionally well written piece about a groupie/artist who is still going strong after thirty-some years. Follow Ms. Plaster Caster around her day to day life for some great entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I was really sorry I purchased this....with all the people she did they concentrated on musicians Ive never even heard of.

The video production and editing were below amateur level. It is a waste of time, offering no insight into the groupies or celebrities of the 1960s and 1970s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good but...","review":"I liked this DVD but I was not impressed. When you can draw like Miss Caster you should persue some sort of craft. This casting thing is unique and cool but it isn't paying the rent for her. She still gets $100.00 dollars a month from her mother who she calls the warden. Very sad. She is a very likable person in the DVD. Almost sweet. It is really nice when she gets her \\"show\\" in New York City but the buck stops there. Where is her life going? It got frustrating. Someone with so much talent needs to get some self respect and self worth. I am a huge fan of Miss Pamela Des Barres. Maybe she should help Ms. Caster get her book done. I would buy it and read it. Miss Des Barres is a good writer and Ms. Caster could benefit from a bit of work ethic. Miss Pamela?? She could use your help."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rock-Solid Documentary That's a Blast","review":"I saw Cynthia Plaster Caster's \\"babies\\" on display at Threadwaxing Space in 2000, read about her in a 2001 issue of BB Gun, and was thus very eager to see this. I got my chance at a recent film festival, and thoroughly enjoyed it.This documentary is as unique as its subject, who comes across as quirky, warm and eternally youthful, and whose craft provides us with a bizarre but indispensible bit of rock n roll memorabilia.You'll love \\"Plaster Caster\\" if you're a fan of: British rock of the 1960s and '70s; the GTO era of LA; the \\"indie\\" music scene of the 1980s and '90s; dive bars inhabited by shaggy-haired rock n rollers; and the DIY aesthetic.I'm definitely buying this on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Angel","review":"From the moment Angela Chamberlain first sees Devil Blackmoor, she's hooked. Her father is about to send her to finishing school, but Angela wants adventure. And adventure is what she gets with Devil Blackmoor.

Because he met her in a bordello, he thinks Angela is neither. He takes her from Denver to New York to make her his mistress. Across the Atlantic to London and all the way to Russia, she holds herself apart from him. But Angela is in grave danger. Unusual and exotic characters people the landscape of this fresh and involving novel.

Don't read this book if you're looking for new insight on management techniques. If you're already a seasoned manager, you'll find more value in your real work environment. This was a text for one of my MBA courses, and the rest of my MBA team (which consists of seasoned management professionals) has the same sentiments.Spend your time elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Layout","review":"The content of this book is adequate, but the layout leaves much to be desired. The only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents. Pages are not labeled with chapter information, such as which chapter that page belongs to. The content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half. This makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book. You can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused. If the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book, I would rate it much higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compete and Utter Rubish","review":"This product is abysmal. I purchased it as cheap intermediary protection for my L-series canon lens until I could afford a solid uv-filter, so I wasn't expecting much. My expectations were apparently too high. The glass was just that, a piece of cut glass with horrible glare in a cheap bulky ring. And to make it worse, it wasn't even tightly set into the ring; the glass was loose and jiggled around (which made perceptible noise). Completely unacceptable product, would not recommend under any circumstance. I ended up throwing this out; save your money for a better filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"For $5.95, I don't feel that this was worth it. I actually got more information and inspiration from YouTube. Even though people have been doing this for years, this is an under-covered subject in the states.I would like to see Amazon offer some of the videos and books listed on www.aquaponics.net.au . From what I've seen, Australia is a little farther ahead of America on this trend.Also, if you are a survivalist, this may be a real solution for your food production needs.

I will be buying another Dominic Miller CD soon......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawnnnnn...","review":"I am not opposed to pop-clasical crossover efforts (e.g., I like most of the Opera Babes CD), but see no point in this album. \\"Shapes\\" offers very sleepy versions of mostly over-familiar classical/baroque pieces, none improving in any way on conventional, unmodified performances or other pop-classics efforts. (For example, compare the fine performance of Satie's Gymnopedie #1 by Blood, Sweat, & Tears with Miller's emotionally/sonically flat version.)Also, Miller's guitar performance displays nothing of his musical personality (maybe he has none). Dom, if you're going to do classical pieces, you need to play them straight, or add some interesting pop flavor/color. This bland, inoffensive approach is uninvolving, hence pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst movie I've ever seen...","review":"That award goes to \\"Rawhead Rex\\" which is amazing in its horribleness.

Acting was subpar, special effects finished it off. What can one expect from Syfy, and Asylum? I would like to see a good Titanic 2 done right.

History of the band is covered, but there's nothing in this DVD that can't be found - and presented better - elsewhere.The \\"documentary\\" is literally close-up shots of three quite frankly ugly, uninteresting english fellows. This video consists of mostly only these three gentlemen talking. (Occasionally, they'll break from the talking heads and show some Who footage, which isn't even that interesting. Number 1, the videos can be found elsewhere, and number 2, no Who audio is included. You are stuck with a bland elevator rock music substitute playing in the background.) I got real sick of watching this very quickly.I would only recommend this DVD for Who completists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth a rental","review":"Thankfully I viewed this with a Netflix rental so I don't feel I lost too much money on it.

Holmes and Watson here do not even get around to questioning the major suspect until around page 215. Neither Holmes nor Watson runs true to the Conan-Doyle form; often they spat like a pair of old queens. As another reviewer has noted, Watson even commits the unforgivable (to Victorians) sin of addressing characters by their first names, about 3/4 of the way through the book, and consistently thereafter.The book cries out for an editor, who could have carved a pretty good 200 page novel out of the raw material here.The text is full of vexing misprints, typically several per page.

This set is an exercise in frustration. Here's why....1) First the wheels on all cars except the locomotive easily fall off. Requiring constantly stopping and putting back on.2) The locomotive's wheels do not stay firmly on the track and easily \\"derails\\" when you run at mid speed or above.Combine 1 and 2 and you have a worthless train set.

So, in that sense it was worth the price.However, this set is not durable at all. I think one of the coupling hitches was broken right out of the box and several others followed suit in the next few days so that now, I think three out of the five cars that came with the set are unusable.Plus the wheels of the cars pop out easily. An adult can pop the wheels back in - providing your child hasn't stepped on them already. Also, the slightest bit of jostling derails the train and it's not easy for a young child to re-mount the trains on the tracks properly.Perhaps if my son was a few years older it would have been enjoyable for a longer period of time. As it was, he got about a day's enjoyment out of it. If you have the money, go for a larger scale (O guage) train set - I seem to remember those were a lot more solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choo Choo for the Sante Fe Flyer","review":"I love my train.

The rail cars are extremely difficult to connect together and it is also very difficult to get the wheels to sit on the track properly. The engine and cars derail very easily. We have triplet boys so we bought 3 trains. Each train is as poorly built as the other, so it's not like we got a dud. They are all manufactured equally bad. The only good thing that I can say is that it runs smoothly until it derails and the power supply seems to operate well.

It starts out slow with about 9 min. of extremely basic stepping (you might want to use hand weights in the beginning to get your heart rate up) and then moves into some powerful moves with some funky hip hop thrown in at the end.

I like a lot of the other workout tapes in the Reebok series, but I could've left this one at the store.

If you want a good, serious, challenging workout by Gin Miller, try her Power Step and Intese Moves workouts, they blow this one away.

The first part of the video, basic step, is easy to catch on to, is a challenge if your step platform is high enough, and goes by quickly since the exercisers spend the whole time trying to be funny. The second segment--my favorite--is Power step, with more jumping, higher intensity moves, less joking around. The third segment, hip-hop step, is a nice concept, but the music isn't hip-hop (the music is pretty blah throughout the whole video actually), the dancy moves aren't at all challenging, and it seems to drag. Good beginner step video, and worthwhile for intermediate/advanced if you raise the platform to the tallest height."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready to smile while you sweat!","review":"Not only is this a great workout, but Gin and her \\"team\\" crack up throughout the entire video.

As a professional bridal seamstress with a background in costuming I was particularly impressed with the way the author emphasizes how a garment should \\"behave\\" and that she gives suggestions on fabrics to be used as linings and interlinings.

The beautiful, smooth, princess seams were perfect. In reading the details and applying them to my situation I was able to create a lovely gown.

The account of when Francis renounced his father was depicted completely, but respectful. His remarkable illustrations are helpful as well.

For someone new to feminist theology, this is a good starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic of Christian Feminism","review":"Ruether lays out the basic principles of a Christian Feminist ethic in this book, and outlines a number of alternative feminists views from the radical to the liberal and socialist perspective. She illustrates convincingly the male bias of much of the theological perspective of the Christian tradition, and suggests how a feminist ethic can help rectify the domineering, hierarchical model of society that this tradition has been all-too-comfortable with. A male Jesus can save feminists too, because Jesus was all about leveling inequalities and promoting social justice, from her point of view. Ruether's writing style and language ranges from accessible to somewhat inaccessible. Beginning students of feminism may find some of the language and background hard to follow, but in a concise work Ruether's book still remains a successful illustration of the feminist ideas of Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it up as you go = feminist theology","review":"Make it up as you go = feminist theology... all I could really say about it.

I was wrong the worst graphic cliping I have seen on dreamcast bad graphic's, bad frame rate, horrible physic's and bad sound effects as well as music. I took it back the next day and echanged it for the best racing game I have seen on dreamcast. That was Test Drive Le Mans it is great I highly recomend it I was happy that Ducati was so bad and I had to exchange it after the first five minutes of test drive le mans I was hooked, that's a five star game not to mention it is only $... so run out and get it.

Couldn't watch it for the grossly overused foul language and lesbians. Skipped to the end to see the Undercover Detective outsmarted and murdered by 1 lesbian he's to protect. Why anyone would spend good money to produce this trash is beyond me. I spent less than 2 bucks to watch it for 7 days but deleted this movie instantly because it's nothing more than trash.

They are good about turning out quality projects. Some of their projects are better than others, this being one of the others.This cd had the songs, but not nearly enough of the stings.

This is not strictly a \\"music\\" DVD; it's a historical work about the people and their lives and experiences. There's some Monk performance footage that's fantastic. And interviews with Blakey, Rollins, Hinton, Mulligan, et al are pure jazz history.The first disk shows Jean Bach's excellent film; the second contains bios, archival pix and film clips of everybody in the picture.

Maybe seattle should stick to grunge music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"If all you want from metal is a competent demonstration of generic thrashy melodic-death playing technique, this album won't disappoint, but if you require a band to come up with some distinctive memorable hooks or at least something remotely original to hold your attention you won't find it here. The squeaky clean production is typical of the current metalcore scene, offering some heavy crunch, but not a remarkable amount, and no grittyness. This is a redundant album by a useless band who should have broken up before they had the chance to even disgrace the Revelation roster, let alone jump on the At The Gates worship bandwagon. For a superior alternative check out And They Shall Take Up Serpents by Byzantine.

I thought what a cool collection. There were some real Classics missing Like \\" Raped and Freezing\\" 'I love the Dead\\" 'Unfinished Sweet\\" and more. But you can only fit so many songs on one disc so I bought it.However when I started listening to it I was highly dissappointed in the edited versions of some of the songs. Why would you take out the keyboard solo in \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\"?If you want to listen to some classic Alice get the original albums. Start with \\"Love it to Death\\" , \\"killer\\", \\"School's out\\" \\" Welcome to my Nightmare\\" and \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" then go on from there. I tried to take the shortcut and got burned bigtime.Alice rules . Shame on you Rhino."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true representation","review":"Where are classic tracks such as Raped & Freezin', Halo of Flies, Ballad of Dwight Fry?

I ditched my old \\"hits\\" CD years ago (the one with the gangster cover) because I was mad that the song \\"you and me\\" wasn't on it. So I finally get this CD (which has \\"you and me\\" as well as my other faves, like \\"under my wheels\\"), and found myself falling in love with the song \\"election\\" which I never paid that much attention to before.

Is this too much to ask??"},{"rating":"2","title":"As a Greatest Hits Collection CD, It Is Right Up There With Queen's Greatest Hits!","review":"It is obvious that this set was harvested from the fantastic Life and Crimes of Alice Cooper Boxset and the result is a smart, succinct single disc retrospective for die hard and casual Alice Cooper fans. The artwork and liner notes are terrific along with his greatest hit singles. Many of the tracks are the edited old 45 versions which are very cool to own. Rhino records probably used Queen's Greatest Hits as a yardstick to bring Alice's legacy to the masses and they got it right with Mascara and Monsters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mascara and Monsters: The Best of Alice Cooper","review":"I have this cd, bought it recently. Most of the main classics are on this cd. But my problem is, where are the 3 classics \\"Hey Stoopid\\", \\"Feed My Frankenstein\\", and \\"Lost in America\\"?

He has some classics. My personal favorite is \\"Desperado\\". All of the songs showcase his talent as a rock star. I would say he is one of the greatest musicians of all time. I know that people don't like his music but those people don't know anything. I say that rock is the greatest thing ever on this earth and Alice Cooper is a shinning symbol of rock.I first heard of Alice Cooper because of my brother. His favorite singer is Alice Cooper. I used to be into other things but Alice made me rethink rock music. I came to realize that the music for me is definately rock. People should agree with me.

I was compelled to write it so that others wouldn't buy this toy.My younger son who is 2 received this for Christmas from his grandparents and it's truly a piece of junk. Let me count the ways:1) Made of flimsy plastic.2) The barn does not close completely. Also, just a few moments ago I \\"closed\\" it and the grey roof fell off when I picked it up by the handle. All the parts came falling out.3) The yellow cart doesn't stay on the tractor. Always unhooking.4) Hay loft falls off too easily. I'm always re-attaching it.5) The animals are not balanced. They fall over easily.6) Fence comes apart easily.7) When the barn \\"closes\\" the parts still fall out because of the windows and doorway. Ridiculous!I'm am so disappointed in this toy. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"We got this because we are dairy farmers and my husband is a very loyal John Deere customer. We were so upset with the quality of this toy! The haymow, roof and doors would not stay on, the walls wouldn't even stay together. The platform where you put the animals would make other animal noises, my boys played with it for about 5 minutes before my 4 yr old said, \\"Mommy, this is a piece of junk!\\" The only thing we liked about it was the corn they still play with that, but otherwise it was a waste of our hard earned money and a bad idea for John Deere to put their mane on this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"This John Deere playset is so flimsy and frustrating to play with, nothing stays together, and I wished I never bought it!...

I couldn't even get it together without it falling apart in the process. The barn door just would not stay on. It is nearly impossible to slide it open and closed. When you put the animals on the area where they will make a sound, they have to be lined up JUST RIGHT or they make the sound of a different animal. DO NOT BUY THIS FARM SET! Mine went back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed! The John Deere name should not be on this poor quality toy","review":"My grandfather owned a John Deere implement dealership in Iowa, so my blood runs green and gold! I was soooo excited to buy this for my daughter, his namesake. It was purchased for her at birth and now she is turning 1. I just opened it and was very disappointed to see that none of the decorative stickers were sticky at all. I had to use glue to stick them onto the barn. Also, like other reviewers have stated, the plastic is warped, making the barn difficult for me to open and the roof doesn't line up well. This product is such poor quality! This Big Red Barn is a Big Red disappointment. It is a disgrace to the John Deere name!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So not worth it","review":"This toy is a piece of crap to say it nicely. My 2.5 year old son is in love with John Deere and received this for Christmas. The farm animals done make sounds the way they are supposed to, the roof falls off constantly and the barn does not fully close. It has been sitting in a tote since Christmas time because every time my son tries to play with it he gets frustrated that it breaks and ends up in tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money at all!","review":"My 20 month old son got this for xmas, and it leaves A LOT to be desired. The other reveiws are absolutely correct. The barn is ALWAYS falling apart, when closed all the pieces fall out, the animals tip over easily and when you put them on the pegs to make the animal noises, it often doesn't work. You have to really wiggle it to get it to make the sound. And if the animal is put in sideways or backwards, it makes the wrong sound. My son like the tractor, and I think the corn part is neat. But that's about the only pros to it. The plastic is really flimsy and the barn always looks like it was hit by a tornado for all the pieces that keep falling off of it. Within a week, my son had chewed the bottom of the farmer to the point where the round plastic disk on the bottom came out (a choking hazard). I caught it before it fully dislodged and pulled it off. It might work well for older kids. All together though, not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"This barn is nothing but a big headache.

They sound pretty good (wish though woofer was in front, instead of on side of speaker). I guess you can't go wrong with the price for two speakers at $50.00 each.

Then there is a rebel monk who got himself out of the temple to live with his own terms. Soon the monk recruited 5 students. They defend the shaolin temple from the evil group and for their own revenge.The action is fast and great, the comedy is on point, and u have your typical martial arts storyline. My only complaint is the dvd version. Xenon company says that it is digitally restored but after seeing the movie it seems that the film was just copied straight from a VHS tape without restoration at all except for the sound. The fight scene at night is dark that u have trouble seeing the action. Overall, I still give it 4 star despite the dvd's fail restoration of a classic 80's kung fu movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply the best!!!!","review":"This is without a doubt, the greatest kung fu movie ever! The action is fantastic, and the training sequences are long and quite inventive. This movie has a great cast of likeable heroes, and impressive villains that all fight like kung fu superheroes. The master is the greatest character in movie history, and is not someone you would want to mess with. This is one of the first kung fu flicks i saw, and it still is my favorite.

I have called the company repeatedly and get this, they told me to hold the gas button down for 10 MINUTES straight to get the \\"proper\\" gas and air mixture. I practically passed out and the thing never would light. They then had me tear apart the hose and remove the propane filter. Now, they are thinking what else might be wrong.

The book does a great job explaining what your rights are, which is especially important in this digital age where artistic theft is easy and rampant.

The graphics are great, don't get me wrong, but the controls and the silly things that your players will do with consistently were so aggravating. For one, every time a shot goes up, defensive rebounding is way too hard. Half the time your players will stand around dumbfounded and then maybe reach down and pick the ball up off the ground. On offense, players will occasionally just wander out of bounds if you are anywhere near the sidelines or baseline. And certainly don't assume that there is any realism to your players abilities. I was playing a friend, and Eric Snow of all people could drive and dunk every time he touched the ball, while Reggie Miller can't seem to be able to make a three to save his life. You tell me, is that realistic? Please rent this before you go out and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"First off the players hunch like someone dropped a piano on them.

Every song here is fun and catchy, even if the singer is a little questionable and the lyrics are usually not that interesting (they can be at times, however). The songs are usually pretty energetic and feature some lesser-used instruments (like the banjo on the first track), but sometimes they slow down a bit like on \\"Dear Diary\\". The best song here is easily \\"Side\\" which has \\"hit\\" written all over it. This is essentially the song that got me into this album. The instrumentation is pretty good, although it's not necessarily new. The singer's reminiscent of My Morning Jacker's Jim James at times. It's slightly a guilty pleasure, but not by a great measure.

Songs like \\"Follow the Light\\" and the bonus track \\"You Don't Know What I'm Like\\" display how \\"colorful\\" Travis can be. There is some excellent work done on this album.

Anyone capable of human emotion can not help but be moved by Fran Healy's astonishing vocals. The lyrics are at times trite, but are always meaningful; those songs that don't challenge the intellect are sure to challenge the soul. The opening track \\"Sing\\" is pure fun and one of the most sonically interesting pop songs released in the last year. Their producer, Nigel Godrich (also Radiohead's producer) is all over this record...the songs flow into each other so naturally that it appears as if Fran and the boys have written one long opus instead of a collection of 12 songs. I highly recommend this record to anyone who enjoys inspiring melodies and well-crafted, delightful songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Who joined the Invisible Band","review":"In the two years since The Man Who completely swept everyone away, even winning best album at the Brit Awards, Travis haven't found a new direction, haven't decided to return to their Good Feeling rock roots. They've just spent that time concentrating on making good music with good lyrics. In short, it's good. Travis seem to have taken a more Beatles-esque approach to this cd, keeping the music on the bright side, as opposed to such songs as \\"Writing To Reach You\\" from Man Who. In fact, \\"Flowers In The Window\\" sounds so close to the Beatles, it's almost scary. This should be the cd that lets travis break through to the US. It deserves to be, for its great lyrics, and melodies that will stay with you long after you finish listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic britpop","review":"I have to admit that I'm a britpop snob...I listen to Pulp, Supergrass, Belle & Sebastian, Black Box Recorder, etc. almost to exclusion. So when Travis came out to such acclaim with The Man Who, I really wanted to like them. Unfortunately, I found that album to be a bit too moody and depressing and ultimately it didn't get much play on my stereo. After hearing Sing, the first single off of The Invisible Band, I decided to give Travis another shot and I'm so happy that I did. This album is light years better than their previous offering. Pipe Dreams, Safe, and Last Train all have an eerily haunting quality which is superbly mixed with the more upbeat songs like Sing, Side, Flowers in the Window, and Follow the Light. I've been unable to stop listening to this album for the last 2 weeks. Buy it - you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice album from four nice guys.","review":"This record is quite [bad]. 'Side' and 'Afterglow' are standout tracks, but most of the record shows little evidence of growth from \\"The Man Who\\". I've given it 2 stars because I am a Travis fan, but this isn't a record that you'll keep in your CD player unless your collection is already pretty weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concert band!","review":"If you get the chance, go see them touring with Dido and Emiliana Torrini this summer. They were good too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More great stuff","review":"Great dynamic music. This is classy rock with haunting melodies and awesome lyrics. Sing just makes you feel so glad to be alive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Melodic Rock (Beautiful)","review":"One thing you must get through your head is that Travis is not Radiohead and they should not be compared to Radiohead (even though Fran Healey sounds a little bit like Thom Yorke circa Pablo Honey on some songs from Travis' debut album).Ok, now you are ready to enjoy an album full of catchy mellow songs from a UK quartet and now they have a BANJO!! A great album and one that grew on me very quickly. Travis have been progressing their sound with each album and this is audible proof. Get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes simplicity is a virtue","review":"Travis' appeal comes from their simplicity. One doesn't need to listen to the album a dozen times for it to work its magic. Travis provides catchy, appealing songs, for the most part.I've found myself misinterpreting the lyrics that made the music sound deeper than it was. I can't understand how a song like \\"Flowers in the Window\\" can work; in all its pop laced unabashedly joyful way just makes one feel good.In my opinion, Travis' \\"Invisible Band\\" provides simple, enjoyable music that you won't be embarrassed that you enjoyed it 5 years from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear...","review":"From the minute you hear Sing you know Travis haven't changed a bit. They're perfectly happy to remain the least risk-taking band in the world. I mean Sing is a very nice happy anthem to sing-a-long to but its not exactly the classic of the century. And I wasn't really expecting heavy rock out of The Invisible Band, but they could have done a bit better than this. They now really don't at all deserve the title 'Indie Rock' or 'Alt Rock'. I see the indie, I just about see the alt, but where's the rock guys?It not like The Invisible Band ever claims to be rocky, but with songs like Dear Diary and Safe (which is exactly what the title suggests) appall me. At least a few of the tracks are beautiful, unlike the re-hashed acoustic indie of The Man Who which abides on most of the rest, boring incredible by the end.This is wonderful as a lullaby album, but unfortunately not all of my life involves wanting to be sent to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted to Travis","review":"I highly recommend this band. I only started to listen to them after the release of \\"why does it always rain on me\\" and they appeared on \\"The Panel\\" (a tv show in Australia). Firstly I picked up The Invisible Band and then had to rush out and get The Man Who and Good Feeling. Have a listen and I'm sure that you too will become addicted! I've been nagging my friends to have a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowers In The Window.","review":"\\"The Invisible Band\\" finds Travis moving towards less melancholy music and lyrics than were found on \\"The Man Who\\". Still, the one thing I like about Travis is they are able to capture the bittersweetness of life in just a few words. Not unlike The Beatles. I particularly liked \\"Sing\\", \\"Side\\" and \\"Flowers In The Window\\" for their philosophical and cautious overtones. Fran Healy seems to have a decent amount of insight and the perspective of a cautious optimist. When this is compared to what MTV and the radio typically throw at me, it stands out in a very good way. The only drawback to Travis, and this is minor, is that they don't vary their sound much throughout the disc. The same was true on \\"The Man Who\\". This is where they are not like The Beatles...yet. I mean early Beatles was repetitive, so Travis has time to grow into it. If you are looking for something thoughtful and catchy you could do much worse than buying this Travis cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, beautiful music!","review":"I would not say that this the album of the summer by far, but it is a pleasant diverson from all of the stuff that you hear on the radio day in and day out. Travis likes to create and play. It likes to create melodies that you just cannot help but enjoy. Although I do not think that this is as good as their previous effort, it is still worth owning. Lyrically, ehhhh? But musically, it is a beautiful landscpe. Great to drive to, clean the house or just simply lie down on the bed and drift off."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant Classic of Ingenious Sobering Sincerity","review":"Of the hundred albums that I have purchased this year, Travis's \\"The Invisible Band\\" is by far the best. There seems to be a greater level of comfort on this album among the band to just let it all out and spill their gutts to the world. This album is for the real people out there. It's about the music -- and nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous Meditation","review":"I was given this book which belonged to my husband's grandfather and instead of putting it on the shelf with other family heirlooms, I read through it a bit. Although this book was written during WW II for service men, I found it to be highly relational to me today. It includes Biblical passages to go along with each days meditations and deals with life as we still are living it. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking a meditation lifestyle. It can also be an excellent supplement to other meditations."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can this be 8 gauge?","review":"Look at the specs! 12.8 ounces, it says... My wire gauge chart shows 8 gauge stranded copper wire weighing at least 47.53 pounds per 1000 feet for the copper alone. That means 25 feet of 8 gauge wire should weigh 19 ounces, not including the insulation and spool. It just doesn't add up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 8 gauge as specified DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"I received the wire I ordered today and was very disapointed. My first clue of a bad purchase was the weight that UPS listed on the package. 2 pounds for a total of 50 feet of 8 gauge wire, get real. I have some real 8 gauge that I purchased from Lowes, it is twice the thickness of what I received. The pictures look deceiving because the thick clear insulation makes the wire look huge. The wire from Lowes is 3 times more expensive per foot, go figure it is twice as thick and made of real copper. I cannot risk burning down my RV so I will be going back to Lowes and buying the real thing. The only reason I did not buy 50' from Lowes to begin with was I wanted something more flexible which this wire definitely is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Candidate for Zero Star cateogry","review":"Each year amazon should have a contest for the worst product that deserves zero stars, and this could be a finalist i'm sure.As the other reviewer reported, the weight just doesn't make the grade for the gauge if it is real copper. Aluminum maybe, but not \\"oxygen free copper\\"Resistance measurements made with an Agilent 4 wire kelvin ohmemeter also show that it doesn't meet the spec for 8 ga wire. I trust Agilent T&M; gear - I don't trust this wire.Don't risk it - Don't buy it - Run - don't walk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TOTAL RIP OFF-","review":"There is no way that this wire could be rated as 8 guage. I wouldn't use this wire on a table lamp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy wire (NOT 8 gauge)","review":"I just got this power wire alonge with Pyramid's so called 12 gauge speaker wire and was disappointed in both. This is not 8 gauge wire (closer to 12 gauge)and there 12 gauge speaker wire is actualy about 16 gauge according to standard wire strippers. I do not recommend this wire ,it is way thinner than advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good power cable","review":"Great price on very adequate power cable. Seems to be true 8-gauge wire as well, unlike some products out there with double insulation to make them appear thicker. Running a Kenwood Mono Amp and Pioneer 4-Channel amp with this cable and both appear to be getting sufficient power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy","review":"I cannot rate this item because it was never delivered to my daughter in Orlando as I ordered. On June 25, I placed an order online and requested that I receive an e-mail confirmation. When an e-mail was not received, I called the company and was told it was sent. On July 2, I called because my daughter had still not received the item and was told to give it a couple of more days. On July 6, I again called and was told that it would be resent. Today is July 17 and nothing has been received. When I call the company, I feel like I am bothering someone and being unreasonable to expect that I receive a product for the money that was paid.

It has a somewhat sad expression and isn't the HIGHEST quality but it was pretty decent. I think the price has gone up a little since I originally purchased it though but I could be wrong. The main reason I wanted this specific plush was because of the size, you get the best bang for your buck with this lion. I needed to make an Aslan (Chronicles of Narnia) that was tied down with rope to a table made out to look like the stone slab for a party I was having and this held up really well.

Put simply, the book falls flat. The first half of the book develops the reader's interest by providing details about the war and the 2 principles. One awaits the promised intercourse, only to find that the potentially exciting 'magnificent dream' was a weakly presented proposal and that DaVinci and Machiavelli never had a meaningful interaction. Overrated, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling account of an unexpected contact between titans","review":"This is a beautifully written account of the meeting and connection of Leonardo and Machievelli which reveals facets of their lives and work heretofore unknown. It is based on punctilious and exhaustive scholarship and is given to the reader with warmth and clarity. It also underscores the practicality of Leonardo - who was after all a military engineer as well as remarkable artist - and Machiavelli who was an intense idealist about Florentine politics as well as a direct commentator on the human political condition.This is a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eyeopening","review":"An online clip of Mr Sirolli's talk gripped me, hence I bought the book - am still reading it.

This was the perfect replacement. It's made of a very sturdy, thick plastic. The width of the swing makes it so comfortable for her that it's hard to get her to come in for dinner! Installation was a snap. While it did not come with the clips that attach it to the swing set, we had some left over from her baby swing, so we just unscrewed that one and hooked up the new chains. I also love the blue poly coating on the chains - no pinched fingers!Great swing for a great price - highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing for toddlers!","review":"We had some flat-bottom swings for our swing set and my 3-year-old had trouble staying on them. This swing hugs her hips a bit, so she has no problem swinging in it. I'm sure it would depend on what swing set you have, but with ours the sing is just at the right height for her to get into it all by herself.

The seat is a pliable rubber/plastic that contours to my 3 year old's bottom nicely. It's nice and wide too so I can sit with him while he's on the Little Tikes tire next to it.The blue plastic on the swing arms means he won't get pinched. I prefer the carabiner-type connectors that the Little Tikes tire came with, but fortunately we had the \\"S\\" bracket from the old swing to attach. Once hung on the last rings in the chains on my play set, the height of the seat was at the small of his back, so he does have to grab the sides and hoist himself into the seat. That seems like the right height to me.We got this swing because our next door neighbors got one years ago and it has held up well through many Boston winters and hot muggy summers, not to mention their FIVE daughters!Very happy with this swing - see pic attached!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Replacement Swing","review":"We needed to replace a similar sling type swing that had gotten rusty and this fits the bill. It fit perfectly into the 14\\" wide hanger on our metal swing set. The chain is plenty long enough to use on short or tall swing sets. The chains are completely covered in plastic so the child cannot get their fingers caught in the links. The only disadvantage to these types of swings is keeping rainwater from collecting in the seat and causing dirt stains. But that is a minor complaint. Good durable product."},{"rating":"2","title":"best price around","review":"This is the best price I've found for this particular swing, which isn't readily available in stores.

However, last week my daughter and her friends were swinging, granted they were a little older weighing about 100lbs and the chain broke in two while the swing was in motion. There was considerable rust under the plastic coating. The swings that I had prior to these did not have a plastic coating and the chains did not rust. I do not think the quality of the chains used in these swings compares to prior models. I also do not think that the pinch free plastic coating is a good design, as it traps water around the chain and causes rust. I did inform Little Tikes of this failure and they were very prompt to investigate. I wonder if there might be a recall? Thankfully, the fall was not serious.

It was awful, but required. At the same time I was working the night shift in a psychiatric hospital. The book bears absolutely no resemblence to the real world of mental illness.If you have to read this book for a course, hopefully you will then move on to a more interesting and useful class.If you want realism, try Ken Kesey's \\"One flew over the Cookoo's nest\\". Everyone I was working with at the state hospital read this book, then the local college produced it. A lot of the patients were taken to see the play and they loved it. (This was before \\"patients\\" became \\"clients\\"). The movie gave me nightmares; I saw it after I left the hospital and it was too real. The mental health field has of course changed considerably since the 70's and a lot of those people are now out on the streets talking to themselves.Unfortunately Szasz is a classic theorist and this book will still continue to be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful characterization when you disagree with someone","review":"Didn't read it.

Thomas Szasz delves deeper into some historical truthes about this pseudo-science and gives a better view as to what psychiatry is. Never base your ideas on one book however, read up on both sides and form your own opinion on what is right or wrong. I can tell you that I will provide you with a roof over your head, a bed, 3 square meals a day, plenty of reading material to study, a chance to improve your physical conditioning and an opportunity to make lifelong friends and it sounds good right? Of course if I say that I am talking about prison, the luster seems to fade fast doesn't it...read both sides!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Have You Ever Been Experienced\\"","review":"I read an early edition when I was an undergraduate,studying Psychology and Philosophy manyyears ago.

There may even be aresurgence of this direction, given thepresent social and economic problemsin health care provision, though unrelated tothe substance of the medical arts.Dr. E. Fuller Torrey has a chapter devoted in hisbook \\"The Invisible Plague\\" 'Why is the Epidemic Forgotten'--THE MYTH OF MENTAL ILLNESS, where he reviews thelegacy of Foucault, Laing, Shatz, and other anti-scientificwriters on the brain, (p. 302).

I'm certainly glad this man wasn't around when I was a teenager defending my right to comit suicde based on my mood disorder. I can't imagine a more irresponisble book will be written.

Mississippi. Two teenage girls. Two young boys, ages ten and twelve. A fight ensues and one of the girls ends up dead. The community is outraged and more interested in revenge than justice. Why? The girls are white and the boys are black. Should that matter? Regardless, it does. French unapologetically drops the reader right into the times with all its prejudices glaring. It's impossible to avoid an emotional reaction to Billy. The grief of the families' losses, Billy's confusion about what's happening to him as well as what happened during the fight, and the blatant racism all serve to make the reader question whether things have really changed since 1937 or whether all that racism really just boiling under the surface searching for any excuse to break free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extrodinary Novel","review":"In the small town of Banes, Mississippi, ten year-old Billy Lee Turner awaits execution for the accidental death of fifteen year-old white girl: Lori Pasko. Young and afraid, Billy and the entire town, are affected by the incident and the consequence Billy must face. This extrodinary first novel sinks deep within the reader's mind with vivid characters and a powerful setting. Questions will arise about death, racisim, and class as the reader follows the sad and gruesome, yet everyday reality that Billy and the town face. This novel does not rest. This is one that will keep you reading, your emotions twisting and your mind racing with brilliant images and remarkable characters. Billy will effect you, no matter your race or class, and open your eyes to the reality that sometimes is too agonizing to confront."},{"rating":"2","title":"Albert French!","review":"Can't believe it's taken me until now to find him.

Angelique finally finds her lost love and husband of 15 years ago that she continued loving and yearning for through all the adventures and challenges she had to go through to survive.I love the whole series, the story is very imaginative, inspirational, has a strong female character, and it has history as part of the story. Wonderful romance and good character development.I understand that there are still 3 books to be translated from French into Spanish. The author is still alive but doing other things, so unless you and I learn French we may not have the opportunity to see what happens and how it ends.So, you are in for a good read if you like the elements I have mentioned.

It was too wide in the front. We only used it a couple of times but the company would accept no return if the packaging had been opened. (Huh, how do you know if it is comfortable if you don't try it?)For myself, I did not feel any comfort as the 'gel' was too firm for me.We would not recommend it for those reasons.

Attempted to contact seller with no response after one week. Amazon appears to use a number of Fulfilment Sellers for this seat so your mileage may vary if you have a problem.

If you have a problem you may not get support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"A bicycle seat is a rather personal thing; what works for one may not work for another. There isn't much that I can add that hasn't been already said. Personally, I find this seat to be the perfect upgrade to the original 10\\" stock \\"comfort\\" saddle that came with my 26\\" Ladies Cruiser. This seat is much better. It has a bit more cushion but is not soft by any means. I am 5'6\\" tall with a broad ladies backside and this seat is comfortable enough for me. I also like the fact that the brackets under the seat used to adjust the seat forward or back during mounting made the perfect place to hang my bike locks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat!!","review":"I had been looking to replace my bicycle seat for some time now because since I am a big guy, the stock seats that come on the mountain bikes are ridiculously uncomfortable and now that I am getting older, it doesn't seem like I have the padding on my butt that I used to. I received this seat as a Christmas gift and right away installed it on my bike. First time out and after making a few adjustments to the angle and height, this seat is truly wonderful! The only reason I don't give it 5 starts is because nothing is perfect in my eyes but this seat is real close. It still has the look of the type of seat you would find on a crossover cruiser without having that super wide look of the beach comber bikes. Great seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy tush!","review":"I didn't think that changing my saddle from a traditional sleek look to this would be my cup of tea but given the joy ofway less pain certainly makes up for any aesthetic misgivings!

I had a smallish seat on my commuter bike that was hard as a rock on my posterior. I figured a nice BIG cushy gel seat would solve my woes. I ordered this seat, and ... yes, I mounted it correctly and ... yes, I have the height and angle adjusted correctly. It's just as hard as the last rock, just bigger. It may hold more of my posterior, but it sure isn't any softer and for me it's, at best, only marginally more comfortable.If what you are looking for is a soft ride, keep looking.UPDATE: I'm actually downgrading this one more star. I just finished a second thirty minute ride today and it was brutal. I now not only think this seat is NOT more comfortable than my original saddle, it may be worse. What the hell happens when I have to ride two hours? I'm planning to re-install the original saddle and ride it for a day to compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big seat, big difference.","review":"I am new to riding so I'm no expert but, this seat makes it so much more enjoyable! Before I had to cut my rides short due to a very uncomfortable rear end. Now I can actually ride as far as my legs will pedal. The wider seat and thick padding seem to disperse your weight so your butt bones (for lack of better words) aren't taking all the pressure.

The seat post in this (new) cruiser model is a pivotal post with 2 chrome bolts; I thought I would be able to remove the Cloud 9's seat post clamp and mount the seat directly in the post by using the rails. (This is how the factory saddle seat is mounted.) No luck. The seat rails are set about 1/4\\" wider than my post will accommodate. No amount of clamping would bend the rails to fit. I guess this speaks to how robust the seat is.

They buy the seat, they want to believe it's better than the old seat, so they believe it is. I bought two of these, and neither of us liked it. I describe it like this:The discomfort usually felt on your bottom on a standard bike seat is reduced right in the center by the Cloud 9 seat, but it transfers the discomfort to the rest of your bottom. So instead of being sore right in the middle, I was sore across my whole butt. In addition to this, the extra wide seat rubs on the back of the legs while pedaling, making a very uncomfortable experience. There is a reason good quality bikes don't come with double wide seats: They restrict leg movement.The seats have giant springs which creak and pop as you ride.All in all, I wanted to believe this seat was an improvement, but I find myself wanting my old seat back.I'm returning both of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sliver lining to this cloud.....","review":"I don't feel this seat is any more comfortable than the stock seat it replaced.

I usually have no problem strectching the springs and padding as far as it will go. But not with this seat. With full weight on the seat, the springs only move slightly. The padding is firm but comfortable. This seat is on a K2 Big Easy Deuce with the stretch frame geometry. It is now the most comfortable bike I could ever imagine riding.If you are blessed with a larger than average frame and backside and you have tended to tax seats to their limit in the past, this could be the seat for you.

I don't have that with this saddle. I almost don't even feel the bumps.However- I may be returning it anyway. I'm 5'3\\" and have my seat post down as low as it goes. With the previous saddle, I could touch the ground on the balls of my feet- a little bit of a hassle, but not to bad. This saddle sits a lot higher though and I barely reach the ground on my tip-toes. This makes getting on and off and getting going after stopping for a light or traffic very difficult.

It's a good intro to the language as well, and is example-based in its coverage of concepts. After becoming frustrated with various reference books, I decided to look carefully for a book that would teach solid principles of OOP and also provide immediate experience in writing useful programs in Java. This book distinguishes itself by going above and beyond those requirements. The introduction to the emerging area of design patterns was inspirational. However, the book omitted treatment of Threads and Networking in favor of \\"miscellaneous\\" topics like RMI and JDBC, and particular applications that illustrate the principles of design patterns like Fast Fourier Transform and printing. Not a complete reference, but as an introduction to some very important software design concepts it cannot be beat by other books that try to cover the entire language."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Java book","review":"Even though the title emphasizes object-orientation as if Java were barely mentioned, the book is about 50% Java orientation.

Her voice had a quality similar to Patsy Cline's: deep and country, but a tone all her own. I think its a shame that she was dropped from the recording mainstream so quickly but pleased to know that she kept on singing and got to play concerts in Europe before her death in 2007.If you like pure,toe-tapping 50's rock and roll, this cd is for you.

Hardly","review":"Like a previous reviewer I was expecting this to be like the awesome Wanda Jackson comp, Queen of Rockabilly, but there is absolutely no comparison. Janis Martin has a fine voice, and since this was recorded in Nashville(at the Bradley Barn, I think) the musicianship is competent. What it is lacking is energy and enthusiasm. I don't get the sense that she even liked the material.It feels like she was just trying to make a few bucks off the new trend, as so many did, or being pushed in that direction by her label to move more units. Her biggest hit was My Boy Elvis. Therein lies the problem. She didn't seem to approach rockabilly as anything more than a novelty. She didn't have the fire and raw sexual energy that Wanda Jackson had(but then again, does anybody?). I do suspect that she was a fine country singer in a Patsy Cline mode, so if she did record anything like that I'm sure it's great stuff. This? Not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst","review":"I bought this CD, expecting it to be in the same league as Wanda Jackson. Unfotunately, this is not the case.

I bought this with Wanda Jackson's Queen of Rockabilly CD. I am thoroughly enjoying both. Janis Martin has a very smooth voice, less edgy than Wanda Jackson's. This CD is excellent and provides some great classic Rockabilly guitar sounds, and Janis' voice is just great. I'd definitely recommend this to Rockabilly fans. I personally prefer Wanda Jackson's Rockabilly style (a little more edgy and wild) to Janis Martin's, but both are excellent examples of women who knew how to rock and roll in the 50s/60s."},{"rating":"2","title":"good female rockabilly","review":"why does every other reviewer compare Janis Martin with Wanda Jackson? Do they expect her to BE Wanda Jackson? This is a good CD of rockabilly tunes by Miss Janis Martin, who was billed as \\"The Female Elvis\\", maybe because she had most of the same RCA studio guys backing her up on these recordings.

It covers the travels of four of the most prominent adventurers of the 16th century-- Cortes, Pizaro, Orellano and Cabeza de Vaca-- conquistadors whose exploits would be almost incredible, if not backed and fully documented in the history of the Americas. The book is well illustrated and is certainly not in the typical genre of a history text. As a matter of fact, it incorporates a sense of travelogue and unusual feeling of reality, because author Michael Wood actually retraces the steps of the gentlemen he writes about. The scenes are vividly described (and often illustrated) as Wood makes many discoveries himself. The book was later created as a PBS video."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be called : european bad - ethnic good.","review":"I give this 2 stars because Michael Wood states his opinion way too much. When I read history I want to read facts and make my own judgment about who was good and who was evil in history. In this book Wood constantly remindes us how bad europeans are and how good the Inacas and Aztecs must have been. This book is more about ethnic worshipping than about history. It still has some facts so that is why it gets 2 stars, otherwise it would be even worst. The author seems to relish every moment a european got killed, but bemoans every inca lose. Not to mention he tries to degrade every achievement the spanish accomplish.If you are a ethic worshipper with low self-esteem that has a reverse persecution problem, then this is for you.On the other hand if you are interested in history and making your own opinion about history, and if you have pride in being european then DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF TRASH.SO STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the book Weird History about the Aztecs","review":"I say this as in the book Weird History it is hardly mentioned at all that the Aztecs were cannibals. Here author Michael Wood frequently deals well with the fact that the indians under Montezuma indeed munched on human flesh regularly. Therefore, he does not make the Aztecs, or their society, desirable in any way. But even so he's far, far too kind all the same as well as sympathetic about these human eaters of human flesh as a judgement of a completely, absolutely negative one is appropriate for the Aztec society. Make no mistake people. The Aztecs were one of the world's three worst societies ever. Right alongside Stalin's USSR and Hitler's Germany.On another point:The bit about talking about how what if the Chinese had discovered the Americas instead is worthless, speculative nonsense and obvious racial butt kissing by the author.

There are didgeridoos & tanpuras, classic droning instruments from Aboriginal & Indian [of India] cultures. Tablas, violin, keyboard. There are many more, used to create something marvelous. I can't honestly say it's the MOST talented or brilliant album I have from this loose genre of music, but it is very interesting, & that is reflected in how well it sells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who writes these reviews?","review":"This production is not even in the same ball park as Loreena McKennitt.

Most of the songs are upbeat and sound great 40 years later, with a punchy horn section. The ballads are drenched in syrupy strings of the sixties, and those don't hold up so well.

Pacino's ruffled, passionate evocation of working-class Brooklynite Sonny--who riles the gawking crowd outside the bank with chants of \\"Attica!\\"--stands alongside his best work of the 1970s. The late Cazale, who played weak brother Fredo in \\"The Godfather,\\" is heartbreaking as Pacino's imbecilic partner-in-crime. Gritty, suspenseful, and superbly crafted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This movie was superb. It is about two men who rob a bank, but dont get out in time and the police come. Basicly the whole movie is the hostage takers negotiating with the police and planning their escape. Al Pacino looks very young in this, but still sounds the same. I would recomend this to people who liked the Negotiator and people who like Al Pacino."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of best films of all time.","review":"Many say its a terrible movie without a point. I say its the best picture of 1975. Al pacino gives his greatest performance ever. On a hot Brooklyn afternoon, two optimistic losers(Al Pacino and John Cazale)set out to rob a bank. Sonny(Pacino)is the mastermind, Sal(Cazale)is the follower, and disaster is the result. Because the cops, crowds and even the pizza man have arrived, the wellplanned heist is now a circus. The film stole 6 academy award nominations including best picture, director, and actor.. Its a shame the academy failed to even notice the performance that was given by Charles Durning. He gave the best supporting role of 1975. The street scenes are brilliant. The cinematography is riveting. The robbery should have taken 10 minutes. 4 hours later, the bank was like a circus sideshow. 8 hours later, it was the hottest thing on live TV. 12 hours later, it was all history. And its all true."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Film Is Tricky!","review":"Be careful when you watch this movie; it plays many tricks! Al Parchino yells \\"Attica\\" when they are in a bank trying to scare monies from the workers there. They eat pizzas and yell to each other with sweat but in the end, they trick you: he is shot in the head!! Also, the phones are silly, but fun - not tricky there!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Different Point of View","review":"Whereas I do admire Al Pacino's acting ability in A Dog Day Afternoon, the story just seems to drag on for too long for me to really like it. Too many odd ball incidents with the gun play and the burning of the bait money. Its almost a comedy of errors that made this incident just snowball to the point where a Brooklyn street corner became a media circus.Whereas I admire the loyalty of some of the bank employees, I just feel this unfortunate incident did not need to be dramatized into a movie. Also, the pacing of the movie is too sluggish for my tastes. However, I can see the depth of the characters in several of the scenes, therefore I'll instruct you to the make the choice between depth and the overall good taste of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pacino Classic!","review":"For those who love Al Pacino this I would have to say is one of his better movies. Pacino's role as a misfit bank robber is outstanding. He plays the part so very well and the acting is dramatic at times while Pacino's ignorance of being a bank robber provides some needed humor to a rather serious situation. Based of a true story Pacino is key to bringing this movie the punch it needs. How he handles people in the movie, his gestures and actions are Pacino at his best. Combined with the movie Serpico, I would have to say these are the best films by Al Pacino from the 1970's before Scarface in 1980. Any true fan of Al Pacino should have this movie in their collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!","review":"I think this was Pacino's best. Tons of action one of the best bank robber movies ever made i highly recommend it for all u movie go-ers. I bought it without seeing it and it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pacino's best performance!","review":"Though brilliant in The Godfather (I and II), Pacino's best performance of his career was in this film. In the Godfather films, there was a lot of talent all around him. In Dog Day Afternoon, Pacino carried the movie. Admittedly, he did have some help from John Cazale, who was terrific though understated.It's a great movie; a true classic. There have been lots of other movies about bank heists and hostage situations, but this is the king of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tension, great characters, acting","review":"DDA is one of the best examples of the 70's movies which explored 'taboo subject matter' in a nonexplotive way. A lot of great movies came out of this era. Everyone is great in it, not just Pacino. Even the actress who plays the bank worker who decides to stay with the hostages instead when given the opportunity to leave makes the most of her screen time. I originally saw this in a theatre when I was a kid and I'm surprised how well this movie holds up. The threat of violence creates the tension, unlike many movies today where guns and explosions pass as entertainment. Pacino's character is gay, yet he doesn't try to use stereotypical mannerisms. I would put this film in my top 30 for the craftsmanship and emotions it invokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Sexy\\" Dog Day Movie Night","review":"I was not one of those people who would've catagorized Al Pacino as someone sexy.In fact, I don't know if there are that many people out there who would find this movie sexy. But I have to say - after watching this movie, I became so enamored with his energy that I have fallen completely in love with Mr Pacino (in a bizarre one-way sort of way).The way he portrays himself as this \\"man-on-the-edge\\" was so \\"closet-realistic\\" in the at-times-bluntly-mundane society that even though he was technically performing a criminal act, it was simply impossible to not cheer for the bad guy.What can be more sexier than that??"},{"rating":"2","title":"ATTICA!!!","review":"I had always heard about this movie but never watched it.

Not much room is left in the main cabin (possibly for one or two filters?) The front pocket is large enough for a small digital camera (e.g. a Canon A95); side pockets are very small. Overall, the bag is large enough to hold my DSLR yet small and portable enough for casual city hunting.I have not have the chance to try the All Weather cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect little bag","review":"The item was exactly as described. If you are looking for a small, light weight camera bag (something to carry just your camera, and one or two lens) this is your bag. The bag is very well designed to protect you camera and comes with plenty of pockets to stash lens covers, instruction manuels, ect. For me, it is the perfect bag for a day trip. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"An enigma wrapped in tripe","review":"The Egan book is unconvincing -- and lacking in entertainment value -- from early on. I usually don't finish a book so poorly written, but a friend encouraged me to pursue to the surprise ending. I do not know why my friend is so taken with the finale (much less the middle) of the book, but it is worth a pass. The central characters are so unlikely and the situation so otherwordly that reader involvement is tough. One word to Ms. Egan on her stylistic choices: Quotation marks were created to help us discern exactly what words each character is speaking; use them. It matters for the reader to know if you are saying something, your character is saying something aloud or merely thinking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Keep is a Book","review":"Meh. I also recently read the other The Keep by F.P. Wilson. It's about Nazi's vs. Vampires: Egan's book is better, but only a little. Egan's book also more fantastical. Not because it may (or may not) feature ghosts, but because everyone in the book is a fantasy: rich 35-year-old who owns a castle... former rock-star meth addict... intellectual, romantic prisoner... and so on. Books like these are supposed to be high literature, but they are just as silly as the genre fiction and comic books read by, well, genre fiction and comic book readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Jennifer Egan is a terrific writer, as has been proven. The Keep is her masterpiece. Really a brilliant story told \\"Egan-Style\\" with duel narratives.

The author uses a scene play like way of doing dialog, seemingly to show the narrator's poor grasp of writing, it may not of been so bad in print, but as a recording it was impossible to ignore and ruined the audiobook.Example:Danny: blah blah blahHoward: blah blah blah,But as a recording it was \\"Danny, Howard, Danny, Howard, Danny, Howard, Danny, ... It was damned annoying.This was a very poor choice for an audiobook (as was switching the voice actor for the last few minutes)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting a M. Night Shyamalan type of Sixth Sense tale, but instead I received a tale that never fully developed. While I like stories that don't 'follow the rules' this book spent time traveling from genre to genre without giving the reader a reason to continue along without a guide.Go to the library for this one, it's not a Keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite sure how I feel about this book","review":"I am really torn between 2 and three stars, maybe 2-1/2? I was very excited to read this book, the description was exactly the kind of story I usually enjoy reading. It started off OK, then got better, then ended....I think I wanted more. I haven't read any of Jennifer Egan's other books, and if they are similar to this one, I don't think I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"This was one of those books that I had been intrigued by since it came out. I liked the idea of a good gothic novel, similar to the 13th Tale, instead I felt empty and cheated when I finished this book. The Keep, by Jennifer Egan, is not a very good book. There were so many different characters and plots going on; however, none of them were that good. I do not think there was one sympathetic character in this novel. There certainly was not one character that I cared about. There was one clever plot twist that turned this into a Two star book for me, rather than a One star novel. I would not recommend this book.I really am not even sure why the term gothic has been used to describe this book. Much less as a Tag. The only thing gothic about the book is that there is a castle. Heck, you can get that from a variety of novel. This is the worse book I have read sinceHawkes Harborby S.E. Hinton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Follow","review":"I purchased this book after reading a positive review in a magazine.

Of which they made a movie.Is this the same castle, country, evil which resides that Wilson developed?Did you even ask if you could build on his idea?"},{"rating":"1","title":"kept getting lost","review":"I felt this book jumped around way too much in the beginning. Then all of a sudden Danny was in jail. Up until then I wondered why he kept making comments on how the writing teacher had never been in prison but didn't understand. I must have missed something? When did he go to jail and why? At that point I got so frustrated that I just couldn't finish the book. It's too bad I really wanted to like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's On First?","review":"A keep is a fortified place or a stronghold at a castle. It is a safe place in case of danger. Each character had a personal stronghold or secret;a mental keep.This unusual book is two stories intertwined. One is the prisoner, Ray. He is writing a gothic tale about two cousins meeting in Europe to renovate a castle with a keep.His story, their story and his writing teacher's story knit into a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't be keeping this one","review":"I read an article about this writer a few months back---really expecting good things from this book. In fact, there seems to have been a lot of publicity from the lit. critics touting this one and I truly fell for it. I had this title on my list and finally got around to reading it.Firstly, the writing itself comes off as amateurish. No wonder people are saying it doesn't merit Fiction 101 or even high school creative writing class stature. That was the first shock.Secondly, the story itself is so implausible, and the premise never delivers, making your schlock gothic pulp read seem quite good compared to this. So sorry I believed the critics on this one. Which leads me to another thing--Egan must have some pretty impressive connections! How else can anyone explain the praise this so-so novel has received?So much better to be had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I read this book based upon an NPR interview and newspaper review. It was odd, bizzare, and a waste of time. I wish I hadn't kept wasting time waiting for it to 'get good,' it never did. I enjoy and appreciate different writing styles, but the weird \\"colon\\" approach to defining who is speaking, thinking, or being discussed, not only was hard to get past, but constantly reminded me I was reading a story and prevented me from becoming fully absorbed into the plot. When people say the book is 'weird,' I took that to mean \\"creepy-scary weird.\\" This book is just weird- odd, strange, hard to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The style is just too difficult","review":"The style of narration, ieHoward: Oh, man, look at you !Danny: Look at you!Howard: I don't know if I would have recognised you....is too annoying to read more than 40 or so pages.I can't tell you about the plot, the characters or anything else you might like to know, because the style bugged me too much to carry on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely 2 stars","review":"I read a lot of books, in almost every genre, but this book is one I wish I had not wasted any time on. I am shocked by the 5 star reviews. I do not wish to tell you the whole plot, as other reviewers do, but to give an opinion. There was one surprise/shock/twist in the story that allowed me to give it 2 stars, but beyond that, it is a mystery to me why the book was even written. It is so disjointed. None of the characters are even remotely likeable. The ending is pointless in every way. If you are really looking to read a good book, save yourself the time because this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can Keep it","review":"I just finished reading this book and was utterly disappointed.At the beginning of the novel, the story holds your attention because you're waiting for some sort of pay off. You want to find out how all of these characters and places fit together. Egan never delivers that to the reader. She leaves the reader hanging and feeling as if they just wasted their time and the money they spent on this book. Many characters are only developed on a surface level. Plot lines are put forth and never followed through on. The ending is far from brilliant; it's cliched and expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing..","review":"The Keep was a book I wanted desperately to love. I was terribly disappointed by it. I felt the writing was disjointed, and while I understand the author was telling multiple stories all at once, the jarring move from protagonists and writing 'style', left me feeling off balance.This jarring sensation kept me from really enjoying the story. Just as I was beginning to identify with character, the prose changed, and I was left to wonder if what I'd just read really happened...or if it was a fantasy of the prisoner's mind.I tend to enjoy books that are similar to this, in theme and tone, but this one just left me 'wanting'. I wish I had enjoyed it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I was in the middle of this book before I realized that it wasn't going to get any better, but I finished it anyway. Like other reviewers, I thought I would be reading a richly detailed gothic novel. Instead, I felt that the author set up all kinds of intricate themes that readers were supposed to \\"get\\", but forgot to write an engaging story around all of the themes. I have not read any of Ms. Egan's other books, so I'm not able to compare this to her other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmm....beautiful writing but---","review":"Well one thing's for sure: you won't forget this one in a hurry. It has some of the most exceptional prose, and beautiful language phrasing I've ever read. And it is actually QUITE scary, creeped me out sitting here alone reading at night and my cat jumping up beside me nearly made me flatline. I can't really be in danger of revealing the ending cause I'm not quite sure what it was. Which is precisely one of the reasons why you won't forget it any time soon cause it will drive you nuts trying to figure it out. I took one star away for my confusion on that point. A very fast read, entertaining, page-turning and amusing in equal parts. I don't want to appear stupid but would welcome points of view on the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleverness Can't Save This One","review":"Two stories, one novel, no real connection. A pair of cousins with a disturbing past come together to restore a ruined castle somewhere in Europe. Convicts take a writing class in jail. What do these two themes have in common, the problem is nothing. Like a previous reviewer, I read the whole thing hoping that it would mesh. Separately, either story line might have been promising, the combination made me feel schizophrenic. This book was possibly the most dissatisfying read of the year. I want a story line that I can follow, not tiresome mental calisthenics. Cleverness is no substitute for skill. I usually pass books on, in this case, I did a good deed and put this book in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the heck did that ending come from?","review":"This book has a promising start, a cop-out ending, and some tantalizing potential in between. It wasn't scary or creepy, despite promos to the contrary. It COULD have been creepy but it was superficial and the pace was rushed so it never got deep or dark enough to be scary. The technique the author used to run two narratives alternated between flowing beautifully and jerking painfully and transparently. I felt so manipulated by the ending! It was frustrating to get engaged in the parallel narrators only to have them fizzle out and get replaced by a character who is hastily developed in the last pages. Lots of lofty advance praise has been aired for this book and this has left me scratching my head. It's a disappointing book from a talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best thing about this book was that it was short","review":"I don't know what all the hype is about this story - you could guess the \\"secret\\" from the beginning. I really hate stories that I can see where it's going early on in the book. Also, the ending really wasn't an ending.As another reader mentioned, this book was a welcomed relief from the bloated books out there. Too bad it wasn't better."},{"rating":"1","title":"did I miss something?","review":"Wow, lots of raves for this novel which I found extremely disappointing. The author obviously has talent but I thought her intent was confused. I get that she was making a parallel between the prison and the castle but the plotting and action at the castle felt arbitrary and, in the end, sort of superfulous. Really, what did setting the action in this remote castle bring to the novel? A little atmosphere but hardly any suspense -- the one creepy and potentially suspenseful sequence (everyone getting trapped in the tunnels) is resovled in a matter of pages. I didn't believe the castle setting for a moment or the Baroness character. In fact, I assumed it was all part of Danny's paranoia/craziness but then the ending belied that. I was so hoping for a good, creepy summer read. After this and \\"The Ruins,\\" I give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a piece of s...","review":"This is a great waste of time. CONTRIVED with no literarary or even escapist values. I can't believe this reject from High School creative writing class got positive and extremely misleading reviews. What a WASTE in every way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I was very much looking forward to this book. I was highly disappointed after finishing it. It had the potential to be something great but Miss Egan decided to take the story in ten different directions and lose her reader completely. Please don't waste your time with this campy and confusing piece of fiction.It had, by far, the worst ending to a book I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a TURD!","review":"This book sucked on so many levels. Total and complete disappointment. I would turn around and sell it on Marketplace, but the pages fell out........that should have been a sign.....Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of set up, no pay off","review":"Or rather, one pay off. But after a couple hundred set ups (ghost twins, halucinatory sex, some underlying importance to the place that no one ever names, Howie's physical changes, on and on and on and on....)I was hoping for one or two clever answers.I bought this one after having read a well crafted and creepy tale (The Harrowing by A Sokoloff, Balantine Books) and was in the mood for more.Unfortunately, the cover was the only lasting gothic thing in the book. I gave it two stars primarily because the set-ups were somewhat promising. Just don't read past them expecting any resolution.Total waste of my time, and precious paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish and disjointed","review":"The tightest writing is the two-word title, which got me to buy the book. From there it's downhill. Egan's incredibly sloppy prose nearly insults the reader. The story-within-a-story-within-a story feels like a cop-out. It's not quite \\"and then he woke up\\" -- but almost. Despite the intricate plot mechanications, nothing much happens. That's partly because her main characters are drugged or being operated on so much of the time. Such cheesey devices echo the worst of episodic television. How this book got an agent and got published is anybody's guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"Can't believe I wasted my time on this one. I really wanted to like this book...and I even tried to like it. The first part of the book was good, but then it fell apart toward the middle and it was a chore to keep on reading it as it became just so plodding with nothing happening except for the ramblings of the unlikeable main character, Danny. The ending picked up a bit, but had a disappointing conclusion. On the whole, it was mildly interesting, but did not really come together for me. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential wasted","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with those reviewers who said that this book had a great concept that was poorly executed and not developed. I had high hopes for this book, but as I read, I kept waiting for the author to connect the separate plotlines and characters. Although a connection was made toward the end, it felt contrived. The book does not tie up loose ends, but kind of trails off; there is no real \\"ending.\\" If you're looking for a great book with an unpredictable twist, I highly recommend \\"The Thirteenth Tale,\\" \\"Fingersmith,\\" or \\"The Stolen Child\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting...but just barely","review":"There never seems to be a reason for anything that happens in the story, and none of the characters inspire anything but contempt or apathy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is too short","review":"I can't imagine how this book got published. The Keep is on the level of people who write stories ending in \\"it was all a dream.\\" I kept trying to make sense out of it and failing. Also, the characters are indistinguishable or pale away to nonbeing. I am now annoyed with myself for having given any time to trying to make sense of it. Read William Gibson if you want something like this that is also clever and somehow says something about our world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy, and REALLY interesting!","review":"I loved this! Gothic, meta, ghosts, weird, disturbing, what's not to like? Unfortunately, either I was too stupid or Egan didn't tie enough loose ends together to finish her meta-fiction, and literary thoughts. I gave it four stars because of the journey of the story and the delightful atmospherics (man, this book can CREEP you out!) but it ends either too soon, or chapters should have been added to end certain plots within plots within plots (too open-ended). However, WHAT a puzzle-box of a start and middle! I think this would be an EXCELLENT book for writer folks to bounce off of! This is such a playful book, it has caused me to completely reassess the only other book of Egan's that I read. If she is in reality such a playful, cynical but loving, meta-fictional writer, I like her much better. But damn! Why didn't she cook this book a little more thoroughly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"The story started out great and I was really excited to get into it, but then the story kept changing focus and characters, it was almost like the author was trying to put 3 stories into one novel. Too bad, the original concept was a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"This novel by Jennifer Egan was a good read--stayed up to finish it. A strange, gothic sort of story. You keep thinking you know how things are going to go, but you don't. At the beginning I expected it to be just creepy, but finally it was almost anti-creepy.Look forward to reading more of Egan's stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain disappointed","review":"Really really loved Look at Me but this just doesn't cut it. I didn't care for the characters, and found the layered storytelling frustrating. The castle passages just felt trite and the relationship between the two cousins is not fleshed out. I wish she had just stayed in the castle, with a little backstory and some more original detail. Sorry, I really wanted to like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The keep","review":"The writing is good but I did not like the story. Too much psycho babble and unbeliebable story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect, brilliant book by one of the best writers out there","review":"I had always stayed clear of THE KEEP for some reason. Turned off by the idea of a gothic novel, I think. But I loved GOON SQUAD so much that it made me revisit all of Egan's books. THE KEEP is now my favorite of hers, and one of my favorites of all times. It is so wildly brilliant and strange and gripping. The characters are vivid and flawed. The structure of the book is perhaps its greatest triumph. Without going into too much story detail, if you even kind-of liked GOON SQUAD, then I beg you to pick up this book! You will be blow away by Jennifer Egan's talent and versatility."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real page turner!!!!","review":"I actually saw this book at the library and picked it up because I thought the cover looked interesting. I read the jacket and decided to check it out. Wow I'm really glad I did. Rarely do I read a book without first checking out the reviews on amazon. I actually couldn't put the book down once I got about half way through. It's a great read. I will definitely read more of J Egan's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was SUCH a disappointing book.","review":"As other reviews have said, this book had many interesting aspects to work with: the baroness, dead twins, the history of the castle and surrounding towns, the fractured relationship of the two cousins, a cellmate who listens to the dead. It all ends up being completely dropped for...the uninteresting story of a secondary character in a secondary tale. The author's other books are apparently popular, but I'm not sure I'll give them a chance after the disappointment of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely useless","review":"This thing builds up VERY LITTLE air pressure, and what air pressure it builds up requires you to pump it down VERY fast. It does not build as you push down slowly, in fact it does nearly nothing if you push it down slowly. It barely makes good contact with the sink I'm trying to push a clog through, and if you're not careful and you pull it back up TRYING to make it work it squirts water all of you and random stuff from the top of the shaft. Complete crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Not effective. You end up trying to get a good seal on the drain and trying to effectively plug the overflow hole while pushing the handle down. It makes enough pressure to blow the plug/tape off the overflow hole if you get a good seal on the drain. Despite my skepticism about other reviews that said as much, I found myself needing another hand. It would have eventually cleared the sink by spitting it all on me, but that's about all it did well. I tried it on several clogs, it never failed to be useless.If you have a sink with a single spout directly over the drain, its nearly impossible to use.Fell apart the second time I tried it. It looks to be held together by rivets, but they are actually pins that are held in place by friction only. I recovered the pin and put it back, but I would have to glue it to keep it there. It wasn't worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than useless","review":"Buying this plunger was a waste of time and money. This plunger did not force water or air into the pipe. The air went up into the tube and out the sides. After several tries, I still had a clogged toilet. If there is some magic trick, I would suggest the manufacturer include it in the directions. The existing directions did not help solve the problem. I ended up returning it to Lowe's and buying a simple plunger that worked like a charm. I seem to be the lucky one that did not end up with a face full of feces like some of the other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO stars","review":"This is the worst product I've bought in my memory. It doesn't even work as well as a regular plunger. I feel scammed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe on some drains","review":"Just bought this today at Lowe's. Plugged up our new toilet yesterday with too much paper, and tried our old-fashioned plunger and some tricks I saw on the web (e.g., dishwashing soap and hot water). Nothing worked. I figured I needed a plunger with a larger diameter (for our new low-flow toilet with the odd-shaped outlet hole). This device looked impressive, and the rubber piece seemed to be wide enough. It wasn't, though, and I couldn't get a good seal, so I just ended up squirting a pathetic amount of water around the bowl. Fortunately, while I was at Lowe's, I also picked up a toilet auger...just in case. After the Plung-It failed, I resigned myself to learning how to wrestle with the auger. Much to my surprise, the auger had the toilet cleared in about 5 minutes. The Plung-It may be fine for tub and sink drains, so I'll keep it. It just doesn't work on at least one new-model toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This product is not effective. I have a clogged toilet and traveled almost an hour to pick this up. I should have saved my time and my money, I wasted both.This product does not seem to be any more effective than a standard plunger. My toilet is still clogged, this plunger sprays dirty water around where the plunger handle connects. Not effective at all. If I could take it back, I would. I feel the manufactorer cheated me out of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete junk","review":"I bought this hoping to remove a stubborn toilet drain. Trying to use it, I noticed problems quickly.* I pinched myself hard following the instructions (enough to create a painful blood blister). The instructions ask that you hold it with one hand and pump with the other. The way it's designed, it's natural to position your hand to pinch it.* It took several pumps to finally feel like it was grabbing water. But then toilet water started coming out the handle and dribbling onto my other hand.* After a few tries, I tried making the pumps longer. But if you pull the pump out all the way, a bunch of toilet water sprays all over the place (including on you). None of these problems were warned about in the instructions.In the end, the clog remained. This thing feels poorly designed, and it doesn't seem to work any better than a regular plunger would. Don't waste your time on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than An Ordinary Plunger","review":"I recently bought this item as a last resort for my shower drain. It's been gradually getting slower and slower, even at times totally plugging up. I've tried every drain opener (and natural enzyme) product on the market, and also used a regular plunger, to little effect. Very annoying taking a shower while standing in water up to the ankles. This plunger, however, succeeds where nothing else has for me. When I get in the shower and turn on the water, I operate the plunger a few times, then stand back to watch the water begin to drain freely -- no more standing in water while showering! Just press the plunger down firmly over the drain to form a seal (using one of the two provided heads), then pump the handle up and down like a bicycle tire pump. This forces air (and hot water) down into the pipe, driving out clogging material. So simple, but it really works for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than a regular plunger","review":"To my surprise this thing was messier and less effective than just a regular plunger. The included rubber base is too wide to form a good seal, and there is an air hole near the handle that sprays out nasty toilet air and water directly into your face/hands. The force generated by the air pump is also kind of unremarkable. I'm taking it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Bathroom sink has been draining slow for several months.

Is is set at the time of the Emperor Constantine and his manipulative mother Helena, who is the power behind his \\"reign\\". Claudia the leading character is Helena's spy. She is heavily involved with one of the foremost gladiators in the city and he has become the subject of a heavy betting syndicate who are attempting to manipulate his fights in the arena to their advantage. The book is full of the savagery and violence that is well documented for that period of history. Paul Doherty seems to be able to turn his hand to any period of history, be it Rome, Ancient Egypt or Medieval England. This is as good as any of his recent books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Trick","review":"I had to write after the review with the \\"spoiler.\\" Firstly, a person that gives away secrets to a trick shouldn't be doing magic in the first place. Now, the trick is a solid trick that many people speak about, especially if they've been to Vegas. I've worked at a magic shop for a few years and it is a good trick to do when properly practiced. It's a great visual and the fact that you can hand the card to the spectator is especially effective because it can be done with any card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the inexperienced magician","review":"It sounds good, it looks good, but it will take a lot of practice to perfect.

This trick disappointed me when I opened it up. It is horrible for it's price. It comes with instructions, VERY bad \\"invisible\\" thread, and wax thats supposed to be breakable.

Well written and enjoyable to read about this great golfer and fine and gentle man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Very Good Remake","review":"I was very skeptical about this movie to begin with, not because of the cast. The casting was perhaps the only good thing. It seems like these highly talented actors were misplaced in the wrong movie. And they didn't seem to be having fun in it either. The Honeymoners is an ancient show to begin with. A remake given it's proper due of this series is pretty difficult material to tackle. To make it funny for today's audiences seems next to impossible regardless of what ethnic group or race the actors are. It's just not as funny as it once was. It would be the same as some director doing a Three Stooges remake. Some things just shouldn't be done over or dug up again. In regards to this film. It would've helped if it was funny. The audiences of today have high expectations often to a fault. I tried to like this movie though and Cedric the Entertainer is very talented and funny when he is given decent material to work with. This unfortunately wasn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"black and white","review":"i know everyone says \\"i'm not racist\\". to say it or not to say it has nothing to do with this review. if you are going to remake something, be historically correct. don't remake sanford and son with an all white cast. don't make the honeymooners with an all black cast. we will all be happier, black and white. and by the way i loved sanford and son, saw every episode, and i am white. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANTOINETTE NEEDS A CRACK REFILL!!!!!!PRONTO!!!!!!!","review":"the girl has lost her mind(did she have one in the first place?!?!?!?)HEY,'NETTE,THE MOVIE TANKED BECUASE IT STUNK!!!!!!IF YOU FEEL YOU NEED TO CREATE EXCUSES FOR IT ONLY SURVIVING 1 DAY IN THE THEATERS,THEN HAVE AT IT.AND WHAT YOU FAIL TO REALIZE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME OF US HERE WHO ARE WEALTHY.AND FURTHERMORE,THE REVIEWS A MOVIE GETS(GOOD OR BAD)MAKES A DIFFERENCE!!!!!!DUH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!MAYBE A REMAKE OF SANFORD AND SON SHOULD DO BETTER?!?!?!?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"To the Moon Alice","review":"I was greatly disappointed by this movie.

The movie didn't stay true to the original as it should be...instead they turn it into this ghetto version. The Diary of A Mad Black Woman was much more interesting and funnier than this movie. Especially Madea...hee hee. :( And Ralph didn't even say his famous line \\"One of these days, Alice....POW!\\". I was looking so forward for him to say that but he didn't. The only famous line he said was \\"Baby, you're the greatest\\". And the movie seem pretty stupid. I don't really recommend it others to watch it. I should have watched another movie. Maybe Madagascar would be more funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Truely Terrible","review":"I went to see this movie with my cousin, as he likes Cedric The Entertainer, and I find him ok. I went into the movie not expecting much, and walked out with only one thing on my mind: \\"What a peice of crap\\"! I mean, this movie wasn't even funny. Who ever greenlighted this garbage wasn't thinking clearly. And, to make matters worse than the terrible reviews and the even worse box office, they bring out this PG rated edition. Now I'm not complaining because I wasn't gonna buy this movie in the first place. I'm just saying that even the DVD sales are going to do terrible now. They just butchered the original show right in front of our eyes so that we'll never think of The Honeymooners as the delightfully fun TV show, but rather the horrible boring movie. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad idea","review":"I have nothing against remakes in general, but this one was a total washout. I really enjoy Cedric The Entertainer and just about anything he does, but this just didn't do it for me. Some of my favorite actors are black: Samual L. Jackson, Morgan Freeman, Forrest Whitacker, Ice Cube, Danny Glover. I can go on and on, but this was not the movie for the main charcters to be black. It just didn't do the same thing as back in the 50's. What the heck were they thinking? It was lacking, like remaking all those spaghetti westerns and using Jack Black as a fill in for Clint Eastwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"OKAY MOVIE.

Since most remakes or \\"tribute\\" films of venerable television shows are not successful and because this movie received such poor reviews, I did not see it until recently. The poor reviews are not justified. This film captures the essence and spirit of the immortal show and does so with its overall theme of working class people trying, usually unsuccessfully, to \\"make it\\". The references and insertion of scenes and dialogue evocative of the classic are well done and very well placed in the script. This cast studied the original and got it right. This film is a rarity - one worthy of the classic it emulates. Perhaps you had to be there at the time the original was made to know how well this film works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"This was dreadful.

All I can say is \\"Why?\\" I thought the original, black and white, fifties version of the show sucked, and even my favorite actors can't redeem it in a movie version. The original show was horrible then; this movie is horrible now. Why Ced and Mike Epps and Gabby didn't try and put their immense good looks and talent into another vehicle I'll never know. But oh well, at least we have two of the three in \\"Cadillac Records\\" and two out of three ain't bad.By the way--I can agree with the reviewers who said that maybe the color lines shouldn't have been crossed.

Day does a poor job of explaining the material, and furthermore, his CD is poorly done. He does not enter most of the formulas, but rather he hard coats his numbers. This makes it just about impossible to follow what he is talking about in his book as the reader must somehow come up with the formulas that he is describing on his own. Day does a great job of protecting his models from being copied as no one would want to recreate the formulas he is using, but in doing so, he prevents the reader from learning. If you are looking for a good book on financial mathematics, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Execellent Book for any Learner","review":"I used this book to help me understand the complex nature of excel. This book is a topical guide that walks you through step by step many subject basics. As the book advances, the less stepping stones are given. Because the author removes these 'stepping stones' it requires the user to develop thoughts and arrays within their own mind. Much of Excel is a self taught program, as professional users claim, that still truly challenges the Masters of Excel all over the world. The author was very helpful when I was deep in trouble. Courteous, timely, and acurrate. The best purchase you'll ever make.-Dean Prinsloo"},{"rating":"2","title":"financial math using excel","review":"Book does and excellent job in showing how to apply financial formulas in excel.

The author's major contribution is showing how to organize the model layout so that inputs, calculations and model outputs can be easily seen and changed saving time and decreasing model errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"One version of the truth","review":"This book is crippled by a couple of factors, including the author's fetish for mocking Arnold's accent about twice a page. More seriously, no one close to Arnold cooperated in its writing (a fact that the author acknowledges and laments.)That understood, however, the books does offer a compelling version of Arnold's rise to prominence first as a bodybuilder and then as an actor.

Instead, it's an \\"ALL or NOTHING\\" proposition. Your frame will display EVERYTHING in its memory, or nothing - there is no control whatsoever. SO, if you want to change what is shown, you have to change the memory card or the internal memory (translate - connect and disconnect from your computer) every single time. Not very smart. It would have taken very little to let you go through the menu and select which folder of photos it should display. Also, the buttons are not intuitive at all, and the manual is almost useless. The quality of the image however, is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"I read everyone's comments before purchasing this. I am happy that I did. Using the buttons are easy and looking at the frame from the front all the buttons work properly, I don't even have to flip it over. I also like how clear and crisp the pictures look. I tried connecting it to my computer but I have a little problem. So for now I just select the pictures right from my memory card in my camera which for me works just fine!

I found this only applied to older photos that I scanned and not ones I downloaded from my camera.Over all this is a good product, and I am please with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Frame, Excellent Price","review":"First things first, the picture in this frame is beautiful. The 720 x 480 resolution and rich color display of this frame beats the earlier generation digital picture frame I have hands down. The display and the price are this frame's strongest attributes, and more than outweigh its negatives. The picture frame's interface can be a little klunky (for lack of a better word), but that characteristic certainly isn't unique to this frame. The software that comes with the frame has been panned in earlier reviews, and, while it is far from robust, it seems to get the job done. The picture frame obviously doesn't have some of the features of higher-end frames (Wi-Fi, etc) but since I bought this for my wife to take to work, that really isn't an issue. One feature that it does have that would be useful in her case is the ability to automatically turn on/off at certain times. To sum it all up, as I said in the title, this is an excellent digital frame at an excellent price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Time Problems with Macs","review":"Bought this as a Christmas present.

The videos directed by Nigel Dick are for the most part the least interesting of the lot, with the visuals and content generally not matching the quality of the tunes, while the early videos from \\"The Hurting\\" album stand up the best. \\"Mad World\\", \\"Change\\", and especially \\"Pale Shelter\\" are terrific songs and videos.

Admittedly, the scope of the book is vast, but I can't help feel that the approach to most topics is far too cursory for the book to be more than a reference to other works.I was very disappointed with chapter 3, \\"Spectrum Modelling Approaches\\" as it not only was a terse white-wash of spectral synthesis techniques, there were multiple instances of unfounded criticism for the rich field of spectral signal processing and its growing constituency of pracitioners.

Not really motivating to keep on practicing the 5 rites...How come the seem to work miracles for others but dont produce any results for me??????????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Secrets - Nothing Unusual","review":"The book leads you on a bit that the secrect of youth is going to be revealed and really , except for the spinning rite, the others are forms of yoga exercises, stretches or isometrics which you can find in any good yoga exercise book. There is a section on giving up sex and rechanneling that energy, if you want to. The lost chapter is just about making affirmations. The spinning is the only thing fairly different (Tibetan Whirling Dervishes), although I have done it in a yoga class. Since the rites/exercises are easy, I plan to do them, just in case the combination just happens to be the fountain of youth. The book's value is that it is small, though wordy at times, and it puts together a program you can do easily and quickly and will be of some value to your body and mine and which could become a nice habit/ritual to stay with \\"forever.\\" It could also make an interesting gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction or Non-fiction?","review":"The book offer some great yogo movements that I'm sure can be beneficial, but has anyone applying the program as Mr Kelder outlined ever turned back the clock?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very shallow and non-informative.","review":"The exercises in this book are similar to yoga except they are too strenuous for anyone and can hurt spine or knees if an individual has joint problems.

It's just another exercise book. The only difference is it ties in to spiritual stuff. The main audience for this book are people who like all that chakra/astral vibration jazz. Not for people who want practical advice because the author can't seem to stay \\"earthbound\\" but has to talk about yoga culture ideas whenever possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth: Book 1","review":"Anyone who has wondered about the secrets of youth should do well by reading this book and focusing on a new reality inside the human body: the power of our vital glands. In the East, these are called \\"chakras\\" and they are thought to be energy-producing and energy-absorbing centers. The story, the exercises, the advice, and the claims posted by many people on the strength of tangible results, should not be overlooked. Simplicity here, is the key to an awesome power which lies within ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Start","review":"There exactly two good things about this book.1. The first part of it is written in a adventure type storey book fashion that will get interested and excited to do the exercises.2. For the subject matter it claims to cover it is complete within it's small range.The truth is there is quite a bit more to Hatha Yoga and Sufism and Tibetian Yoga and some of the other arts this book is based on, but it gives what it claims which are 5 Rites or Body Positions that are designed to keep your body healthy and energetic long after the normal time period.Probably the best part of this book is that it, for some, will peak your interest to looking into books that detail the arts this book is based and thus expanding your knowledge and reaping the many subsequent rewards.For any beginnner a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will change your life....","review":"\\"This book has changed my life\\" is what a client of mine said after she had done the Tibetan Rites (the \\"Rites\\") three months. She is an elderly woman, in her high 70's with arthritis, overweight. Her arthritis is almost gone, she has lost 22 lbs. without changing her diet. Now I don't know what will happen once you do the Rites two years, which is what the Colonel recommended. But in my opinion, I suspect you will be surprised. If you do the Rites correctly, and that includes focused intention and deep breathing, it will change you spiritually and therefore change your life. I live in DC and teach these classes. But you can just do them. Give them your best effort and you will see results."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still think this is a very good book!","review":"I have owned this book for a while now, and I have to say I still think is a very good one. Although my intention here is not trying to convince people to get it or anything of the sort, I can say that it helps, and together with a very complete program of relaxation and exercising (which inlcudes different teachings), it has helped me deeply.Although many people claim different things, I can only say it's a very good program, but do not expect magic tricks, strange sudden power or anything like that: it all comes from within.I am happy with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the hype","review":"Someone on these reviews said, don't believe the hype. I'm telling you that this book works. This is what happened when I started the rites: After a few days, I noticed a rush of energy. Then I started feeling strong. Within a week and a half, I noticed that my pants were getting loose around the waist, partially due to the fact that my craving for sugar and fats was dissappearing. Then I noticed that color was returning to my face after 3 weeks. After a month month and a half, wrinkes were less noticable? Then I noticed that my hair was coming in dark at the roots. Amazing. I am going to stay with these rites. One other thing. The book is advertised at \\"5 Tibetian Rites\\", but there is a 6th rite, possibly the most important that caps off all the other ones......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth","review":"This book has been aound along time and I used to have a copy of it and lost it.

Lower back pain, neck pain, muscle spasms, weight loss and general stress. I did the exercises 2 times a day for 4 to 5 months. I never got any good results so I stopped doing them.I read all the testimonals of the great relief from various problems and am unsure why it hasn't helped me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to be helping with my allergies","review":"I have been doing these excercises for about 3 months, and I have noticed a distinct improvement in my allergies. Prior to beginning these \\"rites\\", I experienced annoying and regular (year round) sneezing and watery eyes. The difference has been staggering; it used to be I couldn't leave the house without antihistimines and half a box of Kleenex, now I very rarely sneeze, never have watery eyes, and can breathe fully, clearly, and comfortably through my nose. I can't think of anything else to attribute these differences to. I know it sounds odd, but the improvements have been tremendous."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it...","review":"I don't know if this program is going to turn me into a 22 year old again, but I find the exercises worth the 5-10 minutes a day to do. They help promote flexibility and strength.I know that the 5 Tibetan Rites are supposed to line up my Chakras. I don't know a whole lot about Chakras, but I do know that the 5 movements stressed in this book have been a good addition to my daily physical fitness plan.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original recordings, barely country","review":"This CD offers original recordings of most of Gibson's late 50-ealrly 60 hits. Mostly unavailable, if you are a Gibson fan this makes it worth buying. The CD chronicals Gibson's attempts to immitate his 'Blue Day' and 'Lonesome Me' sound through many songs. Sadly, much of this comes across as shallow albumn filler. DO NOT BUY THE HICKORY - CURB OFFERINGS UNDER GIBSON'S NAME. These are re-recordings, always inferior, of his early hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"I caught Scott Williams playing back in 2006 when I was at Disneyland in California.

This author has no real academic credentials and is strangely intent on proving some kook-ish theories. In fact, Hebrew is just one of many very similar Northwest Semitic dialects that happened to survive because more of it was written down. It has no particular pedigree, and certainly not one that could justify the author's worshipful approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I loved the shoe and the price. I thought the shoe was different than my normal style but loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"After struggling with the swimming leg of triathlons I purchased this book and the accompanying Freestyle Made Easy DVD and committed to trying the Total Immersion approach to swimming. After two months of Total Immersion drills my swimming has improved dramatically. I now swim (literally) twice as fast as I did before starting the program while expending about the same amount of energy. I've never used any training program for any sport that improved my skills any where near as much as the Total Immersion approach improved my swimming.The book is well written and easy to follow but I found that I also needed the Freestyle Made Easy DVD to fully understand how the drills should be done. Buy them both, they're a bargain at twice the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of good info.... but","review":"This book has lots of good info, and will change the way you swim, but it can be really confusing. He seems to say way too much about nothing. Really, just get the video. The book rambles on and on and on, but the video you can just see what you need to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swim drills","review":"True, you may need the dvd as well to complement the book. But I bought freestyle/backstroke drills dvd instead of Terry's, so, some terms differ. Maybe I'm a tad slow - had to watch the drills dvd over and over (wondering what am I supposed to feel), plus a quick scan through the book, to understand. Dvd demonstrates how to execute the technics whilst books explains the whys better. No such hope for TI swim workshop here in my country. Started to do the drills comfortably now and hope to improve my speed soon. Never thought I could ever do bilateral breathing, but taking it slow and focusing, surprised myself that I could - 2 weeks, you say? As the book says, the key is to improve technic, not to swim harder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth getting","review":"I purchased this book because I was about to do my first triathlon ever, and I had no idea how to swim properly. I also purchased a total immersion dvd, and although I think you can get by with just the dvd, I recommend getting the book as well. The book offers a lot of insight into why the author wants you to do specific exercises, and it's definitely worth reading. Between the book and dvd, I was able to get through an olympic and half-ironman distance triathlon. The only shortcomings of these products is that they offer almost no instruction on proper breathing and kicking your legs, two things that I ironed out in a swim lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"This was a xmas gift for my husband. Growing up in DC at that time minute was great. He enjoyed watching Petey Greene very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for rough cuts but watch how you use it.","review":"I have used this guide often for ripping sheet stock with a circular saw. However, do not expect accurate cuts from this, especially when you are making 8' rips. The guide flexes WAY too much toward the middle. It has little to do with the connector. The guide is just not substantial enough to resist flexing. If you put any pressure against it with your circular saw (as one tends to do when using a tool guide), you will have a cut that bows outward in the middle on one piece, and concave on the other piece.I have recently retired this guide for more expensive and more substantial all-in-one clamp and tool guides that do not flex.Bottom line, if all you need is a quick and rough cut, this is a handy tool. But if you demand a straight cut, pay more money and get a tool guide that resists flexing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Straight","review":"I have tried three of these straight edges now and they all have a bend at the joint. I examined the last one with a machinist's square and found that none of the corners are square. I can cut a better right angle on my table saw. If you want two 4 ft straight edges it will work fine. You will have to have an 8 ft straight edge to hold the two 4 ft sections against while you clamp them together to make this device straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnson Level & Tool J4900 98-Inch Aluminum Cutting Guide","review":"Not able to use it! When it arrived the 'C' clamps and screws for the extension were missing. It states right on the packaging that it includes 2 'C' clamps and 4 screws.

I would say, for the amount of time spent on this video, the author didn't cover enough or at least didn't give enough examples. He took too much time repeating the same phrases during his lecturing (which wasn't necessary, since it's a video that people can rewind, when they miss something), so the time he ended up wasting could have been used for more examples. I wouldn't recommend this video for calculus learners, because there are many free ones on youtube that are far better, and well explained for clear understanding. If the price for this video was $15, then I would say it's not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"No nonsense, systematic approach.","review":"I suggest that these DVDs be used by high schools and universities so that the students understand the basics in a clear and concise way without being confused. This set will give you the basic tools that will enable you to reason and explain to yourself and others as to why you should use a certain approach to solve a given problem. You will not have to rely on your memory because it will all make sense to you.In closing I would say do not fear Jason Gibson's DVDs are here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tutoring for Calc 1 NOT 1& 2","review":"I highly recommend this tutor's Algebra, Trig, Physics, and Calc DVD sets. The calculus set, like the others, gives one a no-nonsence step by step tutoring in Calculus 1. I just love the fact that there is no annoying music and condescending skits to side track you (unlike other DVD math products). All you get here is a white board and a guy churning away example after example that really brings home the point.One caveat. This set does not include Calc 2 - at least not the Calc 2 that I took back in 1972.Excellent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic","review":"I bought this product thinking it would bring my calculus to a higher level. It didn't. The product covers the most basic examples which you can follow in your text if you are taking a class which would be the main reason you buy this DVD. This product was not helpful in doing the higher number problems at the end of the chapters let alone the problems on tests which require insight and creativity. This is the most basic of explanations of Calculus which most people should be able to follow in each chapter of their text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the price - definitely worth buying.","review":"I have a few DVDs on Calculus but this one is the best.

There are much more helpful and specific videos for free on the internet... check youtube."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"I bought this DVD for a business math MBA class I am in that heavily uses differential calculus. I learned nothing from this DVD and I'm not sure how anyone could. Ok, it defined a derivative. It mentioned the chain rule. But there are five other rules needed to calculate most derivatives (constant function, power function, sums and differences rule, product rule, quotient rule). This did not show me how to look at the problem and know how to solve it. Luckily we've moved on to statistics in the class, so there's still hope of me passing it, but the calculus part was a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware on Delivery - No Seller Responses","review":"Ordered late August.

This DVD is a good tool to assist in the basic concepts. Nothing can beat an interactive classroom experience, but this could be a close second.Note: The DVD is not gonna get upset if you keep repeating a section until you can comprehend the material! (Unlike professors and classmates.) Also, great review for previous material prior to taking tests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Helpful DVD","review":"This dvd cuts out all the fluff and gets right to the meat of what you need to learn in your first semester of calculus.

It was filled with quite a lot of advice, but the problem is that the advice is very impractical. The book contains some cute pictures but the information provided leaves me wondering if the author has ever owned ferrets. Suggestions such as taping a mat to the carpet to prevent the ferrets from digging??? Anyone who has ever owned a ferret will tell you that a ferret will rip apart the tape in a matter seconds to get under the mat. Very little useful information is provided and could cause problems for new ferrets owners.

There are lots of photos shot from divers probes sent around the moon and the author guides your journey extensively on the moon day by day, describing craters, seas, swamps and moutain ranges. I find this book an ideal complement to the \\"Atlas of the Moon\\" by A. Ruckle which still remains the reference in terms of selenial cartography.

There is actually plenty of data that suggests that all of that money tore down the african-american family and left it in tatters, where prior to the 1960's. african-american families and communities were relatively intact, drug free, and non-sociopathic. It is the social programs which have created dependency and sociopathy. The authors can forget about reparations because it isn't ever going to happen. The attempt to get them will only polarize the races even more so. In a land of opportunity where even the most recent of immigrants can succeed fantastically, african-americans need to look at themselves and find out what is amiss in their thinking, values, attitudes or behavior that holds them back while everyone else is getting ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braille Rook Cards","review":"These cards were easy for my blind brother to use, and we were able to play immediately.

Well, the reality is that it's not quite as bad as you might imagine. It ends up being a weird Rosemary's Baby kind of story about genetic manipulation and aggression. Not done with the same panache of 28 Days Later, it still strives for a unique story.

About the first 100 or so pages, the author zipped through the most interesting part of the early history of Ireland....I kept wondering what could possibly fill the next 240 pages. To my chagrin, those following pages were filled with the Authors obvious hatred and hostility toward the English and the Protestant Church. Telling in this diatribe was the authors statement on page 337 that \\"the catholic church has always condemned violence\\", when previously on page 141, the author affirmed the fact that \\"the pope declared it lawful for a catholic to assassinate a Protestant ruler.This latter 2/3 of the book was not actual history, but more often the opinions, interpretations, and inner feelings of the predjudiced authors, couched in what a prospective reader would think was history.

I think my anger with the new tool is proportional to how much I liked the old one. The new square is thinner than the old one, and came from the store bent. For the savings of a few pennies Johnson ruined one of the most useful tools I own. I called Johnson and gave them an earful. To their credit it appears that they stand behind their products with a strong warranty, but frankly I'd much rather never have to use that warranty.

When you think how seldom you encounter a recording in which every song is good, think how even more rare it is to find an album in which every song approaches brilliance. From the pop perfection of \\"Angel Inside\\" to the sultry rhythms of \\"Walking Devotion\\" there is not a wasted moment on this CD, not a single misstep or derivative arrangement. The music is fresh and alive throughout and leaves you humming and, quite simply, feeling good. The only recent CDs that come close to \\"Amazing Ordinary Things\\" for sheer enjoyment value are Aimee Mann's soundtrack for Magnolia (the songs she sings), and Sarah Harmer's debut CD \\"You Were Here\\".

Anyway, when I discovered that she had another album out I rushed out to buy it without having heard any tracks. What a let down. Lots of forgettable songs, all interspersed with bland \\"fah-lah-lahs\\".Dont take my word for it. Download as many tracks as you can get your hands on and judge for yourself. I'm not saying this to be vindictive - I really believed that after \\"Roll\\" I'd found a major new artist and I was so looking forward to hearing this album.

Trouble is, as I mentioned above, they just don't stay at the thigh; they ride down after just 30 minutes or so and that's not what I wanted.Like another reviewer says, I will now stick to knee high compression socks.

Perhaps, this movie tells us that you don't have to obey your parents and try to be honest to yourself and live anything you like!! In this film, all children obey their parents. The school the children go to is very strict. One day a teacher named Mr.Keating came to school. Mr Keating is a free-thinker. Because of his appearence,children's thinking is changing day by day. In this film, my favorite charactor is Mr Keating,because he always smiling and I like his way of thinking. The most impressive scene for me is when Mr.Keating leaves the school and students stand up on their desks and say, \\"Oh, Chaptain my chaptain\\" I couldn't control myself and moved into tears.At last, I think this film is worth seeing very much , please rent this film and watch it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Joycean discourse on the tribulations of Black America.","review":"Louis Edwards, in the esteemed tradition of Joyce, Wolff and John Edgar Wideman, delivers a tour de force in his first novel \\"Ten Seconds\\". With remarkably swift yet extremely provocative prose, Edwards recounts the life of a young African-American man attempting to ground his identity in the south. Using a Joycean technique, in terms of the cyclical structure of the novel (based on ten seconds of a 100 meter race), Edwards captivates the reader from page one. Once you pick this, you will not put it down until it is over. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but deep","review":"Don't be fooled.

I don't think this board would have stood up to the beating it would get, even if it had been glued properly.Quite disappointed, because this item didn't get any bad reviews.

The story is entertaining and enjoyable to read. Lasky researched owls and their different species and introduces alot of facts into her story. With that said, it is still exiting and full of action.

For a start, the writing is awkward; it is just not good prose. The fantasy world is not created well, lacks so much I don't know where to start. Second, it is sinister and violent, right from the start. A baby is kidnapped by Bad Guys; he misses his mom, mourns with the other captives. Not uplifting in any way. As another reviewer said, there is way too much talk about ripping out gizzards and throwing up pellets. I don't know, just too graphic and uninteresting.I can see why my student did not like it.

Some of the reviews from those that liked the book seem to ignore the violence altogether.It is interesting to me that the few folks who gave the book an unfavorable review did so on the grounds that it was boring. I hardly think that plucking the wing feathers from a three week old chick is boring. I find it quite disturbing.My next action will be to delete it from my Kindle. It is not something I would ever recommend to a young person and I would not even want my adult daughter to read it.

It's an action/adventure sort of story with cute little owls. But the obvious deviations from owls' natural history are too much to ignore! This book (later books are worse but this initiates things) distorts natural history in an attempt to make owls look better: it makes owls seem very intelligent when in fact owls are some of the stupidest birds. In addition, it completely disregards the fact that owls are not the only birds that regurgitate pellets, or even that that's all they do! In addition, when *possible spoiler* one owl speaks of how some evil owls ate his brothers, everyone acts surprised, when in real life, bigger owls eat smaller owls all the time! This book could even be called out on minor technicalities (one character loses her tongue and now cannot make any sounds whatsoever).

But these are still great books that every animal-fantasy lover should look into, though they fall short of my list of favorite books. The characters are a little one-sided, and their personalities are not very inventive. Still. Mrs. Lasky makes up for that in the excellent plot.

It is because they are rated 800mAH. Don't even bother with a battery unless it is rated 850mAH. The battery life may still be short on an 850mAH battery, but at least the volume on your calls will sound louder and you will have fewer dropped calls.I bought a battery rated 850mAH. The call quality was significantly better, which is why I will not go back to ordering these. I do not feel, however, that the 850mAH-rated battery extended battery life.BOTH will have short battery life. These will have lousy call quality. The 850s will at least give you good call quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job, can't ask for more!!!","review":"When my cordless Uniden phones started failing to keep a charge I, foolishly I might add, first went down to Rat Shack to look for a replacement battery.

This battery is smaller and it does not even fill the battery cavity in the phone. On this battery, it still writes BT-446800mAh (same capacity as the original longer battery) but I doubt that this is it's true capacity. For the money it is not a bad deal but the claim that this is a Uniden battery is false. Just because a battery writes BT-446 it does not mean it is original.

These aftermarket units have an MTBF of less than two years so I'm starting on my third set of replacements, which this time will be of a different make. If you can get a guarantee that you're getting the same batteries that Uniden was putting in their phones in 2005, go for it and pay twice the price if you have to.

Yes, the knives were super sharp out of the box but after about a dozen uses they became completely dull. And don't even try to argue this point with Miracle Blade because their customer service base is practically non-existent, even though these knives are supposed to be guaranteed for life. All I got from this deal were empty promises and dull knives. If you truly want nice knives but don't want to spend a fortune on good German or Japanese steel, then I recommend you try out Forschner Victorinox products. They are very reasonably priced and are excellent products that should last you many, many years. Don't be seduced by the gimmick of Miracle Blade.

I also agree about the heroine not being as good as she claimed. Then again I also thought she was a little haughty anyway. I'm not sure what the title has to do with the story either.

Sharp's Customer Service suggested resetting the machine, and when that failed had us send it in. Well, that set off a six-month ordeal of first being told the machine would be repaired, then being promised a refund, only to have the machine show up at the front door. Unfortunately, the repaired machine now would not only not record, it wouldn't even play back commercial DVDs. So back to Sharp it went, and finally, after numerous unanswered messages, a veiled accusation that we'd never paid for the unit in the first place, eliciting a veiled hint that perhaps small claims court would be a solution, we received a refund.

It is not very long, and tells the management issues simply, giving you a practical work-environment examples. This book does not require you to read the one minute manager. It can be read separately, although you might get more out of it if you read first the one minute manager.

The advice seems practical enough, and if one's worked in the real world with any kind of practical mind, most advice gotten out of it will seem obvious. What turned me off is the way the book is written; a dialog between one who's learning and one who knows the helpful advice. But it tries to hard to make the suggestions clear and simple that the reader feels like their being talked to like a simpleton. It almost reads like a children's book.

I had the most problems with the driver's side mat. It did not lie flat, it had a bulge that was out of alignment and it did not lie in place because unlike the photographs, there was a hole for only one locking tab, not two. Finally, these do not look or feel like they are \\"extreme duty,\\" at least not for what I would guess to be no more than a few years.I'm returning them.

They are not rubber, but extruded plastic, syet they are flexible enough to fold in half without forming a crease. Rubber will dry out after time. So what if it sounds like you're \\"tap-dancing\\"; they cover your entire floor so there is virtually no way for snow, slop, and mud to get on your carpet. I;ve tried molded Husky-Linersm and after 2 years the edges curl. Plus, they are miolded like a tub so when snow melts your feet are essentially in water until it evaporates.

Berry offers a seamless narrative, written eloquently and without malice. Her book is an irrefutable unveiling of the ignorance that so often poses as the truth of popular culture. What is so ironic is that the players she exposes were and are supposed to be the very people who are without bias. Everyone and anyone who has a desire to understand racism and sexism in this country needs to read this book. No lawyer or judge serious about racial justice should enter a courtroom without having read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another person confusing pedophilia with homosexuality","review":"Generally I agree with the author's perspective about stories and how personal and societal views affect and distort the delivery of justice in US courts. However, I was profoundly disturbed by the fact that MOST of the cases she used to illustrate this with regard to the prosecution of so-called crimes involving homosexuality actually involved adult men abusing children. Of course she was not alone in her confusion of child sexual molestation and homosexuality - the prosecutors and judges were also confused, as in most of these cases, the charges appear to have been homosexuality or sodomy and not the more appropriate charge of sexual abuse of a child. Berry does a huge disservice to the gay rights movement by failing to acknowledge this distinction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Full Game!

Very upsetting! Why do these NFL DVD industries not give you the actual broadcast game? I would love to relive those Super Bowl Game's with the infamous Pat Summerall and John Madden narrating each and every play in their classic style!I can't understand why this is such a guarded secret of the NFL? To not sell these full game classic's to the public for obvious huge consumption?

The first two books in the series were a bore-- definitely not great... Once Nesta's view picked up it went even more downhill.

However as a sequel to \\"Pat of Silver Bush\\" I was a bit disappointed in this book. I truely loved \\"Pat of Silver Bush\\" and ordered \\"Mistress Pat\\" as soon as I finished its prequel. Somewhere between books my affection and interest in Pat as a character was lost. Pat seems rather silly and at times downright infuriating in this book. The rest of the cast of characters is as interesting as ever and Judy Plum is truely a gem of a character. If you have a burning desire to discover Pat's eventual fate read this book. If not leave her the charming young lady found in \\"Pat of Silver Bush\\" and read another of Lucy Maud's books which even the worst of are somehow better than modern fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only readable because of Montgomerey's style","review":"I am a big fan of L.M. Montgomerey. That being said, I hated the heroine of this book. Pat is odiously obsessive about change. One would suspect some sort of psychiatric disorder. Also, I was very perturbed by the persistent snobbery in this book; the Gardiner's perceive themselves as above others, i.e. \\"we're not Binnie's!\\" or something to that effect being mentioned in every chapter. L.M. does have a tendency towards snobbery and racism (Tannis of the Flats, Kilmeny of the Orchard) in many of her books and short stories. The racism can usually be attributed to historical perspective, but the snobbery is tasteless regardless of era. Also, if you read nearly all of her books and stories you'll begin to notice the same plot devices and even storylines popping up, which is tiresome.Stick with the Anne and Emily series, and the Blue Castle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"SHe was interesting, but I agree with what someone else said that she needed depth.

I'd make them all read this book. I discovered it in my Native American Fiction class during my senior year at Yale, and in my four years as a literature major, I'd never read anything better. Thomas King is a genius. He is also, according to my professor, a man-- a fact that my entirely female class refused to believe after reading the brilliantly satirical reworkings of phallocentric myths and legends that he intersperses throughout the book. His characters are hilariously and achingly real; his prose transcends the written word in its effortless use of oral storytelling methods. If you're still reading my stumbling attempts to convey the brilliance of this book, please stop immediately and buy it. Buy a few copies, because you'll want to share this with your friends, and they won't want to give it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amusing, well written, insightful book!

The author talks about knititng in a very casual, anecdotal manner--you hear stories of knitters she has known, of yarns she has purchased, of sweaters she has knit. Many of her stories are amusing while also practical. Reading this book is like learning from the mistakes of others.However, alone, this book is not enough to teach you how to knit. While it is worthwhile reading for the tips you pick up, if you need to look up a particular technique, you might be better using a book that is more organised, or with chapter headings that are less humourous and more informative.When you first start to knit, reading this book is like having a friend by your side telling you where you can go wrong, and for that is very useful. But it is best used in conjunction with some other less chatty book, such as Debbie Bliss's \\"How to Knit\\" or one of the many encyclopedias of knitting techniques (many excellent OP titles can be found at second hand bookstores)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Titled","review":"Knitting in Plain English is perfectly titled. I have tried to learn to knit before but I gave up, because I never really understood it. Ms. Righetti writes in a way to clearly show you what you are doing.

I read constantly in almost every genre and Island remains my all time favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Laugh out Loud Adventure","review":"This is a really fun read! Perry has a great way of making the reader root for the bad guys. The concept is extremely farfetched, but, somehow, I didn't care. The idea by the two capers is really a joke that just keeps going beyond anywhere they could have ever expected. When a completely ludicrous idea is suggested, the characters recognize the ridiculousness, and then do it anyway. This is no run of the mill novel. It can be kind of hard to find, sense it is out of print, but if you can get your hands on a copy, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME read!!","review":"I discovered Thomas Perry with the book \\"Metzger's Dog\\" - which I still count as one of the most enjoyable reads that I've ever had - and just LOVE the \\"Island\\"!

The other thought that comes to mind is that if you can dream it - it will come - a new country from a waterlogged island!!Grab the book; grab your favorite liquid and favorite chair; be prepared to enter a world where you can cheer for success for all the characters in this book.

The old adage of 'build it and they will come' turned into a reality and more than Harry and Emma ever envisioned. Thomas Perry is a fantastic author. I love his novels, especially the Jane Whitefield series; Metzger's Dog(Hilarious), Butcher Boy and Sleeping Dogs. You will love his villians. I agree with the other reviewers. The Island is a fantastic story. I am glad I purchased this hard to find book.

If you read any of the previous reviews, it is EXACTLY what they said. The hockey doesn't get any better or any smarter. It simply puts the computer opponent into invinicible mode. Your no longer able to poke check or body check the opponent, they just bounce off you and eventually get the pass off in front of your goalie and the opponent 1 times the puck into the net. (Especially since your goalies suck, they only get about 10-15 shots per game and let in 7 or 8 goals) Also the opponent needs only skate in your direction to knock the puck away from you when your on offense.But medium difficulty is easy and boring because you win every game 10-1.So, I uninstalled after I won the Stanley Cup as the Rangers on medium rating.Weak.

Functions would not respond, my wireless mouse did not work properly, and within a few minutes I lost my wireless connection to both of my laptop computers. I reconnected and plugged in the transmitter again, and immediately lost my network connection once again. Sorry, this is useless with a wireless network...By far the best music player IN CONCEPT is the Linksys \\"Wireless Bridge\\" because it works through your existing wireless network, except that it simply DOES NOT WORK a lot of the time due to bugs in the software.Why can't someone invent a simple way to play stored music via wireless into a stereo without expensive, gimmicky boxes and concepts that DO NOT WORK?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not work with T20 X-Fi speakers.","review":"Be aware that this product does not work with the wireless feature of the T20 speakers.It does work fine as a single transmitter to receiver combination and if you bypass the wireless capability of the T20 speakers, they can be used as 'dumb' speakers with the receiver. You also will find that additional receivers are as scarse as unobtainium, so I am unable to report on how a multi-room system might behave. I thought that since both products were Creative's X-Fi wireless technology and many people were buying the T20 speakers with this product, that they would work together. I could not have more wrong.Please don't be fooled as I was.

I got nothing more than 5kbps on channels 1,6 and 11.-The device can get power from a Mac Mini and adjust the non-existent volume but there is no audio via USB, and the combination of USB for power and mini-jack cable for audio produces terrible static on the other end.

Only problem was the strength of the signal...very weak and crackly. I had to move the two units as close as possible to each other to get somewhat acceptable sound, but it was very unaesthetic. I would have preferred if the units could remain out of site, but the signal is too weak for that.

First the unit reduces the volume output in all modes from the original source. Second the unit does not work with any of the media players on my laptop including one by Creative. Third the units volume control does not work when you use it digitally through the USB port as designed. I didn't even bother hooking up the receiver when I saw the transmitter does not work.

My transmitter is in the basement of my house and I get perfect sound even on the 2nd floor as well as outside. I was careful to avoid putting the transmitter right next to my wireless router (they're about 10 ft apart), but that was the only precaution I took in the setup.It just works.

However, I then looked for a second receiver, and only then realized that Creative has stopped selling the transmitter / receiver combo, or the receiver by itself. Look for it on Creative's website yourself if you don't believe me. There is another creative wireless receiver that Creative is selling, but it is not X-mod, so does not work with this transmitter. So if you only need one pair, and don't mind throwing the whole thing away if the one receiver breaks, then go for it. Otherwise, I suggest going with something that a manufacturer is still supporting. I am happy for Amazon's return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy, so good","review":"Plug it in, attach the cables and that's it.

It is as good as brand new. In fact the xmod is not even opened after I tried Xdock. May be one day when all my devices are N band, I could use this.

When I unplug this unit, all devices instantly start working normally. The product does not even work that very well requiring line of sight with no obstructions to prevent all \\"sound hiccups\\". Also, I thought they would have some way to mount this unit to the wall... NOPE. I am very disappointed in the quality of this product. I don't really feel like dealing with the hassle of returning it so I'm just going to turn it into a big science experiment and take it apart to see how it works, maybe if I'm lucky I can make it work as it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't beat it for the price - just don't expect it to last","review":"First off, this product is incredibly easy to setup. Everything just worked right off the bat. About the only hitch was I had my transmitter placed to close to my lap top which caused interference, but Creative did a great job of communicating this limitation. Sound is crystal clear and the device is attractive and compact. I plan on buying additional receivers for the bedroom, the kitchen and den. BTW I plan on using 2.1 computer speakers since they give great sound and are very affordable. I strongly recommend Logitech speakers since they always have great sound and build quality.I've owned these for a year and a half now and it's not transmitting anymore.

The special effects are cheesy to the 10th power. The actors/actresses all suck at acting. The story line makes very little sense.

I was hoping for a cheesy monster flick, but this was pretty unbearable. The monster effects weren't too bad and the locations were better than some studio movies (looks like it was shot in some real caves). I think it had potential.

It could walk through walls, floors, rock, etc. without leaving a hole and pull people through with him/her..It. whatever.

Though the plot was stupid and the acting lame, this movie actually left something of an impact...The girl in the cave. As the movie came to a close, I was thinking: \\"What about the girl?\\" Well, they did wrap that up finally. Her fate was truly grim. Gave me chills.

As to elaboration, there is a bit concerning the pain body on tape 2, but not enough, and tape 1 is a rather inarticulate rehash of other material in the book. Mr Tolle's tone seems smug at times; it cast a slight negative shadow on my very positive impression of him and his work. I was very disappointed by the tapes.I am somewhat surprised by the other reviews which are so positive. I've only listened to the tapes once so maybe I'm judging them too harshly, on the other hand I have no desire to listen to them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Comes Alive","review":"This book traces an ancient Irish family from the mists of time into the 20th century.

The only reason I replaced it was because after seven years of pretty steady household/basement refinishing/etc. use, the two rechargeable batteries finally died.

Even though we have two Bacon Waves, we only cook one at a time because the 1000 watt microwave seems to take longer to cook when stacked. One minute per slice with one tray at a time is the way to go for perfectly crisp bacon EVERY time.

This cable it small and light, fitting perfectly into my netbook's case without adding to much bulk. The only two complaints I have with it are: it is a little short, which isn't a problem 99% of the time and the clip are a little small.

Not even once did the product work for me to use, and in addition I was charged to pay the shipping and handling for it to get replaced. While it's size is comparable to Belkin's other portable devices, each with a similar retractable concept for portability, many cases with their equipment breaks due to the sheer weakness in the method they use to bind the main part of the device with the rest of it. If this is the case then this is much better recommended if you do not use it on a regular basis, but instead need it for once in a while for when you need to connect one laptop to another via Ethernet cable.

This instead concentrates on the violence in society as portrayed by movies and asks some important questions about personal responsibility. It works on three levels; as a straight thriller, as a satire and as a moral arguement. It never however provides any answers but just leaves you to think about whether films reflect or lead the mood of society. As a thriller it is excellent with some real heart stopping scenes. I would imagine the play currently running in London would be great as all the action takes place in one room. It did not however make me laugh and for a comedy writer as good as he is that disappointed me. if you have never read an Elton book before then can I recommend Gridlock which deals with car pollution and also disability awareness as well as providing more belly laughs than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"While Ben Elton is hugely talented, as evidenced by the writing he did for Blackadder, Popcorn is just too British to be passed as an American book. The dialog wasn't even close to the American vernacular, and that got annoying.

I couln't concentrate on the plot, or Elton's point, or anything else"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst book I have ever read!","review":"Ben Elton's popular novel Popcorn is nothing short of an amature british ripoff of american culture, I don't know if Ben Elton is ashamed to be british or what but he tries to portray the cultural implications of life imitates art and the ethics of a hollywood driven society in the 90's.Unfortunately this impossible for a british person to achieve instead he rips off every somewhat hip film of the last ten years and tries to pass it off as social satire, instead looks embrassingly unoriginal and amature at best. Simply its what if Quentin Tarintino met Natural born killers wow thats irony huh?I'm amazed this book is even published at all there's so many grammerical errors its ridiculous, the chapters are written as one long sentence without a break so its impossible to follow. when describing simple american cultral icons he accidently subsitutes british equivlents on numerous occasions which is just laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sloppily-written and unsatisfying novel.","review":"Ben Elton's popcorn is a half-baked story that manages to combine shoddy writing with a plotline taken from NATURAL BORN KILLERS and a heavy-handed appraisal of a \\"pressing social issue\\" (the effect of the media on violence in society.) Trashy, unenlightening. POPCORN is right; this is the kind of book that you digest quickly, then grumble when it gives you an upset stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Dimensional","review":"I didn't find anything particually appealing in this novel. Elton's characters are one dimensional.There is nothing real about any of them and there is nothing to relate to and invole you in this book. The use of extensive violence in this book seems a bit unnecessary as in most parts it is over the top.I didn't rate this book highly and wouldn't recommend it if you want a thrilling read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dinner conversation","review":"I imagine Elton coming up with the idea for this book after an evening of \\"stimulating\\" dinner conversation with friends on the topic of ultraviolence in film. To be frank, while somewhat entertaining, I found the treatment of the subject matter pretty trite, predictable, and oriented on the sound bite. Really nothing that you haven't heard before if you're at all paying attention, so I wouldn't recommend reading it for its more philosophical aspects."},{"rating":"2","title":"edge of the seat stuff all the way!","review":"Ben Elton is one of my favourite stand ups but I did not think that his rapid fire style would work in a book. How wrong I was! Characters like Bruce, Wayne and Scout are so well devised that at the end of the book you feel like you know them. Even the smaller characters such as Velvet jump straight off the page and into your living room. The way in which Elton has made this a thriller, a black comedy and yet still managed to get the moral message of responsibility across is simply pure genius. If you get the chance READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling satire","review":"While I found this an entertaining and amusing book, I couldn't help but think what a great movie it would make.

Dick's short stories are the best work of one of the greatest ( science) fiction writers in the history of the genre. His spare style leaves plenty for the imagination, as opposed to those writers who feel it necessary to fill their pages with endless technological detail. His staid characters are straight out of the Eisenhower Years, and are put through hoops such as no one has dreamed up before or since. Brilliant premises create psychological dilemmas that almost always resolve unexpectedly. As testament to his fertile imagination, five movies directly credit his short stories, and many more arguably rip him off. This five volume set comprises half of my ten most treasured books; if you like fiction, short stories, or genius social commentary, buy these stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Book of his that I read","review":"I must have missed something about this book.

They don't provide enough light so that you can actually see the path. I need lights for the back yard but the dim light they exude is merely enough to view the lamp, not enough to cast actual light on the ground (even after days of charging in the sun).The flaw seems to be in the plastic 'windows' which block too much light; when I looked at the LED inside, it seemed bright enough.These were packaged well, felt strong enough but were a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but they don't charge the batteries...","review":"The lights are very nice in every way - good quality, good looking, well packaged, etc. Only one BIG problem: I bought TWO sets, and NONE of them will charge the batteries. I removed the batteries and charged them in an AC charger and replaced them. They worked for a week, but then died. Clearly, the solar panels aren't charging the batteries. It's not the batteries, of course, since they took a charge on AC. I don't know if I can get my money back, now that it's been several weeks. I will give these another try and update - maybe there wasn't enough sun the day they ALL decided not to work, but it's a sunny day today, and these things better work tonight..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Solar Light Does Not Work and Does Not Hold Charge","review":"I did not believe the earlier review of the solar light till I got a set myself. The rechargeable batteries did not hold the charge and also one of the light did not even work from the get go. It was a very nice solar light set only if it worked. Too bad but I had to request for refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brinkmann 4-Piece Dual Window Pane Solar Stake Light","review":"I purchased these as they were supposed to be a \\"high quality\\" solar light. The outer case and hardware certainly looked good when I took them out of the package so I had high hopes for them. Unfortunately looks can be deceiving.... The lights were installed late summer in an area that receives sun light all day long, even then they only lasted 3.5-4 hours, now with the shortened days we are down to maybe 1.5 hours tops. This is very disappointing as the cheap Harbor Freight lights we had previously would last an easy 5-6+ hours and put out considerably more light.The second problem is that one of the 12 we purchased is now dead with condensation showing in one of the solar panels. I consider this very poor as we had a very dry late summer and fall with only a couple of days rain. I will be returning it for warranty replacement as it is still only a couple of months old.Overall I am not impressed with these and would advise people to avoid them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but beware of batteries","review":"Ive owned solar lamps for years now. I saw these pretty amber lamps and ordered them for my birthday. The batteries they require are Ni Cd batteries (rechargeable), no other kind can be used, thats normal. Whats also normal is that 1 of 4 has now burned out within the first 2 mos. of usage. Went to Radio Shack to purchase new batteries, I was told they don't sell them anymore, THEY ARE BEING DISCONTINUED!!!!! I ordered replacements on-line from onlybatteries.com. All 4 new batteries are weak according to my battery tester and Im charging them now (1 for the 2nd time). Is it worth it?

Very stylish and much better looking than the ones at Wal-Mart that look like \\"Road Flares\\". It was very overcast here this afternoon and all 4 lites came on. I used 2 on the ground stakes and hung the other 2 from the small shepard's hooks that were included. So far, so good. A \\"10\\" in our book. Will finish this review and order another set ASAP. Feel confident when ordering but do yourself a favor and get 2 sets at once. FYI...This set includes 4 ground stakes and 4 shepard's hooks. Enjoy !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get What You Pay For","review":"I ordered 20 of these to line the walkway up to the house. The price was right to buy sight-unseen. They are fine, but the posts are plastic and very tough to drive into hard ground. When on, they look like Haloween lights, because the glow is orange. All in all, I am luke warm on this product. UPDATE: The lights faded greatly since installed. I think I will replace them this spring with a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"25% Failed","review":"I purchased 3 sets of these lights based on the positive comments on this site.

I think they are confused as to where to make their comments.The current price for this is $35 and it is simply two songs extracted from the \\"Dreams of Rome\\"concert. Believe me, this is not worth the price. I paid around ten bucks for this a couple of years ago and it is barely worth that. Go to Amazon, Vittorio Grigolo, \\"Dreams of Rome\\" concert and you will pay less for the entire concert.The rating is not for Vittorio's singing, it is for the lack of one very important detail not provided. It does say it is a \\"sampler\\", but I don't think people realize it is a DVD sampler that just gives you a tiny bit of the entire concert. Why spend $35 for this when you can get the entire concert for $30!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"Secretariat, an American Racing Legend\\"","review":"This is a great DVD of Secretariat for new and old fans of Secretariat and for horseracing fans in general. The section of the video on tapes of all his races is fantastic footage. There is additional material on this DVD that was not included on the original VHS tape of the same name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful!","review":"The star is for Secretariat the horse NOT the DVD. This abomination is embarrassing. The footage appears to have been shot using a cheap 8mm camera from the 1950s. Most races are so blurry you can hardly make out one horse from another. This \\"tribute\\" to the world's most legendary and loved thoroughbred is a disgrace to his legacy. Whoever is responsible for this travesty should be ashamed of themselves. Unfortunately, the opportunist who made this was more concerned about a quick buck than honouring the greatest race horse of all time. Please, I beg you do not waste your money on this piece of junk. You can buy the Disney movie \\"Secretariat\\" for half the price and believe me enjoy it 1000% more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story","review":"After watching the movie Secretartiat for what seems like a million times this year alone, I purchased this true story for my other half.

It's pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent It Back","review":"My wife and I were thrilled to see this DVD being offered after seeing the movie. However, the DVD does not live up to the movie in so many ways. The footage itself is dated technology and, therefore, the clarity that one would hope for is not there. Also, while it may be fun for some to sit and watch the twenty-one races, after the first few it does get a little old. There simply isn't the drama in the race. I suppose it takes a true horse racing fan to appreciate the nuances of what is going on but the footage often didn't allow for any in depth analysis.When the video of the movie comes out, we will be one of the first to purchase it. What the movie confirms is that Big Red was truly one of a kind and so was his owner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"Not only is this presentation of a legend not worthy of its subject, the DVD was USED: opened, skipped, and had to be CLEANED. DO NOT PURCHASE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.....","review":"I was eager to see this documentary about Secretariat and unfortunately, this DVD doesn't do justice to this great horse. The sound quality is very inconsistent, sometimes it's very loud and other times you can hardly hear the announcer. I was told that there would be subtitles on this film. It is hard to understand the jockey, trainer and groom and there are NO subtitles to help you figure out what they are mumbling. One bright spot is the owner's interview: You CAN understand her and also the narrator. The films of the races are of poor quality. You don't learn anything about Secretariat's life off of the race track. The PBS documentary, \\"American Experience\\" for Seabiscuit was much, much better than this effort for Secretariat. I wouldn't recommend spending $50 on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Cringe*","review":"I really wanted and expected to like this - I mean I love that it has the footage of all of Secretariat's races, but the documentary itself does him no justice. This is supposed to be honoring one of the greatest thoroughbreds of all time and the quality of the documentary is crappy - for a $50 DVD I expected a lot more. For Secretariat I expected a lot better. I couldn't stop cringing when they played that cheesy Bryan Adams song in the background to Secretariat's racing footage! Ugh.Poor Secretariat is probably rolling over in his grave!It's like they hired a cheap wedding videographer to put this together - Not worth $50 - Wait till they drop the price or something better comes along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"For $50 I was expecting a professionally produced product with extensive coverage of Secretariat's life. I appreciate the biographical information; I don't appreciate the cheesy song at the end. I especially don't appreciate the gaps in the playback - similar to the kinds of breaks in continuity you get on a scratched record. I wouldn't mind so much if it cost less. I get more comprehensive, more enjoyable coverage from the pieces on YouTube."},{"rating":"2","title":"secretariat the greatest","review":"this was a very good biography of secretariat. his triumphs and his disappointments.

These are children hardened by lifetimes of physical and sexual abuse and chaotic environments. This is the only one of the many stories I read for them that truly touches more than a few of them.

I believe that Pilkey, with this book, has made a profound difference in many children's lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming and uplifting...","review":"I've been a fan of Dav Pilkey's stories and illustrations for a long time, but \\"God Bless The Gargoyles\\" is my absolute favorite. For adults as well as children! Don't let the title put you off: the message in this story is for EVERYONE, regardless of which Higher Power you choose to believe in. It never ceases to make me cry, and yet feel better at the same time. I can't recommend this book highly enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely story of hope","review":"This book, written in rhyme, is the tale of how gargoyles once beloved creatures became despised by the people as time moved on.

This story brings hope to those who are lonely but they truly are not alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an applique quilter's dream book!","review":"Forget the kids and buy this book for yourself if you're a quilter! In years to come it will serve as documentation for quilt historians of the fabrics available to late 1990's quilters.

Beckinsale filmed this series at the same time as \\"Rising Damp\\" and was forced to wear a wig for the early episodes of \\"Rising Damp\\" since his student character required long hair and his prison character required shorter hair (although his prison character's hair is nowhere near short).Fletch's \\"wise guy with a heart\\" reminds me of Phil Silvers' Seargeant Bilko, always playing an angle, but a decent sort underneath.

He's not only a cutie but always makes me laugh through the episodes. I thought it was really funny when he had to choose between the two girls but ended up with none!

I, personally, am the 2nd type. This show lacks one key concept: a PLOT. The people on this show also need to learn to,ahem,close the door a little. This show is also annoying because they use about 50 pop-culture refrences per episode, so TRYING to copy Gilmore Girls.

But its not even mentioned (as of today, 8/20/04). Here's what I know so far, the DVD set was and apparently still is going to be full screen. The producers and the creator wanted it to be full screen since that was how they intended to film it. Of course, people with HD have seen the Widescreen HD version, so i don't know why they're releasing it in FS (must be a creative thing). I HAVE seen some unconfirmed rumblings that the dvd set will in fact be WIDESCREEN. But I guess we all won't know until it comes out...And to the producers of the dvd, if you're reading this, why not include the MadTV skits? and the Ryan (OUT) Seacrest show with the whole cast?

I thought it would be a west coast version of Dawson's Creek. I must say, as much of a Dawson's fan that I am, I think this show is 10x better. The humor is whitty and quick. This is a great show, that is terribly underrated in the Emmy department. When my best friend got this for Christmas I just thought I would watch it once to see what everyone was talking about. Now I will be saving my paychecks so I can buy Season 1 , and eventually Season 2, of the O.C!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely NOT like Dawson's Creek","review":"As I was reading through these reviews, I noticed that people compared The O.C. to Dawson's Creek. Well, to those who have never seen the show, DON'T BELIEVE IT! I own season's 1 through 4 of Dawson's Creek when I purchased The O.C. and it basically ruined Dawson's Creek for me. There is no comparison because the O.C. is on another level. From the fights to the wild parties to the babies' mamas, the O.C. is just addicting. I know that it's rich people complaining about their lives in a beautiful beach-side setting but what do you expect, it's a teen soap and I LOVE IT. Don't knock it unless you've seen it. I would recommend this DVD set to anyone because it not only appeals to the younger teenage crowd, but also to older adult viewers. All and all the show has something for everyone and with all the extras featured on the DVD, it is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great escapism","review":"Sorry Mr. R. A.

I'm sorry I hate it so much, but I just can't help it. If you do have the desire to watch a teenage soap, at least try One Tree Hill, it's cheaper and you'll see Chad Michael Murray.

It was the one that had the seeak preview of the new star wars movie that comes on May 19th.

Well if this isn't the sappiest bunch of crap. First of all Mr. Tough Guy from the Hood can't act to save his life. All he can do is stand around and deliver dialogue like a bitch.Please, if you have any brain cells, stay the hell away from this show.

Anybody between the ages of 12-27 however, if you're above the age of 27 and actually watch and enjoy this. No offense but that is pretty pathetic. So to sum this load of trash up.

Apparently the editors and/or authors have zero familiarity with the War Between The States, because anyone who knows anything about the war knows that Vicksburg is in Mississippi. And this error was not just a one time error (as it occurred in the related work Mississippi River Gunboats of the American Civil war 1861-65) but appears repeatedly. It is truly astounding. Having said that, the book was well written and a great source of information. I would like to have given it 4 stars but the errors really detracted from an otherwise good work, making me doubt the integrity of the remaining information.

The movie filmed in the South Bronx captures that gritty graffiti era that birthed rap music. The filmed starred Fab Five Freddy, The Cold Crush Brothers, Grand Master Flash and The Chief Rocker Busy Bee. The film really captures the graffiti culture of that era.The 25th anniversary edition includes new bonus features and interviews.

I take more in the winter, and although I can't prove it, I'm fairly certain that it boosts my immune system and is a good flu/cold preventer.

But the other \\"one-star\\" review here on Amazon should be heeded -- these are re-recordings. The song I listened to (on Pandora) is entitled \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" and is based on tunes from that soundtrack. But the actual first half is from the piece \\"As a Judgment\\" and the second half is based on the film's overture. Both halves are re-done, and while not horrible, have lost a lot of power. The original As a Judgment, in particular, is a masterpiece so buy the original soundtrack! If you don't know these songs, you may be safe buying this CD because you won't be disappointed by the comparison. Still, I wonder how badly the other tunes have been mangled when re-recorded?

When that dries up, they branch off into bigger crimes until eventually caught.

Good insights into characters from 'A Wild Sheep Chase' and 'Dance Dance Dance,' and good insights into the author as an up and coming writer. This one's a little sexier than Wind, which the author definitely continued with in his later stuff.

She gets caught, and the law comes down hard--she has to do volunteer work in an animal shelter.The hero is the vet who runs the shelter, and he puts poor Kay to work scooping cat boxes! He's skeptical about her, and she's terrified of the animals. I won't tell you how they work it out, but I can assure you it's funny!

It has delightful and poignant life-experiences from real step-moms and even biological fathers. Mostly, it lets you know that you are not alone in your feelings for your step-child, even if those feelings are negative. Allows you to see yourself as part of a community, rather than alone in the world and in this particular situation. Helps you to focus on what is important and advises you to let go of the rest. Excellent chapters on focusing on your marriage, how to handle vacations with the step-children, dealing with your husband's ex-wife, and when to get help. All in all, a very fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and easy to read.","review":"The author did a nice job of telling summarizing being a stepmother. As a new stepmother of 3 young children, it was nice to know that my feelings were very common among others. There are areas where I wish she had gone into more depth, but she did a nice job of covering a variety of topics. If I ever have a friend who becomes a stepmother I will recommend this book to her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"My husband lovingly selected this book for me as I started on my Stepmother-hood journey with him last year. The How to Survive teaser on the cover would lead one to expect some practical advice. Unfortnately all it offered me was many varied examples of other people's situation without any direction on how 'not to let this happen to you'.I found myself disappointed at not being able to relate to the examples set fourth, and was further confused at the general message (or advice) for each chapter.I was finally able to use my yellow highlighter at the last few pages when she discussed how a stepmother may make specific contributions simply by her presence.

I recommend this book to stepmothers, soon-to-be stepmothers, and any woman dating a man with a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat helpful","review":"This book discusses a lot of the situations stepmothers face, but I felt it had a negative attitude about stepfamily relations. It addressed some of the emotions of being a stepmother, but it doesn't really give a positive outlook on how to improve situations. Other books have left me with a positive attitude about being a stepmom and emphasizing the importance of a sense of humor, but this book made me feel as if things will never improve...so why even try. It may be helpful for stepmothers with problem stepchildren such as behavior or criminal issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best for stepmoms","review":"After reading several books on the topic of stepmothering, I have to rate this one as one of the worst. It highlighted all of the negative and did not discuss the positives of stepmothering. We all know stepmothering has ups and downs, but this book mostly discussed the downs. The book seems full of negative, bitter vibes. The topics do not include the attachment bonds that can be formed between child and stepmom; the author advises stepmoms to keep a distance and not get involved. I do not feel like this advice applies to me because I am a full-time custodial stepmom. I am totally involved in my stepchild's life and see more good than bad in the situation. I would not recommend this book to other stepmoms unless they are looking for bitter and vindictive literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very one sided","review":"Honestly I am only about half way through this book and am considering getting rid of it. This book seems to be written from the point of view that the birth mother has full custody and dad's get weekend visitation.(the only exception is the ONE chapter on the widower) There is actually a specific chapter on visitations on a weekend only basis. This book doesn't seem like it will really offer any worth while advice especially if your husband has full custody and mom has weekend visitation. It seems to focus most on adolescent step children, rarely elementary and younger. I am on chapter 9 and have learned nothing so far besides the fact that according to this author being a step mother will be horrible no matter what. No if's, and's, or butt's. Maybe I need to finish it, but at this time it really doesn't seem to relate to being a step mother in general. It's about dealing with part time teenage stepchildren."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage !","review":"I rate this 1 star and call it garbage not because of the racy subject matter (that COULD have been interesting), but because the film is unwatchable.It looks like somebody took screen captures from a webcam to make the film.. fuzzy, jerky motion that is annoying to try and watch.Almost like the movie is skipping every 3rd frame or running on an altered framerate or something.The girl is sexy (in a skanky way)... but NO WAY would she mess around with the greaseballs cast in this film.15 minutes of trying to watch and then EJECT !!Video quality worse than a home movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"I got to see this movie and I think that the quality of the film is not the best, including picture and sound.

I took a chance because most of the time Amazon's dimensions are accurate. While they are 9 inches square, not only are they not 2 inches deep; they are only 7/8 inch deep.

I have to say, coming from a King Coil pillow top that lasted 7 years for me, this bed is FIRM. The memory foam makes up for this in my opinion, as it adjusts to your exact contours in a minute or 2. It seems to be loosening up as a whole. If it does a bit, I'll adjust this rating to 5 stars without pause. Delivery took about a week, with no damage, vacuum sealed in a roll. The initial smell is normal; only nit-picky people would find that something to gripe about. This bed is perfect for all sleeping AND non sleeping activities. My only concern is the firmness but I am adjusting quickly, and the mattress seems to be adjusting as well. I'll update this in a month or so if it does. My first Amazon purchase too!

This man gives up everything in this obsession, against the consensus who have fingered somebody else. The characters and the setting have a chilly darkness to them. The sky always seems overcast, and little light shines through the characters too. It's a short book, and difficult to put down. It isn't the happiest of books, the characters aren't fully developed, yet the cynical nature of life is fleshed out completely.

Unlike Michael Lewis of Liar's Poker, Ben simply doesn't understand the business. Simple things like scalping the Nikkei (index arb), index additions, are very mundane and simply strategies. Ben attempts to make John and Dean more than they are to sensationalize the characters, and in the process losses all street (wall street that is) credibility.But if you are in the index arb community, or are part of the princeton wrestling/football crowd, or was an expat in Japan. I recommend it. Otherwise, it's a decent piece of ficition.As a side note. The real Dean Carney is a great guy, and actually lives in upstate NY now with his beautiful wife and kids. The real retirement place is not Bermuda! How can one do index arb in Asian markets while based in Bermuda. Just say Hawaii, you are not going to give anything away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read; could have used more technical details","review":"Although Mezrich embellishes the characters enough to make an exciting semi-fiction story, I was very interested when the actual topics of hedge funds and arbitrage were breached.

Still, it is an intriguing book and a fast-paced read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This book is fluff -- its description of the hedge fund world is laughable. You mean to tell me that scalping Nikkei futures is how the \\"Ivy League cowboys raided the Asian markets for millions\\"? Clearly, this author is in way over his head attempting to understand the complex strategies employed by hedge funds to achieve their extraordinary returns (as well as blowups). The description of the Japanese sex trade is a boring diversion that eventually becomes an irritating pebble in the shoe of the book. Ultimately, the book is a superficial story lacking any real insight into how real money is made. And why is that?

As an expat who actually trades the Asian markets for a living, I can tell you first hand that this book is complete fiction. There's nothing of any substance regarding the financial world. The little that he does talk about markets and traders, he manages to both oversimplify and get it wrong. In order to make-up for the lack of real information, Mr. Mezrich spends roughly half the book describing every minutia of every scene.

Second, the idea of climbing down the first escape in the middle of an earthquake is ludicrous. Third, no ultra-hip Tokyo club would have US Marines as patrons.

The book is lacking in technical details and is not recommended as a handbook for how to arbitrage Nikkei futures. Of the several hundred pages in the text, only a small handful are dedicated to the mechanics of arbitrage and trading. The description of trading is very generic and does not provide any insights to anyone with even a passing knowledge of finance.Nonetheless, like his last book, this one was entertaining.

Hogwash and I don't believe it for a minute.I bought the book to learn about some raiders and all you get is some superficial gloss on trading index futures.

He took a great singer and fantastic songs and saddled them with the \\"whitest\\" most \\"elevator music\\" production ever heard in years. Every attempt at \\"hip\\" tracks sounds like something done in the 80's. The background vocals are a farce.

When I saw this Motown 2 CD and the glowing reviews, I thought I'd give it a whirl. Upon first listening I was really disappointed. I've given it another few shots and my verdict is finally a big, bored shrug. The arrangements are kind of bland - which is really a shame because the original tunes rocked their asses off. Finally there's Michael. He's got lovely pipes and a really smooth tone but no guts. I listened to the original Four Tops \\"I'll Be There\\" last night and Levi Stubbs is strong.

However, when I first heard Motown I, I didn't like it and felt somewhat angry.

I did like Mike's arrangement for Since I Lost My Baby. When I heard Motown II was coming out, I wasn't happy AGAIN! The only cut I really like is Stop, Look, Listen with Toni Braxton.

Artists way past their prime for years have mined the immensely rich territory of standards, covers and the like, perhaps because their inability to write any new effective matierial that manages to speak to any audience whats so ever. Mike cuts ever so thin slices of white bread from his versions, only to obscure the magic and production virtues, as well as the emotion, that made some of Motown's greatest songs so enduring. If you buy this album, you probably have no sense of rhythm and you believe against taxing the rich."},{"rating":"1","title":"No-Talent Joker","review":"OK, I'll admit, I don't own this album. I was recently on a car trip with a friend, who played it for me. Michael McDonald is horrible. Not only does he have the most ridiculous voice to sign classic motown numbers, but his piano playing turns all of these songs into elevator music, which is exactly the reason they were cool in the first place. THEY WEREN'T ELEVATOR MUSIC. To buy this album is to accept mediocrity & give this sellout your hard-earned money. Don't be that guy. Have some integrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael McD after Motown: another success.","review":"Without Motown for me this album would be marvellous!

Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever; 7. Tracks Of My Tears; 8. What's Goin' On; 10. After The Dance; 12. Tuesday Heartbreak. Featuring Billy Preston on B3 organ, Nathan East and Abe Laboriel, JR. on bass, Michael Thompson on guitar, Vinnie Colaiuta on drums. On track 2. Stevie Wonder on harmonica. Track 4.

He cannot relive those heady days in Detroit where Berry Gordy had everyone, musicians and vocalists, in the same room kicking out the jams. In addition Michael McDonald is a cotton mouthed singer, where he NEVER enunciates the words and just mumbles to the point of not being able to be clearly heard or remotely understood. He needs a translator.

It introduces the basic steps that you will need to know in order to get any further in this line of dance. The instructions are very easy to understand and the pictures are very helpful.

The instructors always refer to the Spanish names of the patterns or moves, such as a \\"Barrida\\" or \\"Curzada\\". I wanted a book that would be a reference to the patterns I was using so I ordered this book.However, I was amazed to find that all the moves lack the Spanish name, instead using terms like \\"front cross\\", \\"open step\\". I cannot tie those patterns back to what I am learning and returned the book.I did like all the wonderful footwork diagrams in the book and would have been thrilled if they were titled with the Spanish name, such as \\"ochos\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing","review":"The inconsistency of this book is amazing.

This book is really annoying to read. While Barbara tries to include many types of crafts when giving examples, it's easy to see that her focus is the country/traditional theme (think teddy bears, calico, painted wood, corn husk dolls, etc.).Also, her references to religion and God seem out of place to me. Isn't this supposed to be a business book? Not all crafters are religious!I could deal with those things, other than for the fact that it seems like every other page has some sort of grammatical error or spelling mistake. Did she not have an editor? I looked for an editor's name in the front pages, but didn't see one... case in point: If you plan to publish a book, GET AN EDITOR. Or risk looking very unprofessional.There is some good information in this book, but I know I'll be hoping to re-sell my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they advertise","review":"The title of the book is MOVING BEYOND YOUR PARENTS DIVORCE, which would lead you to believe it's a book for children of divorce. A book filled with compassion, and tips for putting your parents divorce behind you. Well it is not that at all. It brags that divorce doesn't really have a bad effect on children, and just tells of success stories of adult children of divorce. The book is more for a parent looking for reassurance that they're not screwing up their kid's life. I would not recommend this title at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"abysmal quality","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my husband, who is quite fond of cinnamon on many things.

We tried everything and never got it working properly. It is only a grinder and should not be that problematic. The handle looks like metal but is only shiny-coated plastic. All in all it is a cheap, cheesy piece of manufacturing and certainly not worth the cost or trouble it causes.I ended up purchasing an \\"Oxo Grind It\\" for the cinnamon.

Since I haven't been playing through amps for that long, I don't have much to compare it to, but my only real complaint is the short cord: you will definitely need to buy another cord and use the attached adapter. I am now looking for another mic with a dirtier sound, but this has been a good mic so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touch read, yet informative","review":"This book is a tough read, kind of like a text book in school. I bought notecards and I went through each chapter writing down things like deletions, presuppositions etc. This book is very VERY informative. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning the basics of NLP.Richard Bandler wrote this book based on the teachings of a gentleman named Milton Erickson. And while all of the techniques in this book are valuable and should be used until they become part of your natural speech let me quote Milton Erickson who said.\\"The patterns the techniques, they're not important. What's important is desire for change.\\"Always remember that you can be the most athletic person in the world, but without the desire to win you will never excel above the rest; because above all, you need a strong frame of mind. The materials in this book coupled with a strong frame of mind will make you an expert communicator. Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Revolution in Cognition?","review":"Published 20 years ago, founder of NLP, this book was edited entirely from audiotapes of introductory NLP workshops. Amazing and interesting view on cognitive behavior and communication. It is a dramatic new approach to traditional psychological therapy, a turn around to say the least. The imperative is that each individual has the potential for change and that each and every single piece of behavior has a positive function in some context. People process language at the unconscious level, and typically the counscious mind is the one that knows the least about what's going on in their behavior. The mechanics seems rather complex for the reader who has his first approach to NLP but ther is an abundance of other books written on this subject which will broaden your possibilities of applying this technique on a professional or personal level."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninteresting","review":"as brilliant as richard bandler is, he cant write a book for his life, based on a seminar and very dry reading some of his students like robert diltz write alot better books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed but should have known","review":"Product was poor quality, tough to assemble and overall was a real waste.

I find the work of Elaine Aron to be much more helpful, descriptive and practical. Aron does not consider high sensitivity a disorder and her books aim at not only educating but helping those of us who were born with this trait to reframe our past in light of this information. Heller's book just reinforces what we have been told our whole lives, and continue to be told even now, that there is something very WRONG with us. I urge everyone who is highly sensitive, or who has \\"sensory processing sensitivity\\" to read Elaine Aron and reject this book's continued refrain that we are disordered, a notion that needs to be dispelled, once and for all. I especially want to suggest \\"Psychotherapy and the Highly Sensitive Person\\" by Dr. Aron as an alternative to this book. Again, an unfortunate presentation of the data we now have regarding this trait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, I know what's going on!","review":"While reading this book I was so relieved to see that someone else has experienced life as I have! I realized that I don't have to \\"tough it out,\\" but the things that I feel are very real, and if I am not comfortable in a situation to just remove myself. There are times that I feel life is bombarding me with stimulus and I just want to go hide, its not an emotional thing, it is like someone has just turned up the volume in my ears, the nerve endings on my skin and I just need to get away. Even when I was little I was uncomfortable in new clothes that were stiff, not broken in. I wouldn't let my mother wash my hair, my scalp was too tender; and fireworks were just over the top too loud. This book gives some great affirmation and coping skills. We are not alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for extreme sensory defensives only","review":"This book is too dense and redundant. Though I applaud Sharon Heller's attempt to bring this issue to the mainstream, it seems only to apply to the most severely affected people and not to less extreme cases. Additionally, the only real suggestions for help seemed to point to seeing a specialist. I really could not find anything practical to help with my \\"oversensitivity\\". I did notice the author tends to mention \\"brushing your skin,\\" yet never really tells what that is, but rather refers the reader to a specialist. One last comment, the type is very, very small and irritating to read. Bottom line: Great for extreme sensory defensives, but overly detailed and redundant for those of us moderately so. Offers no substantial or practical self-help solutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive book, well worth reading.","review":"This book seems really good - from about halfway through especially. This is where it takes on more of a practical, self-help approach, discussing treatment options and the like.The first half of the book is interesting, but I found it difficult to read at times. The book is densely written and there are aspects of Heller's writing style I find a bit confusing. Sometimes the sentences seem choppy and the ideas incomplete. Also, like one of the other reviewers here, I thought that there were quite a lot of citations missing.All in all though, this book is on a very important topic, and is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great English, but easy reading. a must for history buffs.","review":"I read the old edition with pictures and maps from the Deschutes County Library, but sadly the second volume was not in the library.

And the reproduction quality is also not great, especially at the bottom of almost every page. But, to be honest, that doesn't upset me. The real problem is that I felt cheated, because nowhere in the title of the book or in the description it's said it's only the 2nd volume. I think Amazon is not to blame in this case, but the publisher could have described it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MAJOR PRE POST-WESTERN WORK","review":"Today, when there is little but propaganda on TV and at the bookstore, it is astonishing to read a 20th century English-speaking author write in a way devoid of the propaganda. I doubt that the work could be published as is today were it new, even if by such a well-known author. Those were the days of free, or at least freeer press.Because the time span is so great, more attention is paid to 19th Century history up to the end of WW I, where it stops than to older periods. But earlier periods are treated in ways according to the information available to the non-specialist. Wells' history is easier to read than that of the Durants and lacks their obvious bias. With the exception of Spengler, Wells' History is perhaps the last history or biography in which the European point of view is taken as matter-of-fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewing the kindle version, not Wells' content","review":"First I should thank Amazon Kindle Services for delivering history at such a cheap price. Unfortunately the book does not have a TOC and to read a large history book on a kindle without a way to navigate, other than sequential flow, is pretty painful. The images are also missing and only the names of the figures are there (ex. Fig 0027 - Some Mesozoic reptiles, but the figure itself is missing). The lack of figures is OK and I can live with that.

Here we see the harsh social realities faced by foundlings in the life of Beric, Roman child adopted from the sea by Britons during the Roman Empire -- when exactly isn't given. While I'm glad the attempt was made to show the harshness of life both in the north and then among the Romans there was still a bit of sugar-coating that is perhaps the result of wanting to respect our own morals or the result of a lack of knowledge. Thus the sexual terror and abuse of slavery is not mentioned and there is the idea that slaves have special clothes or jewelery to mark their status which is not the case unless one had been a runaway or a master really wanted to use a collar or brand or tattoo.

In fact, the subject of him being \\"blackballed\\" is barely mentioned. (It receives one paragraph in the Epilogue.) Robertson was the first person to suspect something was amiss at Columbia, but the book is actually about the power struggle between the President of Columbia, Alan Hirschfield, and the controlling interests of the shareholders, led primarily by Herbert Allen Jr. This is a long book, but it was so riveting that I found it difficult to put down. It is really well written, even if it does not paint any of the characters in a terribly sympathetic light. I can't help but think that if Hirschfield had shown more backbone in the beginning and stuck by his decision to fire the check-forger Begelman instead of caving in to Allen's demands, none of this epic battle would have happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Page is a Gift","review":"While I found Ordinary Graces to be not at all ordinary (other than that it related to me) and totally eye opening, Watch and Pray is entirely soul opening.

The songwriting is a bit stronger but the delivery is even weaker.'33 1/3' is an album drenched in a sea of fluid tones of flanger and electric piano, then a smattering of organs and synthesisers, and somewhere in the background are George's awkward, meandering vocals.The best song is probably the opening 'Woman don't cry for me'; it's straightforward and easier to understand the vocals. 'This song' and 'See yourself' are well delivered, the other songs are sloppier, although 'Beautiful Girl', 'Crackerbox Palace' and 'Dear One' are good songs.

The characters are not that convincing, and much of the humour is based on bad taste. But the play is not quite a flop. There are moments of suspense. There is some delightful comedy (especially when Bertram chooses to stay in battle rather than go home and marry Helena). And at times, Helena is memorable.

The establishment won in the end on the personal level, as Charlie never made general.Few military books name names and critique officers' shortcomings, or biases as this one does. When you finish reading you will understand the problems of creating a force such as Delta.

The creation of \\"Delta Force\\" is a topic that should interest all military history buffs. Col Beckwith gives a blow by blow account of the obstacles endured in creating Delta. He sometimes drowns you in the day to day bureacratic fight but the reader gets an appreciation for the difficulties he faced. Col Beckwith gives an excellent narrative of the fiasco at \\"Desert One\\" in 1980 while attempting to save the American hostages in Iran. It was a difficult time for all Americans and most would not wish to be reminded, but lessons are to be learned. And in order to learn those lessons Col Beckwith takes us back to that night in the desert. Overall a very informative read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner. Essential for Spec-ops library.","review":"I first thought that this book would probably be a bit dull, since it didn't have a lot of combat experiences in it, but is mostly about the formation of Delta. But it's now one of my favorite reads. A real page-turner, it only took me a couple weeks to get through it. I admit that it's enjoyment is probably limited to those with a serious interest in special ops. It has an honest and candid tone that lacks the the egoism of Marzcinko's book about SEAL Six. If your interested in learning more about Delta, I also reccomend reading Eric Haney's book, and Blackhawk Down. All three are very interesting and informative books, that take you inside, are hard to put down, and inspire profound respect for those who serve their country in this capacity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read","review":"This was a really good read, and who better to write about Delta Force than the creator and first commander? All and all it is a slow paced book, but it is straight forward and the time span is relatively small. You have to remember Col Beckwith founded Delta Force but as tradition goes he was only the commander for a few years. I would recommend Inside Delta Force by Eric Haney if you are going to get this book.

Perhaps if you like this kind of thing it's a great read. I found it overall a boring book. Finally, when it got to the failed hostage rescue I think he covered it in about 5 pages. I would not recommend it to MY friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to much detail about nothing","review":"All due respect to Colonel Beckwith, but he should have titled the book, 'Most of my years in the Army, Delta Force comes towards the end'. He goes into so much detail about all the B.S. he went through and whatnot. There are 4.5 million Generals you have to keep straight. Which ones are on his side, and which ones aren't. Then when you think you've got it down, he sprinkles in about 1.8 million more. It would be a great read for anyone who is looking to start another Tier One Counter-terrorist unit.

The only criticism is that he gives short schrift to the Ninth Symphony, including only 1 paragraph of analysis for such an important work!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carr's \\"Mahler\\" cooked up","review":"It's hard to believe that a book this thick and on such a compelling subject could be so disappointing. It begins ambitiously, and soon peaks with a single insightful paragraph drawing a parallel between the music of Berlioz and Mahler, but then gets down to the real business: lambasting poor old Alma, yet again. This exposition proves to be British in the worse sense--gossipy, slight, and tedious. Granted there's a ton of detail proving Alma wrote down the wrong date and time for the dinner party with Gustav, but do we really care? Carr moves in the direction of redeeming his effort with a compassionate and accurate account of Mahler's time in America, his final illness and death. That is 64 pages out of 254.

They not only make bulging tunnels, but make frequent access-to-the-surface holes (which have in turn become hornet or wasp nests), and occasionally kill plants. We tried everything -- tamping the tunnels down, flooding the tunnels with water, poisons (a matter of desperation, with a very short-lived effect), poundind pieces of reinforcing steel in tje tunnels, blocking the access holes with stones, etc. I gambled on one of these from Amazon, and it actually works.

Nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly Right","review":"The author gives a great explanation of the rope and cordage materials available, how to choose them for a particular application, and how to care for them. Most importantly, he tells you clearly when different sorts of rope should no longer be used for critical applications. This is wonderful, necessary information. He chooses the knots he presents very well indeed. He gives the practical knots everyone will want to use, and he tells succinctly what the proper use of each one is---as well as the limitations of its use. All this is great. I find that his instructions for tying the knots is sometimes too terse. The pictures are good enough, but just good enough. To get the full five stars, he would have to improve the tying instructions and give greater elaboration on how to test each particular knot before putting it in service. It's a great book. There's no reason it couldn't have been even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new low for both Troma and the British Empire","review":"The description of this sounded good, anyway, too bad the movie is about negative 50 on a scale of 1 to 5, with one being the lowest, so that's how I rated it. Strictly amateur hour stuff, with horrible acting, horrible effects, a lame plot, and SUPER DUPER bad production values. And yes I know that's what made Troma great. Or that's what THEY say, anyway. This reminded me of another terrible British flick I saw a few years ago called \\"Zombie Toxin\\" but none of the names seem to tie these together. Had I been in any way connected with \\"Zombie Toxin\\" I'd go under another name for the rest of my life to avoid detection, too, but I swear there's certain people in Evolved that were also in that other travesty.

So beware, the metal face plate may not be securily fastened to the back. Pulling the darts off the board may result in injuries. I am going to drill a hole through the face plate and back then use a nut, bolt, and washer to make sure the two pieces stay together.UPDATE:I called the factory yesterday and told them what had happened.

This is preferable to the 'felt/velcro' which, although good, doesn't have the 'smack' sound when target is hit.

It is about people and their search for solace and shelter in an uncaring world. The passage at the bottom of the statue, the time that it was built and erected, and its location, these seem to have more significance.Well, enough of my ramblings.

Amy Sedaris' comedic brilliance can't be outdone, and I'm sure I speak for fans everywhere when I say that another SWC movie would certainly be welcome.

Well, Amy Sedaris, Paul Dinello and Stephen Colbert once knew something about funny that no one else did. \\"Strangers with Candy\\" in movie form makes it clear that they've forgotten what they knew. For fans of the TV show, the best reason to skip this is Matthew Broderick has more screen time than Paul Dinello. For people new to \\"Strangers with Candy\\", just please watch any two or three episodes of the series (also on DVD) and skip this movie. I fear that using the movie as your first tow in the water will scare you away from what really is some fine comedy, in politically incorrect made-for-TV doses.

Doesn't this sound original? Will Amy help? Gawd, the suspense...And Amy Sedaris does a hideous impersonation of Jerry Lewis.

Same opinion from my husband, who has a high tolerance for gross humor and juvenile humor.The school board representatives were a small part, but they were actually funny, perhaps because the characters were *trying* to be discreet (without success), and they were only occassionally doing over-the-top humor.It was not funny, and certainly not endearing.I've never seen the series.

I found one of my frames in the book (with the maker's label) and photographed it and offered it to Eli Wilner & Co. The book said the value was 11,000 to 17,000 dollars. Wilner offered me $500. I much prefer \\"Collecting Picture and Photo Frames\\" by Schneider. Good large photos in color and reasonable values. Don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 6 things WRONG with this watercolor set","review":"1. The paints do not mix as true colors; no color learning for your child. Red and blue make mud; yellow and blue make mud; yellow and red make mud. This is because all the colors are diluted with white and other pigments and do not mix true. A cheap alternative to real paints.2. The pans of paint are very shallow and get used up in the first use. Another super cheap trick. Your kids will get maybe 3 paintings out of this set.3. Made in China; says non-toxic but what does that really mean in China these days?4. Overpriced at any price.5. Huge waste of plastic and our international shipping lanes.6. I expect more from Melissa and Doug. Cheapens their product line."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're.......okay","review":"They look cool, the color wells are large and the color is fine. But they're not hard watercolors, they're more gel-like. They lasted two sessions with my two year olds. If you hover while your kids paint they might work for you. If, like me, you let your kids go crazy, they don't last long enough to be any kind of value, even at the extremely reduced price I paid. Go with the Crayola ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Not enouch paint. My daugther blew thru this in one sitting.

The petty case is the only nice thing about them.They are used up in one session, are watery and hard to use.I wonder why Melissa and Doug hasn't come up with a different recipe to make their colors richer yet!Maybe they haven't heard that there are watercolors out there that actually work!I'm so disappointed...don't waste your money on this product.I grew up in Germany and am used to watercolors from Pelikan ( they can be found at amazon). Those are by far the best colors I've ever used. They last long and are super rich. I used them even in art class all the way up to my teen years. Super great product! A bit more expensive I think $12.- for a set of 12 colors) but it comes with a tube of white, so you can mix pastels yourself which teaches about colors and shades etc. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little paint","review":"Paint is fine, not super vibrant, but fun colors...my daughter was excited.

Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"they don't last","review":"Although these were a BIG hit with my three-year-old, the paints lasted about 10 paintings, or three painting sessions.

I've heard that Crayola makes better paints so I plan to try those.

We ran out of yellow on the first piece of paper. Three (large) sheets of paper later there's nothing left. You might expect that kind of quality/quantity if you bought paints at the dollar store, but several dollar Melissa and Doug? The case might be nice, but who cares if you only get to use it twice? Brushes pretty standard poor quality kids ones. Learn from our mistakes, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying this product","review":"I have nothing good to say about this product. Like some other reviewers noted, the colors are very pale. The most disappointing thing, however, is the fact that the case contains hardly any paint at all.

What a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Long Lasting","review":"The paint is relatively soft and doesn't take much water to get them ready to use.

However, this one disappoints. The amount of paint in this product is not at all Jumbo. I have bought other brand jumbo sets that have lasted for months. This one literally last two days. The paints are extremely shallow and are used up quickly. Very disappointing and not at all in line with the high standards usually found in Melissa and Doug products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Crayola paints","review":"I love Doug and Melissa toys but the paints really aren't as good as the Crayola watercolors I bought at Target. The colors are not as saturated, and my daughter really didn't enjoy painting with them. No amount of water or pressure or amount of paint on the brush changed the fact that the colors are just really weak. I hope we'll use them up someday, but I went out and bought Crayola watercolors again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun paint!","review":"My little girl loves to paint and draw.

The first day we used them, they were great -- vibrant, pretty colors. After that, they turned into a thick, gummy mess.

It also includes Kana and Hiragana in the back of it, as well as there stroke orders. This is the second revised edition 1961, the book says it can take you to a 6th grade level of writing if you learn all that is in it, however standards have slightly changed... The amount of characters learned per grade, and the characters learned in each grade has somewhat changed from the publication of this book. For instance one can even tell its age looking at the first page where it lists Shi as Four, this was changed well over two decades ago because Shi also means death and makes many Japanese feel uncomfortable using it.This is a great book, but I suggest the third revised edition (2003) as its more up to modern standards, not that this edition is bad in any way, you just might find yourself using some outdated characters here and there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful AEM Book","review":"I give this book 5 stars.

Given that library cataloging requires diligence and great attention to detail, it is frustrating that Hsieh-Yee did not given the same attention to her book.

There's some studly looking dudes in this one. However, other than Nathan Watkins as Chris and Josh Hammond as his buddy, the rest of the acting is junior high level. Especially Bradley Stryker, the hunk who plays head guy Devon. Elizabeth Bruderman is simply awful as the female lead, a whiny voice delivering lines like she was a recorded answering machine voice.

Perhaps when Makepeace's own novel is published - and as a publishing professional myself, I doubt his turgid style would find an audience - perhaps then he will come to understand the harm a mocking review can do to a first-time author.For those yet to read Mallalieu's work - prepare yourself for a fleshy feast of literary originality and dryly sardonic, witty, and intelligent writing. In this age of dumbed-down, easy-to-read pap centred on midddle-class ennui and whingeing - Mallalieu is refreshing to read.

Sadly, the flesh is meagre and quickly becomes a bloated bloodless corpse becalmed in a sea of ennui. Too often we see young writers tackle great themes only to founder in their own syntax. Sadly, there are no great themes and Mallalieu is not a young writer but an aged academic who has spent to much time in libraries and not enough on the Main, hoisting himself through the lubber's-hole over the futtock shrouds. Tales of Adventure on the high seas these ain't. Rather, a prolix insight into one man's wasted life in the cafeterias and chat-rooms of an East-Anglian polytechnic.

How the men fighting it out on the front felt? What it was like in those frightening moments just before a life-or-death battle?Steinbeck brings his extraordinary insight and simple, deliberately understated prose style to the field of war reporting. And the result is breathtaking. In this collection of dispatches from the Second World War, Steinbeck looks at one oft-ignored aspect of the war - the man on the field. For whom the war wasn't strategies and troop movements, but a constant struggle to stay alive, preferably unhurt. For whom the war did not mean liberty and freedom as much as the price of potatoes and a job to go home to. It is a considerate look at the common man, who has been thrust into a war not of his own choosing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good folks to work with","review":"Product was as advertised.

It didn't bend on the straight edge side (the side you use with the bubbles), it bent sideways. Strangely enough, I was able to \\"bend it back\\" in place and it seems to work fine (I checked it againtst my other levels) but I guess the fact that it is so long and light (the \\"good\\" things about it) are the same things which make it so weak.

Wanna know how I know? Well, whenever I turn on a light in my kitchen it powers down the whole unit. My other equipment plugged into the same outlet is working just fine. I have to turn the power back on to the unit, and then I have to reset my Onkyo. Umm, that's not why I bought this. I bought this for power failures. Not to create power failures.

No maddening guitar riffs, no dirty sex lyrics, nothing left that used to define Mudhoney as the grandfathers of grunge. They used to be good, now I want ot vomit.Instead of this, buy their self titled album and 'Super Bigmuff plus Early Singles.' Those both hold up even with age. If you have both of those and want something contemporary, get into the Queens of the Stone Age, Mondo Generator, Eagles of Death Metal, and the Desert Sessions. Bands like these carry on the tradition of the grunge greats, not in their sound but in their attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I have read books written for children that were better than this. The grammar was grade-school level, the punctuation was horrendous, the wording simplistic. For example, on page 28 Tyler writes, \\"Let me illustrate these two types of suggestions that can be got from these reports...\\" Even the back cover, in a tribute to the author, has commas that don't belong.

There are few curriculum writers or decision makers that don't follow the methods advocated by Tyler, in part if not in whole. The style is clear and easy to read, and furthermore, as one reads through, one realises that Tyler was advocating other developments like outcomes and standards years before they became (in)famous and incorporated in edu-speak. The best modern book on curriculum is by John Biggs (\\"Teaching for quality learning at university\\") and he pays tribute to the influence of Tyler's book on his own work. Unfortunately Tyler's is one of those books that everyone has read ABOUT but few have actually read.

I wanted to like this one. Its not that the writing or characters were bad. Quite the contrary, I enjoyed much of the story. What left a sour taste in my mouth was the obvious contradiction of the Chronoliths.Chronoliths appear from the future altering our present to lead to a situation that generates the Chronoliths in the future? I don't buy it. Just take a moment and think it through logically. If you are satisified with your present status, do you do something to alter the past? No. If you are not satisfied with your present, then you do something to alter the past, so your present existence will change. You can't alter the past dramatically to keep the same present existence. It's not a paradox, it's nonsense. That's why this book gets only 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was excited to read this book as advertised on Amazon, but found it to be lacking in closure. The story dwells too much with the main charater's relationships with his ex-wife and daughter. It boils down to a man's quest for meaning and purpose in his life and relationships with friends.

Is it perhaps that very havoc which creates the conditions which foster his rise to power? Is he indeed a real figure?Troughout the story we find the same people inexplicably drawn back into the drama.

It wasn't worth finishing. I just could not get into the very slow relationship stories in this book that are typically an integral part of RCW's books.

I really liked both Sphere and Blind Lake, but not this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The picture on the front cover and summary on the back made the book seem WAY more interesting then it actually was.

A casual observation can be lightly skipped over...then draw the reader back as the meaning becomes profound. An example: \\"the key act of stoicism is denial, the firm refusal to capitulate to an awful truth.\\"The downside of a Wilson novel is that it is sometimes depressing. Gloomy. If hope is available, it is only hinted at in the last few pages. In the case of Chronoliths, I read the story straight through so that I could arrive beyond the misery before I slept.Overall, I felt the novel is destined to become a classic. Highly recommended with the proviso noted above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I'm no snobby critic, so I really enjoyed this book! It is a Great concept and great read!

There are much better sci-fi novels and collections out there, you just have to look harder to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Story Just Lagged on and on.","review":"I almost didn't finish this one. It has a great plot - obelisks that pop up everywhere with no explanation, other that they are from the future. In the end the story doesn't hold together. Too much time was spent on people that didn't hold your interest, while the real story was about the these \\"chronoliths,\\" which I felt was under-discussed or treated in the story. The author tried to make the characters have intensity of emotion, etc., but I felt it was too contrived. It's your gamble on this one. But if your like me and what a fast paced and interesting sci-fi story, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged, and then floundered.","review":"I thought the reviews would lead me to a wonderful book. Instead I found one where the premise was just compelling enough to get me to buy it, the intial plot lines enough to get me to read it, and an ending so bland that I skimmed through the end of the book just to finish it and then threw it in the garbage. Nice beginning... fair middle... lousy ending. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing concept, good story, but....","review":"The concept presented here is fresh and fascinating, and the story and characters are nicely presented and not overwrought. The story progresses at a brisk pace, and wastes little time with trivialities, and takes some unpredictable, interesting turns. Thankfully (for this reader), Wilson doesn't go over the top with what could have been a deep foray into the mind-boggling physics/paradoxical side of the subject.Ultimately, though, the ending was a little dissatisfying. I would have liked some of the loose ends wrapped up a little better. I think you'll know what I mean when you get there.... It's a fairly quick, read, though, and well worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This is one of those books you keep reading because you hope that eventually something significant will happen or that some revelation will be made. By the end of the book, you are still waiting. I closed the book and pronounced \\"What a disappointment\\". You don't know anything more about the chronoliths on page 300 then you did on page 10 and nothing significant is revealed about the conflicts caused by the appearance of the chronoliths. Not a bad read, but no substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, intereting, but....","review":"This book has pretty interesting idea with it and Wilson did a wonderful writing.

The pumice adds some real scrubing action and you can feel it working hard on your skin. The scent is very pleasant and subtle. It is very creamy and thick and stays on the skin (my last foot scrub was mostly on the tub floor) until you wash it off. The most surprising aspect of it though is that it did not dry my skin and left my feet extremely soft and in no need for moisturizing. It is a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way, so it's worth it in my opinion. I have a feeling this will be my best friend over the summer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A so-so record, but all the material is available elsewhere.","review":"\\"Tonight At Noon\\" is an album of leftovers-- half of it is taken from the sessions for \\"The Clown\\", half of it from the sessions for \\"Oh Yeah\\". Charles Mingus was batting consistently high during this period, and at least one piece from each of these sessions is essential in his catalog (\\"Tonight At Noon\\" and \\"Peggy's Blue Skylight\\"). The balance of the material is ok, but either a bit uninspired (\\"Old Blues for Walt's Torin\\") or lifeless (\\"Passions of a Woman Loved\\").Having stated that, the deluxe edition reissues of \\"The Clown\\" and \\"Oh Yeah\\" include all this material. I'd recommend skipping this one and going with those. My rating reflects the inconsistency of the material and the lack of reasonable value. Still, if you've got those two records, pick this up for 'Tonight' and 'Peggy', you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Because","review":"I can remember many older hillbilly performers singing \\"Just Because\\", most of them were copying the performace by Mac Wiseman.

What I found to be most interesting is her assertion that the integration of masculine and feminine qualities, as related to mind theory, leads to optimal adult identity development. Her use of the Psyche and Eros myth is fascinating, and if you're a fan of Jung, particularly enthralling. I found myself examining my own life and relationships in the author's terms and recognizing society's perpetuation of the myth. A good read, but only if you're serious about adult identity development."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book, But It Seems A Little Short","review":"I enjoyed it alot even though I could read it twenty times a day because it is so short.

Deeply religious and determined to become a priest like his uncle, Andrew finds his resolve tested by a platonic friendship with his beautiful classmate, Eun-ha (Aeh Soo, A FAMILY), herself an orphan. Completing the love triangle is the pair's mutual friend Woo-jin (Jin-hee Ji, DAE JANG GEUM), whose growing attraction to Eun-ha sparks Andrew's jealousy and makes him further question his choice of a religious life.

While Mr. Parlette does appear to have a basic knowledge of the brain and its anatomy, the 'exercises' he details in his book in no way give the reader any indication of how they are supposed to enhance brain functioning. If a book is supposed to improve my cognitive abilities, I would appreciate references that back up the predictions as well as some sort of follow-up plan to denote any supposed improvements, neither of which I found in this book.

Four or five months into wearing the belt, I started noticing that the leather on the brown side is starting to crack. That side has completely cracked through to the next layer, and now I have to be pretty careful not to stress the belt too much when I put it on.It was a good-looking belt to begin with, and the buckle itself is very solid and nice, but it will not stand up to everyday use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"This is easily the worst belt I have ever owned. The leather is stiff and difficult to bend around into the buckle. The \\"brown\\" is so dark it is barely distinguishable from the black. Worst of all, the three layers began to separate at the point where it goes through the buckle on the first wearing. Not to mention that the bends at the buckle have set in so severely in just a few wearings that it will look awful if I gain or lose enough weigh to move to a different notch. All I can say for it is that the buckle is quite attractive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Chinese Crap","review":"First, just like 99% of all clothes and apparel sold in USA it is made in China. Second, after just 2 weeks of wear the pieces of leather started to come apart and the hole tore and very noticeable marks developed. Don't buy this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad belt design, especially for Geof. Beene","review":"This belt is a nightmare to use. It is so thick that you cannot insert it in the metal belt slot next to the buckle. The space provided is too small to allow this thick belt to be bent and slid into the metal slot. Thus you can only hope to insert it into the belt loop on your trousers provided you have sufficent length.This was a waste of money and I wish I had returned it before starting to use it. Of course your advertising description was too vague and photos did not show these short comings.Anybody at Amazon want a belt?How about my money back??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Purple Incense Passion Flower","review":"I wasn't happy because when it bloomed, it was a more common variety than a Purple Incense Passion Flower that I ordered.

They loved it, and it was really fun.But the thing started falling apart very quickly. The rubber coating that keeps the air came off, so air would leak out very quickly. I bought it for them for Christmas, and three months after Christmas, it couldn't even hold three small children.The warranty is only 90 days. When I called about returning it, they said I was two weeks too late. (It's probably such a short warranty because they know that it won't last 6 months.)It's a great toy if you're rich and you can afford to spend money like this for something that won't last long. But if you aren't so rich, then you won't be as happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment!","review":"I bought this for my 2 and a half year old who loves to climb and jump around, and was outgrowing his smaller baby climbers. He just loves this! It provides tons of excercise and tires them out fast. It is quite large and heavy, but well worth if, you'll definitly need someone's help to move it around while deflated. Just an FYI- It's funner with more than one child, because it has two sides to the obstacle course, my son has more fun when he has someone to compete against. His sister is thirteen, and she often finds herself in the bouncer too. This would be great for someone with two children around the same age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item!","review":"I just set up this bouncer for the first time and it was very easy. The kids loved it and I am so happy I didn't buy a regular bouncer as the obstacle course kept them occupied for hours. I have noticed with regular bouncers the kids lose interest after 5-10 minutes. Not with the obstacle course - I think the kids played for at least 1.5 hours before finally taking a little break. It wasn't that difficult to put away (it helped to have an extra set of hands). The product is well made and I couldn't be happier. I also feel lucky as I bought this 2 weeks ago from Amazon and paid $299, wow, the price has gone up. Well, worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make more princes & knights please... we love them!","review":"We love this prince!

Thinking about looking for the right person by being a love recruiter for your own (YOU) company and \\"interviewing\\" love candidates for the \\"job\\" of Loving you seemed strange at first, but as I got deeper and deeper into the plan I realized how much sense the Advice Sisters make. When I got this book I read it from cover to cover for an entire day and evening. I just couldn't put it down! I've NEVER posted a review before on Amazon, but this book deserves mention. It is for everyone who HATED \\"THE RULES\\" and dating books in general--totally different. If you are single or know someone who is, you gotta get this book. It's timely, fun, and intelligent. For the first time in nearly two decades I'm re-thinking the way I look at all my relationships, and it is WORKING!

I can't wait to see what they come up with next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me","review":"The idea of following a plan to find love appealed to me since I'd tried just about everything else with zero success. Dunham and Freedman showed me how to assess myself and get organized to find the \\"right\\" one instead of just, as they say, \\"Ms. You'll Do.\\" They were right- looking for love is a lot like a job search. I was surprised to find I'd been looking for love in all the wrong faces and places. Easy to read--but like others have said here, the message in this book actually changed my way of thinking about myself and dating. That's pretty remarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look closely","review":"That other reviewer is right.

The head of the lab just keeps saying they were wrong and to \\"keep trying.\\" Well, once a kid has lost count inside his or her head, there is no way to keep trying to make a certain number unless you can see what you have already done.

It's like listening to war stories from those who made it back, with each story leaving you wanting more. The writers are all British soldiers, and span quite a few phases of the war. Each account is around 3-5 pages long; most are stories of a specific incident, but some are more of an overall picture of the serviceman's (or servicewoman's) experience. Although the stories are grouped generally by front or battle, knowledge of WWI history is not required. These stories are surprisingly detailed, even though they were written down about a dozen years after the war. This is the sort of history that doesn't make it into the history books. Highly recommended for those interested in learning more about life in the trenches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragoon Storm","review":"This attack type rocks the stadium!

It is not a large grill, but every inch of this grill is crafted to make it useful... which means it acts like a grill that takes up more space. It gets very hot, and stays very hot. It took 30 minutes to put together - a fact that made several friends cry after losing a weekend of their lives putting together other grills. I have also purchased the side burner and pizza stone, which are nice additions. The customizable surfaces are awesome, ESPECIALLY the dishwasher safe cutting board surface.My only complaint is that it did come dented - but both amazon and the company made up for it.

The electric start never worked and the food cooked very unevenly. The rear of the grill was well done and the front was medium.

The Toshiba 2032SP won't last more than about 36 hours on a full charge of this new battery. Horrible performance from a cell phone (and don't forget, this is a cell phone). The TFT screen is dim and fuzzy even at it's most intense brightness setting. At it's lowest, power-saver friendly setting it is so dim and illegible as to cause headaches.

It is not the rig for chasing huge fish, but I have caught pike on mine, and my son caught a four pound bass with his the first weekend he used it. This is a serious light spinning outfit. I recommend getting a second spool and filling one spool with four pound line and one with six. The four pound line works great with this rod and reel for things like crappies and smallmouth bass. Much more fun than just hauling them out of the water with a stiff rod and ten or twelve pound line. Six pound gives better results where there are weeds or bottom obstructions - you don't lose so much terminal tackle. The plastic latches on the case will wear with time, so I use a large elastic band to hold them closed.

This album rivals anything that other fellow Canadian rockers of that era released (e.g. Loverboy, Honeymoon Suite).

I find that most books have a lot of pictures but little explaination or little explanation that I can understand. This book was very straight forward. The explanations the author gives are very easy to understand, but not so basic that you feel like he's talking down to you. I also found the illustrations to be very useful. I sometimes find that the pictures in books can be confusing or misleading. The sketches in this book make it very easy to see what the rider is trying to point out.I have really found this book to be a big help. The ideas are a little different then what I have been used to seeing but they have worked very well.

Lo's \\"I'm Glad\\"), no-name-brand r&b (\\"Hell Yeah\\" by Ginuwine), sterile pop-rock (\\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" by Counting Crows), and silly kiddie fare (\\"Girlfriend\\" by B2K).

Some of these songs failed to chart or failed to reach the Top 40. I suggest that the NOW series ends, at least until the state of radio improves or they can put some ligitimate hits on an album.

Lincoln himself never even remotely approached it. It is genuinely stupendous. But let us not forget that it is poetry, not logic; beauty, not sense. Think of the argument in it. Put it into the cold words of everyday. The doctrine is simply this: that the Union soldiers who died at Gettysburg sacrificed their lives to the cause of self-determination -- that government of the people, by the people, for the people, should not perish from the earth. It is difficult to imagine anything more untrue. The Union soldiers in the battle actually fought against self-determination; it was the Confederates who fought for the right of their people to govern themselves.\\" -- H.L.

There's a lot of nice history here -- context, de-bunking of myths, personality quirks, and (Wills' fav) ironies -- but the auxiliary geek material is presented with the same brio as the rest, calling into question the author's sense of proportion.That said, it's great.

For a while it seems Edward Everett is the focus, then the history of ancient cemeteries looms largest, with rambling discussions of Greek and Roman resting places and their evolution from urban to rural, etc. etc. etc. I suppose in all fairness, I should mention that Gettysburg, the place, is the subject. Do yourself a favor: visit the Memorial, skip the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A defining moment in American history","review":"Author Garry Wills is unequivocal in his admiration for Abraham Lincoln and his brief speech, which became arguably the most famous oration of American history. In this fascinating book, he places the Gettysburg Address in context, explaining the political philosophy that inspired it, the literary precedents that gave it form, and the social/historical milieu that influenced the individuals who were present. There are many interesting tidbits here, including the culture of death that existed in the 19th century and the way it influenced the evolution of cemeteries, the influence of classical Greek oratory on the structure of the address, and Lincoln's careful attention to the written word."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"Garry Wills has written a marvelous and meanigful book that adds luster and new life to a speech that most of us heard and did not fully appreciate in school. He suggests that the few words marked a transition in American thought that not many recognized at the time. Taking the ideas back to their intellectual and emotional bases, he emphasises in part just how different the world view was when the speech was given. Language and ideas have chnaged so profoundly that we may not understand that we do not understand. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lincoln at Gettysburg","review":"As the title suggests, Wills really does portray how Lincoln's Gettysburg Address remade America. Throughout the book Wills does a great job of explaining how Lincoln was influenced by the early Greeks, 19th century transcendentalists, and Romanticism. Instead of criticizing Lincoln like most authors try to do, Wills tried to explain how Lincoln's vision was based on Liberty and Equality. Overall, explaining that the majority of the Gettysburg Address was based on the Declaration of Independence. Wills stresses the fact that our society is partly based on the Gettysburg Address, and sometimes stressing it too much. This is the only flaw I've found in the book. After reading this book my view on Lincoln's 250 or so word essay and greatly changed in a good light. I highly reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"making greeting cards that last into the 21st century!","review":"Thisis a book all about making greeting cards and stationary.

Through many interviews of German resisters, this film demonstrates how their consciences were aroused by the atrocities and brutal violation of civil liberties they witnessed and endured. It's a shame that not only were they persecuted by their own countrymen, no country outside of Germany took any interst in the German resistance movement enough so to lend them a hand. It's a history that ought not to be forgotten, especially these days when our own country is losing its civil liberties while the masses remain indifferent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, intelligent and fascinating","review":"This documentary explores a much under-examined element of Hitler'sGermany. German citizens, some of high army rank or social status, whorisked everything, and usually forfeited their lives to try to stopHitler.These people had nothing to gain, and everything to lose. They could ofgone along quietly, and kept their lives and their life styles, Butinstead they trade it all to fight for an ideal.The film-making itself can be a bit dry; lots of talking heads, WW IIfootage and stills, and fairly dispassionate sounding narrators tellingus the facts. But the stories themselves are heartbreaking - especiallythe desperate attempts to warn the outside world what was coming,getting only mistrust and indifference in response.Also remarkable are the bits of actual footage from the show trials theNazi's gave these men before killing them. Their quiet, brave dignityin the face of death is deeply powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"What took so long?","review":"Why did it take so long for this history of the German resistance to the Nazi's emerge? The most important thing this film reveals is that many people, some inside the oligarchy, some inside the military, begged England for assistance in eliminating Hitler early on, yet England refused help in any way? To this day, many believe Sophie Scholl and Count Staffenberg were the only ones sacrificing their lives by defying the Nazis, when they just represent the tip of the iceberg. Even though it meant certain death to resist, thousands were defying the establishment and trying to organize without outside help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Info - if you can ignore the production value","review":"The book is full of very informative and elusive information about how our monetary system works behind the scenes. The author has taken great pains to explain and in some cases prove his points, and reveals some really scarry information. It's question and answer style was a little hard to take at first, but it's not written for it's style, but it's content. I would give it a 5 if it weren't for it's style.

It's very low budget and it was dissappointing to see Ernest in something so stupid.The story was cheesy, flimsy, and stupid. The actors (excluding Ernest himself) were horrible, and it was altogether just cheesy. Ernest also wasn't very funny in this one at all. His co-star, that dumb waitress who goes along with Ernest to Africa was so mean and stupid I just wanted to slap her across the face.

Every baby knows this, that's why they so strongly resist sleeping alone. Forcing a baby to become independent before they are ready to do so is unhelpful, unrealistic, and damages the bond between parent and child. Would the authors recommend forcing a rose to bloom?Solitary sleeping in early childhood is one of the main reasons so many adults in our culture have sleep disorders.

This, of course, did not render them editable, searchable, or anything of the sort.This product is supposed to have OCR built in. It simply didn't activate the OCR on what was clearly text (albeit scanned), and processed each page as if it were a picture.I was running the product on NT 4.0.

If you are a dad, you need this book. If you have suffered the consequences of being fathered poorly, you need this book. It is informative, spiritually centered on the greatest model of fathers (God himself), and highly motivational. It is not flooded with pscho-babble, but neither does it dismiss the value of an analytical approach to fathering.

It is now the fountainhead of worldwide terrorist activity and now also of nuclear proliferation. Apparently, there is no qualitative difference between Pakistani government and al-Qaeda.

He also says that with the booming population in America, our economy has grown and it has caused more people to compete with jobs.I also respect the fact that McKibben is open in talking about his vascetomy knowing that a condom is not the best tool in not getting pregant because they break 4.8 percent of the time and he startles the reader by saying that 60 percent of pregancies are unintended because of this risk of the condom breaking.Overall a well written piece that is fair and balanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argument Based on Fallacy","review":"Why did I have to even give it one star?

If he had chosen to focus on a way to slow population growth and improve economies in the developing nations and thereby probably reduce the rate of immigration his argument would be stronger but since he didn't it doesn't matter what he says because once the core reason for his book is proven wrong, why should we believe any other argument he wishes to make?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So many bad ideas in so few pages.","review":"I am not a pro-natalist, but the anti-birth crowd certainly miss the boat here.

The moles built another outlet about 2ft from their other hole and about half way between the 2 mole chasers. I am going to leave them in operation to see if they will drive the moles off. Right now, I am skeptical that the mole chasers will do any better than they have done so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't think it works","review":"I purchased several for my first house and I thought they chased the moles to the neighbors yards.

We play Sims City 4 all the time on our PC. Unfortunately, we were really disappointed with the DS version, probably since we are so used to the interface and features of SC 4. I understand this is more like playing Sim City 3000, which I didn't play.We found it hard to make the city and the city is hard to see on the screen. You can't cut through the zones to make new roads - at least I haven't figured out how. I also don't like that you can only make one city at a time. You have to erase the city to start a different one. We are used to making 5 or more cities at one time on the SC4 - I guess we got spoiled. But if you are trying to share the game with another person, you would really need 2 games since you would probably each want your own city. At least that is what I was hoping for. I know the DS limits the options, but I was really disappointed with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"I didn't think the game was much fun at all. In fact, I tried to return it the next day and ended up having to take a cheap trade-in on it because I wanted to get rid of it so badly.

A great way to end a long day!! A must for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joy in every day","review":"This is a book that helps you see the world with fresh eyes and a generous heart. Jim Atwell has a knack for elevating the experiences of daily life - some charming and quirky, others poignant and painful, some just seemingly mundane - into the realm of the profound, the beautiful and the joyful. Though his world may seem circumscribed by the tiny, rural community of Fly Creek in upstate New York, that is simply the window through which we walk with him into a wider world of human behavior as he ponders the world of meaning in the doleful eyes of sheep, the world fame of the town kazoo band, and the lives of neighbors who befriend and transform him from a citified academic escaping the pain of his young wife's death into a new and vibrant, occasionally adept, farmer. These are tales that can give guidance to anyone intrigued by a life's journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a friend talking to you","review":"Reading From Fly Creek is like listening to a good-humored friend, a friend looking at the passing parade from a country setting. Atwell's tales of unique persons and lively creatures are so filled with fine detail that \\"we are there,\\" wherever he wants to take us. The song of his prose enchants us, especially when writing about Cooperstown's baseball aura and the Salvation Army kettle incident. And, oh yes, don't miss the delightful sketch of the mouse in the bed or the last page's inspiring motto. This is a book to read and re-read.

Well, here is your chance to find out. The Devil In Velvet is vintage John Dickson Carr. Our hero, 58 year old Nicholas Fenton, makes a deal with old Satan himself, and finds himself a spry 26 year old in the year 1675. He started his journey in the year 1925. He quickly finds that old Sir Nicholas Fenton was a harsh, brutal man of his times, who openly kept a mistress and virtually ignored his wife. Infused with the new Nicholas Fenton, Sir Nicholas becomes a man of honor, courage, integrity and deep passion. He must also solve the mystery of his wife's poisoning. His journey is not without danger and adventure as only Carr can write it. Carr uses old English to accentuate the difference in times. This is also his steamiest novel as he builds the tension turned passion between Sir Nicholas, Lydia and Mary. And has Nicholas discovered a way to outwit the devil? Don't miss this one! This is Carr at his best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any serious Carr collector","review":"This book should be on every serious Carr collectors bookshelf.

One of the gay guys is found dead and all fingers point to the religious zealot.That's all I'll reveal about the plot. What transpires next is a movie that feels it has a lot to say--on a subject that needs in-depth discussion--but get mired down by unbelievable twists and turns which turns this movie MUTE. Most of the characters introduced in this movie are so transparent you can see through them like used Neutrogena.The filmmakers may have thought they hit a bullseye with their movie, but they were way off target. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional depiction of the reality of hate based bias in America","review":"This is a story of how some religious groups encourage and fuel the fires of hatred of gay people. It also shows the difference between religions being fair to Christianity . The story is quite real to life the depiction of a gay couple, showing the normalcy of their lives until the extremist hatred of the most radical Christians moves in next door . In America, this kind of hatred exists and manifests it's self frequently . A must see for all families . I believe this to be a good film for all ages.

Otherwise, it's a good collection of his opinions, and opinionated he certainly was. It also includes his introduction to The American Democrat by James Fenimore Cooper, various magazine articles (including two published just before his stroke), and some previously unpublished letters.The major value in Mencken's writings is that he thought outside of the mainstream.

(I'm sure there must be a story there, but I don't know what it is.) The music they created was described as easy-listening symphonic music, and that is spot-on. Bagpipes do not predominate in the music, only appearing in a couple of the tracks. The music is predominantly created by stringed instruments, but other instruments round out the music.Overall, I found this to be pretty darn good music.

(signed) Mike Levy, publisher, TEXAS MONTHLY"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"The Borderland is one of those rare novels which manages to draw you in so completely that you feel a hearty sense of loss after you turn the last page. It is rich and romantic, large and scathing, and funny and true. Though the book is a historic novel centered around the early days of Texas and the settlement of Austin, it's scope is much greater. It captures the spirit of men taking on the magnificent and the impossible and the persistence and heart which manage to propel them to success. The characters are unforgettable and the prose is vivid and engaging. If you want to read something which will make you laugh and cry and think, by all means, read The Borderland. And check out one of the author's earlier novels, Blessed McGill.

While I think his portrayal of a a brutal time in a dangerous land is probably right on, his narration of the events sounds like something out of a Penthouse Forum. I don't mind the characters speaking in a vulgar way, but for the narrator to choose words that are clearly unneeded to develop the story is really too bad. I was disgusted for the last time within 100 pages of starting it and proceeded to do something I have never done - threw the book in the airport trashcan.

I strongly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Comanche Moon","review":"Contrary to the dust jacket hype, Bud Shrake's writing does not compare favorably to McMurtry. While having an interesting plot for fans of Texas history, the use of telepathy and a yeti as plot devices is not very convincing (nor was the ghost of Deets by McMurtry). Sloppy editing is also apparent in several places, especially when the climactic confrontation of the two main protagonists at the end of the book just fizzles out to nothing.I really hoped for better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deft touch and winsome observations","review":"Connie Cronley's \\"Sometimes a Wheel Falls Off\\" is a collection of wry observations and smothered giggles. Each piece, originally drafted for NPR, has a deft and gentle humor reminiscent of the Talk of the Town brief assays from the New Yorker. Ms. Cronley describes the small universe of her home and cats, her cosy neighborhood, and the larger world she visits when she travels. But some essays are more worldly than these perfectly crafted intimate essays. She provides wise and thoughtful analysis of well known authors and their work. The best part of this collection is the voice of a friend, admiting fraility and finding gentle humor in the vagaries of her life. It's a thinking person's inspiration.

In this book you encounter the average Eritrean and their story during the tough times of the war. Their commitment, dedication, tenacity and strong will power shines through and highlights the superhuman effort of the Eritrean people's David & Goliat struggle against its oppressor Ethiopia and the superpowers of the world (Soviet, US, Israel etc..)....Dan Connell has written a truly impressive book on the Eritrean struggle for freedom, based on years and years spent in the area during the war, this is an essential read about Black Africa's most ingenious society."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Future of Opening Books","review":"The design of this book is very helpful in mastering an opening.

The book is easy to read and look at, with plenty of key diagrams, the most important illustration of positions colored in blue, which helps to remember it. The book _is_ expensive, but if you plan on playing the Pirc for the rest of your life, this is the book to get.

The only 'con' I could mention is that I was surprised at how long a section of plastic had to be threaded through the 'gripper device' (I don't know what else to call it) before that section of the strap was 'gripped'. So, on one of the short pieces, at least 25% of the plastic strap is unusable because it has to be threaded a 'decent distance' into the gripper piece before it 'takes hold'. This may be true of other brands, but as I recall, other such ties I've used in the past 'grabbed' the plastic strap without having to thread-it-through so much.

Rain of Gold did so much to change my perspective on the Mexican experience in this century, and I felt a longing to know what happened to Lupe and Salvadore after their marriage ceremony. This story really came through, showing their growth as a couple along with their individual spiritual growth. This story is about growing into real adulthood and loosing our childish self centeredness. It's about discovering how incredible a person can be, and how far limits can be pushed."},{"rating":"1","title":"frantic and disappointing","review":"I really looked forward to reading this book. I had read Rain of Gold in Spanish, and actually I read this one in Spanish too. Mamma mia! I have never read a book with so many exclamation marks. All the bolded phrases about Papito Dios etc became quite annoying as time went on. The story related in this book was also tedious and silly. I'm sure his parents were great- the photos are the best part of the book- but I began skimming about halfway through because I couldn't bear the hysterical and preachy tone anymore. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhelpful psychobabble","review":"I don't have a general dislike for self-help books or psychiatry, but I finally understand what people mean when they talk about \\"psychobabble\\", thanks to this book. It's a substance-less paeon to the \\"inner self\\" and the author's own recovery from a terribly traumatic childhood. There's hardly anything helpful here for someone who is just plain perfectionist, and not trying to recover from much bigger demons such as physical and sexual abuse by their parents. I also don't recommend this book to anyone who believes in the concept of objective moral rights and wrongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Deserve the High Marks","review":"With all due respect to the author, I found this to be one of the least helpful books I've read on perfectionism and related concepts. While I appreciate the author's sincerety and efforts, the work reminded me of a nice and fluffy John Gray book. In a nutshell: not much meat, not that well written, and not especially insightful. It lacked sound logic and clarity. Much of it didn't ring true to me. I don't think it deserves the high marks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book makes good sense","review":"I've read a few books on perfectionism and this one explains it in a way helps me do something about it and not just think being hard on myself is the right thing to do.

A friend \\"borrowed\\" the first one and never returned it! But I can't blame her because this book is a delight to the eye and a treasure trove of ideas for the shady yard. I must say that I do not have a green thumb, but my once lackluster yard now supports a huge assortment of hosta in every shade of green. You have to love a plant that flourishes in shade, comes up every year with very little care and doubles its size! The photos in this book are beautiful and will make you want to try and recreate the vistas. A wonderful book for the gardener or the lover of beautiful books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Shade Garden book","review":"We have a shady, sloped yard in Texas which is highly unusual for this part of Texas. This means we usually can't grow many of the plants that most people in our community do. So, my husband and I went to the bookstore and found this book. There were others on shade gardening, but this had the best photography. The publisher obviously used high-quality printing techniques on this book to get the vivid color. So, this makes just a beautiful book to look at. I used to feel a little disappointed that our yard was so shaded (except that it's cooler in the hot Texas sun than others!), but when I saw this book I realized we could make it into quite a gem.I will admit that I am a novice gardener, but I found this book inspiring with lots of ideas for plants that we could use in the shade.

Have used other high end lighting and light modifiers and I have yet to find anything that beats Elinchrom for light quality. Same thing goes for softboxes and other light modifiers (reflectors, beauty dishes, snoots, etc.). So I had high expectations for this strip light and they have been fully met. I really like the 69 inches dimension because it means I can use this softbox on full length people shots head to toe. Also, because of the narrowness of the softbox, I can carefully move it into positions where I am just using a sliver of light or the full lighting available. This is very well made, very versatile.

He was so excited to get this video and we had to rush home to watch it. He then proceeded to cry throughout the video because it is NOT about dinosaurs at all.

In fairness, I did not read the whole book. But, by the first page of chapter 2, \\"Evidence for Evolution,\\" was this phrase: \\"Given the fact of evolution...\\". It went on to make apologies for the fossil record evidence being spotty in its support of the theory. I was surprised that a Harvard scholar would write in such a way. Accepting a theory as fact is no way to prove a theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessible and Comprehensive","review":"Although Mayr does not write with the breezy simplicity of SJ Gould, and tends to use jargon without enough explanation, this book is a readable, engaging and fairly comprehensive book about the most important body scientific thought since Newtonian physics was born.

However, I have to agree with those that comment that you do need a bit of a \\"working knowledge\\" to truly mine the gems contained within this book. Though evolutionary biology is something that fascinates me, I havent carefully revisited it in many years and I found this book to be an incredible \\"refresher course\\" that quickly brought me up to speed with the thinking of one of the \\"big wigs\\" in the field. If youre a \\"natural sciences\\" student or, like me, wanted an \\"overview\\" synopsis of current evolutionary thinking, then this book is required reading. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"This book contained a lot of good information, particularly in the emphasis on the individual as the object of selection, and a very clear explanation of the two-step process of evolution (chance generation of variation followed by selection).But where was the editor? There are obvious places where several alternative paragraphs were written and rather than chose the best one, all of them were printed! Some of the errors are humorous, for example, \\"I [the author] recognize seven classes of restraints\\" followed by eight numbered paragraphs! There is a refutation of the claim that \\"morphogenesis\\" is contrary to Darwinism, without any explanation of what \\"morphogenesis\\" is. The first 5 chapters are almost impenetrable to the lay reader, containing much arcane jargon. The glossary is only occasionally useful.I think it's a shame that a highly respected authority in the field would be so ill-served by his publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mile wide and an inch deep","review":"I was a little disappointed in this book. Though directed toward the educated layman, Mayr here writes in a manner that only biologists would find easy to understand. At the same time, he covers so much material that many interesting topics only get a page or so of attention. There isn't much detail that a reader capable of getting much from his writing style would not already be familiar with.There are many problems with this book that a good editor should have brought to Mayr's attention. Mayr often mentions a specific case in passing, saying that X property of evolution is displayed by Y animal, but fails to cite clearly his reasons and source. So what's the point of mentioning the example if it's not explained how it relates to the topic being discussed? Where can I find more information? I found this book frustrating and tedious, and I learned little from it that I didn't already know."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Mayr should have stopped (writing) when he was ahead. This was a very disappointing book. It's not that it needed better editing, which it did, but it needed better writing to begin with. Far too many ideas and narrative directions are addressed in very general, almost trivial, ways, leaving the reader feeling like he or she has only just begin to skate across the surface of \\"what evolution is.\\" And it's not a very smooth or fun surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Mayr author this book?","review":"Ernst Mayr's reputation is such that we expect writings of only the highest quality. This book is disjointed, patronizing, and written professedly for the educated layman but with jargon and explanations that only a specialist would understand.What is unnerving is the lecture mode that the writer uses, asking questions and then answering them as a neophyte would do with his first book.Mayr \\"wrote\\" this book last year when he was 97 years old. I cheered for him as the poster boy for many of us elderly. His preface he seemingly wrote--it's clear. But his secret may be out when in his Acknowledgements he thanks the three people who \\"prepared the manuscript\\" and contributed in other ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Overview of Evolution Today","review":"This book claims to be a source for the layman to read up on the latest scientific evidence on evolution. While it wasn't extremely verbose, I didn't quite see it as light informative reading. In any case, the book was excellent at its task of giving a general overview and supporting it in a well organized manner with interesting scientific data. Mayr obviously has a wealth of knowledge. The last section on human evolution was easily the most interesting and provocative. It's also great because he'll just throw in statements, like \\"this is why creationists are absolutely wrong.\\" I'd recommend it for anyone who wants a good foundation on the \\"fact\\" (not theory anymore, as Mayr puts it) of evolution by natural selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Evolution Is","review":"This book is absolutely fabulous!

Theses voices were largely ignored by their contemporaries, let us not make the same mistake by looking over this engaging translation.The writing is academic, but not unapproachable, and I would recommend this especially to college / graduate students looking for a supplement to their French History classes--most professors will gloss over these thinkers, if they are mentioned at all.So pick it up if French History your thing, as it is an invaluable reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better...","review":"While the story flows well in this mystery, why have so much filthy language and so many detailed sexual scenarios? If the author is trying for authenticity in dialogue, this is fiction and seeing the \\"F-word\\" and other \\"curse words\\" every other page is jarring and unnecessary, and not representative of most people. It doesn't further the story and offers readers an uncomfortable place to be in throughout the book. Some of the characters are interesting, but continually reading about \\"sleazy\\" people feels like work instead of pleasure. I have read one other Maggody book, but if this had been my first I wouldn't have read another. And many of these fictional Southern characters really make Southerners look bad, resembling the often-used negative stereotypical portrayals that those who don't live in the South like to perpetuate.

Also, there was a gash on the wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Priced","review":"I was really disappointed with the overall quality of this lamp. It's made out of cheap wood with plastic semi-circular covers that are somewhat difficult to install during construction and/or if you have to change out a light bulb. The base never fit together correctly. Despite my efforts, I never got the lamp to stand up straight so the lamp always slanted slightly to one side. The only reason I kept it was that I had paid so much for it ($100+) and because it was hidden behind a 6-foot folding floor shade and was never seen by visitors. All that said, it did last me 5-6 years until a short finally made me not trust it anymore and I threw it out. For the money I would recommend buying something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this lamp!!","review":"I love this lamp.

Its message is as simple as it is profound: like breathing out and breathing in, you have to give in order to get. Also, wonderful illustrations. This story is a natural for a composer of melodic talent. Who hasn't enjoyed Amahl and the Night Visitors? Read it and see if you agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Classic!","review":"This is a beautifully written, gentle story about something most people have wondered about: what became of the gifts the Magi brought to Bethlehem? The author has created an appealing young protagonist for her story, and the story itself reminded me of other Christmas favorites like \\"Jamal and the Night Visitors\\" and \\"The Clown of God\\". The illustrations are essential for a book like this and Blondon's work is classically beautiful. For readers who have a 'Christmas book collection' that is savored once a year, this is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloy - The Drummer Is The Star","review":"Many fans of The Eloy consider this to be the band's masterpiece and indeed it is a very nice slice of late 70's progressive rock. The star of the show on this one is drummer Jurgen Rosenthal who came up with the concept and wrote much of the material. His percussion work on the album is simply stunning especially on the opening track \\"Poseidon's Creation\\". The album consists of only 4 long tracks that tell the story of the rise and fall of Atlantis. Lyrically it is a bit sketchy at times and the spoken word sections have not aged all that well, but overall this is a solid release from on of Germany's finest prog exports."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic Piece","review":"For those who have not listened to Eloy before, I highly recommend this masterpiece. There is something fascinating about Ocean. It is an art- rock epic that fuses Yes and Pink Floyd, but you will not find it too complicated. Actually, it is so malted and seriously done that it really deserves to be a part of every A-Z collection. You will understand why this title is one of cult albums from the seventies. Always in their own world, Eloy just could not make anything better than to prove that there are some great rock bands in the rest of Europe. In Germany, Eloy is known as their \\"best art-rock band ever\\". Frank Bornemann, Klaus-Peter Matziol, Detlev Schmidtchen, and Jurgen Rosenthal made it so well in 1977. Twenty two years later, their Ocean is still big. I hope you will dive into its water. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like father, like son","review":"I am 52 and play all of my 70's progressive music for my son. He is 14 and due to bands such as Eloy, he is turning out to be a fine drummer.Yes, Nektar, Epitaph and Gentle Giant seem to be his favs, and most definitely this lp by Eloy is on the top of his list. I have every Eloy lp and cd and I pick Ocean to be their swan song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forcing reality into a pre-conceived box","review":"While the book reviews interesting insights about the stability of ecosystems and emphasizes that most preconceptions are invalid in one or another circumstance, it pushes a preconception of its own that is so abstract as to be nearly meaningless. Phenomena are forced into phases of a model even when the fit is unreasonable. The book reads as though the editors fell in love with a nice idea - and a pretty diagram - and proceeded to ignore subtleties and refinements that, if incorporated, could have had real value. One significant flaw is that the wasteland of a devastated ecosystem, such as an overgrazed scrubland, is conceived as the 'same' ecosystem as the mature one (rainforest) that preceded it, and that a 'cycle' will bring it back around - and this in contradiction to the book's own opening chapter. Some redemption is achieved by authors of later chapters, who do not fall into these traps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelous book of quantum physics...","review":"The \\"Bluffer's Guide\\" to Quantum Physics; everything a student needs is included, after a time, one can not distinguish the fact that he's reading \\"a scientific book of formulas and all the other stuff\\".

However I've given it 4 stars because it IS hugely entertaining and even though he was 56 when this was made Clint looks great in the role.The film is too long at 125mins, but for the first hour and a half you will get to see and hear Clint deliver some classic lines. He spits and chews people out. I also think this is the first film where Clint used that gruff voice that has subsequently become a trademark, reaching its zenith in Gran Torino where simply growls at people!The plot such that it is needs no explaining, there is a love story and its a classic re-working of films like Full Metal Jacket and the Dirty Dozen.

Clint Eastwood's portrayal of Gunnery-Sergeant Highway is overdone, and therefore a treat to watch. Also, catch Everett McGill as Major Powers, absolutely unlikable in this part. Always thought he was a great actor!This movie has something in common with \\"Full Metal Jacket\\". Both movies start off on one foot and seem to end on another. The bad part about this is both movies start off better than they end. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie, I really do.

You should do the same.While watching this movie I suddenly realized that Eastwood was playing a 100% John Wayne role (I mean this as praise not scorn) and doing it very well. The overwhelming strength of his personality gives credible life to his role and unites the film, and is reminiscent of the final part of Unforgiven where he dominates an entire town by willpower alone.This is very much a feel-good movie, but it has plenty of subtle nuances and sub-themes as well. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the ultimate in reference guides","review":"I recently purchased this book (unfortunately, not through amazon.com - I'd have saved $ 18!), and it is amazing. Everything I ever wanted to know about NFL, AFL, and AAFC players - from the hall of famers to the obscure - was easily found and easily read.The only drawback? Virtually no statistical information on the \\"other\\" leagues (WFL, USFL, and the 1930's versions of the AFL). But as it is, Total Football II is a phenomenal resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, Very Good, But Not Great...","review":"Being an avid Football fan, Total Football is a dream come true. It gives me fast reference to players and their statistics, positions, high schools, and even hometowns. However, there is one glitch that keeps popping up. After referencing through the book many times, i finally realized that a player must have played in a game in order to have been given credit for being involved in football that year. Therefore, a player could have been not played in a game, or sat out the season on injured reserve, and the book does not give him credit for playing at all. If a player was on a team's roster, but missed the year because of an injury, that should be noted. With the way Total Football is, I wouldn't know if a player was injured for the year, on the roster but didn't see action, or just sat out the year. To me, that's a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"This baby has it all!","review":"Any facts which is not listed in Total Football 2, is not worth to know!

The Player Register is one big mess and incomplete. No information on long gains, blocked punts, times sacked, tackles, etc. The team stats are rudimentary at best (points, rushing and passing only). Next to no information on the playoffs. And the title is a misnomer...Total Football? There is more to football than the NFL."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way","review":"I have all of the 4 major sports books of the Total package.These stats were increddibally incomplete like they show no tackles stats. I know tackles are not an official stat but there are sources like with the Negro leagues in baseball that show the stats. I liked the part about the Top 300 players to 1998.

It fails, however, to make any mention of the pre-existing CFL. This, in my opinion is an oversight, given the recent expansion and withdraw of the CFL in the United States. The CFL deserves at least 1 page (out of the 1600+ pages in this book) in the \\"Other Leagues\\" Section. If the World Football League, USFL, and World League are worthy of a chapter here, the CFL deserves one too. The CFL is, afterall, now a part of American football history.

Dave Duncan rarely got the press or success of his contempary authors but he was a genius at what he did. He always creates a fast pace fun fantasy with great action sequences. His characters are always interesting and he keeps them to a minimum. Which can be a very refreshing in contrast to modern fantasy writers who often feel the need to have 30 to 40 \\"main\\" characters. This series has a lot of action & questing, it also has some humor, romance and theology thrown in as well. A quick enjoyable read that will have you searching for more Dave Duncan books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Just finished the reluctant swordsman, and it's the best read i've had in years.

Mr. Duncan has created a universe which makes a delightful home-away-from-home. For the icing on the cake, try reading it while listening to the following CD: \\"And the Stars Go With You\\" from Miramar Productions, by Jonn Serrie. The sounds of this CD provide a blend of surreal and real which matches the writing in this book and its two sequels. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, well written, solid story line","review":"I started reading this around 3 in the afternoon, and basically spent the next six hours plowing through it, watching and wondering where Wallie was going next. Well written, challenging enough that it's adult literature, but not so much that I need to drink ten cups of coffee to muscle through it, ala Count of Monte Cristo and other epic works. I knock a star from it because it doesn't personally grip me that much (Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter and the His Dark Materials trilogy did).

Yet for an over-40 who'd never used the Web, they wouldn't understand it either. So who is the target audience?It doesn't even merit being considered as \\"WWW Futures 101\\".

He guides the reader through heavy philosophical concepts like knowledge, the self, experience of time and authenticity with elegance and wit. The Web is big. Not for commerce or pornography but for its very nature - a democracy built on passion. We build the Web ourselves, molding it to fit our best nature. A must read for those interested in understanding the true nature of the Net, spam and all. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it.","review":"I did not find this book insightful or useful.

This is an empty box of styrofoam peanuts, form with no substance. Cliche after thundering cliche evaporates off the pages; here you will find such nuggets of secret wisdom as \\"The Web: unreal and proud of it,\\" or the breathless \\"Our shared world isn't the surface of the earth\\" (!)This book seems to be not much more than Mr. W's attempt to establish some name recognition for himself as an Internet Guru, so as to generate more biz for his marketing consultancy. On the other hand, if you liked Cluetrain, with its adolescent pronouncements, you'll like this. It's your money, folks.

He's on to a major story: this Internet thing is big, not because it puts shopping malls on our desktops, or because we can chatter till we drop, or trade quail egg futures in markets around the world. In weaving a new world within the void of our historical moment, the Web is less a tool than a response, in small pieces, to a wish we'd nearly forgotten we had. For too long, we've been dining on beastly thin cognitive gruel. The Net's unbelievable size, irreducible weirdness and uncontrollable energy reflects how starved we are for the smallest bits of madly inspired life.

Small Pieces looks at our human concepts of space, time, truth and hope, and how the web may not be a perfect world, but unlike the real world, the web is our world. This book is probably going to be a sleeper, the one we later point back at and say, \\"Here's where we started to understand.\\"When I started reading Small Pieces, my first thought was \\"Nice speculation, but how do you know the first-person web is the best web?\\" Then it hit me: This is not a prescription for how we *should* do Internet, it's a detailed survey of the who, how and why of those who do.

It is certainly a book that no criminal law practitioner should be without, whether the practitioner be a member of the defense bar, the prosecution, or the judiciary. It should also be a must read for anyone working in the field of criminal justice.The book covers a broad range of topics. It gives an excellent analysis of the sentencing process, as well as a terrific overview of plea bargaining. It discusses the status of pretrial detainers and convicted offenders in terms of loss of their respective rights. The author also addresses the issue of incarceration, as well as prisoners' rights and responsibilities. The book goes on to discuss the role of parole and probation, as well as the restoration of offenders' rights, and the problems that offenders confront upon release. This book provides a concise and worthwhile analysis of all these issues and is well worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"This is the the most practicle book on employee retention we have purchased.

I am glad Bush won the election and Fahrenheit 9/11 didn't win at the Oscars. Do you remember the days during World War II, when Hollywood produced patriotic films, depicting America's favorite heroes (like Superman) fighting the Japanese and the Germans. It is just sad why Hollywood isn't like that these days. Instead we have Michael Moore and his anti-American, anti-Bush propaganda films spewing nothing but hate about anyone who supports Bush. I am proud of Trey Parker and Matt Stone for blowing him up in \\"Team America\\" and for Michael Wilson, and the authors of this book for taking this politically incorrect stand against this big, fat, terrorist.

I got this book because it was in the series of good collections by Clint Willis. I figured it would probably not be as good as his others, but I was pleasantly surprised. I liked as much if not more. Stories ranging between the plights of sea-men caught in huge storms to single individuals trapped in the solitude of an open sea. These stories are from today as well as from the distant past. If you're intrigued by the sea but don't have much knowledge of the world it creates, take a look at this book. It's wonderfully diverse and highly adventurous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solo, Leia, Luke, and adventure","review":"Unlike the Luke and Leia's Star Wars Jornals, the events are recorded after the events of Star Wars: a new hope instead of during, though it only covers the events of episode IV. Also, it's a conversation instead of a \\"solo\\" effort. And at a time when our always on his feet Han solo is very vunerable and worried about Leia. Yet, he doesn't mind speaking honestly about his hate at first site with the princess, and his growing attachment to \\"little brother type luke\\". Though it's as hard for me to imagine this Monk living in nasty old Jabba's palace, yet being left alone, as it is for Han Solo, its an entertaining read. I guess the hybernation sickness could have had him imagining things. Because he sure had a nice long time to tell all his episode IV history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye Tsugumi","review":"A disappointing book from an author whom I came to love after reading Kitchen and N.P.: A Novel. Goodbye Tsugumi is told in a simple way, yet Yoshimoto's story is lacking in elegance, which then creates a sophomoric feeling.Much of the writing comes off as a teenager recollecting the past with a friend. This might work if there was something more to be gained from the telling the story but there is not. Reading this book is like unraveling a simple square knot,once it is released there is nothing there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Wistful, melancholy, full of beautiful emotions and imagery that I can relate to.

Senor Tony's take on life in the glitzy resort town of san miguel de allende is self-serving, delusional and inaccurate. I won't even go into the lofty professorial tone he oozes like the stink off of ripe cheese. If you know nothing about Mexico, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, exploitive.","review":"Mr Cohan elitism and rip-off of Peter Mayle's fine love of France and his experiences there, is a palid and shallow look at a small Mexican town that deserves better. All the book is, is a thinly (and shallow)disguised look at Mr Cohan himself. And any deeper I would not wish to read. Mr Cohan displays no real knowledge of Mexico or her people, nor does he display much love for this country which he dares to try to show us. As a Mexican I am disgusted with the book. As one who visits San Miguel regularly, I am shocked with Mr Cohan's vacuous take on such a multi-layered town. To learn more about Mexico, skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self centered and not fulfilling","review":"I am going to San Miguel next week and got excited about reading this book, as I live in LA and the author lived here too and moved to San Miguel. I got hooked into reading it and must admit I finished it, but soon realized that it was a silly little book. There was virtually nothing about San Miguel and the characters about whom the author wrote were distant and seemingly figments of one's imagination. The dialogue was ridiculous. I'm not sure what the point of the book is, but it isn't enough to be a diary and certainly not even close to giving one a feeling of life in San Miguel de Allende. It pretends to be erudite literature and the author never lets you forget that he knows this person, and that person, etc. It is a boring, drolling piece of work that drags on, but at least the type was fairly large and it didn't take long to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanted to Love This Book....","review":"I have travelled to Mexico three times, though not to San Miguel de Allende. I was truly excited by the prospect of reading this book as I have an ongoing fascination with Mexico and its culture. Unfortunately, Cohan's self-indulgent whining and tedious, repetitive prose style present themselves as tangible obstacles. I did, however, enjoy some of his vivid descriptions and the few glimpses of this town he provides that aren't obscured by his egotistical point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it Only if You Must","review":"If you love Mexico, as I do, or are moving down there, as I am, then, sure, read this book. But if you are after some good travel writing, look elsewhere. The author tries SO HARD to sound flowery, impressive, artsy and cultured that I frankly found it disgusting. He was always trying to impress the reader with his words rather than just tell his story. One example: \\"Out here on the Mexican road, I have veered into the realm of casual anarchy, where the instruments of recourse may be worse than the problem that occasioned them.\\" Huh? Another example: \\"The scene is Fellini, Jacques Tati--or Luis Bunuel.\\" If that describes a scene well for you, then maybe this book is for you! Personally, I found his prose very irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"As warm and colorful as the author's garden","review":"Very affectionate as memoirs go, as the author's appreciation of San Miguel grows with the passage of 15 years. We see nervous visitors develop increasing resourcefulness as they become contented residents, while they introduce us to a parade of beguiling acquaintances. Familiar ground to those who love Mexico already, a worthy introduction for others curious why we do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call Me Mr. Sensitive","review":"Horrid garbage of the most pretentious kind. Our Hero, a fragile soul whose nerves are all a jingly-jangly because of the evil ways of the US of A, jets down to San Miguel (first class? who can doubt it?) with his oh-so-artistic wife and together they become One With The People as few Gringos have before. Hmmm, smell that mole cooking. They don't have mole in LA, do they? Hey, nice shirt on that woman, let's buy it off her back! Wow, no home burglar alarm systems here in Quaint and Soulful San Miguel. Yeah, not more than about 10,000 of them -- after all, we have to protect the $$$$$$$$ of the mega-rich Gringos from California and Texas who populate this place. Hey, forget about a plastic toy for little Jonny, let's buy him this wooden donkey. Won't we look artistic and sensitive and soulful when it's unwrapped? I suppose this book could have been more patronizing, but it would have taken some work. As we say in San Antoinio, eeee-ho!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty and superficial","review":"Installing a bright blue baked enamel stove and a fire-engine red refrigerator may not be everyone's cup of tea, but this story about the restoration of an old house in the Mexican town of San Miguel de Allende is full of vivid images.

I was on a two week trip, working with a mission group in a nearby village, but staying in a bed and breakfast in San Miguel and attending church services in a small neighborhood church. I loved the place, and the people and wondered what it would feel like to actually live in the region full time. With great humor, as well as love for the place and the those who inhabit it, Mr. Cohan let me know. This book is marvelously full of color, both in the descriptions of places, and in the feelings it gives. He captures much of what I felt as a urbanite suddenly finding himself in a much more peaceful much less hurried place. San Miguel de Allende is a magical place. Mr. Cohan's writings capture at least a portion of that and allowed me bring it home."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Mexican Time","review":"As a longtime friend of both San Miguel and Provence, I must agree with the blurb that Cohan equates to Mayle...but only in terms of strong egos and weak apologies for peddling the innocence of their newly beloved countries. Cohan's sophomoric blather, more like assigned reading for High School Spanish 101 than the work of an aged Stanford author,is repetitive,tiringly repetitive and flowery, often self-contradictory and overly righteous...like so many other gringos who, Cortez-like, imagine to discover a virgin and proceed to gloat over its deflowering."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travel Book Pretending to be a Novel","review":"When I ordered this book I was hoping for either a factual travel book on San Miguel de Allende, or a novel, but not both.

It strikes a pretentious, patronizing, self-congratulatory tone from the outset and keeps pouring it on... I will simply say that this book, without any alteration at all, could just as easily have been a parody, intended to skewer the NPR-ish, pseudo-artistic, oh-so-sensitive Gringo who jets down to San Miguel and becomes the first white man ever to become One With The People due to his super soulful sensibilities. Yeeech."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"Being the armchair traveler that I am, and the fact that my husband would rather visit Mexico more than any other spot on Earth, I picked up this book to read why we gringos north of the border are so fascinated with life south of the border. I was not disappointed. Mr. Cohan describes the good along with the not-so-good, the people, the culture, the climate, and the richness of life that one can enjoy when one steps out of the materialistic and secular rat race of life in the States. This book makes me want to learn Spanish, sell my house, and move to San Miguel de Allende!"},{"rating":"1","title":"another yuppie house remodel","review":"I echo the sentiments of previous readers--too much shopping, remodeling, and too many gringos. Cohan and his wife escape L.A. so they can duplicate their acquisitiveness by buying and furnishing a house in Mexico. This is essentially an account of a 15-year visit to a nice, middle-aged couple's lovely vacation home. Made me want to join the Zapatistas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a 5 pack like described","review":"I did not think they came in a 5 pack but took a chance.

I love to read books that have a language that speaks volumes, but in an original and moving way.In Mary Robinson's Why Did I Ever, Money Breton, the heroine, chronicles her quirks and troubles that face her. Her children are in trouble, she may lose her job as a screenwriter, the IRS is bugging her, she has begun to make conversations with herself, and has started to travel to various cities in the South. All is done with quite an unique brand of dark humor. Also, there are lots of page brakes. Each page brake consists of a few sentences, perhaps one or two paragraphs -- she mostly shares whatever comes out of her head with the reader. You may find it strange at first, but it'll suck you in at the end.I found this work to be humorous, poetic and a bit sinister. Robison is one of the best writers of our time.

The drama depicts the struggles that each girl faces as they try to achieve there dreams. One will risk everything to get what she wants, the other achieves hers through her dedication and strong moral ethics. This drama has everything you could want from a K-drama; love, betrayal, comedy and tears. The acting is outstanding and it moves at a fast enough pace that you won't get bored. Buy it because it is definitely one you will re-watch. Han-Jae-Suk is incredible and plays such a different role than he did in Glass Slipper.

COFFIN, produced by Skyrocket Productions and headlined by Kevin Sorbo and Bruce Davison, is such an independent film. The acting is believable under the direction of co-helmers Kipp Tribble (who wrote the screenplay) and Derik Wingo, who play the Oscar and Felix detectives in this game of cat and mouse and cheese. With enough twists and turns to make a roller coaster envious, this taut movie excels in plot, in acting, in production value, and cinematography. It is NOT a copy of BURIED, as many have suggested. It is an original film that will satisfy its audience on all fronts. A must see, must buy psychological thriller with horror overtones that does not disappoint.

If you are interested in plot and character development, choose something better. Ms. Hamilton's characters are pulled around like puppets by a series of bloody, mindless events.

Since then, I've read the entire series including this newest volume. If you're just getting started with this series, pick up the first book instead. Those not familiar with Laurell K. Hamilton's writing/universe/characters will be very confused indeed as it takes a longtime fan of the series to grasp everything in this book.While not up to par with her previous novels, it is still fitting. Anita is tied closer to Richard, and Jean-Claude by marrying the marks. As she ventures through the side-effects, one begins to wonder just how much humanity Anita will retain when she finally accepts the fourth mark.

But this book is a stinker. She has gone so far off of what her characters were you can hardly regonize them.There is no plot and if just sex is what she was going for then she did achieve that.(...) What she has done to Jean Claude is in itself a crime. Also please what happened to the Anita we all knew?????Please do not buy this in hard cover and waste your money, if you must read it wait for the paperback.I believe this is the last book I will read unless by some miracle she can get out of her \\"Anne Rice\\" mode and write like Laurell K. Hamilton again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited so long for THIS?","review":"I love the Anita Blake series, but this installment was just plain awful. Anita would decide to take some kind of action (usually saving one of her were-leopards), would take a step toward it, then detour for 50 pages to sleep with someone or wring her hands over her sexual morality or whom she might love, etc. For it to happen once is unfortunate; repeatedly is unforgiveable. Hamilton has never been the strongest writer in terms of grammar and style, but in the past she had a handle on plot and characterization. Over the past two or three books, she's abandoned plot more and more, and her characterizations, though powerful, simply can't carry a book. The publisher needs to seriously consider getting a stronger editor to rein in Hamilton before the series suffocates from egoistic bloat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"I cannot believe the turn Hamilton has taken with this series. I started with Guilty Pleasures and found a fresh, new approach to vampires. Why could Anita not stay as a vampire executioner and necromancer? Why, oh why, did she have to get tangled up in \\"Nima-Ra, Nima-Raj, etc. to the point where I cannot even keep up with storylines anymore, because I'm trying desperately to make sense out of lycanthropy rules. And what she's done to Richard and Jean-Claude -- well, I think this will be my last Anita Blake book, especially if Anita turns out to be a \\"furry kitty\\" in the future. I think Hamilton has truly messed up with her loyal Anita/Richard/Jean-Claude fans this time. If this book had been different, we could've forgiven Obsidian Butterfly and things could've gone sorta back to normal, but not now. I knew from the scene at the beginning with Anita/Richard/Jean-Claude that this book was doomed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita the victim","review":"I was disappointed in the many fragmented plot lines that pulled Anita into too many directions and neglected an insightful/in depth conclusion for any of them.

I like the book so far, although Iwill admit all the sex started to get monotonous until I realizedit was, for the most part, necessary as it is part of Anita's\\"evolution\\". At this point I'm hoping she and Nathanial can staytight without something coming between. I really like him and don't want him to get too \\"weird\\". So, that really just leavesme with one complaint - Where's Edward? I love his character andthe way he and Anita interact. If there's a next novel, please bring him back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamilton does it again","review":"After reading all of the other books in the Anita Blake series, I didn't think it was possible for Hamilton to add more spice to Anita's life. The triumvirate finally hits home and all hell breaks loose. I'll admit it isn't the best of the whole series, but it has that classic Anita Blake \\"feel\\" to it that draws me to reading the books over and over again. I hope that she writes another one, because I just can't get enough of Anita's twisted world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful!","review":"The worst one yet. Anita Blake the character has been destroyed by her author. The first half of the book explores Anita's new and improved love life, with some of the worst erotic prose this side of a rejected Penthouse letter.Anita Blake the human with increasing powers is still the only individual in these books who can win a fight, solve a problem, rescue the kidnapped, feed the hungry, heal the sick, be the lupa, entice the males, win the day, blah, blah, blah. This wouldn't make a good comic book.If you really want to read this, buy it used, wait for the paperback, or borrow it from a library. Don't spend hardback money on this fourth rate pap.Laurell K.

If this is the best she can do, she should retire the Anita Blake character."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!!!!","review":"my brother gave me obsidian butterfly,i just kinda look at him \\"like ok\\".i picked it up and couldnt stop reading it,then he had NiC,the second i put OB down i picked up NiC,let me tell you i devoured it ,i liked the action of the fights,and the moving sexual experinces with i ardeur.I think anita is just getting started to explore her whole self,and i LOVE Micah,he is her nimri raj!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, not the best, but not the worst","review":"Hmmm...where to start. As a whole it was an alright book. Not one of the better in the series but hey, everyone screws up sometimes, and this was Laurell's. First I'll have to say this, RICHARD MUST, I MEAN MUST DIE! I'm really getting tired of him, he's becoming such an a**. The only highlight of the book was the introduction of Micah, who is filling the loneliness in my heart, although god knows something has to be wrong w/ him to be so understanding. Enough on that, I would say buy this book simply b/c its part of a series, can't skip a part, although nothing major happens. The main plot of the novel was something of a new take on her character although that dwindles rather quickly and doesn't end how I had wished it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm - Not QUITE an Anita Sequel...more of a Merry Sequel","review":"Well - I have been reading the Anita Series for about 3 years now...and after reading the other 9 books I never thought I would dread reading the next one....I did. *sigh* I wouldn't say that my reaction was enough to turn me off buying the next book, but it was close. I was expecting a nice, good Anita book - with Necromancy, Killing, and good Vampire-Hunter action...instead I feel like I got a Sequel to Kiss of Shadows. (...)The only thing that I can think of is that LKH saw how well the Merry Gentry book was received and it just bled over to this series. (Pun intended :-> ).(...)

What a disappointment. This isn't the Anita Blake we've come to know. I absolutely believe that a character needs to change to keep a series fresh, but in this case Anita's gone from being an interesting in-charge woman to some sort of emotional victim. The AB books have always had a sensual storyline going on, but NiC went way beyond that. I wouldn't have minded the sex so much if it had been true to the Anita character. Every real fan knows the moral backbone Anita has had throughout the last nine books.Maybe Laurell Hamilton is tiring of Anita and wants to pursue her Princess Meredith series. In that case she should put Anita on hold until she's ready to give the character the type of story she (and the fans) truly deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last and so far least","review":"I've loved the Anita Blake books since I discovered them, butwith the last one and especially this one, it seemsLaurell Hamilton has fallen into the abyss of on-goingseries.

I miss her raising the dead, working out with Ronnie, sparring (verbally) with Jean-Claude, fighting danger. This novel goes in a sad strange direction that loses all the fun of the orginal few books. It needs more plot, less sex and more sex appeal. I had to force my way through this book, as I did through OB. Fortunately, I have the earlier books which I still very much enjoy reading over and over, because this is the last in the Anite Blake series I will read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT judge the series on Narcissus","review":"I loved the first several books of the Anita series. I was disappointed in the last one but thought LKH might just need to adjust to the longer hardback format. Far from recovering from her little stumble, though, Hamilton takes a dive in Narcissus. Thin plot, weak new characters, and a dull situation in general with dull, repetetive sex scenes connected by drivel. I'd hate for someone to pick up Narcissus first and be turned off the rest of the series.Bring back the zombies, Laurell, or quit writing Anita and try to do better by Meredith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita Grows Darker","review":"I had just reread \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" before reading \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" and the changes and growth of the main characters is typical of the mastery of Hamilton.Anita is pushed further into the world of her \\"Cats\\" the leopards she'd inherited after killing their leader. Fresh from the depths of Obsidion Butterfly's power, Anita is ready to defent those she loves, her home, and the innocents who too often get dragged into the fight between good and evil.Another wonderful example of Hamilton's writing- provocitve, downright scary at times, I couldn't put it down (Though it cost me a few night's sleep)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"I have been a fan of Anita Blake since the beginning of this series and the addition of & reading of Narcissus in Chains was a complete disappointment. No characterization, no plot and I had to force myself to finish it. Plenty of sex that was contrived, Jean-Claude is no longer the sexy vampire that I once knew. I liked the daily life of Anita Blake, her job, her interactions with other people like Dolph and her boss and her best friend. I liked learning more about Anita as a person. Narcissus in Chains disappoints in that it abandons the characters and what we have come to know about Anita Blake, vampire Executioner & the people who populate her world.

It was almost as if someone else had written it, using Hamilton's name and knowing the basic mechanics, but the heart and soul had disappeared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft Porn","review":"I've read all of the Anita Blake books up to and including this one as well as 1/2 of the next one, Cerulean Sins (which I won't finish). I did finish this book but was not excited about continuing the series. I felt that the original storyline created books ago was lost and muddled and this book was all about sex. Not that that can't be exciting when you are ready for it but if I wanted to read this much sex, I'd get the appropriate magazine. Anybody can write about sex. It takes a great author to create a great storyline and finish and add to that storyline with every new book in the series.

But, I miss the more human Anita who didnt have all of these crazy powers, who worked with the police, and was the small chick everyone underestimates, but winds up kicking butt and taking names later. Please, please, please tell me that this is the only book where LKH seems to fall off the wagon, but she gets back on and that the rest of the books will be like the \\"good old times\\".

Both slayers were small and gutsy and could crack one-liners with the best of them. Both universes were darkly inventive and sensuous and always underscored with a deep well of black humor. While that is still true for Joss Whedon, Laurell Hamilton walks in the shadows of her own failings as a writer. She is her own Mary Sue, stalking through the pages into one sex game after another. Hordes of faceless shapeshifters with black hair and leather dominate this book and after awhile, it becomes an interminable trek. The rot started in Obsidian Butterfly and spread to her new heroine in Kiss of Shadows and migrated over to this latest effort.Reading this is like watching a badly made porn film. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has anyone seen the real Anita Blake?","review":"I eagerly pre-ordered this latest in the Anita Blake series and had been waiting very impatiently for its release...boy was I disappointed. Narcissus in Chains bears little resemblance to the series fans know and love. There were a number of things I didn't like about this book: the plot was weak, there were WAY too many sex scenes (Ms. Hamilton, leave this stuff to Princess Meredith and her series, please!) instead of Hamilton's usual tastefully erotic love scenes, and too many series \\"regulars\\" were nowhere to be found. Where was Edward? Willie? Larry? Animators, Inc? (Not to mention creepy Otto from Obsidian Butterfly!) Based upon the previous nine books in this series (all of which I've read multiple times), I barely recognized this Anita - her actions were way out of character and frankly, some were just tasteless. I sincerely hope that in book #11 we find Anita returned to her normal, sassy self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....","review":"I have to agree with the other readers, this book was sooo disppointing, where is the Anita from the earlier books???The book has absolutely NO plot, JC is nothing but a shadow of what he used to be, Anita has lost her sense of humor and is transformed into a very arrogant and very tired woman. I loved the books untill Burnt Offerings but since then Ms. Blake has lost her appeal, because of the munin and now the dreaded ardeur she is most of the time so out of control that her personality is barely reconizable, I'll read Cerulean Sins but from the reviews I read I have no hope for this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita starts to grow up","review":"First of all I love this series. Jean Claude is great I liked the way his temper flared at Anita, because sometimes there is no pleasing her. Next Richard needs to become a true leader and stop being so soft. Anita was just Anita annoying but funny.The sex in this book was soft porn, but I liked it anyway. I think the plot was a little thin but the sex and violence made up for it and made it interesting.The new people and development of others could make for interesting reading in books to come. If you like Anita you may also like Merry Gentry Laurell's other series. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I have read all of the vampire series and loved each one. Ms. Hamilton snagged me with her quick spunk, style and fortitude of her writing. I cant say what my excitement level was at thought of reading her new book. Unfortunately I wish I hadnt. Normally you cant put them down, this one I could hardly pick up. I dont know what happened but the characters came up short, especially Anita Blake, she seemed to turn her into some sort of weak, scatterbrained,sex starved person. There was way to much sex so much so that it became boring. Most of the main characters were there, a couple of new ones. But the whole story line lacked a great deal, there was just alot missing that normally is there inL. Hamilton's books. I can only hope her next one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Hamilton","review":"Fabulous I love Hamilton and can't get enough of her books. Like this one better then Obsidion Butterfly which was alittle off because of the S&M stuff to freeky for me. Still a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita Blake fans, stop here","review":"This is the book that kills the series. You try to give LKH the benefit of the doubt- everybody has a weak book in their series right? But several books later, you're like \\"Why did I keep going? Where should I have stopped?\\" RIGHT HERE. JUST STOP HERE. I know, curiosity gets the better of us, and we want more of what we used to have. But those of us who started the series because it contained a strong female protagonist in an interesting alternate reality will be disppointed from here on out. Anita develops a \\"there's no problem I can't fix by f**king it\\" mentality. Plots go bye bye. Character development goes bye bye. After this, it's just porn. If that's what you're looking for, fine you were warned. But there's better written porn out there if that's what you're looking for. I made the mistake of continuing for 5 more books.... don't repeat my mistakes. The Anita Blake we loved is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is Hamilton Doing?","review":"I am a HUGE Anita Blake fan, but I was pretty turned off to this book. Its main topic seemed to be how many men does Anita need in her bed. I don't read the series for her sexual escapades with any male that is in the room with her and I didn't quite buy the reasons for this need in this one. I hope Hamilton's next book is more like the earlier books and that JC remains the top guy in the series. If Narcissus is a preview of what's ahead, I am jumping off this train NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Padded","review":"Like so many others here, I found this book to be a major disappointment. And for many of the same reasons. If I had to use one word to discribe this one, that word would be \\"padded\\". It seems like once she'd written it, Hamilton came in 200-250 pages short, so she began having Anita start repeating herself. How many times did she tell us about what had happened up to this point...in detail? And the sex scenes got old real fast.I've read every book up to this one, and enjoyed every one (including Obsidian Butterfly, which others found disappointing, as well). And what I find most disturbing is the stuff that's missing. Is Anita even still working for Animators, Inc. or the police department? You'd never know it from this book.I'll be around for the next one, of course. I won't let one stumble chase me away. But more like this one, and I'll be gone. Sad, but still gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissus in Chains Should be Chained Closed","review":"I have read all of the Anita Blake novels and this is by far the worst. Let me provide you with a synopsis. Friends disapproving of Anita's love life, trouble with the wereleopards, gang style fight, Anita saves the day but almost gets killed (...) I actually put the book down because I just couldn't take it any more. Some of the intimate moments were just too gross to read through. The book does not flow well. It's choppy: scene one, CUT, scene two, CUT and so on. And there is so much going on that you almost forget what happened in the beginning because there doesn't seem to be any connection with what's happening in the middle. Ms. Hamilton does manage to piece it together somewhat, but it's all just too much! Ms. Hamilton is always \\"over the top\\", but Narcissus in Chains makes you want to scream ENOUGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst story line ever............what happen???","review":"I always enjoy reading L.K.H. books since the first one, but this has got to be the worst story line ever...Correction -NO STORY LINE- just sex,sex,sex...poor excuse for menopause (heat flashes,etc)Enjoy the previous books and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bottom of a downward spiral","review":"The \\"plot\\" of this latest in the Anita Blake series has degenerated to nothing more than a platform for bizarre sexual aberrations between a variety of \\"monsters,\\" from lycanthropes to the biggest monster herself. Richard and Jean Claude are portrayed with the depth of cartoon caricatures, others about whom one might care are abandoned along the way (Damian), and the \\"cultural insights\\" that once made the glimpses into the worlds of lycanthropy and vampirism intriguing are so long dead that it's unlikely even a necromancer could resurrect them. But hey, you sure know what everyone is wearing......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissus in Chains Review","review":"By far the poorest of Ms Hamiltons Anita Blake series.The author seemed more interested in putting Anita into any sort of sexual situation that she can think of, which would have been OK if i was reading a work of erotica. Instead i was hoping to read something else entirely. Nothing important or interesting happened until nearly half way through this book, which at 400+ pages made for some very dull reading.I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this, borrow it instead.Very dissappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new Anita?","review":"Narcissus in Chains was quite a departure from the other novels in the series. I would like to say at the start that I am an Anita Blake junky, and find Laurell Hamilton's alternate universe to be one of the more creative worlds an author has allowed me to visit in quite a while. That said however, I was quite disappointed when I finished this novel.Anita Blake \\"Surrendering\\" to anything.? Much less something requiring her to participate in group sex.?When I closed the book my first thought was that this was a collaboration with another author.Read by itself this book would be an interesting read if only for a glimpse of the world of Anita Blake.For Anita Blake fans, you will of course have to purchase the book. If you enjoyed A Kiss of Shadows and it's Main Character, you will probably enjoy this book as it seems to merge Meredith Gentry and Anita Blake into one person. If you enjoyed the Anita Blake who would rather die than \\"surrender\\", you will probably be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Laurell Hamilton's Narcissus in Chains, the tenth book in the Anita Blake series, was a huge disappointment. The major characters were almost unrecognizable in her latest work. Instead of focusing on solid characterization and coherent resolution, Narcissus in Chains seemed to focus on sex ... and how to get characters into sexual situations. The book left a lot to be desired (pun intended) to this long-time Anita Blake fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back.","review":"I am a great fan of the Anita Blake books and was more than excited when I picked this one up to read.I have never been more dissapointed with an author in my entire life.None of the characters were true to themselves, many too many faux character were added in for no good reason, there was no plot and way too much porn.I am so dissappointed I don't think I'll be buying any of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The Heck...????","review":"Is this an aberration or a \\"new direction\\"? If its the former, glad to hear it. If its the latter, thanks its been fun but I'm done.You ever read a book and think....what was/is going on with this author that this book is the result? Thats how I felt about this book.Maybe its just me, but having your main character screwing around every chapter with another male with an enormous schlong and calling it \\"characer development\\" is laughable to the extreme.If you're a Jean-Claude or Richard fan, BEWARE !!! They are badly written, dumped on, and in the case of Richard, unbelievably mangled. Ah, but not to worry, Anita has a new instant soulmate, Micah. A character so flimsy and useless the most memorable thing about him is the size of his willy.You had me until this one Ms Hamilton...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot? and the characters?","review":"Having read all the Anita Blake stories up to Narcissus, where did the characters go? This kind of fiction should entertain, and at its best develop interesting characters that we want to follow from one novel to the next. Up to now, I thought Hamilton managed to be one of the better genre series writers at doing this and even though the characters live in a genre plot, Hamilton managed to make the mysteries interesting enough to keep reading. Narcissus has neither. Also, I don't usually have any problem with whatever sexual activities occur in books-- as long as the sex fits the characters and helps the plot along. This book seemed to forget to have a plot other than sado-masochistic sex and the characters all left their personalities behind in some other book. This piece of the series is better skipped- read one of the earlier books to get an idea of why the series might be popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metaphysically gangbanging the buyer","review":"The other negative reviewers have already touched on the numerous problems with this book. This is a very poorly written book - one wonders if this was cranked out to meet a mortgage payment.Hamilton's obsession with sex in this piece, albeit \\"metaphysical sex,\\" leaves no room for plot or character development. Ick. If you are looking for a good story, don't bother with this book. If you are looking for smut, there's better drivel on the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened??","review":"Narcissus in Chains was one of the most disappointing, peices of writing i've read. Months on top of Months, Anita fanatics waited for the book to come out. For months we had no Anita, no Richard...yeah and no JC either.And then its released and...its Trash. I've have come to expect alot more of Laurel over the years. She completely destroyed her characters and everything they stood for, in this book. She degrated Anita. I wont even go into what she did to Richard. And She Slept with everyone in the book Except the people she wanted to sleep with in past books. And come on what the hell happened to Damian? Lets get Damian out of the box, and then send him to the basement for the remainer of the book. Hopefully LKH will realize, whats shes done, and try to fix it with the next book, or just end the series because frankly Anita doesnt deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest link.","review":"A huge step back for Laurell K. Hamilton, the newest Anita Blake novel seems to lack a lot of things.The character development we've all learned to love disappears into thin air when contradictions galore appear with old characters and new characters just seem to pop out with no back story. While it's fine and dandy to have Anita take a 90 degree turn in her personality, we as the readers want to see the turmoil happening. You don't just jump from point A to D without explaining B and C or putting some depth into the story. It ruins the moral climactic moments readers love.Bad guys are thrown into the mix sloppily so it seems like they were just attached onto the story for no good reasons. The plot is secondary to the all mighty sex, so we're left with a soft porn feeling. Most of the sex scenes sounded like they were recycled from the old books anyway. Sorry, if I wanted to read half a book full of sex scenes, I would have bought an erotica."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last Anita Blake book for me","review":"This series has been sliding for a few books now but I thought that it could recover. Now I know that it won't. So this is that last book for me and I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. Such as shame because the first five books were so strong and different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost better than Anne Rice","review":"I have read all of the Anita Blake series in one month. Ms. Hamilton's writing is excellent!I have only read Anne Rice's vampire books before and when I found Ms. Hamilton's I didn't think they'd be very good. However, I was wrong. I'd put her in the same category as Anne Rice.She has the ability to draw her readers in to each one of her novels and it is a nice change from the Vampire Chronicles. She puts enough of the details into her writings that they almost put you there with Anita.I never thought of reading any writings from other writings except Anne Rice, however, Ms. Hamiltons' book are excellent!I couldn't put any of the books down until I'd finished them and was ready to go onto the next.I hope she keeps up the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"got to love it","review":"This is my favorite book of the series, and I can say that with glee because I've been reading anita since book 7 was released and after all this years shes still my favorite series. When I want a book to comfort me this is the one I choose. I've have to of read this book a hundred times. I actually ended up having to get another copy of in because I is so well read. Maybe my next copy will be on my kindle.I won't spoil the read or hope the series ends as others hope because I truly wish for a long well planned ending many books from now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Micah","review":"I'm so glad Anita is finally getting over her prude act it was way past due. I like this book and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narcissus in Chains","review":"Yeah! Richard is gone sort of. Couldn't of happened to a nicer guy. Not that I don't like him which I don't but what a whiner. I wish he would just get over him self. This book was good not just because Richard might be a little more out of the picture. I have to admit though half way through I put the book down in shock. Not that the others books haven't had there moments but wow!!! I almost wasn't going to read the rest of the book. I consider my self to be a hard core Anita fan and I almost wavered. Well of course a day hadn't gone by before I was chewing my nails and making up all sorts of awful endings for the book. I finished it and wow. I'm still an Anita fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one can read just one....","review":"I read the whole series in a matter of weeks. I found the books to be entertaining, and addictive. I called them my trashy vampire novels, but they are much more than that. You get a chance to see Anita evolve in every aspect of her life. Especially her spiritual life. She faces every nightmare and fear she has, and comes out on top. There is a lot of power and might tucked into the tiny person of Anita Baker. I can't wait to see what she does next!! The cover of this book is hanging on my bedroom wall, signed by Laurell K. Hamilton. It is one of my most prized posessions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Sad......","review":"This book made me consider Obsidian Butterfly as the true end of the Anita Blake series.She went from a strong women who could hang with the big boys to a women that has sex to make all of her problems go away. I'm not even a women and i feel offended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the Disappoint Begin","review":"I've just completed the last book in this series. After reflecting back on the pain that I caused myself getting through the entire series, I have pinpointed this book as the beginning of the end. This book marks the end of a character to admire and to cheer for as she kicked some bad guy butt. I so admired Hamilton and her clever use of different mythologies and genres to create a world where I wanted to keep returning to book after book. All of that stopped with this book. It became less about a strong personality and more about a lame sex drive and even lamer men. I don't care if you add sex to the story, but Hamilton needs to add story to the sex. The rest of the series has glimmers of the clever and entertaining writing of the early series, but not enough to make it worth to time and soul draining ickiness needed to complete the series. I hope to find a charm to wear around my neck to keep me from purchasing the next book like a brain dead zombie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my last Anita Blake...","review":"As I said in my one-star review of Anita Blake #9, Obsidian Butterfly, if the next book in the series wasn't better edited, I was done, done, done. So, here is #10, and it is even more poorly edited (typos, repetitive scenes, and overly-long descriptions - how many times do we need to hear about Nathaniel's ankle length hair?), but even worse, there was no story arc. Really, no plot...nada, none, zero. Anita moves from violent episode to violent episode, and from sexual encounter to sexual encounter (wash, rinse, repeat MANY times), but there is no plot to hook it all together. The final straw is the insertion of a whole new villian in the last few chapters! I won't be reading any more of the Anita Blake series, and, given that I couldn't get past Chap 6 of the first book in LKH's Merry Gentry series, it looks I'm done with LKH as an author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I really loved the Anita Blake series and even put up with the little bits of sexual encounters that were seen here and there. The plots were to my liking and I the character development was keeping me coming back for more. I could not make it through half of this book, because all the sex was getting in the way of the story. I will not read this series anymore because what had been some great urban paranormal fantasy has turned into something I am no longer interested in."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I so enjoyed this series and couldn't wait to get to the next book. I read all of them in order and was so pleased to find a series and heroine I was really excited about. What a let down. However, I persevered, read this book and went all the way to Cerulean Sins. Now, I understand the negative reviews and other remarks by disappointed readers and fans. I do not mind sexual influence when it adds to the story, character, whatever. But, this is down right ridiculous. I mean, give me a break here. It was one reviewers opinion that the author refuses to listen to her fans opinions, I hope that is not the case and the plots get back on track and off the current story lines. Because I miss the original Anita and her stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly disappointing","review":"I got hooked with the Anita Blake series with Obsidian Butterfly. I found Anita Blake to be a strong, smart, attractive character, a woman who charts her own course amongst so many characters who would love to chart her course for her. But here, Anita Blake has lost her way, seems helpless at times, and unable to do anything except give in to the events surrounding her. Many people who might read this understand that her helplessness is not her fault, as she is afflicted with something I won't describe that causes her personality to change and her willpower to diminish. Nonetheless, her fault or not, she is far less interesting this way, and truthfully, things happen within this story that alter the way I will view her character from now on. Unfortunately, I view this book now as the end of the series, because Anita Blake no longer appeals to me as a human being."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Escape","review":"I must say I was a little hesitant about purchasing this book after reading some of the bad reviews of NIC however temptation overcame when I was the bookstore and I bought it anyway! I am truly glad I did. For 6 hours, I was transported into Anita's world and it was a welcome respite from happenings going on to the world today. Many of the complaints that I read is that the book had too much sex, I thought thought the sex/sensual scenes showed the growing up of Anita Blake, she was coming to terms with who she was and not who she thought she should be. The character development was great especially for Jason and Nathaniel, who have been my favorite 2 secondary characters. To Ms. Hamilton - I greatly enjoyed reading this book; thank you for this truly pleasurable bit of escapism!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly Breathtaking!!!!!","review":"I have never read a book like Narcissus in Chains,EVER!It was capitvating and I could not put it down. I recieved it as a Christmas gift and I finished it in two days. This was the first book that I had even read from the Laurell H. series but it was easy to catch on, I could not bear to stop. Each character had their own special qualities and althoug others may disagree, I'm glad her and Richard are over, he's such a pain. Also, I'm probably not the only one that thinks this, but the relationship she had with Nathaniel was so cute,throughout the whole book I kept thinking he was going to die, but he didn't,:)I don't think I could have handled that. Hopefully in her next novel there is more of Nathanial, Damien, and Gregory, it seems that they were just left hanging. I can't wait for the next instalment. Until then I will definatly go back and read the previous novels, hopefully they are just as good as this one!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex, sex, sex ... simply terrible","review":"This series has gone from hunting vampires and werewolves to having group sex with them.

Do yourself a favour and buy one of Hamiltons earlier works instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a disappointing porn novel.","review":"Where were our beloved characters? Where was the sexy, mysterious JC/Asher? Where was the winsome Nathaniel? Where was our strong boy scout Richard? Not in this book. The good ol' characters that we've come to love, and the villians that we've come to hate are gone. They've been replaced with bad copies of themselves. Anita is now the all powerfull Master Vampire Human Necromancer Nimir-raj and NOTHING can kill her. I would've liked to see her learn to use what powers she has instead of gaining new ones. I'd actually like to see Edward or Richard finally kill her off so that we don't have to read about Little Miss Slut and her problems anymore. Her problems are all the same, who can she sleep with? Who is she going to kill now? Who's trying to kill her pard? *sigh* I was happy to see LKH put out a new AB book, but, just maybe it's time to see her stop writing about our now-un-loved AB before she ruins the characters anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going downhill fast...","review":"This books seems to be merely trying to show LKH's new found interest in fetish sex.It is far LESS about Anita's days as a necromancer and vampire hunter and so much more about her ridiculously promisucous love life with all the \\"monsters\\" in her life.HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And Thats One Star Too Many","review":"Book 10 in the Anita Blake-Vampire Hunter series is a complete trainwreck of a book. Awful is too kind. Perhaps parody would be a better description. Oh, where to start....well, the beginning of the book actually starts out promisingly. Anita's back in town after leaving to get her head together, a crisis erupts, Anita calls Jean-Claude, her vampire lover, for help...he shows up and brings Richard, Anita's werewolf lover, along. They \\"marry the marks\\" , and the book is humming. Then the boys somehow disappear, Anita gets injured and wakes up naked in bed with 2 men she's never seen before. WHAT??? Who substituted this piece of .... for the book I was reading? Well folks, from there it continues to spiral down into the abyss. The only good thing about this book is that it virtually guarantess that the next one will be better....because nothing could be as bad as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave Me A Headache","review":"This book is proof positive that an author might want to back away when going through some personal issues.Silly, repetitive, smutty (which is a good or bad thing, depending on your POV), and very, very disappointing.

So when I checked this book out of our library, I had high hopes. After less than three dozen pages I saw what writing her other series did was just the opposite. Not only are we seeing the same level of wanton sex, we are now also seeing extreme torture and bondage. I tried to stick with it in the hopes the book would not be too bad, but when Anita ended up in bed with 4 men at the same time I called it quits. But Laurell did at least have the characters take steps to make sure Anita did not get pregnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed the change.","review":"I was worried about reading this book because of the negative comments I had read, but I must admit I really enjoyed the change. I read these books for the relationships, and this one is all about the relationships among the characters. This book has a lot more sex, so if you like violence but not sex, this is not for you. As for me, I like sex much more that violence, so I am actually happy about the change in focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"Ok, I don't exactly read LKH books for my edification, and I know this isn't exactly world-class literature here, but I think this book has been the worst in the AB series to date.Anita's personality is completely reversed, and she keeps making remarks like \\"I should have done this\\" or \\"this was my cue for so and so.\\" It makes me wonder where the old Anita has gone all of a sudden. I also thought the situation w/ Micah was unbelievable. Why did she--paranoid Anita who always carries a gun--start trusting him again??Let's hope the next book salvages things a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita for Better or Worse?","review":"I don't know what else I can add to the plethora of reviews already here, but I feel the need to defend this book anyway. Yes, the story has taken a heavy twist since Obsidian Butterfly. Anita's changed etc etc, but IMO I just sat back and enjoyed the book. Sure, I had my moment where I just had to stop and go, \\"What?\\" Not only has Anita become defender of the \\"monsters\\", she's become a complete superheroine. But as a female, I can't help but go \\"Yeah! You go!\\" no matter how cliche that sounds. It just seems to me LKH has taken the plot a big step further at what she's been hinting at. Plus, it is the tenth book in the series-- how long can a series go through a similar plot formula without some change? I do look forward to the next book anyway, and recommend to others who are hesitant to buy, borrow/preview first."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEREWOLVES MATE FOR LIFE!","review":"To all who think Richard is gone, guess again. In NIC, it is brought up that werewolves behave like regular wolves. In this, thet Alpha male, Richard, picks his mate, Anita, for life. This is the explaination for his comment during \\"Blue Moon\\" where he is upset with Anita for finally giving him a \\"choice\\" and not giving up other men. The problem with all of this is that Anita has had classes in supernatural beings in college, per \\"Blue Moon\\", so why in the world does she not understand that Richard wants her for his mate. NIC is horrible because of the retread plot, Anita's ... attitude, new characters without explianation, Anita's gaining more vampire powers, and a lack of explainations for past actions, especially from \\"Blue Moon\\". Anita was spending 6 months learning about a werewolf pack, WHAT DID SHE LEARN? LKH has made Anita all powerfull and perfect (P U - hold your nose). This series is great, except for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the series","review":"Plenty of other readers have elaborated on the reasons this book isn't nearly as good as the others. I miss the old Anita Blake. This has been my favorite series of books for years. I'm so very disappointed. The plot gets so bogged down with sex and gore.

Unfortunately, it is pretty awful. Ms. Hamilton has abandoned the formula she used for the first 8 books, the formula that made me such a loyal fan. The writing itself is pretty bad and the characters are superficial and not terribly likeable. And why are all the guys skinny with long hair?! Please give the rest of us a man with another body type so we can stay interested too (Richard doesn't count anymore). I miss the police work. I miss her job as an animator. I miss the wit, the morality, the other characters I'd grown to love. I do sincerely hope the next book will be better than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing....","review":"Needless to say, I was supremely disappointed with the newest installment in the Anita Blake books. Gosh...I even pre-ordered it, anxiously awaiting for its delivery! As a huge fan of her books and characters, I was crushed. I have to admit that I was not too thrilled with the last one either..but, this book was obviously written without much thought to the plot. The entire book only covers a few days which just tells me that she is just trying to crank them out as quickly as possible. I will buy the next book of course, but I hope it isn't a third strike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissus in Chains","review":"Was so thrilled to find Anita Blake series about strong woman, gutsy, independent woman which mixed my two favorite genres: supernatural and vampire. Yeah! Read several of the earlier books than hit this book and only felt disappointment and yes, disgust that the author had to use the \\"ardeur\\" to throw the reader into a quagmire of sexual exploits. I can read romance novels if I wanted all that. Why was this necessary? I almost gave up on the book but out of loyalty I finished it...hoping that the \\"ardeur\\" would pass. But no...I just started Cerulean Sins...and the smut continues. So that ends my loyalty to Anita. Will no longer be recommending it to friends. How sad! The plots have suffered for the sex. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened!!","review":"I started reading the series and fellin luv but in this book I really felt cheated.

She had morals and boundaries. Now she has none of those things, she kills whoever gets in her way and sleeps with everyone with no regards to anyone's feelings or any reference to what her one time high morals used to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Crawls Before She Walks","review":"True, at first glance there may seem to be differences in the book and Anita's character, but when you look at the pattern of the books you can see that Anita's power is always expanding and we as readers are learning with her the limits or lack thereof to her power. Certainly Anita acts out of character and does less than moral things in this book, but just as she needed training and practice to become a sure-shot and fast-draw, she will need to learn techniques to quell new desires and experience to bring fledgling abilities to second-nature skills. I thought the ending was a bit abrupt and that there could have been less sex, but overall I'm excited to see Anita to grow as a tough character and anxiously await the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"I've been a fan of Hamilton since 1994, but this book was such a disappointment. The plot was non existent, and Anita isn't tough, she's just annoying. There are lots of scenes in which it looks like she's just trying to prove how strong she is, but really is just pathetic. All the sex in the book is unexpected...it is a sharp contrast to Anita's earlier personality. It's understood if you want to gather more readers with a more provacative heroine, but this is ridiculous. If I'd wanted to read a porno, I would have picked up another book. Do not read unless you want to be disappointed! I hope Hamilton will change her writing. I'm still going to read the next book b/c I'm such a big fan of Anita, but I'm praying that it doesn't drag the reader into another gutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I'd hoped for","review":"After eagerly awaiting the new Anita Blake novel, I'm very disappointed- definitely not of Laurel Hamilton's ususal quality- major characters are underdeveloped, plot twists have no explanation, and Anita acts out of character- more like Merry Gentry, but even more gratuitous. I'm hoping that future books are back to the standards I've come to expect from Laurel Hamilton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamilton is reduced to sex alone.","review":"One of the true beauties of Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake sagas has been the eroticism and realism of the character caught up in \\"unreal\\" situations. \\"Narcissus\\" goes further into the \\"unreal\\", further into the erotic, and further away from realism. While I still look forward to any other book in this series, Ms. Hamilton's disappointing last three books would not convince me to essay any other series she starts. I personally look forward to see how Ms. Blake resolves her life, but don't as whole-heartedly urge new readers to take up this project as the latter books in this series have been dissapointing in style, content and narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissus in Chains","review":"This book was sick-and I do not mean in a cool way. This was straight Porn! I cannot believe that Laurell K would let her character go like this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Yet","review":"I too have been a reader Ms. Hamilton's \\"Anita Blake\\" books since the beginning. Somewhere around the middle of the series, things began to slide downward. Beginning with the hardcovers, things got really bad, but \\"Narcissus In Chains\\" lands at the bottom of the slagheap. It's so poorly written that one is never just quite sure what is going on, who's speaking, or just why the hell one should care. Do her publishers think she is so big now that she needs no editorial guidance? Any editor worth his/her salt would have sent this one back on a rail.Absolutely not worth reading, much less buying. Stick to the first five of the series, then pretend to yourself that Anita Blake went off to live in the tropics or something. Better than what we're getting here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book did not further the overall arc of the story. Blue Moon is the best book of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like sex too, but ....","review":"I liked the earlier Anita Blake books. There was more humor and I enjoyed her job duties. She started going down hill in Blue Moon. While I like sex as much as the next person, I feel the story line has suffered. They just aren't as much fun to read as they used to be. The fun banter between Anita, Jacques and Richard was enjoyable. A free-spirited, take-charge woman holding her own with two domineering men. Now, she's not all human, but horny as heck. Her Meredith Gentry books started out with unlimited sex, so I've pretty much come to expect lots in that series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"When I started reading this book, I hoped that it would be as good as \\"Obisdian Butterfly.\\" Mistake. Anita Blake seems to have the morals of your local hooker. I have to agree with the reader from Las Cruzes, these books are becoming sad. Anita no longer fights monsters, and is has lost touch with her human friends. Jean Claud and Richard are fast becoming things of the past and minor characters. Let there be no mistake, I AM NOT A PRUDE, a touch of sex (or perhaps a little more than a touch) of sex does not bother me, but three at a time?! We may end up having to buy her books at the local adult book store in the future. I would like the Anita Blake of the past to come back to the future. I do not mind change, I just don't like mindless change. Before you buy this book, read all of the reviews, and then ask yourself, would you leave this on the coffee table for younger teenagers to read? Go for the paperback if you want it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARE YOU KIDDING?!","review":"I first discovered the Anita Blake series this year and loved all of them.WHAT HAPPENED?This is without a doubt the worst book I have EVER read. This book has no plot, familiar characters that wandered off into never-never land, page after page of scenes and sex that do not make sense and are not relevant to what little plot there is in this book.The new \\"Micah\\" character (bye the way - where did he come from?) is just creepy. Richard and Jean-Claude are only peripheral characters this time around and when we do see them, their personalities are so altered that you almost don't recognize them. Jean-Claude, for example, was acting like Anita's personal pet poodle. What happened to the smart mouthed master vampire that we all loved to be annoyed by?As one who eagerly awaited this installement of the series, I was greatly dissapointed. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita the bloodthirsty prude becomes Anita the Tramp","review":"Words cannot describe how bad this book is so I'm not going to try. The plot is barely there and the main character has turned into super tramp. Anita manages to sleep with anything and anyone she crosses paths with. Save your money and read the earlier Anita Blake novels. This book is 99% porn. So much so that it becomes boring very early on. Again, save your money. Just like Anita, this book sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even Anita can raise this series from the dead","review":"This book marks the death of one of my favorite dark fantacy/horror charactors.What was once a quality series has finally completed its devolution into adolecent wish fulfillment.I'd rate it even lower if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series jumps the shark with this book!","review":"Series jumps the shark (can I use that for a book?) right here with this book....get it from the library and see for yourself. New fans, do yourself a favor and stop here...you will only be disappointed! Old fans might want to just skip ahead to the newest, Skin Trade, which was better than the drivel in between all these books, and you won't have missed anything but lots of tasteless sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"No rest..","review":"This book was difficult for me to put down once I had picked it up! Though there were some aspects lacking, all of ones favourite characters from previous novels are there. Including the infamous (yet dead sexy) Jean-Claude. The storyline comes at the reader non-stop, one finds themselves exhausted right along with Anita Blake, though she bears up well. Sex, blood, magic, and lycanthropes.. oh and did I mention Jean-Claude? A most definitely recommended read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"My least favorite so far. Too much sex, too much arguing, and not enough plot development. Introducing a conflict, like the one with Jacob, and then finishing it up in the epilogue was a bit cheap. All through the book I was expecting some kind of big showdown between the two of them and then I get, \\"my first order of business was to execute Jacob.\\" WTF?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment :(","review":"I really loved this series when I got my hands on it.It was gripping, and interesting. I couldn't put them down. I read each book and just couldn't wait for the next. That's what made it so hard to read the last few books. They became one big mess. Anita was no longer this strong, stubborn yet smart woman. Now, she's a horney know-it-all. I found myself rolling my eyes and saying \\"oh come on\\". It just became too predictable and trashy. So, needless to say, I will not be buying this disappointing trash anymore. So sad :(."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"As I said in my last review, I was hoping that the downhill slope that Hamilton is heading with the series must stop with this book, but I was left disappointed. The book remained in the pattern that it took after Obsidian Butterfly and if this continues, the fans of the series will certainly look for alternative options.This novel indeed introduced a new character but also was an addition to the growing pile of Anita's lovers which is not really a good since if you ask me. I don't mind reading erotica but reading it 80% of the novel is just too much for me. As Anita was described to have embraced her growing powers but it just somewhat made her more promiscuous and made the novel soft porn. I don't want to use that term but it's what the book is giving me.Reading the book I realized that I skim through pages to avoid reading the steamy parts. The initial story of the book seemed lost and I'm wondering if Hamilton can bring justice to the series again with the future books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and better, in fact Best!","review":"I have read all of Ms. Hamilton's books and I am extremely pleased with NiC. She gathered all the threads that have been ravelling over the course of this series and not only brought it to a great conclusion, she left herself ample room to continue with the new story arc. Many times over the last few books it seemed as though she was writing herself into a corner that she couldn't get out of, but she not only gave everyone a big surprise she made me like it. I felt that the resolution had an internal consistancy that will allow me to continue to expect great things of Anita without knowing what those things will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Hamilton!!","review":"While you definitely should read the earlier books, this installment is fantastic! I couldn't put it down! I noticed that someone rated it 2-3 stars, yet mentioned they couldn't put it down either! Funny, heart-felt, hope for the good guys to win, with an edge, it's what I love about these books..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"First off let me just say I have not read this book yet. I have read all of the previous books up to this one. With that said, I for one would like to see Anita become more shallow. I like the idea that she becomes a promiscuous slut. I think this would be a good character development and liven things up. I have never liked Richard. I think it would be pretty cool if Anita were to turn him into a sissy cross dressing tranny. A forced feminization thing if you will. Instead of turning into a were when the full moon shines, he could become totally Fem and become Anita's submisssive girlie/boy. Anita could dress him up like a girl and totally humiliate him whenever the full moon rises. Hopefully this series will evolve into something like this. It would really be awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"MysticalStar","review":"What happens when you try to mix a heroine who, \\"Doesn't do casual sex\\" with an editor who wants to \\"heat up\\" what has been a great supernatural series? Apparently, you get \\"Narcissus in Chains,\\" which is as bad a book as the book just before it, \\"Obsidian Butterfly,\\" is good. The heroine of this series, Anita Blake, has gone through a lot, and always remained strong and her own person. To have her now be portrayed as an out-of-control nympho, who will even attempt to jump the bones of a monster-while he's trying to kill her-strains credulity just a bit too far. It is so obvious \\"the ardeur\\" is intended to spice up the books that it is both awkward and stilted. I still prefer my monsters killed, not kissed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was an option for 0 stars","review":"Thanks Ms. Hamilton for taking a series I really enjoyed, with a fascinating alternate present with vampires and werewolves living among us and a really interesting, strong female lead with an unusual profession (necromancer) with interesting side characters like Jean Claude and just stomping your foot on it and twisting it under your, completely destroying it. There is absolutely nothing left of the original series which I enjoyed so much.Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge let down","review":"The Anita Blake series started going down hill when plot, character development, and decent stories were pushed aside for as much sex and contrived sexual situations as possible. The series were great when Anita was actually WORKING as an animator and solving crimes on the side. I don't think she has been to work in the last two books.I say let Hamilton get all her erotica out in her new series (which is basically Anita Blake without the intial sex hangups) and get back to the basics with the Anita Blake series that we all know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the crunk....","review":"Ok...if all that you read for is sex, and if sex is all you think about then go for this book, but if your like me and need some plot to go along with your story stay the heck away from this.Long time Anita fans also beware. This book is of course a tale taking place after OB...but oddly enough when I read it it didn't feel at all like Anita and just had me thinking 'Did I miss a book somewhere?'Lets all hope and pray that LKH gets out of the funk she's in and brings us back some real storytelling and not some dime-smut like this.In two words: Big Disapointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex and violence - no plot or humor","review":"I love the Anita Blake series - but definitely not this one. To this point, Anita has been a witty, intelligent, dangerous woman with great internal strength. In this book, all that goes out the window. Her powers continue to grow, and her moral resolve crumbles to nothing. Where in previous books, she tries to make hard choices, and approaches life with a sense of humor, here she is not funny, and a sex maniac. To LKH I'd have to say - keep the sadomasochistic sexual tendencies to your fairie character from Kiss of Shadows - keep Anita the strong ass-kicking ball of INDEPENDENT fire that she always was. And bring back the humor! Where Anita was once a woman I could admire, and even wish to emulate, she has now become someone I would want nothing to do with. Remember - most of your readers are like Ronnie - regular people who want the best for Anita. We dont want to see her as a mindless, unfunny sex slave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Worse","review":"The glory of Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake books is, in my, view the toughness of the central character. She is the terminator, she doesn't give in, she doesn't stop and she never backs down. Added to this are the imaginative plots combining gothic fantasy and detective-noir.Ms. Hamilton's books have always had a strong element of the erotic. In her earlier books this element was pretty much under control and, indeed, usefully established the \\"otherness\\" of the world co-existing with our own. Unfortunately in this book, like her last, this element has been allowed to dominate, resulting in a sado-masochistic farce. Not only is this excess boring in itself but much of it is predictable - there are striking similarities between scenes in the last few books.A plea from a fan - drop the touchy feely stuff and please return to the hunter-killer mode and the imaginative plot lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita Has Lost Her Compass","review":"I am so tired of a great character, Anita Blake, being obsessed with sex, sex, sex. She was fabulous and now is totally one-dimensional. I think she would consider jumping a turnip if she walked close by one. And all this back-and-forth between Jean-Claude and Richard is BORING. How did Anita sink into this morass?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest disappointment ever","review":"To make it short and to the point:-No cohesive plot-The character development is highly inconsistent-Many, many, spelling and grammatical errors-Repetitive and unimaginative descriptive phrases-Confusing narration-Repetitive, emotionless, boring sex scenes-Contemptible behavior on Anita's part-Many, poorly developed, unnecessary additions to the already leviathan cast of characters-Completely joyless narration-Most of the characters from the earlier books under went total character assassination-etc., etc.The worst part is that I used to really like this series. Narcissus in Chains was a highly anticipated sequel which I ordered months in advance. After reading this book, I can no longer enjoy the earlier novels. The flaws in the series have been made too obvious to be overlooked any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn with fangs","review":"A complete waste; of time, of money, of paper, you name it. Unless, of course, you enjoy voyeuristically wallowing in someone else's fantasies. It must have been difficult for Amazon to find six pages from this book to display that DON'T consist entirely of turgid sex scenes. And, even those weren't well written, in my opinion, though some of the female reviewers here seemed to like it. So, maybe it's a guy thing. The fact remains this book is basically porn, occasionally interrupted by other events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely readable","review":"I'm not a prude and don't turn twenty-seven shades of red if I read something \\"raw\\" or twisted, but this book delves far, far too deeply into the sexual underworld of bondage, deviancy, etc, etc. Was it really necessary? It took me 3 tries to actually get into this book and I still don't see the point of it. I realize that Anita Blake is not your normal paranormal character, but somewhere along the line the author took a seriously wrong turn and now what used to be an enjoyable series has turned into hard core porn. Why? All she needs to add now are some \\"Oh, baby, harder, harder!\\" type comments into the writing and it won't be anything different from the books the neighborhood perv reads.What a sad turn for what was once such a promising character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely AWFUL","review":"I am a HUGE fan of the Anita Blake books. This is my second time through the series and they're just as good as the first time. However, this one absolutely lacks plot. The characters you've come to know and love are dull and flat and down right whiny. There's way too much sex in this particular novel. I mean sure, a little sex is good but seriously? The whole thing is sex, sex, sex. She leaves no clues as to who the villain is so you're surprised at the end which is good. But there's NO plot until the last like 13% of the novel. I was extremely disappointed but don't let this one bad apple deter you from the reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop reading the Anita Blake series before you read this one.","review":"Up to this book, this is a pretty good series, but I've now read though all but Blood Noir and I won't read any more (I would have stopped at this one but I'd already bought the whole series). Anita has lost almost all of the qualities I liked about her by this book, her independence, strength, and self reliance. She's always needy and that always requires some type of sex with someone different. Gosh, does that get boring. Ms. Hamilton has forgotten or given up on writing a plot for these stories and just goes from one sexual situation to another. No more for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficulty Finishing This Book","review":"When I discovered the Anita Blake Series I fell in love. I devoured all the books prior to this one. It took several tries before I was able to finish it. With the books prior to this one, I'd stay up all night and read until done. I kept getting stuck on this one. I couldn't \\"swallow\\" all the unnecessary, poorly written sexual content. I'm thoroughly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a memorable book","review":"This entire series is a Mary-Sue. Take one look at the author's picture and then read the description of Anita. Anita is the center of every single character's world. Every male abases themselves before her. Every female character either hates her or looks to her for protection. The police apparently can't do their jobs and it's up to her to fix things. Blah blah blah blah blah. It's basically 'Twilight' with porn except for the personalities of the main characters. I'm just glad I bought the books for a few cents instead of full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I have been reading the Anita books and loved it ever since Guilty Pleasures. That is why I'm thoroughly disappointed with this book. I'm halfway through the book already and still there's not even a hint of a big bad. After the scene at the club, it's like 200 pages of repetative sex scene nonsense. I found myself glossing through paragraphs just to get to the end of the chapter. It feels like LKH ran out of things to write and stretched a scene into 5 chapters. I mean the curing Gregory part was just wayyyyyy tooooooo loooonnngggg... If the remaining books are like this, I think I'm going to pass it. AND Anita is getting to be so annoying. Whatever happened to her raising the dead or her police work or hell does she even works at her office anymore?"},{"rating":"2","title":"anita blake series","review":"this series was the best i have ever read. i read the entire series in 2 weeks now i am going through anita withdrawals. i can't wait for the next one"},{"rating":"1","title":"One angry and childish woman","review":"Maybe if I had read the other 9 books featuring character Anita Blake before this one I could get a better grip on just why this woman becomes violently angry in every other paragraph. In this particular book when she isn't having sex in some form or other with the main male characters, she's threatening to shoot them. I found the Anita Blake character and this book childish and rather melodramatic. Considering the subject line you'd have thought there would have been more meat on the bone as the saying goes but alas the was no real plot to follow unless the ardeur was to supply that also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh...","review":"Alright, first off, I gave it two stars because /I/ didn't like it overmuch, but that doesn't mean it's Worlds Most Horrible Book. I think LKH overdid the sex, and recently Anita has shifted from the witty, sharp witted character I found so fun in the begining of the series. Re-reading Guilty Pleasures and Circus of the Damned after reading Narcissus in Chains made that really clear. I was unhappy to see so little of the police group, and Animators Inc...especially Zerbrowski (And Larry, whatever happened to him???) Again, I'm not putting a big DO NOT READ sign on this book, it has it's good (and bad) points, but more of a warning, this is a big change, and if the Anita from the early books is who you loved (Gag me with a spoon etc), you might want to skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita Blake is a wonderful heroine","review":"Laurell K.

We are introduced to a new character Micah Callahan. He is the Nimir-Raj for the Maneater Clan. He is in the city searching for a home for his pard, and for help to defeat a \\"bad man\\" that has taken them over. I like the fact that there is now someone that thoughout the story is there to support and understand Anita much like the element of Jean Claude. This adds another person that she has to come to terms with being involved in a sexual nature into her life. Of course there is still the issue of Richard not being able to accept who and what he is. Ultimately this leads to him rejecting what Anita has become. The love life of Anita along with the action, magic, and new emotions that she deals with, and the powers that she develops are another part of her character that makes her seem more real and intriguing to read. This story was great and I hope that the next one is even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORRRRRRRRRING","review":"Well the first Anita Blakes were great, but this was one sex scene after another and just boring.

Anita having sex with anything sporting the proper plumbing2. Anita whining about #13. Richard not happy about #14. Anita telling everyone around her how tough she is5. Anita / Richard / J.C. triumvirate not working outRemove these elements and you'd be left with a story that fit into 50 pages.LKH comes up with interesting ideas and unusual characters. It's too bad that her last several books have primarily belonged in the porno rack. It's not even GOOD porn, the kind that titillates -- it's just the kind you skim over, wondering when the story is going to start moving again.Come on, LKH, you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Genuine Disappointment","review":"How is it possible for a talented writer to follow up one of the very best books in a series with one of the worst? It's baffling. I really wanted to like this book, but often found myself skimming through the seemingly endless (and humdrum) sex scenes and discussions of mysticism. There was very little action (internal or external), few captivating characters, and a sense that with this novel, Hamilton has decided to head in a new direction. Now, don't get me wrong...I often love it when authors veer off in new and exciting directions, but Hamilton's choices are neither.Reading this book was a lot like listening to a friend who has created all kinds of problems in their life, but refuses to make the choices that would be necessary to get their house in order. They whine and moan, and eventually you give up on giving advice or even listening. Laurell, I'm about to stop listening to Anita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Australian","review":"Hi - I have been (like most of the other reviewers) an Anita Blake fan for years but I too found her latest effort dismal and disappointing - it's almost like someone else wrote it - this isn't some sort of VC Andrews thing is it(After Virginia Andrews died the whole family took over and started writing her novels)? This book spends far too much talking about clothes and explaining everything in exhausting detail, and YES there is too much sex and Anita has way too many roles & super powers (what's this ardeur thing?). Also what's happened to Jean Claude - is he to become a wimpy character with almost no coverage in Ms Hamilton's novels? There also seems to a very homoerotic aspect in this novel which I find unnecessary, will Jean Claude be wearing a dress in the next book? Anyway I'm not happy and will think twice about buying the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proves Kiss Of Shadows is the new LKH style","review":"As has been pointed out by many other reviewers here, NiC is soft-core porn. Among the many faithful Anita Blake followers, it was for her nickname The Executioner that we loved her. In the latest (10th) of the series, Anita Blake is hard to distinguish from Meredith Gentry from KoS. It was hoped that LKH would use her \\"Dark Farie\\" Kiss of Shadows novels as her erotic line and leave Anita Blake Vampire Hunter to what LKH does best , ie action scenes with intense characterization.I am presently loaning out my copy of Narcissus in Chains so others won't buy the hardback. Most say they will buy a paperback or used copy later, but they are in no hurry. This is from people who have been reading LKH since the first of this series. Here's hoping LKH gets Anita back on track in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Downfall of a Wonderful Series","review":"The decline is finally complete and I will not be reading any of the new Anita Blake books. Hamilton has transformed a witty and unique series into supernatural smut.

Other than that, I'm not sure why Zebrowski, Dolph, et. al. were even in the book. The plot was basically an excuse to go from one sex scene to another.

Each book had a new twist and a different type of enemy for Anita to face. However, I have noticed that with each book the sex gets kinkier and the emphasis on bodily fluids has become grosser and more prevalent to the point of disgust. While I have liked most of the books in the series, this one was over the top and I have not been able to finish it and dont know if I will. I have just found I no longer care about the characters or their over the top relationships. I hope that if Ms. Hamilton continues the series, she will revert back to the things that made the books special; the different monsters and the mystery of finding and destroying them. Enough already with the sex and messier aspects of the stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing/Softcore","review":"After Obsidian Butterfly being one of the best in the Anita Blake series, you've now come to the worst.There's very little storyline, or character development. Though it has a couple of moments, there's hardly any action to speak of... apart from... action in the bedroom.Now don't get me wrong, I'm not averse to a bit of spice but I'd like some substance to back it up. At some points this seems like so much slash.And what happened to the title character?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita, Powerpuff Girl?","review":"The 10th book in the Anita Blake-Vampire Hunter series continues the disturbing trend of the last few books, especially the last 2, of heaping ridiculous power after ridiculous power onto Anita Blake. Thats fine if you're into reading comic books heroines that leap tall buildings in a single bound and \\"kick-...\\", but if you are looking for complex, mature, human females, you're probably going to want to skip these books from here on out. Anita doesn't even remotely resemble one anymore.I gave the book 2 stars for the marrying of the marks in the beginning....a start that promised a better book then delivered, and Jean-Claude finally losing his temper with the childish Anita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex & Violence, and not much else.","review":"I've read all the Anita Blake books, and enjoyed them all, except this one. I've thought for several books that Anita was getting too violent, but in this one, she loses the last shreds of her morals, and appears dedicated to pursuing all the sex, violence, and violent sex she can get. This book is almost totally plotless! Anita used to be a great character I could love and admire- the Anita in this book is just a bloodthirsty ..."},{"rating":"1","title":",,,deleted my original review","review":"A disappointing mess of an entry in a series that absorbed and amazed me for many books.I'll leave it at that, since so many one star reviews of this book are vanishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks Laurell","review":"How do I feel about NiC? I feel ... absolutely nothing. In that regard, NiC has got to be one of the worst books that I've ever read. I never even entered the Anitaverse, I was just staring at ink on the page. None of the characters generated any sort of emotional response from me, not even two pivotal scenes. Nothing.As someone who's been reading AB:VH for a few years, I'm disappointed that Laurell has felt the need to change her characters so radically. No one's actions were in character, and the characters' actions were inconsistent within the book itself.However, I do feel the need to thank Laurell for two things: First, LKH is off my shelf, off my wish list, and out of my wallet. I have absolutely *NO* interest in the next AB:VH book. If Laurell felt that it was her job to alienate long-time fans, then she has done that extraordinarily well."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disapointment-dont waste your money","review":"I wouldnt reccomend this drivel to anyone.Her characters are one demensional,boring,yet they are always exquisitely beautiful-please!!I was expecting much more and as you can tell was very let down.It was a long,boring read that went no place.The dialogue is often trite and stilted.At times the story is vague.I reccomend that Ms Hamilton work on making her characters a little more believeable,and a little less perfect.If you are going to throw in Bdsm and sex,to sell your books,at least make it erotic.It was a big Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye to the Anita Blake I loved from the start","review":"Horrible, just horrible. This was the beginning of the end of the Anita Blake series for me. Books 1 thru 9 were great reads, books 10 thru 14 left me frustrated and upset with the person Anita became. I did enjoy The Harlequin but it was just a little too late in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop now!","review":"For anyone who is reading Ms Hamilton's series in order, I suggest you stop with Obsidian Butterfly and call yourself content. The later books in the series, starting with Narcissus in Chains, then Cerulean Sins and Incubus Dreams do not follow the formula which enamoured early readers.In Narcissus in Chains, Anita changes from a formidible trigger happy somewhat prudish zombie raiser, to a hedonistic magical wonderwoman in thigh highs and a miniskirt with a stable of 'committed lovers' (none of whom are human).If you like your porn with little or no plot, then go ahead and buy it - but for goodness sakes, go to the library, a second hand bookstore or get the paperback. Waste as little money as possible on this prurient prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I ever read","review":"So many other reviewers have explained the flaws with this book, that I can't really add anything to their comments. I'd just like to suggest that if the book is republished, they print it on toliet tissue so the book can be of some practical use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploring her boundaries","review":"I have read all of the Anita Blake series and I see a steady progression that is intriguing to me. After reading some of the first reviews, I didn't think they read the same book, so it goes to show you we review everything from our own personal experiences. This book was bloodier, sexier, more violent than any of the others but Anita is entering a world she knows nothing about and she has no guide so anything is game. I think she realizes she can't control everything and she won't always triumph! But as we all know, what doesn't kill us makes us stronger! As for the sex, so far she has had sex 4 men in her 28 years. Hey, give her a break! As for Micah, it wasn't casual they are still together. I'm looking forward to the next installment and I think Anita is a great kick [butt] character. I can't wait to see what Ms. Hamilton will think of next."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"I don't know why so many people are so diappointed in this book, it was EXCELLANT. The sex seems to be necessray due to the evolution of Anita's character. It's not like she is just jumping everyone, it is the \\"ardeur\\". I also hope something does happen with Asher, I'm sick of Richard and I don't like Micah. I can't wait to see what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch.","review":"Oh my good god, do not read this book. It's worse than a Harlequin romance novel. It's awful. Awful. Pure evil. A disgrace to the series.Ow. Make it go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad it is","review":"Laurell Hamilton \\"jumped the shark\\" with this book. I have read all of the Anita Blake series & was highly disappointed with this one. The plot was VERY thin to non-existent. I don't mind the sex as long as it fits in the storyline & doesn't seem like it IS the storyline. I hope the next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate that I didn't love this book","review":"I am a big fan of the Anita blake series and was actually lucky enough to meet Laurell Hamilton at a reading of A Kiss of Shadows. She previewed this book and I was very excited about reading it, but was disappointed at the end of the read. Anita has gotten progressively darker in her books as the series has progressed, but the wanton sexcapades that ran thru this book seemed more like a continuation of the Meredith Gentry series than Anita Blake. She has basically accepted the fact that she has lost her morality, which was actually something that she used to hold in high regard. She has become a very unlikeable character and that troubled me quite a bit because I have really enjoyed the previous stories and her adventures. ... I am hoping that the next book is different, because after I finished this book I wasn't real excited about continuing the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"I *LOVED* this series - when it was about Anita Blake, Vampire Killer. Whatever happened to her? It seems this book was just an excuse for the author to write erotica - fine if that is what LKH wants to do, but don't destroy the Anita series doing it. Get Anita back on track! The gratuitous sex is just boring - what's next, a three-way in the bank lobby becomes necessary in order for Anita to be able to use her ATM card?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Character Building . . . ?","review":"In what universe? The characters, even Anita, were flat and barely recognizable. The first few chapters of the book were great, until Anita woke up in bed with a couple of strange wereleopards. After that, I had to force myself to finish the book. I've read the other books, especially Burnt Offerings and Blue Moon, to pieces. Yet this one sits on my shelf, collecting dust. What happened to the humor? The mystery? The action? If I wanted sex, I would have bought erotica.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed doesn't cover it","review":"The teaser I read in Out of this World is the only reason I started reading this series. Between August and October, I read all of the Anita Blake books and became hooked. And then, October comes and NIC hits the shelves. And I was ready to throw it at the wall. Poor sentence structure isn't even the beginning, but her editor needs to seriously brush up on her editing skills.Little plot, little mystery, very little thrills (unless you count pointless meaningless sex). A waste of money. This will probably be the last book of hers I buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laurell Hamilton taking the Anne Rice course of writing","review":"I absolutely loved all of the previous Anita Blake books as they were the anti-dote to the bizarre overwrought works of Anne Rice. Anita was a moral character that was able to hold her own. Sadly, in Narcissus in Chains, she has become Anita Blake Necromancer extroidinaire and part time Porno Queen. It is my hope that Laurell Hamilton chalks up this work as some sort of anamoly and starts fresh with a new and improved storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"LKH gives us her equivalent to \\"The Phantom Menace\\"","review":"Don't get me wrong, Laurell K Hamilton is still my favorite author. I have gobbled up her previous 9 Anita Blake novels, and they continue to be old favorites on nights when I want to revisit my favorite butt-kicking heroine.Narcissus in Chains very much reminded me of \\"The Phantom Menace: Star Wars Episode I\\". Huge buildup, waited a long time, and it fell flat for me. I might have liked it a little if I didn't have the previous 9 to compare it to. The plot and character depth just wasn't there.However, I felt that Anita's butt-kicking ability didn't shine through in this book. She cried SO many times! She bitched and demanded in a whiney fashon. She got sex, ALOT. Everyone seemed to pander to her. From Jean Claude to the entire lycanthrope community.Will I buy her next book? You bet. One off book doesn't write an author off my list. Will I recommend this book to anyone? I'd say wait until it comes out on paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"This is a great series, but skip this book. There are many Laurell K. Hamilton fans - I'm one - who would recommend this book because it's hers, but it's just bad.Sex and violence are fine if they are appropriate to the story and moves it forward. In this book the violence is so extreme that you skip pages just to get past it. For instance the Horrific Thing in this story not only gets loose in a hospital but... and I couldn't believe she needed to so this, but heads right for the nursery! Yep you bet. The carnage is so over the top that it become ineffectual and takes you away from the story. I actually stopped reading this book because I lost interest.She has many much better books to pick from I recommend you save your pennies for any of her earlier books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope this is part of a longish plot line that goes on","review":"First of all, I don't mind normally reading a steaming chapter or two of sexual encouters, but this time it was just to much of the same.Too darn much sex, sex, sex and not much else - especially when LKH needs 10 to 15 pages to describe one sexual encounter.It gets to the point where you ask yourself where the story is ?The fact also that LKH in her intro says her usual clique of writer friends didn't see this one due to time constraints, points sort of the way to a novel that was quickly written.All is not lost, if you're an optimist like me though - this could also be the book that describes Anita's descent into 'hell' and in the next book her fight against it and her climb back out of it. How to get rid of the marks ? How to get rid of the sex ?I'll wait for the next one to check if Anita as we know it survives...I'll be sorely disappointed if the next one doesn't"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I have loved the Anita Blake books for years, but this book has really turned me off. What was Ms. Hamilton thinking? The characters have totally changed, and I am seriously considering not only not reading any more, but also getting rid of the books I have now. It was a complete disappointment--more so because I stood in line for two hours to have her sign the book. Now I wish I could return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was my cup of tea","review":"The newest installment in the Anita Blake series, is, by far, one of the best. I'm so happy with the outcome, and that Anita is \\"growing up\\" and finally listening to what other people have to say. I think the ending served to be the right choice for Anita. The new characters were great, and I really think this book serves as a closing point of old plots and problems and a branch to new things. I definatly suggest it to the LKH fans out there, at least give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"different but in a good way","review":"I am a major fan of the Anita Blake series. I think LKH has let Anita grow in these books little by little. Anita is finally opening herself up for others to love and care for her instead of her taking care of everyone else. This is good and something that has been missing in her life, probably since she was a child.I was happy that LKH resolve the Jean-Claude and Richard situation. I enjoyed learning a little more about Jean-Claude and Asher. She introduced some new characters and hinted that they have stories to tell, but left it to be told at a later date, much like she did with Edward. I have faith that she will get around to tell us and making them less \\"one-dimensional\\" like other viewers mentioned. Fleshing out these people was the main point of this book.I can't wait for the next one. Thanks LKH for another page turner. It was well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written piece of work! A definite page turner!","review":"Very well written, interesting plots and very interesting characters...it was the first anita blake series I read as well as the first book by Laurell Hamilton and was well pleased, now I'm looking for more. Typically, vampire novels aren't my cup of tea but the plot was very well put together and the characters were amazing; I fell in love with anita, micah and jean-claude, and there was much suspense, action and romance. It has become one of my favorite books. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys supernatural thrills and enticing characters. Honestly, I couldn't put the book down; it was truly interesting trying to figure out what new situation anita would get herself into. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very depressing book.","review":"I thought it was a very depressing book. It was confussing and the ending did not tie it together like I would of thought.

It would be a good book if I could understand the point of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakin awe inspiring","review":"I recently read this book in eight grade literature class and it is one of the hardest books to grasp. It makes you think and it constantly makes you wonder what exactly is going on. This book is about corruption in the government and a boys goal of reaching his father at a hospital, seemingly. I would recomend this book for teenagers to adults it's simply stunning and very confusing so if your going to read it actually read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"da Book\\"I am The cheese' is a hit","review":"This book \\"i am the cheese\\" is a good book.

I would not recommend it unless you like a book like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cheese stinks","review":"This book was kind of hard to read, it didn't flow very well among other authors like Gary Paulsen's books. Cormier was very random, although the ending was very amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the matter??!?","review":"I remember reading this book in seventh grade and finding it to be one of the most moving books I had read to that moment in my life. And, no, I'm not that old either, a Freshman in college. To those of you from seveth to ninth grade, the book is not about understanding everything but rather making a strong emotional connection with the narrator. I hope you can look back on this work of art later in life and cherish its memory as I do now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Worth Your Time","review":"I Am The Cheese is my favorite book written by Robert Cormier. He is an excellent author who always writes from a very realistic point of view, and I Am The Cheese is no exception. The story was confusing, but that's what makes it so great. The intricate details that you must pick up along the way to understand hold your attention and keep you 'on your toes'. The story of Adam Farmer and the way that Cormier uses the song The Farmer in the Dell is a brilliant idea. I reccommend this novel to anybody, and even though I am in 10th grade, I'm sure that students in junior high would still be able to grasp some of the meaning, and the lesson that Robert Cormier is trying to teach all of us about ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book!","review":"I must admit...the title was ever attractive.

I have never read any of Cormier's other books, but this book is greatly discouraging me from doing so. If I didn't have to read this book as a class assignment, I never would have read past the first five pages. No one in my class, not even the teacher, understood it and we repeatedly had to reread parts of the book before we could make any sense of it.

It leaves you in a weird suspence. In some of the books that I read this was a really good thing to have because it was a mystery. That kind of book needs suspence. Now I Am the Cheese on the other hand, used it completely wrong. He made it so that the reader got confused. This isn't a good thing to do. The skipping back and forth from storylines just in my opinion stunk.All in all I did not like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like to be depressed-read this book!","review":"This book is about a troubled boy wandering through practically a nightmare--his own life story.

I think that this book was too hard to understand, because the story kept on switching from the interview, to the bike ride, and to the flashbacks. Also, I think that Cormier could have developed the characters more than he did. He developed Adam too much and everyone else that he met on the bike ride, his parents, Amy Hertz, and Grey not enough. This was probably the dumbest and most confusing book that I have ever read. I think that the school board should not make this a required reading title. Overall I think this was a horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally boring and uneventful til the end.","review":"This book is useless, boring, and horibly written.

The scary thing is I voted to read this. The whole mental institution thing appealed me. Unfortunatly I was wrong. This book is confusing in all ways.

Trust me, don't get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cheese Stands alone.","review":"First of all, this book is WACKY! My seventh grade honors class was FORCED to read it. It is very understandable but the plot is a little zany. A boy rides a bike around...This book was also an eyeopener to some people life styles. Cough-Arthur-cough. Now, I know that he was trying to send a message of some sort but I couldn't exactly figure it out. What - their are loony people out their? This book was also the [back side] of MANY jokes. Anyway, I found this book.... interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ive ever read","review":"I am the cheese was the worst book i have ever read.

I am wtiting this review to tell anybody who hast read it not to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Confusing Cheese!","review":"The book I Am the Cheese is a confusing suspense thriller that's written in a different kind of technique then other books I've read. The end is so astonshing that you never suspected anything as weird as what happened on those last two chapters. However, I think some of the language was for mature teenagers and not for anyone below eighth grade. The language could have been taken out without altering the outcome of the story. Also, people who have read the book before said I would learn something about myself, though I never did. So I think that it's better just as a suspense thriller, because it definitely keeps you waiting for the end! I want to read some of Cormier's other books and see if they have the same action and writing technique!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am the Cheese","review":"This book was confusing at first, but towards the end it started to make sense. I tought this book was interesting also. It made you use your brain. There were little bits and pieces of this story that were used later on and that helped you figure out what was going on. At the end I was still a little confused, but once I thought it over twice it made sense. Over-all this would be a book for people who like to solve mysteries. This was a very perplexed story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Yet Interesting","review":"Although I liked this book, I felt that it was rather hard to follow and a bit confusing. The plot of the book was good yet Cormier needed to make a clearer image for his readers. Cormier wrote a very creative novel but He just needed to expand a little to make the book more understandable. I also felt that a few of the characters needed a little more description. I do have to admit parts of the book were exilerating and kept me on the edge of my seat. The book did have a lot of twists and turns which kept the readers alive. Altogether I thought this would have been a great book if Cormier worked on it a little more. I think the book would appeal to readers with more of an imagination and who would take the time to think about the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I twist on life","review":"I think that this is a wonderful book. It is very exciting and always keeps you on the edge of your seat every moment that you read it. It is the type of book that takes a persons life and twists it all around in to this astonising awsome book. this book leads you to have a lot of questions all threw out the book.

I hope if you read it you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping 'till the end!","review":"This book was very well written. It kept my attention throughout the whole book. At first I thought this would be another boring book we had to read for school, because it was slow and confusing, but as I read on, I kept wanting to read more to find out what happened next. It was gripping until the end. I've heard when you ask questions about a book after you've read it that you are interested. I don't know if this is true, but if it is, then I was REALLY interested, because I was asking a million questions, and when it was all sorted out in my head I thought it was a very clever story.Cormier kept switching perspectives of the story which was very interesting. I enjoyed this book a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am the Cheese","review":"I am the cheese starts out slow, and is kinda confusing. Once you've become part of the book and begin to think like Adam, the book is great. Robert Cormier creates an illusion from what seems to be real. What is real is actually a figment of the imagination. Everyone should read this book!!!! Young and old can enjoy the confusion and discovery this book offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I stand alone","review":"I am the Cheese was an exciting yet depressing book. It is so interesting you don't want to put it down. When I was reading it, I felt as though I was in it. It seemed as though you're experiencing the same things that Adam Farmer experiences. This book is about how Adam Farmer has to find and face his past. He comes to realize he has to live his life never knowing whom to trust. He also recognizes his need to forgive his parents for concealing the secrets of their previous identity. It was a stirring book reading how Adam Farmer did stand alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheese Please!","review":"\\"I Am The Cheese\\" was a good book. It wasn't the best book that I've ever read, but it's not the worst either. You had to pay attention to the characters through out the book, because if you didn't you'd probably get lost really easily in the end. I think it's really neat that he takes so many thing's in a boys life and puts it together and makes it all come together in the end. Not many people can do that. Reality plays a big part in this story. You can never really tell if what's going on is reality or fiction. So please read the book, it's worth your time and energy.

Adam Farmer is trying to make heads or tails out of his life and is having a hard time doing so. This story will suck you in and not let go until the unbelievable ending. No matter what style fiction you enjoy, this book will keep you enthralled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe I'm a bit biased since I consider Cormier one of my favorite authros..","review":"However, this book was fantastic. Seriously, run out and buy it. NOW.I love unexpected endings. With Cormier, I've come to expect the unexpected. Nothing prepared me for this!Usually in my reviews, I post a short description, in my own words. I won't this time, as I don't want ot give ANYTHING away. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"makes sense in the end","review":"This is a suspenseful and fast-paced tale about Adam, who pedals furiously and desperately on his bike across New England in search of his father, his past, and his sanity. The story is spliced with excerpts from a transcript involving Adam and a sinister, mysterious interrogator. As I read, I wondered why Adam seemed so mute and withdrawn during these sessions, but in retrospect, after the last chapter, it made perfect sense. If psychological intrigue, you'll like this book. A definite must-read for Cormier fans. A strange, tragic, and addictive book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am the Cheese","review":"I do believe that i am the cheese is a great book. It was a book that was interesting. You needed to read the entire book to understand the book. It takes a few pages before the book makes sense. Once you start you want to continue. The book tells about Adam Farmer's life. It starts out with Adam wanting to go and visit his father. He goes on his own little adventure on his way to see his father. The book will really get you in the ending. This book has a real different type of ending. If you read you shall find out why this ending is so special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of I Am the Cheese","review":"This is a very creepy book, and by the way it is banned.

I loved the book. It was so suspenceful I couldn't put it down. Although, at at times it was hard to follow and understand. This book is best for teens who can read well and act mature. The way the author describes some things could only be taken in seriously by a mature mind, which is why I wouldn't recommend this to a teacher to read aloud to a class. But overall this book is great and I think you really would enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I thought this book was excellent! Although I was a bit confused at the beginning, towards the middle I began to understand it a lot better. The book was very deep and made you think about each sentence that was in it. Usually books make you confused at the beginning and it explains everything at the end, but this book was different. At the end, you were questioning things. It made you go through all the possibilities because it never gave you a direct answer on almost everything. I would advise everyone to read this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW its pretty wierd","review":"that was the wierds book i have eva readit was very involved and boring for most of the time and i find it very difficult to understand and how he was in the nursing home all the time and he was just dreaming his story it was wierd"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am the Cheese, makes me very pleased!","review":"The book called I am the Cheese, by Robert Cormier. It is am amazing book that I have read over the past few weeks. The story is based on a boy searching on a bicycle to find his father, and a desperate journey through the mind to unlock the secret past. As his search progresses through the chill October night, Adam remembers a happy childhood marred only by small memories: his parents' whispered conferences, their sudden midnight move to a new house, the strange man in the gray suit. But it is the past that must not be remembered if Adam wants to survive.It throws you off until something unbelievable happens next. It made me really want to get up and eat some cheese. This was a very good book that I just randomly picked out of the library. I have never read such an adventurous book in my life. He reaches for the truth that hovers over him at the edge of his mind- and he brings the truth to a shattering end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am The Cheese","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful writing of this book, but after just finishing it this afternoon, I still have no idea what was going on in the story.Using chapters that alternate between (apparent) real-life and the main character speaking with an adult named Brint, Mr. Cormier does a marvelous job at making every reader of this book confused beyond his/her wits.The ending-although there might be a slight chance that I understood it correctly-is too irrational and outlandish to fit smoothly into the plot and Mr. Cormier is apt to puzzle you with it...that is, IF you allow yourself to go near this book. Don't. You'll be glad I spared you from it!P.S. If anyone would like to explain this book to me, please contact me as soon as possible, putting the title of the book in the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skitzo and Freakish!","review":"What was Robert Cormier on when he wrote this book?!? I Am The Cheese was not only very confusing but boring as well. We had to read it for our summer assignment. Robert Cormier's idea of a skitzofrenic male in a mental hospital was not only childish but very unprofessional. Not one of the estimated 30 of us in class could understand or care about what was going on. And the POKEY THE PIG? Hello! I expected something a bit more important! The characters Adam Farmer and Brint were the most confusing. In conclusion, I am not the only one that hates this book. I would never recommend it to someone unless I hate the person! Even then I would not be so cruel! And the denoument in the end was probably the only part of the book I actually understood! Sorry Robert! Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am Chesse Review","review":"I Am The Cheese, Robert CormierBrian Adamson, OHISBN=0-440-94060-5PRICE=$5.50This is an excellent adventure!

He goes all his life thinking his name is Adam until his father reveals to him a deep family secret that changes his life forever. He finds out that there are people out to get his family and that his name is Paul Delmonte. The story flips back and fourth though as when he's older talking about his childhood with a therapist.

It was also very emotional. I would only recomend this book to people who can handle emotional books. During certain parts I began to cry, others I wanted to throw the book, but I was in school. At first it was kind-of confusing, but at the end it is all explained. I thought the only bad part was the author did not explain the pills. My favorite part was reading about the \\"Numbers\\". Until the end I did not understand the idea behind the tapes, but it was all explained. The book was full of suspense, it kept you wondering, thinking, up to the last few chapters...This book was one of the best books I read this year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wierd?","review":"This book was really a good book but wierd. My english teacher explained what happenen in the book to me. Adam Farmer(Paul Delmonte) has been in a large foster/mental home for 3 years. During these three yearshe takes a bike ride but never leaves the estate. He relives his past with every incounter. All of the people in the middle of the book are also somehow in the estate.

And by the way read the book and you will find out why the title is so wierd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing","review":"I Am the Cheese was good, but it was somewhat confusing. I put off reading it for a while becuase of the title. It was too strange. But I don't get I AM the CHEESE. What does cheese have to do with Adam/Paul? Also what did the \\"T\\" and \\"A\\" stand for? I know \\"T\\" was the doctor and \\"A\\" was Adam/Paul. And what about Amy Hertz? And that motel? So Amy Hertz never existed at all?

There are many interpretations. I have tried to figure them all out, however how do I know which is correct. Is he so paranoid that he dreams up all his stories? Has the government nabbed him up and is holding him to find out the truth about his family?It starts out with Adam riding his bike in search of his father at a hospital. After many encounters with who you think are strangers while he is riding his bike, the last chapter ties all those so called strangers together as familiar people. While reading this book it jumps from past to present in which you as the reader are not sure where Adam is coming from. While Adam is on his journey on his bike he seems so alone and confused....I found that this book could have explained itself better. I was left feeling empathy for Adam and very confused about the ending. It sort of leaves you hanging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Reading","review":"I really enjoyed this book and the only reason I didn't rate it higher is that I felt there were a few loose ends at the end.Adam Farmer is undergoing psychoanalysis. Little by little he seems to remember things. The more he remembers he finds out that the life he thought he came from is a lie.The author uses interesting story-telling in that some chapters follow the continuing story of Adam making a bicycle trek over a couple of days and encountering attack dogs, bullies, bad weather, and a bike thief, while on the way to meet his father to give a gift.The other chapters are either straight narrative as Adam remembers things and there are also question and answer sessions between Adam and the analysist that is interrogating him.The varied writing style makes the book flow by pretty fast. I was able to get through this one in a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rochelle's Review","review":"This book is very confusing at the start but once you read on it starts to make scence.It is also more confusing because the book is written out in three different types of narration.It somtimes kept you in suspense but the ending was very twisted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im the cheese","review":"I Am the Cheese is about how a boy, named Adam, who has to remember his lost past. His past is forgotten because it is too painful for him to remember by himself, but he has help from a doctor.

The author brought his point across which was, that you can't trust anyone in this world anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is just too confusing!","review":"I don't see how they could possibly call this book \\"young adult\\". I'm 14, and I'd like to think I'm pretty intelligent, but this book is so confusing. It is constantly switching scenes, or narrators, or whatever you want to call it. You can hardly keep track of it. It's not that this book is so bad, it's just that it's so baffling. I did actually think it was OK. I like the ending, it is totally unexpected. I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't read it though. Also, I really like the title. I had to have a book for a book review at school, and I picked I am the Cheese because I thought the title was funny. I read and read and it had nothing to with cheese. Then, I came to realize that it has to do with \\"The Farmer and the Dell\\". Adam, the main character, is constantly singing it, but we don't really know why.

I just thought this album was very bland, very boring and uninspiring. I don't think she's done an album this bad since EL TIEMPO ES ORO. And even then that album had some good songs.

I could not develop any empathy for the characters.The father, played by Oscar-winning actor Daniel Day Lewis, was rather depressing (because he is dying, I suppose he is entitled to feel that way), and the daughter, Camilla Belle, was quite disturbed, and most of her actions were unbelievable.The whole bit about the secret girlfriend and her family moving in on a moments notice was odd, and I did not feel any chemistry between the two lovers.Some brief incestuous undertones, allusions to one of the boys being gay, the promiscuity by a couple of teens seemed a bit out of place.

He's rich so he can afford not to work while living in a leftover 70s commune while waiting to die young from a heart condition.

It's not as bad as all that.If you haven't bought it, I wouldn't rush out to the store or the Amazon shopping cart for it, but if you have it, go ahead and watch it. It's strange, you'll laugh in spots, and Daniel Day-Lewis is still Daniel Day-Lewis. You might find it hard to care about any of the characters, but oh well.

Most are short, of low quality, and contain a lot of hiss or other noise. Many of the sounds are not isolated, as if they were lifted from a TV show and you can hear other sounds in the background. Some are not really sound effects, just someone speaking gibberish. You can only export the sounds as WAV files, and you can only export them one at a time, which makes it extremely tedious to add these sound effects to your project or your own sound organizer, like iTunes. You must keep the CD in the computer to access the sounds, which again makes it cumbersome to use.

They caused anger in the troops. It made them want to fight.As for being of historical value - well... they aren't. Take anything you watch with a grain of salt. Some of it may be true, some is not correct at all. The Americans use basic propoganda techniques like constantly repeating what Hitler said, and then showing what he did. The movies don't bother to tell how the political climate had changed and Hitler had been forced to act against what he had originally promised.I'm a history professor at a well-established university (sorry, can't tell you which one... anonymity is key to survival). I would not use this to teach my classes. The real facts are very different from what the movies portray.As I said... They served their purpose to boost morale in the troops back in 1944-45... but to the general public it is just hogwash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good video on the start of World War II.","review":"This video shows how Japan, Italy and Germany got to be powerfull nations and ready for war.

And, it strikes me that many business books speak in contrived terminology and approach business from an academic and often archaic level. The Profit Zone doesn't fall into that. It's a book about winners and how they did it. It's not a book about business as much as it is about people who've succeeded. It's like you have Bill Gates and Michael Eisner teaching you because the stories are so clear and detailed. I just think it's a great handbook especially for managers. Very useful, practical, and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"Like the firm with which its authors are employed, the Profit Zone aspires to greatness, but never seems to reach it.

Its intention to draw any reader (non-voyeur or voyeur) into a world of voyeurism ... by framing each photograph with thick black borders, its intention was to convey as if we were there \\"secretly\\" peering and privy to a private and secret moment.Unfortunately, it fails on several levels. Of course, grainy low-res black and white photographs are an esthetic choice - in this case, the choice certainly does not add any value to this collection - but more importantly, it fails on the level that there's no real point to these photographs ... and no real message other than just a random series of photographs of a similar subject. With no artistic point or message, it's really just a series of grainy black and white, not-very-erotic photographs. All and all, a fairly pointless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The cover and bindings of this book are great. I love the black pages. The pictures are disappointing.

Granted I'm not a Ph.D., this book shouldn't have been that difficult to read; for this, I might as well read Darwin's book. While some parts were complicated, I think the main problem of the book was that it was edited poorly. If you don't think punctation marks matter, give this book a read. Afterwards, you will praise an English teacher. On a good note, however, Jones did wonderful in the explanation department. I did learn a lot on his AIDS coverage. For a better yet simpler read on evolution, I recommend Richard Dawkins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by Subtitle?","review":"Unfortunately, this is not an update to \\"Origin of the Species,\\" but a layperson's \\"guide\\" to developments in evolution biology. Darwin's own revisions and updates to Origin of Species, turned out to often be wrong. But he was a very good writer, and I was looking forward to an actual \\"update\\" (specifically of the first edition).

Certain fragments are very interesting and even shocking to the layman (just for example: Earth's history, details about bacterias, ants, bees and behavior of cuckoos and other birds/animals). And OK, I understand: there is no charity in Nature, everything comes down to DNA, its mobility, exchange, transmittance, etc.(meaning DNA science is a key in today's research on evolution). However I had to struggle quite often over many sections of this text. Swamped by chaos of too many examples, \\"Darwin's Ghost's\\" huge disadvantage is a lack of 'Glossary of Scientific Terms' - a MUST for any popular science book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Many interesting facts, ideas and pieces","review":"I found this book a great read. In the interest of keeping this short, since at least one review is highly detailed - here are some quick notes. Many of the examples used were new, like the AIDS virus information and because of this the book is not only of interest to the evolution folks as an example, it is also of interest to anyone who would like to know more about some recent biological work. One other example that just stuck with me was some of the information on heredity. The example of the cats, were fully white cats are commonly deaf due to gene interrelationships.This is a highly readable book and I for one would recommend it to anyone with some interest in evolution (be you pro or con on the subject) or recent biological work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Disagree","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever tried to read. I read about a third of it and quit. It's a waste of my reading time. It is not seriously explanatory at all. It is merely a heaping together of things that can be said in loose association with a topic. All sorts of odd examples, cute little metaphors, long metaphors are tossed on in rapid succession, very witty, very clever, very cute. Unfortunately, many of the sentences make little sense at all, or if they do, they have to be decoded. For someone who really wants to find out about evolution it is intensely frustrating. I suppose those who already know about evolution find all these various ways of expressing it fun. They are the ones who recommend the book, and, as is often the case with experts reading popularizations, what they enjoy has nothing to do with the needs of those for whom popularizations are written."},{"rating":"1","title":"never got it","review":"well i give it only one star because i never got the book customs did not give it to me they say its illegal to let it in the country i read a little about it on line it looks very interesting but sorry did not get it"},{"rating":"2","title":"was good for my ESL kids","review":"was good for my ESL kids the older ones will do well with this......................would reccoment this for any class.....yesssssss will be used"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent follow-up to L&T 2000","review":"Having come-off a huge hit (2000 remake of the classic \\"Loops & Tings\\" by Jens) with remixes by Humate and Anastasia, Lady Tom returns with another sure-fire trance track.

That's new for me! It is well designed and heavy. The bowls feel really sturdy and it's a breeze to clean. Really! The small 4 cup bowl inside the bigger 9 cup bowl is ingenius. You don't have to find extra storage for the little one while not in use, and it's really smart; one food processor for small and large jobs. You can't go wrong with this one.

The inner plastic sleeve/tube is too short and the sauces and pestos I make ooze right up over that tube and all over the machine and counter. It's disgusting and to add insult to injury is hard to clean the now gooped up base! Why on earth would they design something so poorly. Don't they test these first? Did they think no one would use the 9 cup bowl? The mini-bowl is better, but none of my recipes work in that small of a bowl. This machine is worthless.

I tried so many times to remove/lift the large bowl without a spill - no luck. Even before you try to lift it, while you are chopping stuff -- if there is a tiny amount of liquid it will find its way out the middle tube and down the base and on the counter. The small bowl is hard to lift up without either getting your fingers in the food or having stuff fall into the large bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anything liquid","review":"I bought this unit because of all of the positive reviews, however I find myself returning it. When making something like salsa, cole slaw or other dishes that contain even the smallest amount liquid, the liquid will come through the middle of the device under the blade and out the bottom of the bowl. Unfortunately it is a pain to clean up! Additionally the unit is very bulky and doesn't fit into my cupboard or on my counter. I love KitchenAid (I've had a mixer for years and wouldn't give it up), but this downside of not being able to handle any liquid makes the device completely irrelevant for me.To clarify: the ridge from the bottom of the bowl at the hole in the center (over which the blade fits) was only about 1/4 - 1/2 inch tall. Not like other processors that i have seen that are about 2 inches tall, thereby allowing for some liquid in the bowl without spilling up and under the blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fatal design flaw","review":"I bought my processor last November because I was going to be making the family Thanksgiving dinner. For slicing and most dicing, it works well. The most important problem with it is that the center lip of the work bowl is only about 1 inch high, which means that's the most liquid it will hold. That's approximately the amount of juice produced by 6 lemons, which really is not very much at all, so it really limits its usefulness. Another problem is the small work bowl slants out, so the blade throws whatever you're dicing up where some of it stays while whatever's on the bottom gets pulverized. If I had read more reviews before I bought it, I would not have. I really relied on the Kitchenaid name, which in this case did not pay off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and beautiful but handle holds liquid after washing","review":"I'v had this processor for a few years and it looks and acts like new. I use it maybe 3x a month but when you need one, you need one!. Grating cheese (hard cheeses) saves money and the other attatchments all work well. The ONLY thing I don't like is that the handle holds water in it and if the water isn't real clean then scum/water will be seen floating around in the handle, not really very attractive. Otherwise it's a great machine, not too loud, runs smoothly and looks great on the counter. I wish there was a way to get the water out but besides that it is a very good quality machine compared to most out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware--Customer Service Doesn't Cut It!","review":"We bought this one about 2 years ago. It worked fine with light use, however, I recently called customer service, thinking it was broken. The representative didn't want to help me try to figure what was wrong. Since it was out of warranty (1 year for this pricy processor), KitchenAid wouldn't fix it. The rep suggested I bring it or ship it to an authorized repair place. I live in Houston, Texas, one of the largest metro areas in the county. And the nearest KitchenAid repair place is 300 miles away! The rep basically said I was on my own and told me to find a local appliance repair shop.As it turns out (thank you hubby!) once in a while the parts don't lock into place, and it may seem like it doesn't work. Mea culpa. It's working again.Bottom line, my experience with KitchenAid's customer service and repair options was very disappointing, especially considering how expensive their appliances are. Won't buy from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it except for one little pesky problem.","review":"i love that it is sturdy and almost silent when in use. i have not found one job this food processor cannot handle. i made the best salsa yet. the pulse really chops without making things a pulpy mess. my one dislike is it does not hold much liquid. to make my salsa is an extra step because the little spout in the middle is only about 3 inches high and is easy to have a big spill. i have found if i leave the chopper blade in and just loosen and lift and pour quickly not as much spills through the hole. this is made shorter to hold the mini chopping bowl. the speed of receiving my order was fantastic. i would recommend this to my friends and i have but with the warning watch for liquid item overflow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing machine, but heavy and hard to clean by hand","review":"Take this review with a grain of salt. I'd been living without a food processor for almost two years when I ordered this. So, naturally, I was completely enthralled with it and immediately used it to make about four recipes that I had been sitting on, unable to try out because I didn't have the necessary equipment. How could I not love the machine that brought me homemade falafels? The only downside is that it is a little tricky to get all the little nooks and crannies cleaned properly if you're doing it by hand. I will also say that it is on the heavy side. If you don't want to leave it out on the counter, you'll be struggling with a pretty weighty piece of equipment every time you want to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine!","review":"Highly recommended in all ways, quiet, tough, durable, pretty....just one minor complaint: The lip surrounding the hole in the center of the large bowl COULD and SHOULD be higher to prevent liquids from running all over the base. I've had other food processors where the center lip is as tall as the bowl itself...not sure why they designed it this way???? Otherwise it's top nocth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very strong","review":"This is a very strong processor, able to handle processing raw nuts, seeds and veggies pretty much on daily basis. I've only had it for a couple of months and so far have been very happy. When using the small bowl as an insert, things do spill over to the big bowl, so just have to wash it as well. It's pretty quite as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"Seems very substantial. I have had it 2 months and have made cookie dough, pizza dough, thanksgiving stuffing, and soup, among other things. It did leak a bit with the soup, but then again, the soup recipe makes 12 cups, so why wouldn't a 9 cup processor leak with 12 cups of fluid in it? It feels very weighty and I don't have safety concerns about the \\"flimsiness\\" of the lid that others have described. My reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars is just that, for this price, I think ANY food processor should come with some kind of blade storage device. Once this FP is unpacked, the blades are just loose in a bag, and yes, I cut myself in the first 5 days I had it. I am now looking for that storage device...but wishing it was included and spared me a sliced finger!"},{"rating":"2","title":"KitchenAid processor lives up to its reputation.","review":"After my 20+ year-old food processor finally stopped working and knowing how much I used it, I bought this to replace it. It has a larger capacity and a useful chopping bowl insert, which I really like. It is also easy to clean. The downside is that I also bought the box for storing accessories and find that its lid its loose lid does not stay on securely and the post for holding the large metal blade is not placed in a way that the blade fits securely. That said, I am very pleased with the processor itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair Light Show","review":"This is a relatively small prism in terms of overall size and cuts. It has to be positioned just so in order to get a decent reflection."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I'm not even a horse person","review":"I picked up a copy of My Racing Heart because I'd heard it was an unusual, well-told story. \\"But I'm not a horse person,\\" I said.It didn't matter. This is a book about horse-racing meant for people who value a rich and passionate life. The history of the thoroughbred was fascinating, but moreover, the story of the author and her grandmother finding meaning in horseracing -- and in the tradition of being together -- isn't like anything else I have ever read. It sounds corny, but it was inspirational and very, very satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book","review":"I bought this book hoping for some real insight into the world of Thoroughbred racing from the history and allure of the breed to the off limits world of the backstretch. Given the authors credentials, one might think that that's what you'd get. This book, however, is the most self indulgent, cloying piece of pap ever put to paper. This book reads more like a teenage drama queen's diary than a satisfying chronicle of The Sport of Kings. The only reason to buy this book would be the picture on the cover; it's phenomenal. Unfortunately, the photographer wasn't involved with writing the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED","review":"I thought the title was a somewhat missleading. If your looking to get some insight into thoroughbred racing this is not the place to look. There are some points of intrest and humor. For the most part it is about how the author views the world of thoughbreds and horse racing, which is a view that is not all that interesting. To me she came off as a person that loves horses, but is not quite sure if she like horseracing or the racetrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to put it down...","review":"This book is so full of useless, flowery writing that I just couldn't take it anymore. Her method of description is simply annoying. Not only that... every chapter begins with lame stories of May May, Nan's grandmother, that just about drove me crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Very Best","review":"This book kept me up all night reading. It is full of great stories and many laughs. I am looking forward to the next book by Nan Mooney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Fun, Frisky, and above all Full of Talent","review":"I have been a fan of Robbie Williams since the last cd, The Ego Has Landed and I knew I had to have this cd after I saw the video for the first single Rock DJ, he never ceases to impress me or amaze me with what he comes up with next, I also think it is a travesty that we do not hear more from him because he is more talented than some of these other performers out here, I hope he keeps up the good work because he is someone I respect and admire because he is not afraid to speak his mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Ego Has Landed\\" so much that it seemed that I always took it everywhere. This new cd disappointed me. like many other people that reviewed this, I agree that you should listen to it before buying it.I watched the specials on BBCAmerica about the making of this latest cd and it made me want to buy this one. Advertising at its finest. I loved every song on the first cd but I have found a few that I could do without on this cd. Some just seemed like they were thrown in to take up space. It seemed very 70's pop/disco oriented. I'll probably put \\"EGO\\" back in the player and this one on the shelf.The video of 'Rock DJ' was good until the scenes liken to 'Night of the living dead' meets roller disco.I just wasn't impressed. I expected more from someone so talented. The pictures in the cd amused me more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robbie Comes Of Age","review":"On easily his best album since leaving the dreaded Take That, Robbie shows his repetoir of blending Pop with Rock. The strength and depth of the album could take FHM's \\"sexiest man in the world\\" to new heights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner!!","review":"Robbie Williams has done it again. This CD is an eclectic mix of infectious tunes, much like his brilliant \\"The Ego Has Landed\\". I seriously doubted he could have two amazing albums back to back,(rare for ANY artist)but he has proven me wrong. My favorite song is the one that took the longest time to grow on me - \\"Let Love Be Your Energy\\". \\"Supreme\\", \\"Kids\\" and \\"Better Man\\" are also great. \\"Rock DJ\\" is so much fun - it's pure disco. But has anyone else noticed that it too (like Supreme) is a sample tune? You can hear Barry White's \\"Ecstasy\\" throughout the chorus (many of you are probably too young to have heard that song). And it is also very close in style to \\"Pop Musik\\" by M.All in all, I think \\"The Ego Has Landed\\" is a better all around CD. But \\"Sing When You're Winning\\" is a VERY worthy follow-up and will not disappoint. I only wish more people in the US would discover him - he's a rare talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing along with Robbie!!","review":"While America is being pummeled by corny, anemic pop music, Robbie Williams offers a fresh, meaty alternative. Robbie combines his cheeky attitude, wit, and heart-on-his sleeve lyrics on this album again (yes, he does write his own stuff with Guy Chambers!). You know that he is grinning while he's belting out these tunes, and you will be too when you start singing along. He has the makings of true pop legend-but will America take notice? I hope so. And when he comes back to America on tour-Do go see him...puts on one heck of a show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars no doubt","review":"In old days I was a rock fan and didn't like any music that sounded like pop. Nowadays I am not so extreme anymore. This album is really good. Though a little bit worse that \\"I've been expectin you\\", but still five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing When You're Winning","review":"Sing When Your Winning is a very, very, good album, with very, very, good songs, even if some of the music videos aren't (*cough* Rock DJ). Some of the music has some really inspiring meanings, like Let Love Be You're Energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another quality Robbie CD","review":"Robbie is just unstoppable. His latest offering is great, I have to admit that I am not entirely sure this is his best CD yet but it's certainly as good. There's some amazing tracks on here, I don't think any real Robbie fans will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robbie does it again!!!!!!!!","review":"I highly recommend this amazing album, Its definantly one of robbie's best albums yet. You can just here the maturity of this album through his lyrics and his voice. Robbie is incredible at evolving with his music and always keeping his fans wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's winning, but not by a landslide....","review":"First of all, this CD is really a good buy. \\"Sing When Your Winning\\" does stray away from Robbie's others albums \\"I've Been Expecting You\\" and \\"Life Thru A Lens.\\" If your lookin' for an album with some funky upbeat pop songs then you'll find it here with \\"Rock DJ\\", \\"Kids\\", and \\"Forever Texas\\". On the mellow side you can listen to a country-ish little tune called \\"The Road to Mandalay\\", a sweet love song (\\"If Its Hurting You\\") and another GREAT song called \\"Better Man.\\" This CD is top of the line, but if you are a new Robbie Fan i suggest getting his older albums too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks to Barry White and others","review":"Good music, that's true ! But thanks to 70's great stars : look at Rock DJ, and listen to \\"It's ecstasy when you lay down next to me\\" by Barry White ... Eternal love and respect Mister White !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Fun!!","review":"\\"Singing When Your Winning\\" has to be one of my top 10 favorite CD's. From the cover and lyric booklet, to the actual songs, it screams \\"Unique!\\". The songs are, as the title suggests, positive and fun to dance to. Robbie's singing voice has a tint of an English accent which adds so much to his music. The acoustics are amazing, and this is definitely a CD that the phrase \\"I like to sit in my room and listen to music\\" applies to. The songs have strong messages and really seem to show Robbie's personality. Like the songs, the lyric booklet seems to have a touch of Robbie's personality and flair. Each picture features him playing different roles such as a football (soccer) player, referee, coach, as well as the fans watching the game. This makes the CD all the more appealing and interesting. All in all every aspect of the CD is good. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes a bit of \\"good old English pop!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Boldly going where American acts are too afraid to go..","review":".. this album achieves the fun and pop mentality that American artists are too sales-conscious to even attempt.Robbie Williams is the quintessential British pop superstar, and his music reflects the fact that he absolutely loves making it.Rock DJ is a great bouncer of a club track. Kids is by far the best song on the album - who knew Kylie Minogue sounded so good?I won't get into a track by track review, but the album is well worth buying (especially since the price is great!) Robbie doesn't have the voice of the greatest male singers, but it's a strong voice, fun, and he doesn't care if you like it or not - and his music is all the better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Genius","review":"Robbie Williams is a true rock star: sex appeal and personality to burn on top of clever, on-target lyrics, and a great voice that can be mean, kind, soft, and hard.My favorite tracks: Kids -- a superb commmentary on the pop music industry. Pure genius to have Kylie Minogue (the opposite of clever) do the duet. Did she get the joke? Love calling earth -- heartbreaking. Just when you think RW is all snide remarks and sarcasm. Rock DJ is awesome for dancing -- and also for singing in the car!It never ceases to amaze me that RW is not bigger in the US. Perhaps he's too clever?"},{"rating":"2","title":"ROBBIES WINNING WHEN HE IS SINGING ON THIS CD","review":"A couple of years ago I reviewed \\"Ego Has Landed\\" and I said it was the album of the year.Now Robbie is out with his latest \\"Sing When Your Winning\\" and it is again another pop masterpiece.Robbie has the Beatle-esque, Pet Shop Boys, etc. sound down with a unique male pop voice.From \\"Kids\\" to \\"Rock DJ\\" to \\"Supreme\\" all the songs on this CD standout as possible pop singles.What amazes me that the US has not embraced this wacky wonderful eclectic man who brings some NEW needed energy into the pop world.Robbie writes and produces his music, and takes full control of his albums. If more artists followed maybe I would be at the record store a little more often spending my paycheck before I even get it.Hats off to you Robbie!....again you make your fans proud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Don't Wanna Stop!","review":"I was in studying in Oxford this past July and heard the first single from Sing When You're Winning, Rock DJ. It was one of those songs that you hear just once, then proceed to sing to everyone you know, praying that they know the name of it, who its by and where you can find It. Fortunalty one of my friends had the same obsession and searched high and low for the CD. The single came out the last day were were in England and we bought it. I now have the full CD and love it. The music is dancey and cheeky just like the controversy that is Robbie Williams. And try to check out the video for Rock DJ .. it was banned from the BBC during the day, because of its graphic content. . . .he pulls his skin off . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!
