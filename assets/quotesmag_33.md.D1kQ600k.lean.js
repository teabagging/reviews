I felt the pairing ruined any enjoyment to be gleaned from Shaver's contribution.The Friedman fan, however, may really, really like this record - and may even say Shaver drags it down - the two styles really do not complement one another. Should you like both, you're probably in luck.The Shaver fan awaiting another UNSHAVEN should keep waiting and pass this one by.

My 2 year-olds snapped the bottom metal grid part off of the piece where the wheels are, and my daughter actually got her sock snagged on the metal, so good-bye sock (luckily her foot was ok)!

His neighbor (Greg Kinnear) a gay painter, has an emergency and insists that Melvin take care of his cherished dog. He knows Melvin is a stickler for detail and trusts Melvin. Melvin also has to deal with Carol, who also must take off from work because her son is ill. This is too much change for Melvin, his world is turned upside down.

The dog was the best thing in the movie. I also liked the one line of the movie (as said in the title) 'What if this as good as it gets?'it was a shock of realism there and i liked that. Also, I loved the gay guy. He was...eh.....kinda funny..... I had to sit through everything else.

The pathetic gay character (Greg Kinnear, stealing Rupert Everett's Oscar nomination) who is beaten and seems to have no friends or lovers? The mugging of Cuba Gooding Jr.? The endless, winding plot that goes nowhere and never builds? Hunt, trying desperately to turn a single mother cliche into something real, despite her leaden commentaries about the HMO system? The ENDLESS cuts to the cute dog? The film's nasty, venomous \\"humor\\" coming from Nicholson, which is then tried to be covered up in \\"Oh gee, isn't this awful\\" backtracking? A completely vile film that inexplicably became a huge hit; everything in it is false, right down to Art Garfunkel's version of Monty Python's \\"Always Look On the Bright Side of Life\\" that cuts out the profanity (and the bite). Avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not a comedy","review":"This movie always shows up under the category of comedy. I have no idea why.

I went in with comedy expectations (b/c that's what we were lead to believe) and got a drama. Frankly, I was bored.

At first I didn't agree with Leonardo DiCaprio boycotting the awards ceremony, but after seeing this film, I did! The scene where Greg Kinnear gets beaten is disturbing and totally unnecessary - it almost had a gratuitous feel to it. Helen Hunt is truly uncharming. Jack playing Jack was probably the best thing in the film - and I'm stretching a bit here. Best film, best actor, best actress! Totally preposterous."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie even Nicholson could not save ...","review":"This is a slow moving and boring movie.

Oscars for Nicholson and Hunt for this film...? Shocking! Robert Duvall (remarkable in \\"The Apostle\\") and Helena Bonham Carter (magnificent in \\"The Wings of the Dove\\") were robbed at the 1998 Oscar ceremonies. Nicholson played Nicholson. And Hunt...don't get me started on that one...! \\"Someone please comb that woman's hair!\\", I wanted to scream at the screen (in between glancing at my watch and longing for a cigarette, which I had long before quit). The writing sucked. Hey, James L. Brooks, what was that little roadtrip to Baltimore about? Did it not strain credulity that the gay guy (OK, Greg Kinnear is cute) would hop in the car and drive to Baltimore instead of picking up the phone and calling mom and dad? Answer: Yes. It was not a very clever way of trapping our three leads in a car so they can bond and be adorable. I loathed this movie and will lobby Congress to pass a law banning James L. Brooks from ever making another cutesie-wutesie movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honesty is Good","review":"In this society, where political correctness reigns, anyone who is honest is considered to be rude. They even have a phrase called brutally honest. The movie As Good As It Gets pushes back on this notion. The main character is honest at all times. If you are honest with yourself you will like this character because he says the things that you think, but are too afraid to say. As Good As It Gets shows us that even those people we deem monsters have hearts. Those people are often more sensitive than the rest of us. The best part of As Good As It Gets is that you will laugh from opening reel to closing credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"They rarely make 'em like this","review":"This movie has got just about everything. Borderline classic. Jack is an obsessive compulsive guy who tries to overcome so many of his \\"hang-up\\" for the sake of a relationship with Helen Hunt.

Not only does it make you laugh, but think and feel about your own foibles, and your own views on various topics. Its very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie -- WEAK ending!","review":"The characterizations are great in this flick all the way through till about the last 45 minutes. Helen Hunt's character ending up with Jack Nicholson is repulsive, not only because of the superficail age difference, but because of his personality and how he treats her. There is a veild attempt at the end with a shot that shows him walking over cracks in the road that is supposed to show us all that \\"AWW!!

Are we so desperate to see A list actors that we'll watch them in a C quality movies? Enough already. The end of the movie gives the viewer a crawly feeling...

The biggest surprise is Greg Kinnear, who has proven himself as a great actor in this film.The movie has you cheering for Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson to get together, even with Jack's phobia behavior. Also, the connection with Jack and the sweet adorable dog, that seems to help get Jack over his phobias, is a gem. The movie one minute is a tear jerker and the next it warms your heart, truly, as good as it gets. GRADE: A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming movie","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. I've never cared for Jack Nicholson until I saw him in this film. He's perfect as Melvin Udall, as are Helen Hunt, Shirley Knight and Greg Kinear. A fun experience with lots of character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real surpise","review":"Jack Nicholsen playing a malcontent, yet successful writer. He seems to write romances, beacause a woman working at his publishing company asks him how write women so well. His reply: I take away reason and go on from there.Helen Hunt did a tremendous job and is well cast alongside Jack Nicholsen. The script is extremely well written and engrossing, and could forget that adorable Brussels Griffen? It really deserved it's oscars and nominations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicholson confuses me","review":"Jack Nicholson continues to confound me: His Oscar-performance in \\"As Good As it Gets\\" is incredible. Yet when you listen to the director/cast commentary for two hours, Jack has absolutely nothing coherent to say. You'd think the guy was a moron. Still, the commentary is enjoyable, and this film is a real gem.P.S. How can people say the romance between Nicholson and the younger Helen Hunt is not realistic, when in real life Jack is dating the nubile Lara Flynn Boyle?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Nicholson is the s***.","review":"\\"As Good As It Gets\\" is one of the most purely entertaining movies ever made. It is funny, sad, romantic, and it captures your heart with its witty dialogue and stellar performances, especially by it's Oscar-winning leads. Melvin Udall is a man that would make any waitress quit her job."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dog deserved an OSCAR too !","review":"The dog goes a long way to making this movie as entertaining as it is besides the fine performances by Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and the neighbour. The movie has many messages in it and particularly shows how a cranky old man can be tamed. I held off seeing this movie up until last month as I don't like Helen Hunt's acting style but after seeing this I thought she did a fine job. 'As Good As It gets' is a very refreshing movie although drags a little in the middle. That is my only reservation about it. Does anybody know if the dog is a Shih-Tzu? A friend wants to get one just like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars And More - Nicholson, Hunt And Kinnear","review":"This is an extraordinary romantic comedy that can be seen again and again with pure delight. It is difficult to imagine how anyone could give this movie a rating less than 5 stars. Nicholson stars in one of his best 5 roles of all time. In spite of this fact, Nicholson is almost overshadowed by great performances by Hunt and Kinnear, especially Hunt.The movie gives the viewer so much. It is wonderful and amazing. Seeing Nicholson's Melvin soften and melt with the dog and his gay neighbor is just terrific. The film showcases Hunt's acting ability and her stunning beauty. Persons who suffer with OCD will be greatly moved as Melvin struggles with that illness and makes considerable progress to a recovery.The movie is warm, witty, romantic, funny and very engaging. Do not miss this treat and see it more than once. It gets even better the 2nd and 3rd time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack does it","review":"Let there be no doubt that Jack Nicholson made this movie as good as it is! I don't think there's another actor out there who could have pulled this performance off!Combine Jack with a great cast, and side spltting story, and you have this outstanding comedy!Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Helen Hunt got best actress for this is beyond me","review":"Jack Nicholson delivered an amazing performance, as always, but this film was absolutely ruined by Helen Hunt. Doesn't anybody find her incredibly irritating? I can't put my finger on it. Maybe its her voice, or demeanor. I don't know. But I can't stand her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"This is supposed to be a tear jerker but the politically incorrect lines are the real highlights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it at all","review":"I must admit I hated this film. I sensed absolutely no chemistry between Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson whatsoever. Nicholson played himself yet again. His racist/homophobic/anti-semetic comments weren't supposed to be funny ... or were they? Hearing the audience laugh at Nicholson's bigotry sent chills down my spine. The only saving grace of this film was the acting of Greg Kinnear. Ironically he was the only actor to not receive an award for his work in this film, but the only one who deserved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen!","review":"I Thought this movie was horrible. The age difference between the two actors (Hunt and Nicholson) was too huge a gap to make an enjoyable movie. Jack's character was horribly mean and in reality, Helen's character would have never looked at him again after he said such awful things about her son. If it were possible, I would have given it 0 stars. I wouldn't recommend this movie to even my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, I don't know how did it get an oscar!!!","review":"I was shocked when I saw the film, it was really boring. Helen Hunt was o.k., but the others are not. The story is soooo silly, disgusting and I really wasted my time on watching it. It didn't worth any oscar at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Condition!!","review":"I knew that this product was new, yet I was still amazed at its condition. I'm very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack does it again","review":"Jack Nicholson, one of the great actors, teams with Helen Hunt in a wonderful comedy/drama. Long a favorite movie, I finally purchased the DVD. The little dog steals the show, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"it can never get better","review":"Well, i love this movie, i spent twice the money the dvd costs in rentals to see it over and over before i finaly decided to get my own copy. I dont think there is better value you can get for your bucks.The plo of movie is well known and the performace of the trio nicholson, hunt, kinnear is just fabulous. The DVD is quite old so it doesnt feature much extras, there is the commentary and thats what you get. I really recommend this movie to anyone looking for good commedy when you may laugh and cry at the same moment. Best viewed with a loved person, especialy when you are same type as mr. udall :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"The story is full of extra, smaller stories that made the movie a rich watch. Watch it a second time and see new things. The characters are full and the comedy is sometimes sad. I love laughter through tears.Watch this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. Jack Nicholson was a natural as usual and I also enjoyed Helen Hunt's peformance. The story was about a grumpy romance writer becoming happy and falling in love. The writer(Jack Nicholson) also has psycholigical problems that he must overcome. The script is fun and the movie is incredibly funny. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As It Gets","review":"This is a classic comedy. I have only seen several movies worth owning. This is definitely one. Jack Nicholson is an amazing mixture of brilliance, an impossible personality, vulnerable, honest, and certifiably insane.Nicholson is supported with actors that don't fade to the background and who challenge him. They actually slip a robust story in on you while you laugh.This is seriously one of the best movies you could buy. Great for trips, family nights, I watched it the other day just for a laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO","review":"There's not much wrong with this film, but it has changed the way I watch films forever. Previously I had laughed at the misrepresentation of other peoples misery in films, its portrayal as not really being as bad as the sufferer says it is. I'm sure most of us have at some time or another laughed at the misfortunate medical circumstances of others as represented on film. But after seeing this film I now feel ashamed and angry at the effect that films can have on the way society thinks of and treats people.Jack Nicholson, if you're going to play a character suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and phobias HAVE THE DECENCY TO RESEARCH THE CONDITION AND PUT SOME EFFORT INTO CONVEYING THE MISERY IT BRINGS, rather than just playing it half-heartedly for laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is the state of witty dialogue, we're in trouble.","review":"There are a few (very few) amusing moments, but the overall spirit of the film is entirely flat. This represents the low point of Brooks long descent into mid-cult mediocrity. It isn't the kind of mediocrity that one can vege out in front of, though, rather its attempts to hit the target in the lowest-common denominator funny bone get increasingly grating and insulting, to the point that by the end of the movie I wanted to see the entire cast drawn & quartered, and the writer and director in stockades. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Just Two People Who Like Warm Rolls\\" ~ A Love Story For The Obsessive-Compulsive","review":"The '97 release 'As Good As It Gets' is an immensely entertaining and touching comedy romance with the rare ability to make you cry and laugh simultaneously. The storyline will hold your attention from beginning to end, the dialoque is crisp and original with a mulitude of memorable lines and Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear all deliver superb performances. Simply a marvelous film you will enjoy more and more with each repeat viewing!An essential purchase for your permanent DVD library."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie could put anyone in a great mood!!","review":"I think this may have been one of Jack Nicholson's best roles yet. He did a wonderful job as being a pessimistic, prejudice crazyman that turns into a warm-hearted human being with the help of his co-stars, Helen Hunt and Verdell."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest movies","review":"I was forced to watch this movie. I did NOT want to see it at all! So.. I sat through the movie and actually started to enjoy it. The movie was great! Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, and Cuba Gooding Jr. do a great job of acting in this hilarious movie. It is now a movie I own and can recite line by line. I strongly recommend this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As soggy as possible","review":"As doggone doggedly doggy as could be. There is some kind of unbridgeable cultural social divide between America and the rest of us when it comes to this type of material. What apparently seems so delightful and Oscar-worthy over there just strikes the Old World as incredibly yukky and fake. The extra star is for Helen Hunt, who did the best that could be done with the cringe-making script. Like someone said, Jack could have sleep-walked through this role; and I think he did. That cute little tyke looked female to me, but they kept calling it boy. Embarrassing."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUIET DECENCY","review":"I am going to get sick using this word, but here it goes. This story is indeed about what happens when a decent woman confronts the meaning of a truly altrusitic act by a quietly decent man, and decency that unfolds when she pursues."},{"rating":"1","title":"very run of the mill","review":"who hasn't already seen this film done oh say about 75-80 different times already?Helen Hunt is a so/so actress.nothing really special about her character.as for Jack Nicholson is he ever gonna change his style? to me he is just like the Rolling Stones.some good songs here&there but after a while everything starts all sounding the same.well that's the case with Nicholson all of his movies he plays an Arrogant Man.this is one of the many reasons why i don't watch award shows they like to much sameness.there's nothing special about this film at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Good As It Gets","review":"We had this movie on an old casset, wanted a newer version. Loved it. The quality of DVD is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, warming and a window to another slice of life !","review":"This film is a little bit of an emotional roller coaster.Nicholson gives his finer range of skills over to the character of Melvin, a wealthy, withdrawn, cinical, neo-hermit.His senses are awoken by the plight of a waitress at his favourite diner. We accompany Melvin as his better nature comes to life and he encounters some more modern day dilemna's. A vicious attack by homophobes on his neighbour (which is vividly and shockingly portrayed)cracks open the true nature of Melvins heart.We never really are allowed to understand Melvins true motivations,,,guess that's as good as it gets!The movie is an uplifting experience, beautifully shot, dramatic but above all very watchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"The movie itself is just like its title: \\"As Good As It Gets.\\" The casting of Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt is superb. Greg Kinnear also plays an impressive role as a down-and-out, but very talented artist. And...if you're an animal lover, you'll fall in love with the little dog that invades Nicholson's OCD routine and eventually captures his heart.A movie that makes you laugh and cry at the same time - you'll definitely watch it again and again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I love Watsonville Patio's first 3 CDs (Watsonville Patio, Hotel Roselynn, population 02), so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, I found this CD to be boring. All the songs sound alike to me and there are no standouts, no catchy tunes. I listened to it a bunch of times to give it a chance, but my opinion did not change. Very disappointed with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for fish","review":"I use these squat bowls for many different uses, other than a home for fish.

I returned them for a .5 size smaller and I stepped out of those as well. On the third attempt I went down a size smaller and they were also too large."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marine Fuel Pump","review":"Great product, with quick shipping. Took about five minutes to install and works flawlessly. Would recommend to anyone with an older outboard. I replaced the factory fuel pump with this one because the old one had a stripped out center bolt hole. This this works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOAT FUEL PUMP REPLACMENT","review":"The fuel pump in this picture is not the actual part. The part for this part number looks very different than this one and the output line is only 3/16. I had to send it back and reorder the correct one which does actually look like the picture but has a different part number."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This is a very disapponting book. It has to unifying theme, unless Semiotics is given that role. In fact, it is not a book, and doesn't read like a book. It is a disparate collection of variable level of interest, going from no interest at all, to moderately interesting. It is, to a large extent, nothing but a waste of time. My interest in semiotics as a field of intellectual endeavour wasn't sufficient to carry me through the entire thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vote for More Star Wars Toys Like This","review":"My son is obsessed with Star Wars (not unlike his father), and the action figures are his greatest delight when it comes to \\"playing\\" Star Wars. The ships in which the action figures fit, however, are often too large, too unwieldy, and too expensive. These Titanium Series die-cast versions allow him to enjoy playing Star Wars in a different way. You don't want to drive over them with you car, but these ships aren't cheap plastic. They'll handle the vigorous sort of play he enjoys. I wish the Titanium Series would offer more ships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words words and more words but little substance","review":"I bought this book based on all the reviews posted on Amazon.com. I must say I was extremely disappointed. The book does not describe even a single machine learning algorithm adequately - no pseudocode, no mathematical description, and at the end of the day, no real understanding. If you are an analytically challenged manager who wants to pick up a bunch of buzzwords to throw around to impress your equally analytically challeged colleagues or customers who don't have a clue, this might be the book for you - a n overpriced, highly overrated \\"data mining for dummies\\". If you want to learn something about machine learning, well.. stick to books like Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell or Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong named","review":"If \\"practical\\" means having a sample project with the theory, the name of this book is incorrectly named. With a big bunch of text or description, it is not \\"practical\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I am very happy with amazon purchases as they always come quick, as described. I love the free supersavings shipping program. Prices are charged in the middle (not the chepest, not the highest) but I know I can always rely on Amazon! Every time I have something to buy online, I go to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"This book reminds me of the programming books by Deitel&Deitel.; It's wordy and superficial, making lots of people feel like they understand the subject. Unfortunately, it takes *much* more than what's in this book to really understand Data Mining. Compare this book to the book by Hastie, Friedman and Tibshiranie, which really goes into the statistics involved in Data Mining.There is no magic: real Data Mining needs lots of Statistics. You can learn to use Weka, but in order to do real work you'll need to understand what goes behind its nice user interface, and I think this book is not enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful addition to your shelf","review":"This title is a most useful addition to your data mining collection, especially if you plan to do some practical experimentation with the Open Source WEKA software it describes. You do not need a degree in maths or statistics to work with this text, conversely don't expect detailed line-by-line explanations of each algorithm either. If you want that open up the Java code in the WEKA software. I note in the other reviews comments about the practical nature of the book: the authors are at Waikato University in the heart of New Zealand's dairy country, and it is this practical agricultural application that has driven the research behind the text and the software, as opposed to books written by authors working in the cloistered mathematics departments of the major universities. Recommended for serious students new or not new to the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I'm about 1/2 way through the book and do intend to finish it. However, I must say, this is very tough reading. I think the author tries not to use a lot of math and algorithmic speak but ends up using descriptions that aren't very clear or easy to follow.Plus, this book really does require a background in this topic. Perhaps a few books as pre-requisites would make this material easier to understand.The author separates the more math intensive stuff in paragraphs marked as optional but to be honest, these are the sections that I found easier to understand.Anyway, I really wanted to like this book. But unfortunately, I did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A data mining Book for Open source tools","review":"Data Mining Sec Edition is a good book with a good support for related open source Weka system.

In conclusion, we're not using this product anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a so-so text","review":"This book was given to me; it is a decent reference text/atlas with some good color illustrations; however, I believe that another text -- Recognizable patterns of human malformation: genetic, embryologic, and clinical aspects by David W. Smith -- is far superior. I very much recommend the Smith text over the Spitz text. Although Recognizable patterns of human malformation does not have color illustrations, it is much more comprehensive, easier to read (in my opinion), and cheaper ($65)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, Farylrobin","review":"The design of these shoes is so pretty, especially the thin ankle strap and toe cleavage in the front.

It may be read as a satire of the hippy generation, but I just find it incredible clever and ballsy. The protagonist's voice (who vaguely reminds me of Chong --from Cheech & Chong) is rendered perfectly. And it has an off-the-cuff, irreverent quality from start to finish that's exceedingly rare. It's a unconventional novel, unlike any you're likely to read. The only other book that comes to mind is Richard Perez's The Loser's Club, which is also set in the East Village, but even there the narrative is more straightforward being about a writer addicted to the personal ads. The Fan Man is the kind of a book which might be called a \\"cult classic\\" because no one who reads it will ever forget it. I strongly urge that you buy it!

The adventurers do fish, but the joy and beauty of fly fishing the Yellowstone is not captured. The cinematography leaves a lot to be desired. The beauty of the river is not displayed. You never come to know the cast of characters or the river. This video is not much more than a sequence of days of some people floating some river. You do not know the people or the river. I found this DVD a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"A fun calendar with great patterns. of course, you are not supposed to KNIT one every day (that would be ridiculous!) . Several patterns are reminicent of last year's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmm... not so much.","review":"A pattern-a-day knitting calendar is a nice idea, but the reality is that most of the patterns will be either thrown in a file somewhere or simply dropped in the trash; very few knitters are able to keep up with this much work, and even fewer would have any desire to. The main problem with this calendar is that many of the patterns are relatively unattractive (witness the goofy hat they decided to use for the box cover; it might be better with different yarn colors, but still....) Don't buy this for your mother or grandmother unless you want to be the proud winner of a bunch of goofy knitted garments that they'll be sure you'll like (\\"But my desk calendar said it was 'groovy'!\\")Get a joke-a-day, word-a-day, sudoku-a-day or cartoon-a-day calendar instead, you'll be glad you did, for so many reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip","review":"I usually like calenders that give me something to think about or to do.

His beautiful voice is certainly as eloquent as ever on this album. I guess I was expecting more variety in terms of some being traditional slow Christmas songs and others being fun, upbeat songs. In retrospect, I obviously didn't think about that too much before ordering. If you want slow, provoking songs and love Crawford, you will probably like this album. If you want sing a longs, look elsewhere (course that should be obvious!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD!","review":"Last year, on Christmas Eve, I heard \\"O Holy Night\\", sung by Michael Crawford, on the car radio, I looked in few storesfor a CD, but couldn't find it. Recently, I spotted it on Amazon.com and ordered it. The whole CD is wonderful, not just thatone song. If you purchase it, you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Angel of Music Sings Again!","review":"Whether he is enchanting you from behind a dressing room mirror, or from your cd player, Michael Crawford is undoubtedly the most \\"angelic\\" voice of the decade. Who better than the angel of music to deliver for the holidays a beautiful collection of Christmas hymns that we all know and love?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have component of any Christmas music collection.","review":"Michael Crawford's voice is absolutely amazing and is melded perfectly with the Christmas classics on this album. You will never hear a better or more powerful rendition of \\"O Holy Night\\". It is absolutely magnificent. The album is a must-have if only to have the \\"O Holy Night\\" track. The other tracks are equally impressive highlighted by a wonderfully done medley of several Christmas classics. The album is a necessity for any Christmas music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"Although the entire CD is wonderful, it would be worth every penny for Michael's rendition of \\"O Holy Night\\" alone. I first heard it back in 1993 when it appeared on David Foster's Christmas Album, and I was so thrilled to see it included here. Never will you hear a more beautiful, powerful and moving rendition of that song. It gives me goosebumps every time I hear it, without fail. The other songs are wonderful, as well, and it's a pleasant change to hear songs that really explore the true meaning of Christmas. And when sung by Michael...all the better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christmas album I've heard","review":"Michael's done it again! Every song is a winner. A Christmas album that will make you feel great.

Will be playing it many times Thru NOV! and DEC! to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a VOICE...","review":"I gave this CD as gifts to two people who have repeatedly told me how much they have enjoyed Michael Crawford's voice and his entire CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what a shocker!","review":"Boy how could an album that possess what I feel is the world's best version ever recorded of \\"O Holy Night\\" not do anything for me after that? It sounds as if Michael held back on all the other songs. Maybe my hopes were too high, my suggestion, down load the single and save the money to purchase the Phantom of the Opera, a 10++."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect Christmas album!","review":"This wonderful album mixes traditional carols with more modern material all in keeping with the spirit of the true meaning of Christmas and all treated with Michael Crawford's tender loving care. From the majestic \\"O Holy Night\\" to the simple \\"Scarlet Ribbons\\" Michael Crawford shares a very personal interpretation of each song. This is an album to be savored over and over. I have to mention the less familiar songs - \\"Mary Did You Know?\\" and \\"A Strange Way to Save the World\\" - both hauntingly beautiful. The combination of \\"Angels We Have Heard on High\\" with \\"Joy to the World\\" makes those familiar carols sound brand new. Needless to say, I plan for this album to be a part of my Christmas season for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most touching Christmas album I've heard","review":"I bought this album based on customer reviews and after listening to the samples. The actual album surpassed my expectations. This is not a collection of Christmas carols but a beautiful musical presentation of the Christmas story. Michael's presentation of 'Mary, Did You Know' is the best I've heard. I've already decided to buy extra copies for Christmas gifts. This is the perfect album to listen to when the family is gathered around the Christmas tree to remind us all of what Christmas is really about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely astonishing","review":"Picture a singer, with not only a light, tenor's voice, but with the breath control and musical genious better than that of any other singer, and you have Michael Crawrford. He is an abosutely increadible singer, and not only sings the songs with a tremendous voice, but presents them to us. We feel the emotions and the religious connections through these very traditional songs. The Medley (#5) is one of my particular favorites. This CD is definately not one to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Album by Michael Crawford (Atlantic 83222-2))","review":"During 12/93, there aired a Christmas TV special called \\"David Foster's Christmas Album\\" which I videotaped and kept in my video archives [album: The Christmas Album by David Foster; Interscope 92295]. One piece, Michael Crawford's \`O Holy Night' was absolutely incredible. Around Christmas time, I pull out the videotape and listen (and I do mean listen) to Crawford sing this one song over and over, ad infinitum. I never get sick of it. Each time seems better than the last. Watching Crawford sing this song is an experience in itself - his ribcage inflating like bagpipes in order to prepare for that last \`noel' shows his talent. This exact song/rendition is on this album. The entire album uses childrens' choirs. Which album you choose really depends on whether you want only Michael Crawford + choirs, or want many singers like Celine Dion and Tom Jones. Both albums get an A+."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype, no substance","review":"I bought this CD without having ever actually heard any of the songs, simply because I'd heard so much hype about it. What a mistake. I might have enjoyed the songs if Crawford wasn't the singer, but I found his voice to be wimpy, weak, and totally irritating. There is no real substance or passion in his voice; he sounds fake and phony, like he's acting in one of his theater plays. And in my opinion, that's what he should stick to doing. I'll be taking this one to the used CD store, and I'll never again waste my money on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Phantom Does Christmas","review":"This is NOT a Christmas album, per se, so much as a Phantom of the Opera/ Michael Crawford album. While I like the Phantom album and another Crawford album I own, this one is so full of Crawford's thoroughly affected whispered words and \\"soaring\\" vocals that it completely overwhelms the songs he is performing. On \\"Candlelight Carol\\", for example, the best part is when Crawford stops and lets the choir sing. Only then can I fully pay attention to and enjoy the tune. \\"O Holy Night\\" sounds like it was arranged by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Frank Wildhorn together: what ought to be a beautiful, pristine melody sounds like a Broadway finale with layers of instruments, synthesizers, chorus, and full-blast Michael Crawford. It's just too overblown. Crawford should have kept the Phantom locked in the dungeon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gagging on Scarlet Ribbons","review":"A friend loaned me this CD because she knew I'd liked Phantom of the Opera when I was 16. In absolute honesty, this has to be the worst Xmas album I've ever heard. Every track is utterly saccharine to the point of being unlistenable. I had to hit the \\"skip\\" button on my remote around the 20-30 second mark on each. Don't take my word for it...listen to the previews and see if you're not slapping yourself on the forehead.Crawford's horrid \\"Scarlet Ribbons\\" has to have garnered the attention of the guy who hosts NPR's Annoying Music segment by now. I agree with other reviewers who say this song will bring you to tears...but only from laughter or sheer misery, depending on your bent. If this phantom were caterwauling in my basement, I'd call in the exterminator.If you're planning to listen to this album on your MP3 player, feel free--but for the love of pizza, don't subject anyone within speaker range to this torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER","review":"THIS IS A SIMPLY WRITTEN, NICELY ILLUSTRATED BOOK WITH AN OBVIOUS ANTI-SOUTHERN AGENDA; PERFECT FOR THOSE LIVING NORTH OF THE MASON-DIXON LINE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy\`","review":"This toy is okay its kind of noisy as far as the sound it makes to spin the CD.

Don't make the same mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"My daughter got this \\"CD player\\" for her birthday. It plays some cheesy renditions of nursery rhyme songs, but the only thing my daughter wants it to do is make the power drill sound that it makes when you push the big button on the front. Very annoying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and fun toy!","review":"My baby was scared of this the first time the CD spun around but once she figured out that music came after it, she loved it. She likes watching the blinking lights too. The songs aren't too annoying (although there's a weird version of Baa Baa Black Sheep that drives me crazy) and there is adjustable volume. I'd say it's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"We bought our youngest daughter this for Christmas, when she was 5 months old. She is now almost 1 and she LOVES this toy! It's very easy to operate; I think she figured it out at a very early age. My 4 year old daughter likes to play with it too. We also have a 15 month old nephew and this is one of his favorite toys when he comes to visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"kid loved it until it broke!","review":"my 1 year old daughter loved this toy, she would press the botton to make the disc spin and then dance to the music. The music is okay, not annoying like most noisy toys. But after a month or two of rough play it no longer spins. It will still play the music and if you move the wheel by hand I can select the different songs, but my daughter doesn't play with it anymore she has totally lost interest in it since it broke. I guess she liked to watch it spin and light up. I haven't called Fisher Price to complain about it yet, but I should--they have been good about making amends for other products that have been faulty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for little hands","review":"My daughter loves to push the middle button and make the animal selection fly around like crazy.

It is however emotionally charged by the narrator who he seems to be a fan of many historical figures. But strip that away, and you have an uncorrupted (by liberalism, Marxism, or religious establishments) narrative of how Christianity and the bible was formed after Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Geneva Bible was not talked about.","review":"The Geneva Bible should have been given time in this movie. Sadly, it was only mentioned one time. It was the most revered Bible until they stopped printing it in 1644, due to the KJV. The people of the time coming to the new world wanted nothing to do with the KJV as it was Anglican;they were still being persecuted by them,why would they want their Bible. The notes provided by the founders of the protestant faith, contained in the Geneva Bible, were of great value to the people and King James didn't like the fact that the notes condemned the so called, \\"right of kings\\" doctrine he held in high regard. There were also other reasons I won't get into in this review. Shame on you for not including one of the most influential Bibles in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is REALLY -- NOT AVAILABLE","review":"Just so you know, I recieved an email from Chris Klaus after contacting his secretary hoping to get this book faster.This was his response:Thanks for your interest in the book.

Everything that had a radio in it interfered with this mic system.I didn't expect it to be a good product, but I did expect it to at least get something.The microphone system was supposed to have two different models, RED and GREEN; Indicating two separate channels, I bought two, thinking that I could flip the channel manually, but, no it is a static channel based on the color dot.IF YOU BUY TWO MAKE SURE YOU INDICATE YOU WANT A RED AND A GREEN.Still I don't recommend this if you plan to use it, for anything where you need to hear your voice, unless you are outside and miles away from anything that may generate radio noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even try to think about it","review":"Be careful!

It is not overly resistant at all. The only negative things I've experienced so far is that the band leaves a white powder on anything it touches and smells like latex (not overwhelmingly at all however!)

I'm an avid user of Cathe Friedrich videos, and it was definitely worth trying the brand she uses, so I am assured I'm working with the same resistance level and Cathe and the crew.

I know that I sound lazy when I say that I don't like subtitles, but I wish that there was an English overdub option for the documentary part. It would make life a little easier. Even though I'm not happy about the subtitles, that's not my main complaint. The sound quality during the live performances is horrible. The one performance is in mono and sounds like there was a single mic, placed in the crowd , used to record it. The other performance actually utilizes surround sound but all of the low end is gone. My subwoofer was pretty much useless for both live performances. I feel bad saying such horrible things about a Nightwish DVD, but it's depressing to see such fine music be butchered like this.

Tunes like the swingin' jazz track Street of Dreams, the sultry I Only Have Eyes for You, and the haunting Look What You've Done to Me are carried out with fine finesse and superb artistry. Even her rendition of Igy fits in with her usual pop stylings from her earlier releases.She sings each track with her own brand of soft and soulful sensuality yet would never be confused with melo dramatic or pretentious bravura of, say Whitney Houston.Because Austin does not buy into the diva persona this actually makes her very likeable and accessible with producers, artists and her public (fans).At one point Street of Dreams was only available as a Japanese import at a price that was quite questionable.

I bought the grey and it looked nice but it was just surprisingly thin. It almost felt like if I pulled hard enough it would separate and create a hole of some sort. Luckily, I found my fleece scarf so I no longer need this one. The thing is, it has got to be cold outside for me to think about wearing a scarf in the first place. If it is cold enough that I will put up with the inherent hassle of wearing a scarf, then this scarf just doesn't have the warm factor that would make me think, \\"hey let me choose the grey scarf today now that it is cold.\\" I gave it two stars because if I lose my fleece scarf again, I can wear this scarf and block out some chill. Also, it is soft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lightweight stroller","review":"I was sick of my bulky travel system stroller and had tried a couple of other strollers before keeping this one. My daughter was much more comfortable (thus cooperative) in this one! Easy to fold up. Pouch and cup holder are great. Color is good for stains and easy to spot clean. Folded up small enough to keep in my trunk all of the time. And I am tall, and my husband and I often had aching backs after pushing other strollers. Not this one. Only issues I have with it...my daughter always would push down on the foot strap and stop the wheels once she got taller. Now that we have had this for a few years, the cup holder pops off in my trunk all of the time, and then it's not there when I need it. You also have to remove the sun shade in order to fold it. So I just always kept it in my trunk and put it on if I knew we would be outside for a while. We are very happy with this stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for an umbrella with features","review":"I needed an umbrella stroller that was durable, lightweight and very compact, but i also needed a few features such as a canopy/sunshade and a bag or basket to hold a few things. I got what I was looking for in this stroller. It also comes with a few features that i wasn't looking for, but are nice to have: it has a cupholder and it reclines. it was easy and quick to assemble out of the box and shipped really fast. the only warning i would give is that the back rest may be a little short for some children. i have a 14-month old who is very small for his age (5th percentile) so he is ok with the height of the back, but i can see how other children might be a little too tall."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this stroller, but 3 point harness?

He said he had a great voice and really liked the songs he had heard on the radio. So I went to the POP/ROCK section of a local music/book store and found John Mayer. This CD was listed with most of his songs and was the most recent CD (2003). So I bought it and we were both COMPLETELY disgusted. There are NO VOCALS and it most certainly is NOT John Mayer. I believe the packaging had misrepresented the music inside, but was told by the Manager's Asst. that 'Our policy is to never take back opened merchandise.' I really felt that whoever created the CD cover for this Hillbilly version of John Mayer's songs did it knowing that customers would be confused and buy it because they thought it was John Mayer's actual work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of errors","review":"While at it's core, this book does tell a compelling (and sometimes heartbreaking) story of the Allison clan, it is seriously handicapped by the author's failure to thoroughly research the subjects discussed in order to be accurate. Another shortcoming is the numerous mis-spellings, which should have been corrected during the editing process. An example is the author stating that Bobby Allison test drove the Buick Riata before it's release, when a simple Google search reveals the correct spelling is Reatta. In the end I found this book very frustrating and confusing to read. My advice is to pass it by."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great story let down by poor writing","review":"In addition to all of the other errors that have been mentioned by previous reviews, I'd like to point out potentially the BIGGEST glaring fault of this entire book.A scant TEN pages were spent on Allison winning the Winston Cup Championship.For the story of someone who has struggled for years coming up as a self-made racer, it should be one of the highlights of the book. Simply put, we know more about Allison's engine swaps in his airplanes than we do about his Championship winning season.I'm going to finish reading this book more as a tribute to Bobby Allison and the Alabama Gang. Golenback should be ashamed to have allowed this book to have been published. It's a travesty of poor writing, poor editing and elusive facts. It is a mismash of anecdotes and interviews (which in their own right are probably hugely fascinating) marred by absolutely abysmal presentation.Bobby Allison deserves a good biography - and this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nutrition or just plain nutty?","review":"This book seems to be full of formulae for curing mental illnesses.

I started crying in the middle of one chapter when I thought Irene's friends would be discovered by the major, which was a bit embarrasing (in the least! ) It's a really great book to read, especially because it's from a different point of veiw.

It's very well rounded. The acting, score, and cinematography are excellent as well. This movie won the academy award for cinematography in 1994. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins have done many great movies, but this is one of the best. It's so very dramatic and incredibly powerful. It definitely tugs at the strings of your heart. It would be a shame to miss this wonderful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Excellent","review":"What a great movie.

I thought this was a typical Hollywood manipulative melodrama with stilted acting and a plot that made me laugh several times from its absurdity. Brad Pitt reminded me of those \\"good looking\\" dudes in high school who got the babes but now they're pumping gas. If you thought this movie was great, more power to you but it's sad to think that this movie is at the pinnicle for a lot of people. That means you're missing some great movies and books out there...

Brad Pitt is lame, the plot is stupid, and the movie is about 2 hours longer than it should be (literally!). When I saw this in a theater, my friend walked out on it and left me sitting there by myself. I stayed simply because I figured it had to get better. I was wrong. I think the only reason people like it is because Brad Pitt is nice to look at (though he comes across as being dumber than a doornail).

I have both movies and I would say that the original is a better representation of what the movie requires. The Blu-ray, in this case, did not add any clarity to the grandeur of the landscapes, nor enhance the softer character lighting. This movie is a classic and requires more than what was given it.

The story is truly engrossing. You will WANT to see what happens to Tristan and his brothers. Performances are strong by Pitt, Quinn, Hopkins and Ormand. Aside from superb acting, this film is beautiful to watch with breathtaking cinematography. The musical score is appropriately \\"sweeping\\" yet not overbearing. At slightly over 3 hours, it's best to watch this one in just one sitting since you'll follow the characters more smoothly this way. I found myself almost not wanting their stories to end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corn","review":"Looks promising at first but quickly degenerates into overblown, romance novel style ridiculousness.

Very pretty. Really dumb.","review":"A remarkably pompous and self-important film. Elements from William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway never manage to coalesce. We just get lots of truly gorgeous scenery, and a witless script that loads on the Mythic Significance with a shovel. Brad Pitt stands around rehearsing for a Calvin Klein shoot. Aidan Quinn lets his big baby blues tear over. Anthony Hopkins chews scenery. Only Julia Ormond comes out unscathed. A film of value only as a collection of images of the wilds of Canada. Not as a drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Legends of the Dull\\" is more like it","review":"This has to be the most stupid, boring movie that I ever wasted the price of admission on at a movie theatre. My friend who came with me actually walked out halfway through and sat in the lobby until I came out, dazed from the experience. I sat through the whole movie thinking that it had to get better at some point (which it didn't).The plot is dull and hard to believe (someone whose life is already hell is killed by an eagle-eyed bullet ricocheting off of several rocks, I believe) and the acting not that good (I was totally unimpressed by Brad Pitt, who seems to be just as stupid as he is nice to look at).I would recommend not to waste your money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous with a capital R","review":"Boy, this is one silly movie! Now answer truthfully, If your lover pulled a knife on you in bed, wouldn't that be the end of your relationship? Well, that's the kind of stuff going on in this incredibly unbelievable movie.

And check out Anthony Hopkins--even after he strokes out, he's still pulling his rifle out on people!One legend that doesn't merit perpetuating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible and fragmented","review":"Unsatisfying, grotesque, lame parable about selling out.

Brad Pitt looks stupid in this movie, thouth I admit he is still hansome. Nearly all of the characters are annoyingly irreasonable and irresponsible. Female characters look especially stupid. Also, I am really sick of seeing white people mystify the native Americans, pretending to forget the fact it's the White who destroyed them almost entirely.It's not a good movie, though its background is beautiful and some hansome and pretty people are in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the best part of the entire movie...","review":"...is when brad pitt gets eaten by the bear.here's the reader's digest version of the movie:close up on brad pitt's hair.julia ormond cries.someone dies.julia ormond cries.close up on brad pitt's hair.someone dies.julia ormond cries.anthony hopkins suffers a stroke.someone dies.close up on brad pitt.julia ormond cries yet AGAIN.more people die.more people cry.brad gets eaten by the bear (yahoo!)it's *not* an epic. it's not a masterpiece. it's silly, inane, and melodramatic--that's why only 13 year old girls love it and want to name their boys 'tristan.' please, little girls, don't name your boys 'tristan.' they'll hate you. they'll get beaten up at school."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS!","review":"I love Brad Pitt & he looks hot in this movie, but itSUCKS!

The burden of the picture rests on Pitt's often exposed muscular shoulders, but still it remains an ensemble piece.The Native American aspect to the story brings an added dynamic to this interesting tale. Beautiful costumes and lighting, too...although the constantly changing (and obvious) wigs, wiglets, hairpieces, spirit-glue facials hairs and falls get a bit tiresome.There are also some gratuitous buttocks shots of Brad for his many admirers. Julia Ormand, however, was not similarly objectified."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies!","review":"All of the cast in this movie are amazing!

The story line is heartwarming, witty, and moving! The scenery is beautiful! If you haven't seen this movie - rent it or buy it! You will not be dissappointed and I can almost guarantee you even the hardest hearts will break a little!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is probably my all-time favorite","review":"I could not wait to buy this film, and I must admit to watching it probably 100 times. While I loved (and bought) the soundtrack, and was a sucker for the scenery, 100 times has got to add up to more than that. Legends has a true turn of the century ambiance, with the characters tragically in love, and so often dying young. At the time the film is set, this is not melodrama, folks. It is life. There is a strong native american current running through Legends, and that is another reason I liked it. If you like histry, action, romance and beauty of every kind there is, Legends of the Fall is the film for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Blu","review":"This movie took a very long time to make it to Blu Ray. So when it did I couldn't wait to upgrade this film from dvd to blu. Imagine my surprise to find this elegantly written, and beautifully photographed film to be quite grainy, overly contrasty, and drab. At one point I actually put in my old dvd to compare. Although it was softer in comparison the blu isn't that much of an upgrade. Heavy sigh. I believe the marketing term that they used is newly 'remastered'. Extremely hard to believe.John Toll deserved the Oscar that he won and the film is worthy of a better 'remastering' than the one that is offered here. Its a huge disappointment to see this movie in Blu. It is one of the poorest discs remasted in the medium. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remastered version on blu-ray...","review":"\\"Legends of the Fall\\" (1994) is directed by Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond). The story focuses on a family of three sons who live in Montana (though the movie was filmed in southern Alberta, near Kananaskis), and spans from the decade before World War I to 1963.Unlike some inexpensive blu-rays this movie appears to have been cleaned up and remastered. The blu-ray also contains original featurettes of the movie which have not been remastered and are in 480p, along with deleted scenes and commentaries by the director and Brad Pitt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mawkish, overlong family drama","review":"Well intended but unsatisfying melodrama with flat performances, a mediocre recreation of the time period, and a story that has as much wit and subtlety as a pro-wrestling match. You've seen it all before: complications of love between two brothers, a World War I subplot, and Hopkins overacting! This movie could have been made fifty years ago, and made much better, with stars like Gary Cooper or Spencer Tracy as the father, Liz Taylor as the young woman, and Rock Hudson and Montgomery Clift as the two sons. Well, at least that's who I see as the leads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legends of the fall","review":"this movie was shipped and recieved on time.

After all, he has written many books on various eras of California and there was every reason to rejoice over a shorter book to learn more. However, I was very disappointed in this error-prone, often dry and shallow account of our history. While it is a fast read and some of the facts were interesting (like how California got its name), Starr tends to write some of the more uninteresting history of his beloved and favored San Francisco and glosses over some of the more important history of Southern California, one of the largest metropolises on the planet. While I haven't read all of the books on California history, I would not recommend this one as the defining one for those who want to learn more about the Golden state."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Utter Disappointment","review":"You would think that such a renowned historian could write a book without so many errors in detail. Sorry, Mr. Starr, to travel the Pacific Ocean from the Phillipines to California, one heads east, not west. Unfortunately, this book is about what is to be expected from today's academic elite. He can't stop with the oppression & enslavement of the Native Americans, Chinese, Blacks, etc. by the European Americans with biological genocide etc. The \\"environmental catastrophe\\" of the Hetch Hetchy and Owens River water projects is yet another popular comtemporary theme. Yet I wonder if Mr. Starr even considers where that water comes from when he opens a tap at USC? Heaven forbid that he would address these as the engineering marvels of their day that are still in use today. This book is not history, it is retrospective social comentary from the elitest perspective. I got 3/4 of the way through and threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent California history Resource","review":"This book was absolutely wonderful for me, as a teaching student in California.

No relation to the Bank of America. I wonder what other factual errors this book contains and how much I can trust the author with his story."},{"rating":"1","title":"did nothing at all for me","review":"California does have a fascinating history and this book does cover it all. Problem is the writing. The author's not a bad writer but he's not a great one either. I felt my eyes glaze over especially on passages about politics.Given I've enjoyed a number of books on California, it's definitely not me. Maybe someone else can put a finger on it but I just grew weary of the style of writing which came across as too matter of fact and lacking in verve, color, whatever you call it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intro but culturally imperialistic","review":"Prof. Starr's written a good, concise history but has predictably failed in his treatment of the Spanish and Mexican periods. His is the standard 21st-century cant, i.e., whatever was done then should be judged by \\"modern\\" standards. This bit of cultural and temporal imperialism says that the noble savage, living in peace with his neighbors and harmony with nature, should have been left alone to work out his own indeterminate fate. However, even a cursory reading of eyewitness reports will call this viewpoint into question.Once you get past his cultural bias, though, it's an entertaining--albeit understandably overly concise--intro to California history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Political History","review":"This was not the book I was expecting but it was still well written and informative. I was not expecting so much political history but in hindsight it really filled in some history of California for me. I did not agree with everything he said but much of history is interpretation. Don't read this book if you are look for history on the everyday lives of California's. The last chapter is out of date considering how much happened politically in the last year."},{"rating":"2","title":"California Dreaming...","review":"Another triumph for the Modern Library Chronicles! If you want to understand why people around the world continue their California dreaming--read this book. It is a very easy read but full of interesting facts encompassing the periods of 1510-2005.

It was released on laser disc a long time ago. Now they're finally getting around to DVD. Two venerable stars go out with a blaze of glory in this tale about the end of an era. Both in terms of time and setting of the film and also the end of Hollywood turning out westerns as standard movie fare. And as to the latter, I am sincerely regretfull. You have adequate folks laying out the story line here, suffice it to say it's about two old friends who have a falling out over a gold shipment they're transporting and their commitment to get it to the rightful owner, complicated by the marriage gone wrong of a young lady that joins them along the way.

Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea gives the finest performancs of their careers. Should be on the 20 Best westerns list. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is another Peckinpah western in this set (the Peckinpah masterpiece is The Wild Bunch, from 1969). It has some wonderful scenes, although some people may be put off by the Bob Dylan soundtrack and the surrealistic feel of the movie. Chisum is middle of the road John Wayne, not his best or worst. The Stalking Moon has moments, but is probably the weakest film of the four."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 westerns at a great price","review":"I liked most of these four films but some much more than others, Chisum is one of the later John Wayne formula films that started with Rio Bravo and went on too long, this is not one of the best but it is ok. Stalking Moon is very well done and Greg Peck and Eva Marie Saint are quite good in it, it is more of a thiller than pure western and it has some nice plot twists. When I first saw Ride the high country I was not too impressed but over the years I have come to appreciate it much more, it is a very good story dealing with the decline of the \\"West\\" and the men who made it. Scott and McRae are great in it. Unlike so many others I am not a fan of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid as seen through the eyes of Peckinpaugh and must admit that I have always had a hard time sitting through the whole thing. I will give it another try and see if my opinion has changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"this film kicked ass","review":"western fans, you'll love this film. the other reviews where they're saying this film is dull just didn't watch it right. the gun fight at the end is so awesome.

This film is modern in every sense with its downbeat view of heroism and challenging of western conventions.The story of two aging gunfighters is filled with interesting characters and situations. The real secret to its charm is the telling attention to little details in the characters. The marriage scene is an especially memorable set-piece.This is Peckinpah's finest film told with real warmth and restraint. There is real depth here that may suprise people who have only seen his later films.The musical score and a couple of studio-shot scenes are the only thing that really date it.Beautifully shot and masterfully directed with a haunting closing shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine western!","review":"Fine little western - brilliantly acted by ol'cowboys Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott.Pity that \\"hell and fire\\" director Peckinpah didn't make more quiet and poetic films like this one.

Instead, I got a book with lots of theory but no real \\"practice\\", and a cd-rom that has pictures I could have obtained from the web myself. Noden has a wonderful idea, but he seems to have left out the most important chapter in his book: HOW TO USE IT! In addition, there is little said about the part of grammar we all have trouble teaching--the rules. Most of this book relies on content and revision of WRITING, instead.I like that idea, but with the burden of standardized testing, students need to know the rules behind the revisions, too.

The graphics are perfect and fabulous but as virtually everyone buying this is used to playing it on Xbox, MACSOFT never told anyone that they couldn't be bothered to add GAMEPAD support! Of course the pc version has. It would have taken them an extra day to do it but didn't. SO until they do this is a MOST USELESS game to play as using a mouse and keyboard require 17 hands and two sets of eyes just to get some basic gameplay, SO until they deal with this SERIOUS issue do NOT BOTHER WASTING YOUR MONEY as they may NEVER release the patch to allow GAMEPAD support. best Barrie Roness"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Bad","review":"Well, I was quite honestly expecting more. But then again, it is Microsoft... The story mode is fun for awhile, but the multiplayer never gets old, that is if you actually find a good server that does lag too much and doesn't have too many 13-year-old kids shooting teammates. On my dual 1.42GHz MDD G4 with 512 and an ATI Radeon 9000 Pro card, the framerate still dips down to unplayable levels. Unreal 2003 looks much more detailed and I have never had the framerate slow down, even online. It's still fun to play though.

If you are looking for a great game and have the latest, greatest system, go for it. If you don't have a G5, however, I'd recommend getting an Xbox and playing it on there. You can also get Halo 2 when it comes out on Nov. 9 (which will be even better than Halo!). The only thing the Mac version has going for it are the new weapons and vehicles, and online play.

I don't know what MacSoft did with the 2.0 universal update but it runs like an absolute dog on my high end iMac.To put this into perspective: DOOM 3 maxes out at 60FPS (and 60FPS is the built-in limit for DOOM 3) for 95% of the game on the same machine. Oh, and that is running at 1920x1200 on the highest possible detail, so it's not 'lacking the grunt' so to speak.My friend has a Powerbook G4 1.5mhz with a 32mb video card and Halo 1.5 (PPC) runs faster than it does on my new high end iMac...

Nevertheless everything about this game is great, you'll find yourself playing the same level over and over again and it won't feel old. The immersion is amazing, when you see a couple hunters or a pack of elites up ahead you will sweat with fear.

Thank you Donna Freitas! I, like many others, have been struggling to identify my own definition of spirituality. In \\"Becoming a Goddess of Inner Poise\\", Donna Freitas uses an informative-- yet, contemporary and humorous approach to this very ambiguous subject that has been itching to be addressed from a contemporary and professional standpoint. Key word: contemporary; meaning, something that women (and men) of this era can relate to. In a very professional but cool fashion, chapter by chapter Freitas tackles the every day issues and struggles which keep us from attaining spiritual bliss. It's a must have for anyone that has been lacking in their spiritual department and doesn't know why. Donna Freitas is a true pioneer for this new era of spirituality.

It's a great way to satisfy, or stimulate, a child's curiousity about faraway places. The illustrations are colorful, and yet not too cluttered to be informative. The descriptions are clearly written, with nice big print, but with enough detail to have educational value. I recommend it for grade-schoolers, who have any interest, or who need to learn about, life in France.One deficiency: Since I don't speak French, I can't help my daughter with pronunciation, which is so important. Although some of the pages include transliterations of the French phrases, not all of them do.

I understand that he's good at what he does, and bravo to him-- but please, it's hard to take someone seriously when they tout their opinions as facts. I'd recommend reading this because every person is different and what someone else might find this book brilliant, but personally I was so turned off by his cockiness that I had to stop reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every writer should read this book.","review":"I have read this book four times and given it to about ten writers I know.

I am a person who has always enjoyed writing. I chose another profession, which includes writing contracts. I have been thinking about writing fiction for a long time and that is why I purchased this book. The book basically states that if you haven't gone to school for writing then you can't be a writer. Not very encouraging. Too many \\"BIG\\" words. Not easy to read at all. If I picked up a novel written by this author, I probably wouldn't finish it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars.","review":"This book has many wonderful reviews. I ordered the book and was looking forward to reading it. So I read it, then read it again. I didnt find much that is helpful to new writers. Certainly no \\"Ah,Hah!\\" moments.Gardner reminds me of something a professor once told me: \\"If you were lost in the Amazon jungle would you want an Indian to help you OR someone who knows a lot about Indians?\\" Gardner knows a lot about writers! This book showcases his knowledge of writers and literature. Very interesting book.But what exactly it does to help new writers is a mystery. New writers are not Tolstoy or Dickens or Balzac. New writers need to know how to hobble a book together that will fly...later they can soar."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC BUT DENSE","review":"Don't expect to cruise through this book.

I am learning a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Path Hath Twists","review":"What most people don't know about good writing could fill a book. This is probably that book. If you're considering purchasing it, don't hesitate. 'The Art of Fiction' is worth any price if you honestly want to learn to write. Gardner is the most readable authority. However, I offer one warning: His mathematical explanation of plotting profluence is cold. Profluance can be achieved more organically, I believe, and the process of artificially constructing emotive 'triggers' (as will be plain all over 'Grendel' after reading his instructional book) is, to use Gardner's own term, a little frigid. But then again, if it hadn't been for John Gardner, I might never have become that sensitive to linguistic nuances. Get this book, buy it for anyone who you believe wants to write. But do not be wooed into thinking John Gardner's mastery can be your own. 'The Art of Fiction' is a path, not a destination."},{"rating":"2","title":"good condition","review":"The book came in great condition and looks good as new. Came fast enough, too.

And I know it's been said elsewhere, but his defaulting to the masculine personal pronoun is incredibly grating. And then there's the question of why we are supposed to care about the views of someone who was neither prolific nor especially successful himself as a writer of fiction? He makes a few interesting points, but overall it's a pretty tedious read."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware ...","review":"If you aren't well-versed in the Canon of Great Literature, then most all of the author's references -- and perhaps a good deal of what he has to say -- will be lost on you. There are a number of good, clearly stated ideas in this book, but after wading through three quarters of it, I have to say that there must be a better way. To wit, probably better than half of them can be had by reading the previous reviews and any one of a number of internet pages that address the common mistakes of beginning writers. If my knowledge of literature was as complete as Gardner assumes his readers' to be, I wouldn't need to read a book about writing ... Perhaps that's a good bit of Gardner's point, but I paid money for a book about how to write, not for a reading list. I'll be moving on to Burroway's \\"Writing Fiction\\" before I subject myself to the remainder of this snobbish morass.

I especially love Josie Lawrence who I have never seen in anything else before or since, and of course Miranda Richardson and Joan Plowright are wonderful. Even the menfolk characters are well-written and performed and there is no man-bashing so common in \\"girls\\" movies. Heck, even the husbands may want to watch this one.

After leaving the theatre, I commented to my husband, \\"I want to go there.\\" The setting is lovely and tranquil - a perfect place to heal and be restored."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"This is a modern classic with such a sweet and enchanting story. It is beautifully filmed in Portofino and just brightens my day every time I have watched it. Not one to buy movies, this would be one of only a few I would be willing to buy, if only the DVD would be released!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF!","review":"First of all, I don't know if me and the other reviewers watched the same movie?!It made me very uncomfortable when Lotte kept kissing the old lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"A woman may like this movie, but it did not meet my interests.","review":"They story was boring to watch, it was more what ladies may like to view. I need to check out movies before ordering a copy for home use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective movies","review":"I tried purchasing this item twice. Both times, the dvd was stuck on \\"director commentary\\" and the movie would not play.I returned them and will not try to buy this movie from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspect something wrong with Amazon DVDs","review":"I ordered this DVD from Amazon. When it arrived and I tried to play it, the scenes were all out of order. Amazon was good about quickly replacing it, but the second one does the same thing. All my other DVDs play just fine on my DVD player, which is connected to my Samsung TV. I will probably not be buying any more DVDs from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enchanted April","review":"This film is one of the finest and fairest stories ever told. Taken as a whole, the actors, the concept, the scenery, and the magic work perfectly (thank the director Mike Newell for that). I purchased a VHS copy over 10 years ago, and now I'm anxiously -- and a bit impatiently -- waiting for the DVD version which, no doubt, would be even more beautiful in every sense of the film. Step on it fellas - we're all waiting!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Convincing","review":"Pretty picturesque views, but besides that not much else. The acting was stiff and not very well done. Especially Lotty -- that was some bad acting. We didn't get deep enough into the characters to really appreciate their epiphanies. Read the book and forget about the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet holiday","review":"This film is like going away for a day by the lake, but without the hassle of getting a picnic ready. A gentle story about love restored or found. Lovely views. Charming characters. Very relaxing. Just a little quirky, but only enough to bring a smile to one's face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This movie is one of my all times favorites. I can watch it over and over again. It is just a really \\"feel good\\" movie about friendship,relationships, and love. A visually gorgeous movie that makes you want to take a trip to Italy. It is a beautiful movie that will leave you with a smile and lovely feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely... Enchanting","review":"No car chases, robots, murders or hip-hop music. Oh wait, those are just some of the reasons we love this film. It is charming and brings a smile. We waited a long time for this to be released so we could own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"A beautiful film about the power of love to transform people. This is one of the best movies ever made and I cannot for the life of me understand why it is not available on DVD in the U.S."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming!","review":"I popped this movie into the VCR thinking it would probably bore me. There were no big names or splashy titles to lure me in but it was recommended by a friend. I was transfixed from the beginning. It drew me in and when those four women found themselves resting and soaking up the beauty around them in a sort of paradise, I went with them. These four women find true friendship and manage to mend damaged marriages in this magical place. An incredibly sweet story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in quality of DVD.","review":"I really like this story, but am disappointed in the quality of the DVD. The sound was bad and the entire movie was very dark. In some parts, the scenes were so dark, it was difficult to see the action. And in some scenes, the lighting faded almost to black and then it came back. All in all, the quality is very poor, especially at the beginning of the movie. Are all of the DVD's of this movie like this? I gave it two stars because of the poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting! Beauty, kindness ....","review":"Enchanting! Beauty, kindness and togetherness and a sense of happiness. Women put together by circumstance of wanting more out of life. Brilliant cast of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I gave the movie as a gift to my mother and she loved it. She especially enjoyed the movie because it was set in Italy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true spirit lifter","review":"This is one of the best films to watch when you're feeling down. It's a great testament to the power of friendship and the importance of just smelling the roses (or the wisteria in this case). Why they will put trash like American Pie on DVD and not this film is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A serene escape to a gracious era","review":"Four very different women decide to escape their everyday lives and have a vacation in an exotic locale, in this turn-of-the (20th) century movie. In a lighthearted but meaningful way, the movie interweaves two main themes. One is getting a different perspective on your daily petty annoyances when you are physically removed from familiar surroundings and people. The second theme is friendships between (sometimes unlikely) women. The costumes are ethereally lovely and the pace of the movie speaks to a gracious bygone era. There's not much \\"action\\" here. The tone of the movie is very relaxing. This is a movie with inter-generational appeal, a lovely finale to a summer family get-together at grandma's."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY GREAT MOVIE BEST OF THE BEST DVD RELEASED IN EUROPE","review":"AS TO BE EXPECTED THERE IS NO US RELEASE ON DVD I HAVE THE VIDEO AND THE IMPORT DVD.PLEASE RELEASE THIS TITLE NOT KILLER MICE ON MARS OR KILLER TOMATO TRILOGY"},{"rating":"2","title":"ADULT ANIMATION, NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN","review":"The dvd has Great Quality Sound and Video with lots of vivid colors and many sexual inuendos. There is a Great story line as long as you can follow a plot that suggests that there is more to life than just living on \\"earth\\" such as going back and forth to alternate universes. If you have seen and liked \\"MEET THE FEEBLES\\" You'll like this one too - this one does not have any bloody scenes or explicit sexual scenes, much is left up to the imagination. I think that Many people need to Learn to use their imagination more and not be so closed-minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool World","review":"I love this movie. I used to watch it when I was younger and could not find this DVD anywhere. Then I looked on Amazon and here it was. I was so excited. It is perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T MISS IT!","review":"I liked it! Holli IS the cutest thing. It opens another world..one where you need to watch your step. Yeah, some of the questions could be answered. What picked Pitt to be pulled into Cool World? What became of Holli? Do Lonette and Pitt have 2-d kids now? The music PLAY WITH ME and Cool world by Bowie are just great! And the rabbit was too funny..BUT I WON! See it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"for teens only","review":"I was never aloud to watch this movie when I was younger, and for good reason. This movie would only be good for people who know curse words and know about sex. It is no childs movie. All in all it was a very good movie to watch. The plot is funny, and the characters are very amusing. If you watch it you should like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything but \\"Cool\\"","review":"This is a horrible movie. It makes no sense,the acting is horrible and nothing about it is funny and/or dramtic. It's ToonTown on smack and even worst,second-rate actor Brad Pitt is in it. I give this film a 0 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen worse!!!","review":"I've seen worse!!! I think that this movie is trying to somewhat copy the fantastic movie \\"Who framed Roger Rabbit?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Of mild interest only","review":"Cool World is a very disappointing film. While the concept is interesting, the execution leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I've ever seen...","review":"I don't want to waste too much time on this review, but the fact that this turkey is averaging three stars is ridiculous. This is one of only two movies that I have ever seen that I actually wish I had gotten up and left halfway through...I kept holding on, hoping, hoping, hoping that it would redeem itself, and it just kept getting worse...As another reviewer pointed out, this isn't even campy-funny. It's just horrid, horrid, horrid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun as always","review":"Haven't seen this movie in years! Always a fun watch. I understand the script is a little weak and... Brad I love you honey but it's not you finest acting. But let's not kid ourselves- we're watching it because we want to see a real world + cartoon movie. I think the animation is very well done, I just get a bit confused when Holly Would starts transforming back to her cartoon self but it doesn't look much like her... like a different kind of cartoon. But those are just minor nitpicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly","review":"Brad Pitt tried when he was younger to do cutting edge work in film. As he rose the ladder he succumbed to the Hollywood cookie cutter style of acting, but you have to give him points for trying early on (remember 12 Monkeys and Fight Club or if you're really good - Johnny Suede). However this mishmash of an attempt to cash in on the success of Roger Rabbit was ill-conceived and badly executed. Not that Pitt didn't bring somehthing to his role and the same can be said for Kim Bassinger's badgirl, which made Jessica Rabbit look like Snow White, but they both failed to salvage the movie. The interaction with the doodles (toons in Rabbit) is mostly annoying and lacking in wit and style.The movie is noisy and meandering. Save your money.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"one liner","review":"I only rmember one thing from the entire movie that I just sat thru.One toon calls another \\"pencil d##k\\". I laughed and laughed. Then I went back into my coma. Not a very good movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bakshi's worst movie","review":"The movie is poorly written not to mention the lame special effects. Its a completly souless film. If you liked Fritz the Cat,Wizards,American Pop, or other films by Ralph Bakshi, than stay away from this, because its embarassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holli Won't...","review":"More misogyny from the stunted, adolescent mind of Ralph Bakshi. People love to point out Bakshi's movies as \\"adult,\\" but I submit they're more in line with the musings of a junior high misfit. But mainly, they're about how much Bakshi hates, fears and misunderstands women.In this blatant \\"Roger Rabbit\\" retread mix of live action and crude animation, Gabriel Byrne plays a dimwitted cartoonist whose creation, Holli Would, comes to life in the luscious form of Kim Basinger, who proceeds to ruin his life and transform him into a gibbering, idiotic superhero cartoon. That is, when she's not killing other \`toons and turning into a monstrous, hideous caricature of herself. Holli's just another in a long line of Bakshi women- either they must be pliant and vapid (the faeries of \\"Wizards\\"), or manipulative shrews like Holli. Yep, women are truly evil, Ralph.Brad Pitt sports some crazy hair, but truly there's little here of adult interest. Adult meaning \\"mature and reasonable.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great movie everyone should see it!!!","review":"It's no different from anyother movie,like spacejam it's just the same only this one is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible","review":"I finally got around to seeing Cool World. I wasn't expecting much (heard all the bad reviews when it was released), so I guess I was not disappointed. Cool World is terrible. It's not even \\"good-terrible\\" in a campy, kitchsy sort of way. It's a miracle that it didn't kill the careers of Pitt, Basinger or Byrne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor animation, poor storyline, poor everything!","review":"Avoid this movie at any cost! Althought it has nothing to do with Roger Rabbit, you can notice this is the \\"wannabe\\" kind of movie but with very bad and poor results. Seems to have had a very low budget for animation and camera work. Remember a very old and bad movie called \\"The android\\" that had opening credits the same way than Star Wars but done very badly? It had starships that looked like the Star Wars ships, but this were a shame. Maybe you don't remember it, and I wish I've never seen that movie. Well, I feel the same way about Cool World. You'd better watch Roger Rabbit over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"completely awesome.","review":"I saw this movie yars ago and have finally purchased it. I guarentee everyone will love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um... I'd rate it garbage","review":"I watched this because it comes up as a recommended film, like a cult classic. Clearly those critics were high when they saw this movie. This movie is absolutely terrible! There are such huge plot holes that you practically have to go into a concussion to understand what's going on. I'm so surprised that Brad Pitt's career didn't go down the pooper 'cause this movie had bad acting and animation all around. It's incredibly cheesy and at times annoying. At least with Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the humans felt like they were interacting with the toons and were physically affected by their presence. This film was like watching amateur mimes. Could they have at least looked in the direction of the toons they were interacting with? It's like they decided to just look left of the camera at all times instead of at the fictional character. >_< If they remake this movie, it can only be for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely different","review":"The concept of this movie is so different. Even with the live-action/animation, sometimes it's a little difficult to keep up. The graphics are great and Kim Bassinger and Brat Pitt do an outstanding performance. I would not recommend this for a family viewing night despite the cartoon graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather vomit and go play in it...","review":"This movie was so horrible, I was going to sell it in a yard sale. Then I thought... 'that means it will be floating around somewhere else in the world.\\" So I decided to throw it away, then thought 'what if someone goes dumpster-diving, takes it, and watches it?\\" I couldn't live with that! So, I burned it. Bad for the environment, yet good for the general population. The only thing RIGHT about it was that the Rock Biter had the correct, book-version of the name. STILL, if I wanted Cheese, I would have grabbed a bag of Doritos. Mmm... Doritos. ::Walks away to find the Doritos::"},{"rating":"1","title":"It only feels like it never ends.","review":"The first movie was awesome. The second one was ok. This one is just embarrassing. The only cool things about this movie are that you get to see Jack Black play a school bully, and hear Rock Biter sing \\"Born to be Wild\\". Other than that, this is a total waste of time.Oh, and if they're going to have a different kid play Bastian in every movie, they could at least make some effort to have them look somewhat alike. They all look completely different. He might as well have been black in one of them.Bad trilogy. Very bad. Just go with the first one, it's the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to NES fans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The first Neverending Story was and is one of my favorite movies ever made, I can't get enough of it. After the second one came out they messed everything up and this third one is a joke, a disgrace and an insult to NES fans everywhere. First of all the book and the auryn look nothing like the original. Atreyu isn't in the film nor is he mentioned. The rock biter has shrunk, there is a stupid talking tree and poor Falkor looks like he's going to die off! I swear I think the people that made this movie didn't even bother to watch the original. The Rock Biter singing \\"Born To Be Wild?\\" You've got to be kidding me?! They should never have made any sequels to this movie unless the original actors, writers and directors were in it. They should have just left well enough alone. Like they say \\"If it aint broke, don't fix it\\" I wouldn't spend 5 cents on this movie nevermind wasting [$$] on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING LOWER THAN 1 STAR ?","review":"Just saw this movie on WAM today 4/10/04. Can't believe that someone didn't stop production on this film EARLY in the making. What a waste. Hope to have better luck with the \\"Tales\\" series.

I can't imagine it taking long (possibly a week) to make this film. BOO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD BE BURNED!!!!","review":"This movie should be burned and forgoten!

It's TNES fans hitting their heads against walls!","review":"Why did they even bother making this? The original movie was good (although I'd personally recommend reading the book by Michael Ende) and the first sequel was acceptable (although it still does not come anywhere NEAR to the book!) But this second sequel... URGH! I think it is one of the reasons why TNES is not more popular today. It is a disgrace to fans, and it NEVER should have been made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack Black is the only reason one should watch this","review":"What a horrible piece of film history. I'm not even a big fan of \\"Fantasia\\" or this series, but even I felt betrayed. It has nothing to do with the first two despite the appearance of Atreyu (who in this incarnation is played by Jason James Richter - i guess the money was too low for someone the caliber of jonathan brandis) i digress. even the creatures are cheesy. there is no spark of imagination like the first two in the way the creatures act or talk much of it relies only on pathetic one liners. the plot is also sad. like i said, the only reason to watch this is to see jack black, one of the finest comedians of our time. thanks for your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So terrible, selling it in stores is criminal","review":"Just look at this, about 10 minutes in you know just how terrible this is. Why even sell this if it does much more harm and absolutely no good? If you ever come across this in a store or flee market, DESTROY IT! Stomp the tape or bend the disk in half. They may demand you to pay for the damage or arrest you, but it's well worth the risk because THIS MOVIE IS CRIMINAL. Just say \\"It must be destroyed before it does more damage to other people who are unfortunate enough to fall for this.

The first sequel had some decent moments here and there, but overall it was nothing special. The second sequel . . . I think I'm gonna puke last night's dinner. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. \\"Escape from Fantasia\\" is an insult to all NES fans of all ages! It had a cheap plot, cheap special effects, a cheap script, cheap performances . . . in fact, everything about it was an abomination. And why was Jack Black in this movie?

They attempt to use a few things from the book at the beginning, but it just descends into an ever downward-spiraling wreck that makes you wish you could get back the last hour or two of your life. Rockbiter has a whole family and rides his bicycle thing and sings a song.Under no circumstances should you every pay to see this movie.

I sure was wrong. It was practically a different story! Falkor is really different (and kind of stupid), I have no idea what they did to the rock biter, and why did they have to go and change what the aurin looked like?

And where did the empress's mystique go? Now she is just some teen in a Princess Leia dress with a silver necklace in her hair. And I didn't know that the Orin gave you a credit card! What tripe!

Rewards are an excellent motivator. With Tracy Foote's book, the motivator is the sticker chart.We've seen other sticker charts and they only have space for about 20 stickers or so. Although there are some children who are trained that quickly...most are not. This is a nice big chart that allows children time to develop their good bathroom habits.Our son has enjoyed the \\"fireman\\" stickers and the other stickers with big boys to look up to.

He still wants the stickers and loves putting them on the tracking sheet, but it isn't worth it for him to use his potty chair. He's barely 2, and I am sure he will come around. Some of the stickers are very specific to what they are for, and it's hard when he wants to use those stickers when he hasn't accomplished what the sticker says. I may try this when my daughter is ready for potty training. It has been worth the money so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Motivator","review":"I was having trouble motivating my son to use the potty. He wasn't interested in candy or other rewards, but I gave the stickers a try and they are a big hit. We hung the chart in the bathroom so he can see his progress. Plus, he shows all our visitors all the stickers he has earned. I let him choose the sticker and he really enjoys seeing the little boys and the ones with toilet paper and sinks. When his dad gets home from work, he takes him by the hand to the bathroom to show how many stickers he has gotten that day.

I was drawn into the story and felt like I was a witness, instead of a reader. The characters are complex and well defined.

Oh, it certainly had its moments, but despite some really emotional inner struggles, the book as a whole didn't often move me, although I liked it better than the other one.The love scenes too seldom move the plot forward in any significant manner, and they often skirt the border of what's acceptable for me personally. The middle of the book were terribly slow, and while I rather liked Kell, I wasn't too fond of Raven. Most of the secondary characters and the plot points were weak, tired, or overused.All in all, I think I'm done with Nicole Jordan for a while.

More than anything, it is a story of a man's values and integrity during struggle and success. Willeford does an incredible job of painting an accurate picture of the sport of cockfighting. While this sport may seem inhumane to some (if not most) of the general public, Willeford portrays the honor and integrity of the sport without shying away from its gruesome truths.

I came to realize that God still loves me and I can have a relationship with Him outside the confines of this religion.Thank you Raymond Franz for helping me on my road to the real truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JW's Governing Body exposed by a former member of 9 years","review":"This book exposes, for the first time, the inner workings of an organization whose Governing Body is a mystery to even devoted, long-time members. What JW's accept as unquestionable \\"Truth\\", has oftentimes been the product of vicious political infighting among the Body members. Because of the controversial subject matter, Franz is meticulous in his documentation of events and writings -- to quiet any would-be doubters. He also appears to be devoid of any bitterness or resentment from his harrowing ordeals. The end result is an account which shocks often, enrages at times, and always entertains. While Franz' intention is not to preach, he does raise intriguing, thought-provoking questions which every Christian (and especially every Jehovah's Witness) owes it to himself to answer in his heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indeed a Crisis of Conscience","review":"As I was starting reading this book, I realized that I wasn't the only one with \\"crisis of conscience\\".

We had them for only a couple of months before he figured out every conceivable way of opening the door. First by sliding his fingers through the hole in the front of the cover to turn the knob, then by firmly slamming the front of the cover with the ball of his palm to break the cover in two and then the way it was intended to be opened.This did prevent him for a little while, however if a child is determined enough to leave or gain entry to a room they will do so.

I have a Climber in the car and have used it for very light basic repairs, but I have seen what can happen to a Swiss Army knife that is mistaken for a multitool. It buckles at the base and the rest of the knife loses it's overall balance and functionality. This and all Swiss Army knives are the percursor to the modern day multitool and should be treated as a last resort for any type of repair. With that in mind, the craftsmanship is superb and actually quite beautiful in all Swiss Army knives and the Climber is, but one of many available models. A nice gift and I gave a few for Christmas knowing that it is always well received. I have about 8 different models of my own and will likely get more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator music","review":"I understand where everybody else is coming from when they say that Soulive has good musicianship and songwriting skills but this album is completely devoid of emotion. All the little unison sax/keys licks seem to be floating around in the songs for no reason. It sounds like the kind of stuff that you hear on an elevator when you go to work. Also, I like Dave Mathews, but on Joyful Girl, he's terrible, probably because it's was a terrible song to begin with(it's an Ani DiFranco cover). The other lyrics just don't seem to cut it either(sorry Black Thought) because they don't fit in with this style of jazz.

Bought on the recommendation of a friend, based on my love of MMW, this is not even in the same realm. MMW is raw, gritty, and dirty, with all sorts of sounds going on in and around their music. Soulive has none of this. It's not quite as bad as smooth jazz, but it's close. The production is too slick, and the organ, sax, and guitar sounds are so cheesy I felt I needed some bread and a skillet. The only song worth anything here is the Ani cover (\\"Joyful Girl\\"), on which Dave Matthews' voice shines - and I usually can't stand him or his band (or their fans, but that's neither here nor there). \\"Next\\" is exactly what I said when this album ended, and it'll probably stay in its case on the shelf forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is Spiderman and The Hulk???","review":"I guess these were OK comics... they seemed a little depressing.

I got it for my set of 52mm filters and it is just way too large. However, if you do get it to store 72mm+ filters you may not be able to close the flap completely because of resulting thickness.In all, for ~$10 I did not expect miracles, but I did expect better.

For the casual reader, at times irritatingly challenging - he uses proper and place names often with no previous reference and maps are very sparse, and in tiny print.

The main character is colorless, to put it mildly (perhaps he seemed especially so because I just finished a book by Rick Copp, whose protagonist is particularly interesting), the motivation for the characters' actions never quite rings true (the \\"solution\\" to the mystery was especially disappointing), and the characters themselves are neither fully-developed enough to be interesting nor weird enough to be entertaining.The book is really more of a soap opera than a mystery: it's full of family business intrigue, issues of incest, long-buried secrets, and other soap-opera business.

And soon the serene surface of Charlotte is ruffled as things begin to \\"happen\\" to Derek. He is a likeable and even admirable young man so attractive to read about. We wish him only the best. But his quick temper and lack of real judgement get him into unnecessary trouble again and again. Surely, the reader wonders, he cannot be that dense! He is quickly in bed (literally) with two different people (whatever happened to discernment?)and one wonders about his stability. Still, that all said, it is a good read, and even has some surprises in store for the reader which are not easy to see coming. I hope that there is another Derek Mason adventure and that he can make up his mind and at the same time, find some maturity so that he can deal with happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"I totally agree with the guy above who was disappointed with this.

This album has three cuts , two of which I think are extraordinary and Judy at her best. The 1st is 'Plaisir D'Amour', and the second is 'Loch Lomond'. These two I consider as flawless in every way as her best version of Amazing Grace that was included on the 'Forever' collection, her original 'Send in the Clowns' or 'My Father' to name a few. 'Barbara Allen ' is nearly as flawless but I'm spoiled by the Jo Stafford version, which on her \\"Best Of\\" box set Judy is quoted as saying that was a favorite of hers. The rest of the album is good with 'Black is the Color' and 'Morning Has Broken' rounding out my top five for this album. The rest of the album's songs are not spectacular but make for a overall enjoyable album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy Easy Listening","review":"This is a great CD.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAME OLD, SAME OLD","review":"If you own many CD's by Judy Collins you may be very disappointed in this one. It is just more of the same old music. There is nothing fresh and new about this CD. Judy sings more Bob Dylan, traditional folk music, MORNING HAS BROKEN, AMAZING GRACE, and CATS IN THE CRADLE once again. Judy tries something new with combining John Denvers LEAVING ON A JET PLANE with COUNTRY ROADS in a medley, which was a bit different. The band on this album plays very well but has a tendency to hold out the last notes of each song expecting Judy to hold her last note longer; but she never does. Judy also growls a few notes on this one. My suggestion is stick to the old Judy Collins recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best idea to buy this book","review":"Excellent text, horrible edition. Sure, the price is good and the fact that you get all 4 volumes of The History of Napoleon in one book make this version tempting, but the quality of the print is so bad and the size of the book is so huge that most likely you will not get very far reading this.

I really liked this book-couldn't put it down. I especially liked the Patton scenes (hilarious) and could feel the \\"heat\\" between Ingrid and Judge when they finally meet.

Way too familiar","review":"Not a terrible book, but it's marred by the feeling of familiarity -- it's been done by better writers (Ken Follett, Jack Higgins, others) and seems not just derivative but sort of rote. The author is a workmanlike prose stylist with a tendency to overuse big words; the characters are pretty thin and not so easy to identify with. The author's first book at least had the virtue of a setting (inside a Swiss bank) that we hadn't really seen much of before.

Patton a traitor and common murderer. His attempt to take Patton's warnings about the intent of the Soviets and the need to push them out of Eastern Europe (we might ask some of those left behind the iron curtin if Patton was correct) have been converted to his being a traitor, this is going to far, unfortunatly the courts have ruled that you cannot slander the dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent post WWII novel","review":"I am not a WWII buff like my husband, but read this book because it was available. I highly recommened it as it is set immediately after WWII as Berlin is being divided among the Allies. The post-war conditions of Germany were written in such vivid detail, I felt as if I was reading non-fiction. Immensely accurate and a great read. Characters are well developed. Gave it 4 stars just because it's not my favorite genre. Passed it on to my mother-in-law to read. Interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling From Start To Finish........","review":"After reading \\"Numbered Account\\", which was one of the most thrilling fiction novels I've read in many years, I wondered why Reich would switch from a financial thriller to a WWII plot. Nonetheless I had to buy the book, and I was far from disappointed. Christopher Reich has a knack for writing novels that keep you enthralled from start to finish. Not only was this book exciting it was also a small lesson in history with a most stunning and thought provoking ending. It was one of those books that I wished would not end. I can strongly recommend this as a wonderful read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Don't read this book just because you liked Numbered Account.

In order to enjoy fiction, one must be able to \\"suspend disbelief\\" and be caught up in the story along with the characters. Too many factual errors for me to maintain that critical suspension of disbelief in this one. For example, Mr. Reich describes a .45 caliber pistol as having nine bullets in the cartridge, one in the chamber. Huh? A bullet IS a cartridge, and they go in the magazine, or the clip. Little things like this are jarring, like seeing a soldier with long hair curling over his ears in a movie about WWII - just not realistic. Mr. Reich has a fairly good writing style, but he needs - badly - a fact checker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Yarn - Bad Editing","review":"An interesting story. Mediocre writing style.

This line: \\"He wanted to taste her, to touch her, to revel in the heat that spiked a fever in his body every time he was near her.\\" Seriously? I think a cute story could've been told without all the references to sex. I'm not opposed to sex, but in today's world, this book takes a male/female relationship a few steps back.

All the characters were well-developed and three-dimensional. The dialogues contained a lot of banter which I enjoy and really gave definition to the characters as well as moved the plot along. The plot was a bit predictable but still lots of fun to read. There were some mistakes (like using Sophie's name in place of Lucy's, for example), but for the most part the story flowed very smoothly. The imagery was done very well and I really empathized with the characters and the funny situations that they experienced. (The one that comes to mind is Lucy's problems getting through airport security with her silver case.) My only objection is that nobody practiced safe sex. This book was lighthearted yet it touched my emotions in many places and I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleepless reading","review":"It's a fun, fast-paced story written in a delicious way that kept me hooked from the first page to the last. The characters are so real and their feelings and reactions so well shown, that I wanted Lance and Sophie to find their happy ending together in spite of the many conflicts they faced. This is the first book I read by Rita Herron, but I enjoyed it so much I will be looking for her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"This is my third book by Rita Herron and my favorite so far. My only regret is that I now realize it is the follow up to Marry Me Maddie and I should have read that one first. The whole set up was fun and full of conflicts. I could understand why Lance had issues and sympathised with him, but he did dig himself into some holes. Sophie was a wonderful heroine, funny and nice and I really wanted her to find her happy ending with Lance. Sophie's sister Lucy is a delight, and I must check out if she has her own book. I hope she does.

You have a strong independent woman in lust with a wimpy man. Wimpy because he doesn't want to be with Sophia (strong lady) because he doesn't want to get married??? There was no hint that Sophia wanted marriage. But then somewhere in the middle of the book he wants to be with Sophia and is Mr. Romantic. I just wasn't into it. I like those books where the funny strong lady banters with the funny strong man and there was none of that in this story. Definitely no humor.

The book also has countless factual and geographical errors; i.e. a burnt out car found west of Sarasota. That would be in the Gulf of Mexico then! Too many middle aged people having torrid and graphic sex - nearly all of whom have inter-racial partners. The author cannot resist inserting her own political and ideological politically correct beliefs at every opportunity. Too many characters, not enough plot and, in the words of Elvis \\"a little less conversation, a little more action\\" might have benefited this shambles. I persevered with the story because it fell just short of being binned, but only just.

After reading the part about Alyssa's 2 sisters pregnancies, I realized this sounded familiar and checked my list of books read.

Terrorist, AKA 9/11, spousal and child abuse, porn, inter-racial marriages, red neck stereo type casting, FBI paranoia,etc? Better to pick one theme and stick to it. I hope our countries security and safety is not hinged on these sex obessed people as described in this plot. Help. Did we really swallow the accident Gina had with Max just happening to be there to the rescue? And that the drivers mimiced her cousin that was her father's 4 youngest brother's 3rd youngest son.

There was very little suspense with Sam and Alyssa in this book, no shockers at all. There wasn't much SEAL action either. The only real action was at the end, which as one reviewer mentioned was tied up as neat as a bow. I have never been able to put any of Brockmann's books down until completely read.

I love Sam & Alyssa's story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the others!!!!","review":"I could not wait for this book so when I read it I wanted to read it as slow as possible so I could savor it and for the first few days I managed too. But of course it didn't last long. I got hooked and didn't want to stop reading it. Although the Sam and Alyssa story wasn't my favorite. I thought the book as a whole was incredible. Suzanne Brockmann is an incredible writer. I would not have changed one thing about the story and now must wait for the next one, which I hope will be Max and Gina. Until then I must dream of Max instead of read about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than 'Into the Night ' - boring","review":"This book is the closely-tied sequel to 'Into the Night'. I felt it dragged. I skimmed large sections of it just to get through it. I'm happy that Mary Lou survived the storyline although her character development pretty much ended in 'Into the Night'.I was surprised that Alyssa had any warm fuzzies at all for Sam - they must have happened behind the scenes or in the sections I skimmed because in the pages I did read, she was always hateful to him.However, I was happy to get the background story on Max & Gina whose story is a well-done recent release of Ms. Brockmann's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blew Apart My Preconceptions","review":"I feared Sam the Jerk would become boring, so I delayed reading this book. What I couldn't have imagined, based on the other books in the series, was that I was unable to finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long, long windy road....","review":"Now granted, Suzanne had a lot of loose ends to tie up in this book. There were so many things left unfinished, and she had to zip everyone's story up, but this book was entirely too complicated....There are layers, upon layers, upon layers of maneuverings, and thoughts and ideas, and the talking! I have never \\"met\\" men that talked and talked (and cried - NTTAWWT) so much! Brockmann is a good writer, she loves her Navy SEALS and strong, passionate women, so it was good to come back and \\"see\\" everyone again. But this was too complicated. She gets a lot of points for making Alyssa and Sam's story interesting for so long and also for not being afraid of interracial relationships. Good for her. But this was an exhausting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too drawn out","review":"I was very very disappointed in this book, after eagerly awaiting it. It was too long, with too many story lines. It could have been made into a 200 page book. No sizzle and spark like the other books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brockmann can do better","review":"After anticipating the conclusion to the Sam and Alyssa story for the last five Seal Team 16 books, I was sorely disappointed in this book. There were too many story lines introduced that interfered with the flow of the main story. Only about 40 percent of the book were devoted to the main characters, very little of which is spent on romance or even true character building. Ms. Brockmann seems to have been more concerned with setting up her newest story line (a civilian, covert agency) than giving her readers what they have been expecting. The ending or HEA for these two characters was very rushed and not supported by the action in this book. After her dismal efforts in Into the Night, this is a second strike for Brockmann."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam and Alyssa","review":"This one was 5 books in the making... Sam and Alyssa's story as well as a continuation of Mary Lou and Iibraham.As always, best to read this series in order because of the massive character building matrix that spans several books.We probably learn more about Sam than most other characters because we get 3 generations of Starrett here- and specifically his own childhood which isn't tooooo common with Brockmann.The \\"change of heart\\" is sudden. The jumping from crappy marriage to with someone else could be skeezy, but we know Sam's love Lys for a while.This is also the end of the Paoletti/SEALS part of the series and the very seeds of what readers will come to know as Trouble shooters Inc. The SEALS are still around, still causing trouble, still kicking butt and taking names... but Tom and some of the characters we've grown with to this point become peripheral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally I finished it!!","review":"I have to congratulate the rest of the reviewers that have ploughed their way through this entire series. I read one before this \\"Defiant Hero\\" and that's enough for me, thank you. It is hard to believe a writer could drag out a story that takes place in 1 week folks, check the dates, but the way she did this was to sandwich in all the childhood trauma of Roger/Sam and the letter writing between Dot and Walt. She not only filled us in on all the background but kept beating us over the head with it. And talk about sexual hangups these characters had them all. At least any more in this series will have a change of pace you can hope since there are some career changes taking place, and maybe everyone will get lucky and Max will go off to Kenya and do some real adjusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuchhh!!!","review":"Last one I'll read by her.I didn't like the last book. But, I had to read this book after living with Sam and Alyssa for years.I liked MarylouI didn't care about Tom and Kelly.Needless to say, I was ready to throw the book before the first 100 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome socks!","review":"These socks are great! I have searched a long time for socks that were comfortable, well cushioned, and fit right. I have a size 14 foot and the 13-15 size was perfect.

This book is more suited for the slow 2nd grader. It mostly deals with outside painting and staining.nothing at all on how to roll inside walls. This is the WORST book that I have ever bought. This book does not even come close to Tauntons Press normal quality, Shame on you Tauntons..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Questions about APS Answered","review":"Jenni Bidner does an excellent job of explaining the features of the Advanced Photo System.

Our whole class along with the Professor find this book to be very difficult to follow. The book constantly repeats itself making it extremely boring to read and is not fluent at all. They have examples that reference charts that are 3-5 pages apart from the problem being discussed the formulas you almost have to figure out for yourself how they are used and there are alot of typos.I recomend burning this book!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent reference for engineers at all levels.","review":"The book is thorough in its presentation of every aspect of land development. It examines the intricacies involved in a project from planning to engineering to construction stakeout. The authors apply all this knowledge in a Case Study of an actual development which they planned and designed. Numerous graphics, tables and charts were employed to reinforces the information in the text.Obviously some of the design information will not be applicable to the entire country. However the authors do suggest where locally relevent design information can be found.Overall, I found the book very informative, easily read and well organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book for the Project Engineer Engaged in Land Development","review":"This book is the first book that really reflects and addresses most of the \\"everyday\\" issues encountered in site design and land development.

With today's technology, I expected a lot more. The manufacturer claimed a greter capability. It identifies colors, but not alwys with accuracy. For example, pink is identified as red. On the positive side, I learned the placemats on my table are black/olive green. I think that is right! Being completely colorblind, I rely on my color-sighted friends for accurate information. In a pinch, the device will be useful; although, it is almost too large to carry in my purse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Challenging","review":"This is a great game for parties or casual get-togethers. The rules are simple but once you start playing you realize how hard it is to picture the maze changing in your mind. Many times, you'll move a tile only to realize you just messed yourself up instead of making the amazing connection you thought you saw.Highly recommend this for 3 or 4 players. With 2 players it's OK but it's too easy to plan ahead to your next move. With 3 or 4 players you have to adapt your strategy constantly because by the time your turn comes again the board has totally changed.This is a game where you can still have a conversation going at the table without ruining the flow of the game, but it demands enough attention that people don't lose interest in it. Kids from the age of about 7 or 8 can play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"First played this with my niece when she was about 7. Now I play it with my HS students. Good for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The aMaZing GaMe","review":"When you need to play a game with grandchildren, this game is more fun, for you, than a lot of the boring games on the market. Guaranteed not to bring yawns. The grandchildren enjoy it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all ages!","review":"This is a great game... easy to understand for most ages, challenging enough to make it fun and fast moving to keep you from getting bored. I got this for my daughter last year and we have really enjoyed it - basically you take turns sliding 1 piece through the puzzle, constantly changing the way it looks and trying to get to your target square. fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging; pretty fun","review":"The game is very simple. The rules are easy to read, though a little hard to interpret, but a logical person can figure out the rules in one or two reads. The game itself is very well engineered. The pieces are not too hard to slide, nor do they slide easily out of place. It is tempting to come up with custom rules to keep the game flowing a little faster to reduce frustration. For instance, according to the rules, you're supposed to first play the maze card, then move your token, but it improves game flow if the order is not enforced. Game flow would also be improved with the possibility of getting a spin card that, when played, would allow a player to spin the labyrinth square he currently occupies. Just a thought. Really though, Labyrinth is a fun game that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its really a boring game . . . .","review":"I bought this game for nephew who is eight.

I'd never heard of it, but it looked interesting and had a parent's choice award label on it, so I decided it give it a try. We played it as soon as we got home and we enjoyed it. Simple enough for 7yo and fun for adults. I agree that sliding the tiles is annoying because they catch, but otherwise great. I also like the the box insert is designed to neatly hold all of the pieces: an extra bit of quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly high quality","review":"I bought this set as a present for my little brother, and for the price expected it to be usable but not particularly nice. So I was surprised when he opened it and found that the chop paste container, brush stand, and water bowl are made of attractive porcelain, the chop stones have detailed carvings at the tops, and the ink stick has a beautiful dragon embossed around it. The brushes are a comfortable weight and have stiff bristles. He loves it!I highly recommend this set for any beginning calligraphers, and as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"If this is a gift for a child, it's OK at best. If you're truly interested in learning the art, do some research and spend a little more. The brushes and ink stick were cheap and the ink stone isn't the right shape inside the bowl, so ink cannot be made properly.Check out: Takase Shodokai (Learn Japanese Calligraphy) for both the proper How-To, and the correct tools you will need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice set","review":"I'm sure more professional calligraphy artests would think this set for little kids. But I am really impressed with it. It comes with four brushes, two chop stamps, an ink stick, a brush stand, an ink stone, a red ink container for chops, a water bowl, and a water spoon, all inside a really nice case. The set seems really authentic and delicate, and with the free rice paper you can make tons of pictures and kanji posters. It was a really great price even if you choose to just display it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I paid for","review":"I ordered this for a calligraphy class and chose this particular one because the stones looked especially nice with the design at the top. When it came in the mail the ink plate was broken along with the plastic tips of the brushes. Also, the seal stones were about half of the size represented in the picture and did not have any detailing on them at all. Another issue I had was that I paid expedited shipping and it took about a week to get to me even though they did not ship it from all that far away from where I live. It was a major disappointment and I can't use half the stuff since its either broken or too small for what we're doing in class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We bought this set as a gift for our teenage daughter. We were very disappointed with the quality of the brushes, which broke immediately. The cover of small pot of red ink for the stamp had bonded to the base and we had to work with hot water and a blade to open it. The stamp is uncarved and there is no practical way to carve it unless you already own sculpting tools. The parts we did like include the pretty case, bar of black ink, and brush rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, endearing","review":"This was a wonderful tribute to the loves in the author's life.

Aside from being mislead to begin with, the band in my opinion is just terrible. If I were in Snapcase, even just being a fan of Snapcase, I am insulted at the use of a great bands name and reputation to sell a crappy product. If you like that poppy alternative immitaion punk, like Matchbox 20 or 3 Doors Down, maybe you just might like this, but I doubt it. I couldn't find anything about it even somewhat interesting. Singer is whiney, instruments are played basic and boring, common of every other band out there on the pop stations, and some songs sound familiar as in other songs by other bands. There is nothing original here, save your money, buy a guitar, and with in 10 minutes of playing it, you can produce a better album than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the actual book!","review":"I ordered what I thought was the book, but received an audio CD instead.

And by cramping, I mean horrible spasms down my wrist and into my elbow! I had to ice my hand because I noticed my palm was swollen. The moment I'd go to pick up my pencil, the pain was back, so I started researching my options. I figured out it could be the grip of the pencil, and then I found this on Amazon.I've been using it for about a week and the difference is amazing. Along with some advil, the pain is significantly reduced and I'm able to get my work done without having to stop every twenty minutes or so to massage my wrist.I would recommend this to anyone who is in the same boat as me, and as soon as this one breaks, I'll be right back for another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality","review":"This is a very sturdy mechanical pencil.

She's pulled on the handle of the oven a few times (and we've told her \\"no\\", which she seems to accept most of the time) and the lock has stayed put. She's tried to operate the lock a few times, and has not been successful at that either. I can see a toddler who is very interested in the lock being able to figure it out, but she has been easily diverted from it.It's held up great, and I don't find it too cumbersome to lock/unlock it whenever I use the oven (which is pretty often - I cook a lot).

I used the oven 2 days later and the sticky adhesive came off. put it back on once the oven cooled. then a few days later my 18 month old toddler tried to get into the oven popped the lock easy. put the piece once again back together. Then about a week later he pulled the door once again when i was cooking and broke the whole lock easily. If i had not been watching him he would have gotten into the oven and got burned.

If you have lightweight venetian blinds with very short cords, this might be useful. I can not wind up enough cord to shorten it enough to keep out of reach. And if I do get it short enough, then when I try to actually open the blinds this thing pops off. they are hard to keep on. Also, if they are within reach of the child, they create a strangulation hazard because they create a loop. I am going to replace these with cleats next to my windows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frusterating!","review":"I am a short mother of active twins. I purchased these in hopes that it would save my blinds from being yanked down. Sadly after the first couple times of using them I realized they were not going to be any help at all. Any time I try to pull the blinds up or put them back down the cord winder pops apart and the two pieces go flying in opposite directions. I can hold onto them till a certain point but then I am to short to do it the rest of the way. Everytime I use them they come apart. Putting the cords in a loose knot is less work and quicker! I can't even get one winds cords to wind up enough for my two 15 month olds not to get ahold of it. It was a great concept but they just didn't pull it off. They need a much better way of locking the two pieces together for them to be even slightly useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"Functional and easy to use. They do the job.

I left a room for 30 seconds and came back to see that my son had pulled the cord down and had it wrapped around his neck. Terrifying. Although these do pop open easily, they most definitely did not pop open from the pressure of a child's neck which I find to be a SERIOUS design flaw. From a company named Safety 1st - back to the drawing board on these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it so much","review":"This product works just as it should. I read some negative reviews, and was a little reluctant to buy it. However, for the safety of my children, I need something to keep the cords out of reach. This was the only thing I could find. So I bought a few packs. If you follow the directions (which is really easy), you should have no problems. It took me a few minutes to get the desired height, but after the first one, it only took me a few seconds to the do the other cords."},{"rating":"2","title":"PC Connection is a MUST","review":"This cable lets you connect your M315 to a PC and expand its capabilities 10 fold.The cable lets you use the proprietary Magellan DataSend CD to customize your selection of world-wide built-in city, highway, airport, tourist or marine database features.You can also link your GPS to PC software like MS Streets & Trips etc to get real-time full-screen lap-top street tracking and route-planning.You can also hook up your GPS to shareware software like OziExplorer and GPS Utility to do some serious off-road trip planning using scanned topographical maps.Having said all this it might have been wise to separate the power and PC cables which make cable management a bit of a wrestling match in the car.But the bottom line is that you're only half-using your GPS if you can't hook it up to a computer - and you're missing a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book has several fatal flaws.

I was not only impress with his playing but with the song arrangements and the feelings he was delivering so sincerely. He sounded like George Benson playing at his best. Two weeks later I was at a car wash when a Lincoln Navigator pulls up beside me blasting the most incredible jazz guitar playing, I asked for the name of the cd and deja vu!! \\"Celebration\\" by Norman Brown.

It truly is a work of art. The projects are breathtaking, the paper quality, printing quality and photography of this book are exceptional.Unlike some of the altered art books hitting the market, Transparent Art's projects/tips/instructions are on the cutting edge of the paper arts industry. After reading this book, I started playing around with transparencies in earnest. The information elevated the quality of my own mixed media art pieces immensely.

The directions are clear and concise and even a novice can do some of these projects. Working with varied mediums such as glass, wood and fabric made the transparent images look different and new.I would recommend this book to anyone who hasn't tried their hand at working with transparencies in their collages or altered art. They will be surprised at how this medium will enhance their art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transparent Art","review":"I loved this book.

You will not be disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Having a mary Heart in a Martha World","review":"Our women's covenant group at a local Methodist church worked with this book for a few months. We found the author's viewpoint to be disappointingly demeaning to women: a very fundamentalist portrayal of women based on their Biblical status vs. contemporary society,and assumptions that we cannot prioritize our lives and work to make room for a relationship with God. The writing style was rather awkward, too: many little personal stories with \\"forced\\" linkages with spiritual messages. The last chapter revealed a probable reason for our frustration: the author states she wrote this book at the age of 37 -- too young to have developed mature coping strategies. We would not recommend the book, due to the biases noted above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to Get Into It: Redundant","review":"I bought this book at a retreat because the title spoke to me. I am a full-time engineer who struggles to find a way to carry God into each work day while still focusing on the hard work at hand. It's been very hard to get into this book because the author repeats herself again and again. There are just too many rehashings of the same thought about Martha's frustration with Mary. I try not to jump ahead in books but with this one I've started skimming to get to the ideas to apply to my own life. I will continue to try this book and come back with a final review."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Love the book.

I have found it to be very thought provoking and inspiring. While the author does point out her thoughts on a deeper inspection of the accounts of Mary and Martha, she has questions for the student that are introspective and, I hope, will prove to be life changing. They make me reassess my priorities and attitudes toward what the world expects of me vs what God expects of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Joanna Weaver's book. Having heard her speak, she brings that same spirit into her writing.Getting caught up in the flurry of everyday living is easy to do. She really spoke to me about slowing down and taking the time to enter into a relationship with God. Many people spend most of their time in a Martha world, Weaver's book helps us to spot those opportunities to be a Mary.

Mary, of course, was the woman in the living room, and Martha was in the kitchen. I appreciated Joanna's willingness to open up her life and provide memorable stories and fresh symbols. For example, she compared picking up the house in the morning with the confession needed in prayer time to keep our spiritual house \\"fresh\\" for God. Women's Bible study groups will find this book targeting many needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great book","review":"This was a wonderful book! I have always loved the story of Mary and Martha, and this book only added to my appreciation of it. I loved how practical Joanna Weaver was in her approach to the story and I loved her heart felt humility in her writing.

It raises a few interesting issues and provides a little information on race and gender relations in the pre-Civil War south, but that's all. As far as the story of Celia herself goes, the author provides remarkably little detail. In fact, I have never read any \\"history\\" with so many admissions that the author doesn't know the facts. Instead, he repeatedly speculates on what likely happened after admitting there is no evidence on the point. And as far as the broader picture of slavery goes, most of it is pretty cusory and often it is simplistic.

I was reluctant to read it--who, as a kid, hasn't heard of the terrible ordeals slaves had to endure? Who hasn't had to read about slavery and abolitionists and Frederick Douglass? I thought it would be the same old thing.I was pleasantly surprised; the author does a fabulous job setting up the historical setting, and shows an appreciation for ALL of the thoughts and feelings of the time period. I was VERY impressed at the author's objectivity--it is easy to get sucked into 21st century pity or anger or blame.The front and back covers of the book make this seem a bit more like a dramatic story, but it's a very detailed historical account that gives wonderful insight into antebellum Missouri and slavery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not charge iPod Shuffle","review":"I bought this product to play \\"white noise\\" on my iPod Shuffle while sleeping at night.Contrary to what's mentioned in some other reviews, the speakers I received did not charge my iPod Shuffle.

These poems by Grady Harp and the beautiful vessels created by Stephen Freedman demonstrate a wonderful collaboration of two people trying to make sense of the death and destruction of so many lives during the Vietnam War. I cried when I read these poems. That's how touched I was. Yes, I was there in 1968 during the Tet Offensive, and know first hand of the suffering that was experienced. However, I can never feel the pain, the helplessness, and the great loss that Grady felt as a doctor in helping these young innocent men face great pain, and even death. My heart goes out to him, and also to others who saved so many lives. They should be very proud, especially Grady.

I'm not exactly sure how many people can just listen to others talk in monotone voices about him for 4 hours though. It does well to make people that put down Kurdt and Nirvana for either no reason, or for something that they heard that someone heard about him/them look ridiculous though.

And the people who were saying that they were the fans of Nirvana seemed to say it just because they wanted to be in the video. PLease, I request you not to buy this video if you like Nirvana.

The DVD consists of a number of interviews with some people that are in one way or the other related to the band, and little bits of footage. Some of the interviewed people were very annoying. One person overanalyzed the bands success way too much. The best bit of the DVD was the photographers stories, and his photography were quite good and interesting.

Many major aspects of Nirvana are not covered, including Kurt's drug problems, the post-Nevermind relationship of the band, and his relationship with Courtney. Furthermore, the documentary contains no actual Nirvana songs. It insults Nirvana fans by having other groups performing their music during the film. If you are just learning about Nirvana, this is not an accurate depiction. Instead I would reccomend \\"Live, Tonight, Sold Out\\" which is not on DVD yet but seems to capture Kurt's vision. \\"Heavier than Heaven\\" by Charles Cross is also an excellent resource to really learn about the man behind the music. Overall this DVD is a brief glimpse of some random Nirvana facts that really big fans may find somewhat amusing. Other than that I can think of no appropriate audience for this terrible documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"this is an unnofficial documentary that has no live performances, and no interviews with anyone worth talking to. all they do is talk to people that LIVED IN THE SAME TOWN as him, and give little random facts about kurt cobain. for christ sake one of the people interiviewed comments on his music and says \\"smells like TEAM spirit\\", WHAT THE HELL?!?? this is the stupidest excuse for a biography i've ever seen.DO NOT BUY THIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winding down the thread","review":"This book was profound, but easy enough to read in a La-z-boy if thats your style. It's a series of short stories all joined by a common thread, the narmada river. Filled with hindu ascetics and Indian playboys, A River Sutra should be the first book you read about India-its kind of like a primer to India's often ignored jungles. This book flows, and its not sketchy like some other writers who write about India."},{"rating":"2","title":"This beautifully written book will open your eyes.","review":"\\"A River Sutra\\", by Gita Mehta, is not only a beautifully written book but is both exciting and moving. The narrator is basically a stander-by as the people he meets tell him the stories of their lives. These stories are interesting within themselves, but put together they show a common theme that the narrator, a man with a relatively uneventful life, sees. He then realizes the mistakes he has made in his life. This book opened my eyes, too, and anyone who reads it will make a pledge to take risks and take control of who they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was interesting but not great","review":"It was interesting because it included different stories from many different people. It was not great because it was composed of different short stories so I could not get into the book as I would have been able to if I were reading a novel. It had an interesting and fun writing style because it was narrated by a person, and in the narration he told the stories of people he met. Every other chapter is a story, and the ones in between are the narrators reflection on the story and what happens next in the narrators life, before he meets the next person whose story is told in the book. Overall it was a very good book, especially for one assigned for my english class."},{"rating":"1","title":"River Sutra","review":"As hard as I tried, I could not get into this book.

The characters are funny and sometimes tragic. The stories not only give insights into love but they also give insights into the Indian culture but the meanings of the stories are universal and are understandable by people of any class, race, or religion. The novel is usually easy to read but some stories force you to reflect to find the true meanings. The narrator is a forgetable character because characters of the different stories steal the show. Whether it is the child musician or the young courtisan, you are drawn to them. Mehta adds little twists to the stories to keep them interesting and you are never sure how the story will end. Even though the book gets a little hard to read at times, it is worth your time to read it. Mehta deserves all the praise that she has been given."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing narrative, two thumbs up!","review":"Collection of short narratives keeping a retired government officer and the Narmada River in the background. Each tale brought out a different flavor of life in India. Very good treatment of the characters and the storylines. Slick narrative, wonderfully woven tales. Strongly recommended for anyone who's interested in Indian life and particularly modern Indian English writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mehta's book combines the universality of goals with India.","review":"A River Sutra is a book that combines the themes of the universality of life and the continuation of life. The book talks about how life goes on and it is illustrated well through the characters and imagery used by Mehta. Because the book is Indian, I can relate to it well.

Important lessons are learned from the characters and the descriptive imagery sparks one's imagination \\"like no other.\\" Good book, if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enchanting little book. Beautifully written.","review":"This book is really a collection of enchanting stories all with an underlying mystical message--which is not always clear--which joins them together.

Ms. Mehta obviously loves writing and her prose is so enchanting and graceful that it reads almost like poetry at times. A sheer joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"What has happened to this author's sparkle? Mehta's first book, Karma Cola was amusing, this novel on the other hand, is deathly dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great book!","review":"The beginning of the book started off pretty slow as the narrator described the landscape around his retreat house. The story of the monk was the story that really got me into the book and made me want to read on. I think the intriguing aspect of the book can be attributed to its riveting stories involving love, sacrifice, suffering, and death; all inevitable aspects of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gita's Good","review":"\\"A River Sutra\\" is the third Gita Mehta book I've read. Previous to this I enjoyed \\"Karma Cola\\" and \\"Snakes and Ladders.\\" As a non-fiction writer, Ms. Mehta is lean, sharp, caustic, and witty. She gets to the heart of the matter, and doesn't hold off on personal opinion. I didn't know what to expect from her fiction, but I was surprised. She seems like a different writer. A gentle side comes through \\"A River Sutra\\" that leaves you feeling deeply for the characters she's created. It's not that the stories are fluff, they're not; it is that she employs a lyricism that was unexpected. The river is the Narmada, one of the holiest in India; and, a sutra is both a thread, and a discourse that constantly unwinds. This aptly named book is a study of love, and another look at India - sometimes fanciful, sometimes frightening, but always warm hearted."},{"rating":"2","title":"enchanting collection of tales","review":"I found A River Sutra to be an enchanting collection of tales incorporating rich language and multiple themes. The unique characters immersed in traditional Indian mythology creates a colorful contrast between the modern and the ancient, the individual and the collective. The format of this book (a collection of short stories within a greater novel) is effective in its ability to convey the metaphor of a flowing river. Each individual story is a gem in itself, conveying tragedy and passion in a delicate blend. Though each story conveys its own individual theme, the narrator is able to use these tales to come to a greater realization about himself and his relation to the world around him. In this way, the reader is also able to use the stories to deduce his or her own theme, whether it be similar or different to the conclusion the narrator came to. Overall, I found this book superb in its ability to effectively incorporate short stories in to a larger novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Helpful Resource","review":"This book is an excellent resource for anyone looking to begin or enrich a daily prayer life ritual. Don Aycock provides reflection on the invitation to prayer, the reason for prayer and the thinking behind some common prayers, such as the Lord's Prayer. The book provides some helpful beginning points for prayer reflection. It is written in an easy to read format and contains beautiful photographic images.

It looks sleek, too, like something Apple could have designed. However, just about everything about it is flawed. Like other reviewers mentioned, this hub will randomly stop and turn back on, causing Windows to detect all the devices being connected repetitively. It's a major hassle to try and copy photos since the hub will 'hiccup' like I mentioned before, corrupting the photo transfer process. I disabled the card reader device in Device Manager because it will add 4 drives to My Computer, for each card slot. Pretty much everything I've ever connected to this hub has given me problems. My HP printer will sometimes stop working because of the hiccup. My Logitech MX700 mouse will stop moving until I disconnect the usb cable and replug it back in. Bluetooth is unstable.

Additionally, if you leave a card in the reader your computer will every so often redetect it and pop up a window. Can get very annoying as it interupts whatever you are doing or wkaes your computer if suspended. Lastly, it has the same pause and restart problem with the USB ports. If you are trying to print through this hub you are in for a tough time.

'Hyperion', 'Carrion Comfort', and 'Song of Kali' are all great books, but this collection of novellas is a total disappointment. I think the problem lies in the fact that Simmons is moralizing here on subjects that he cares about (like the horrors of AIDS) and it's getting in the way of his usual magical style of storytelling. With the story subservient to the moral, we the readers are left to consider Simmons' ethical point of view, which in the case of \\"Dying in Bangkok\\", is downright offensive. It's not hard to understand why this book is out of print. Stick with 'Prayers To Broken Stones' if you want to experience Simmons' shorter works of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I did not enjoy these short stories at all.

I eventually got to many of the places mentioned in his book, and found that the information he had provided was accurate and useful. I spoke with Mr. Mahler just before leaving Guatemala, and am delighted that he included some of my suggestions in this book, including Los Viejitos Restaurant in Nebaj (look for the green door)--the owner told me she used to cook for Nancy Sinatra!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft is important","review":"I'm in the contruction field and have to take pictures from time to time. I bought a Sony T9 digital because of it's size and it's 6 magapix. It cost alot of money and needed to be protected and the Sony LCS-CSG soft case was the right move.

LOL!","review":"This case is obviously NOT made of leather, let alone \\"soft genuine leather.\\" It is clearly made of some kind of very stiff PVC vinyl. You can tell by lifting and examining the stitched covering that is folded over inside the flap. There is no evidence of any cowhide even though the tag inside says, \\"Made in China\\" and \\"Material: 100% piel bovino.\\" I believe that translates to \\"skin of cow\\" but I repeat, this product is widely and FALSELY ADVERTISED as leather. The result is, you're paying as much as thirty dollars for a case that looks and feels like it's made from rare Chinese Vinyl Cows. Could this explain its recent price drop? Incidentally, this case does happen to fit the Sony DSC-T50 quite well, hence my promotion to 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"cyber shot camera carrying case","review":"Very confortable protective case.

With the exception of the uncle who adopted her, Clytie Flower has been disowned by her family on the instructions of the head of family. However, on discovering a betrothal agreement signed by her father and the late Duke of Banglor, between her and the duke's heir, her uncle comes up with the idea of trading the duke an unbetrothal in exchange for the assistance of the dowager duchess in bringing Clytie out. The result is a charming and charmingly funny novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Publisher's Note for the 2007 reprint by Clearfield Publishing:","review":"From the founding of the first official church in 1683, the Baptist Church grew prodigiously in South Carolina. Leah Townsend's superior history of the development of the Baptist Church in South Carolina emphasizes the growth of the Church in the Low-Country, the Peedee Section, Charleston, and the Back Country, and gives a county-by-county breakdown of the various churches, with statistics of members, dates, and names of ministers. Of greatest interest to genealogists are the membership lists of the various associations and congregations which are interspersed throughout the narrative and in footnotes, many of which supply genealogical data of the first rank.

They were completely unlike others that I have used that were very tar-filled, so much so that they are rather difficult to get out from between the two plastic sheets that they came between and leave a bit of tar behind on those plastic sheets.

It has caused me to further question how my country treats people who come from across the border seeking a better life. El Norte was made in the early eighties when I was only a year old. But this film has remarkable relevance today. Have kids like these waited your table or cleaned a room for you or landscaped the plants outside where you work?

Although it is an 80's film, the content and the themes are as timely today as they were 20 years ago. Although the film is mostly in English, Spanish and Quiche (one of the major indian languages spoken in Guatemala) are also used adeptly in the film. This is probably the best film ever made about the immigrant experience in America. It puts the viewer in the place of the illegal immigrant and allows her/him to experience some of the same emotions as the characters, while they struggle to survive in very difficult circumstances. This is an important film, both from a historical and from a sociological perspective, and I highly recommend it for use in the classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, must see","review":"Some might be turned off by this film based on the subject matter, but this is honestly one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. I am so thankful it was finally re-released, and that it made its way on to DVD.This film gives a very real look at not only how illegal aliens from south of the USA border live, but a very real look at the practice of the Guatemalan military on the \\"naturales\\" of genocide. Having been to Guatemala on several occasions, I think of this movie everytime I am there. Do yourself a favor, and at least check this film out. It is somewhat dated, but still worth watching.

However, it should be noted that the movie is rated R for excessive uses of the \\"F\\" word, and other dirty language. Also, sub titles were difficult to read at times since they would blend in with white backgrounds. The movie did not go into great detail about why the Guatamalen siblings were moving north.The movie may help you to see the struggles some immigrants face when they are in truly trying situations. But isn't there some way to do so with less language????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do we really want to discourage kids like this?","review":"I love Snoopy; I loved Charles Schulz's comics. But this book is disappointing in its negative message - it goes too far with the \\"Charlie Brown is a loser\\" message - Charlie Brown's friends all laugh at him when he insists it's good to keep trying (I agree with Charlie Brown - making a mistake or not winning shouldn't be a signal to just give up and never try anything ever again) and he enters the spelling bee. There are no guarantees that something attempted after a failure will end in a success, but Charlie Brown's failure in the spelling bee isn't funny - nor is the way his friends make fun of him - nor is the general message of his \\"loser\\" status: it's completely depressing and the book ends with no hope whatsoever for Charlie Brown to be anything other than a loser...

The kids in this book dread the start of the school year. I don't want my kids to feel that way!

Someone is taking his beloved Peanuts and making products just to make money. I love the Peanuts and I love Charlie Brown and when I saw this book in a department store, I thought, \\"Great, a new Charlie Brown book.\\" Well, this book isn't quite the nut it's cracked up to be. Charlie Brown enters a spelling bee against the protests of his friends. He really thinks he can win, but when he finally gets his moment to shine, he messes up big time. The book ends by basically saying things are hopeless for Charlie. The ending is what really bothered me. Yes, Charlie Brown is a lovable loser, but even when he loses there's always some catharsis; he usually thinks about his loss or talks about it with Linus and the story ends on a note of positivity. Not so here. Peanuts fans are the only people I recommend this book for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, Really!

Sometimes it is hard to open the lock. I loved the 360 degree movement of the middle leg, when combined with Manfrotto 322RC2 it works like a charm. I highly recommend this product who is looking for a affordable Manfrotto with good durablity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well I HAD liked it....","review":"For about two years I had really liked this tripod. Now, I plan to sell it after I fix it.Its rated for 11 lbs??? I just broke two leg angle locks, these are cheap castings and should be machined aluminum, and I am not even sure how they broke. Either me wiggling it in some slush with my weak right hand did it, or else putting my 5 lb view camera on it. Nice that it didn't drop the camera, but that was only because of the rocky bottom of the creek bed holding the legs in place. To be clear, my 2 lbs Feisol has handled my cameras better and my right wrist is so weak I won't even lift a gallon jug with it... how could I possibly have broken TWO of these cheap castings at once without abusing it?I really like the older Bogen tripods. The new stuff just is not built as well. I've had a couple of grand of gear on this thing... I can't do that again, I got lucky that I didn't loose a camera today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogen Manfrotto 190XPROB","review":"A usable unit except that the stem clamping arrangement is poorly designed.

I also like the ways the book indexes the songs. You can look up songs in various ways: by title, artist, and era. It's a treasure and a great resource for my beginning guitar students. Since I'm an experienced guitarist I am not bound to the arrangements. I often add my own harmonization with different chords or I change the chords and/or the key to suit my voice or my students' needs. However, the chording of the songs is quite sufficient as a starting point.

I should haveknown better - it has 500 plus pages and oftentimes two songsper page.For those of you who have difficulty reading small print - Iwear reading glasses - stick with the Hal Leonard fake books which have approximately 200 pages and 100 songs. My favorites are: Easy Fake Book, Broadway Fake Book, First Fake Book, Simplified Fake Book, Easy 60s Fake Book, Classical Fake Book (new edition). They are easy to read and enjoyable. An improvement I would suggest would be a spiral binding.The bigger the book, the more songs, the smaller the print.I understand that this book is for all audiences, but I suggest that about 70% of the songs were minor hits.Katherine BrownWayne, NJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pop fake book","review":"I was more than pleased with this book.

There's such a wide variety.You can't beat a fake book for the number of songs and having one song per page instead of scattered over 5 or 6 pages. This is great for guitar players like myself who don't need the piano music.While there are Chords listed above the lyrics (such as F, Gm, C7, etc.) there are no chord diagrams. So you'll have to either know the chords or have a chord shape/diagram reference. There are only a few songs that have complex chords though. Most songs are simple to play.Great book. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"If you are in the position of having to take requests, this book is a great resource for songs from 1955 to 2000.Having three indexes, alphabetical, by artist and chronological, is a real plus to help find something fast.My only complaint is that the chord symbol font is a bit small and hard to read at times.On the plus side, the layout is well thought out to avoid page turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Twain Remembers","review":"\\"Mark Twain Remembers\\" is one of the best books I have read in quite a while.

We're ushered into the quintessential Ballardian scenario: the microcosmic \\"culture\\" of the wealthy and retired. We quickly learn that all is not well, and follow the quasi-hard-boiled narrator as he succumbs to the community's visceral core. Bloody and provocative, \\"Cocaine Nights\\" is an excellent compliment to Ballard's other \\"landscape\\" novels (\\"Crash,\\" \\"High-Rise,\\" \\"Concrete Island\\"), in which he plumbs the apocalyptic interface between desire and environment, turning the psyche inside-out with the steely objectivity of a lab tech. \\"Cocaine Nights\\" is vintage Ballard psych-noir and won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Crossing frontiers is my profession.\\"","review":"If there's anything crazier than coffee, it's cocaine, and this novel revels in the cultural effects of the hyperstimulant. Hyperstimulation is my middle name, man, and this book'll hit your frontal lobes like a weekend in Vegas with all the pretty lights. The main character goes on a journey from a wild coastal town in Spain to a massive social experiment carried out by a guy who makes Jim Jones (of the Kool-Aid party) seem like just another evangelist. Ballard crosses every frontier, from the boundries of civilization to the borderline of the sane.If you like your books hot and twisted, readRabid: A Novelby Kenyon,Tree of Smoke: A Novelby Johnson,The Pugilist at Rest: Storiesby Jones, andFight Club: A Novelby Palahniuk.The Bookeater!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Club class? More like cruise control...","review":"Not a bad story, with the usual Ballardian ideas. But that is the problem: J.G. Ballard is getting lazy. Okay, so exposing the tedium, the superficiality, the pointlessness of bourgeouis life is the point of his writing (isn't it?)... but Ballard's books are getting more and more similar. This is just Vermillion Sands but less fantastic, Running Wild running on empty (and much less economical and experimental in form). All Ballard's characters, from The Drowned World to Cocaine Nights, are like millenial parodies of people out of a Noel Cowerd play - 'how frightfully dreadful, and pass me another cocktail, darling...'. Ballard is probably right ot say that unfortunately this homogenous, leisured, airport lounge, gated-communities culture is the future in a globalized, Americanized world, but surely there are different ways of approching it than to write the same thing, in the same way, over and over again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work for me","review":"Very disappointing, especially after the rave reviews on the back cover. The book is little more than a vehicle for Ballard's much aired views on suburban alienation. These views are done to death in this book.

This is club class Ballard. You really have to buy it.' Let me tell you, you don't. The 'plot' was completely ridiculous and far-fetched - people are bored so let's set their houses on fire and steal their possessions, then they'll all want to star in porn films and play tennis! Hmmm, logical eh? Not only that, but the dialogue was appalling - I'm yet to meet anyone who talks like the characters in this book, and if I did I would probably tell them to shut up immediately.The back cover also tells me that this was shortlisted for the 1996 Whitbread Novel Award. I can only assume that my book had the wrong cover.This is my first (and last) Ballard novel and I could list you a great many better British writers than him. Save your money.

The music, the artwork, the character development, the roller coaster ride of violence and tenderness - all are carefully thought out and shown with care. This is no anime for the faint of heart. There are scenes that are simply so horrifying and gut wrenching that it may leave an indelible impression that you can't get rid of. This is true of both the violence of the \\"monsters\\", as well as the evil in the hearts of men. At times in the story, you will understand the violence, even expect it- maybe even want it.

My major issue with most novels is that they tend to be very predictable so I end up planning out the climax and ending ahead of time. Then, when my predictions come true, the story seems so much less interesting. I can honestly say that there was nothing predictable about this story. I will admit that it was slow going at first because I found myself slightly confused with the storyline.

Although it is the first product of its director, it is excellent. I have watched it 10 times and at every watching, I felt different things and discovered different and more detailed pictures. Anastasia's soundtrack doubles the beauty of the film. The film basically and efficiently reflects the life in Balcania after (and during) the meaningless war.

It is, first, a stunningly beautiful piece of cinematography. The camera pans natural vistas, churches, London streets, and the faces of the interlocking characters with sensitivity, wisdom, and love. The three parts of the film mesh with perfect paradox, underscoring the recurring theme that time is not a circle. We see the young, the old, the weak, the strong, the living, and the dead all intermingling with an incoherent rap song which blasts from speakers the world over. The pacing is ideal; the plot is ingenious; the message is eternal. BEFORE THE RAIN should be reissued on videocassette and offered on DVD. It moves me as much as any film I've ever seen. Even American high-school students are captivated by it, and that in itself in a small miracle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"This CD and movie seems to generate a lot of controversy...I don't really know why. It WAS a good movie..and I feel it's a great soundtrack...one I never tire of listening to. I remember being a teenager..a young one.. and always loving Babs... but seeing this album cover was mesmerizingly sexy to my young libido! I think Kris and Barbra had great screen chemistry..and there is a lovely simmering sensual quality to all of her acting and singing. And I agree..she does a great comic turn, as well! I almost always cry during the love songs on this CD.

The attempt to update the story and give it a rock theme falls flat.The music, however, is another matter. Barbara Streisand shared the 1976 Acadamy Award for best original song with Paul Williams for Evergreen. The songs and the performances are good. The music can stand on its own, and, in fact, holds up better than the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am captivated by the movie and the music.

Barbra's pseudo rock/pop/diva material is mostly exceptionally well-performed, most of all her lovely simply ballad Evergreen. But in retrospect, it is Kristofferson's melancholy wailing -- remember he was about to hit rock-bottom during the making of this movie -- that has lasting power and angst. I particularly love Crippled Crow and his version of Watch Closely Now. This is a soundtrack worth having as a monumentally well-produced product from the mid-70s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the Movie \\"Snobs\\"","review":"I liked this movie. I don't care if anyone else did. It's a re-make and I'm no expert on the original. I like to be entertained and this movie and its music did. So, I like the CD as well. I will say this: you can listen to the words to the songs and, for the most part, they speak to you. No gibberish (although that's okay sometimes, too.) Lots of hooks, and Streisand is great. I'm not offended by Kris Kristofferson either. Listen to it 3 times and you'll fall in love with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW 2002 REMASTERED VERSION BEST FOR SOUND","review":"The previously remastered version of this Streisand soundtrack was done well, but the 2002 issue sounds even better. Evergreen and Everything never sounded so clearer. Stephen Marcussen who is credted with the remastering, and Stewart Whitmore for the digital editing have done a splendid job on this album, as well as 4 additional Streisand classics, and the new Essention Barbra Streisand set. I hope there are more coming in her catalog with bonus tracks. Both gentleman's names appear in the body of the artwork on the CD tray insert so you know which is the correct edition.

This Bible, though, is absolutely essential to someone who may not have access to commentaries who needs an historically reliable resource. If it seems 'ungodly' it is because its annotations may differ from what your Sunday school teacher taught you. But remember, this Bible will not teach you the doctrine of any one church; it is ecumenical and (gasp!) allows the reader to make decisions for themselves. The annotations are not infallible any more than the NRSV text is. But they are excellent (as is the NRSV translation) and worth looking at for reliable information.If you want a devotional Bible, look elsewhere. This is for the historically-minded individual who is ready to break the bonds of his Sunday school class."},{"rating":"1","title":"HA!","review":"This is a great work of fiction, however it goes on and on in 5th century righting boredom.

Proverbs 30:4, which refers directly to a father/son relationship, not parent/child. This rendering totally obfuscates the allusion to the Messiah. Anyway...The Second Edition is the one to get if you have any respect for the sacred text. Dr. Metzger was the editor and it has balanced commentary. At least the Second Edition acknowledges in 1 Cor 6:9 that the term \\"sodomite\\" refers to a male homosexual. The Third Edition tries to explain away any reference to homosexuality!!? How PC can you get? I want commentary that respects history and the Biblical Author. I can get PC mush on TV all day long.The only reason the Third Edition gets any stars is for production quality and use of the NRSV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this up","review":"Look at other study Bibles like the Concordia Self-Study Bible, before you get this one.

I was raised atheist. My mother knew all the literature of the bible, had learned it at UC Berkeley in the 20's, but remained a non-bliever to her death at age 94 in 1992 of old age.My interest in understanding the bible grew out of my minister's cure for me twice - 12 years apart - of the same cancer that killed Jackie Kennedy in '93.

It is, however, very bad for getting a balanced look at the moderate, conservative, and liberal academic positions.This is a very liberal publication. Don't count on the moderate and traditional views being portrayed accurately or in any good light (if they are portrayed at all).I think that many of the ideas advocated in the commentary are unsubstantiated and often remarkably far-fetched. Sometimes the positions offered have been shown to be false more than twenty-five years ago! This is why I give it a 1 out of 5.I recommend the purchase of the Navarre Bible (a commentary series). There you will find balanced, sensible, in-depth, and up-to-date commentary. It uses the more universally accepted RSVCE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of info but most Christians need not apply","review":"There's lots of historical info here, true. Some good outlines of the backgrounds of the books of the Bible and some nice essays at the end. The Protestant canon of the OT is supplemented by the Catholic and Orthodox Deuterocanonicals.The problem? This \\"bible\\" is loaded with unbelief. To a man, the \\"scholars\\" involved come from a radical theological background. They pretty much seem to doubt that any of the Biblical books were written by who they claimed to be. They attack the Bible's clear teaching on moral issues (e.g. homosexuality) and then try to explain them away with equivocation that would make Bill Clinton say \\"Enough!\\". Since the notes attack the ideas of inerrancy and infallibility left and right, most will be offensive for anyone from an Evangelical, Fundamental, or Traditional Catholic/Orthodox background; therefore, most of the Christian world will have little use for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised Customer","review":"Great Bible - purchased for class but was pleasantly surprised by the large font type and great resources in the back(i.e. essays, maps, etc).

I was shocked at the level of hostility shown in the editorial comments of that series. This edition of the NSRV places these passages predominantly in the light of the gentiles' then-common practice of temple prostitution and sexual idol worship, which scholarly research has shown to be more reflective of that time and culture.With this translation, Bible study and research is a joy and comfort, and something I look forward to each day.

Save your time and money on this one....unless you are only looking for the \\"Bling bling\\" and could care less about it actually holding bags that you are going to need in the future.

One of the best!","review":"Facing a most important and crucial crossroads in his life, Costner examines his past experiences all during the course of what many believe to be his final game (at least for the Tigers).

It is a very touching movie, well written and well made."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I love Kevin Costner. I hate this movie. I wish this movie was about baseball. Instead it is mainly an extremely boring love story. There is no chemistry between Costner and milk toast Travolta, whatever her name is. Their romance is dull. I didn't much care about what happened to anybody in this movie. The only compelling character was Costner's and everytime he got back around Ms. Boring, I didn't care what happened to him either.

This is a wonderful movie to watch. Kelly Preston and Kevin Costner do really great jobs of playing their roles in this movie, but more importantly the storyline is really well done. Costner plays an aging professional pitcher at the end of his career. On the last game he pitches, we see not only what is going on in his mind as a professional pitcher, but also flashbacks of his career over the years and his on again/off again romantic relationship with Preston's character.

I am a baseball fanatic, so I may be a little biased. I knocked it down from 5 stars to try to compensate for this. The story is good, and well told. The use of flashbacks is excellent. The acting is more than adequate. It really captured the essence of baseball very well, and its place in an American's life. It represented the book well. If you are looking at this as a baseball movie...go get Bull Durham, or The Natural. This is really a love story. I love for a woman, and a love for baseball. It is also the story of modern Americans. To Billy Chapel, his work is his life, and he realizes that as his baseball career is coming to a close, he in a sense is dying. While he remembers his successes, he cant help feel like a failure.Overall, it deserves a watch...but realize that baseball is the mechanism through which the love and life story is told, so it is not a pure baseball movie.

The love story is cliched as hell, but some will enjoy it. The baseball scenes are good, but the players just didn't seem like major leaguers to me. Also, I found the announcers at the game (Vin Scully and someone else) kind of annoying. Their banter just didn't ring true.Costner's performance is marginal. One of the central plot elements is his character's balance of the two loves of his life--Preston's character and baseball. Baseball has always been the clear number one, but he finally realizes during his final game as a player that, hey, maybe he does have room for a woman. Convenient timing there, Kevin!If the movie was around 1:30 long it would have been a whole lot better. The simple plot just didn't support a two hour plus run time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do It","review":"This bleak excuse for a movie should be banned, as should the bulk of Costner's recent \\"work.\\" Bad writing, bad acting.

With this he falls somwhere in between.When on the mound he is the pure image of a major league ballplayer dealing with everything from heartache to a bum arm. But in the so called romantic or serious scenes he falls a bit short. The story itself is what drew me to the movie. If your a baseball fan you'll love the atmosphere that is created throughout the picture but if not it may drag out a little to long and lose a little thrill towards the end of the game.

The movie is less a baseball movie than a relationship movie, and not a very interesting one at that. Although the movie has a few interesting moments, such as a compelling scene where Costner \\"gets in the zone\\" to pitch and turns off the crowd noise around him, most of the movie was pure oversentimental drivel.As I recall, I fast forwarded through about the last 30 minutes of the DVD, hoping, praying that the film would somehow redeem itself with something interesting to watch.

This is the biggest waste of talent that I've encountered in quite a while - Sam Raimi, Basil Poledouris, those two are among the best in their professions. And what did they do? Well, let me put it this way: They took a popular sport, took every energy out of it (the Baseball-scenes are repeated endlessly, same style, again and again), added some of the worst dialogue ever and put a romance at the center of the story. That ain't so bad, but there's no chemistry between Costner and Wright-Penn. I could go on, but you get the point. At the end, you're happy it's over. No climax, just a needless 'happy end'. Sam Raimi used to be such a good director, and even in his lesser movies, he had his style. There's no style here. A flop, financially and critically, Sam Raimi move on... and give us a good 'Spiderman'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Costner Was Right","review":"Kevin Costner was right. He fought bitterly with Universal to release the original cut of the movie, but lost to bean counters that were afraid of an overlong movie. I just saw the DVD and the deleted scenes, that can finally be seen, make for a much more complicated and moving story. Particularly the subplot with his coach's wife's struggle with cancer and when his friend on the Yankees came in to congratulate him and say goodbye. Those were the scenes that made these characters real and took down the wall of \\"just baseball\\" and made it a satisfying drama. \\"For Love of the Game\\" is a fine film that will hopefully be seen from now on with these important scenes included."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surefire suspense mystery","review":"The Hardy Boys yet again get caught in a super thriller that almost cost them their lives.

A must for a Wheelbuilder."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT clearly written for average readers","review":"This is a terribly-written book. Sections of it are utterly incomprehensible for average readers who don't already understand the structural mechanics of a bicycle wheel. Although I agree with the author's preference for traditional wheel-building, I'd prefer it be written in simpler-to-understand language and include more practical concepts. For example: should I build a wheel with 32 or 36 spokes? He never makes this clear. How do I choose proper spoke lengths? He gives an equation on page 127 that seems impractical or unclear how to apply in actual use. (Am I really supposed to measure flange hole diameter and \\"effective rim diameter\\" and apply an equation using sine and cosine of the \\"spoke angle\\" when elsewhere he mentions, but never explains, a \\"reference table\\" of spoke lengths?)I'm an average reader who just wants to learn to build wheels.

I have two other wheelbuilding books, but this is the one I return to. It isn't all that friendly to the casual reader, it's a bit textbook like. What really maters is building solid wheels, and that is only a small part of the book. The title is accurate, but do most people care about bike wheels, or do they simply want to build good wheels. You decide.I agree about the wheel tacoing advice. I wrote Jobst about that, and he seemed to believe it wasn't applicable to today's stiffer rims, and the widespread use of tension gauges and factory spec.My only reservation is that so much of this info is online today. I build wheels infrequently, and it is a combination of Seldon's lacing diagrams, Jobst stress relief methods, and factory specs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to build wheels?

Originally, I bought it so I could connect an old VCR (which had RCA or coax output only) to a flat-screen TV (Sharp Aquos). I wanted to use the inputs in the back which means I couldn't use a RCA video connector since the RCA video input on the Sharp is on the side of the TV. I thought I'd just use the RCA to S-Video adapter... but the picture came out so bad, I couldn't believe it. I thought it might be the output from the VCR but when I plugged the RCA video connector directly into the RCA video input on the side of the TV, the picture looked fine.Perhaps using it as an S-video to RCA works better...

The manual explains that if your TV or receiver only has a single 'ANT IN' connection (and not separate UHF/VHF inputs, as you may remember seeing on some ancient TVs), then you either have to buy a band combiner (at least $7 incl shipping--search Amazon for 'splitter combiner') or manually switch the screw connections when you change channels.Most DTV channels are on UHF, but standard TV is still largely on VHF in my area, so I returned this item to Amazon.

Save your money and time and buy another novel instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've been a short story","review":"The Coming takes place later this century in a world wracked by social change. A scientist in Gainesville detects an approaching spaceship, and the news causes some upheaval, though not as much as might be expected. Nothing new, it would seem, but Haldeman keeps the focus almost entirely within Gainesville: very little of the action takes place outside the university town. The novel feels stretched out: it probably would have made a fine short story, but as a novel it left me thinking, \\"This is it? This is all we get?\\" Without giving away the ending, it's not a particularly satisfying one. Haldeman doesn't really explain the why of the plot. In fact, the plot feels like just so much baggage while he expounds on a few social themes, like the criminalization of homosexuality and the implications of real traffic control. In the end, Haldeman has many interesting ideas (as always) but it was stretched out far too long. He's a fine author with lots to say - just not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great narrative style, great vision, let down ending","review":"Joe Haldeman is one of the few authors whose books I will buy in hardback without a second thought. \\"The Forever War\\" remains one of my top 2 or 3 favorite books of all time, in all genres.This book shows him growing still as a writer, not afraid to experiment with style.The story flows from one character to the next in a seamless way: the section transitions are usually continuous with the focus and the action merely shifting to another character in the scene. This is extremely well done, and holds your interest well. It also advances the plot nicely.His vision of life in the near (~50 years hence) future is well realized. It is easy to believe that people will live just like this.Sadly, the ending seems to be just tacked on. It is a letdown. For a book focused on the \\"Coming\\" of aliens, I expected a bigger bang, but got only a fizzle.Summary: read if you're a Haldeman fan, but wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Soap Opera","review":"Well, all those people who have relentlessly beat the \\"character development\\" drum...I hope you're happy. Here we have yet another good SF author serving up a book packed with nothing but \\"character development\\", and it's boring as hell. No scientific concepts here to speak of, and very little thoughtful extrapolation--just a whole lot of slice-of-life style narration. If I want to immerse myself in the mundane details of average people's lives I CAN DO THAT FOR REAL. No book needed.This book has no business being listed under the SF category. As for the 5-star reviewers, I suggest you give in and try the romance aisle next time. Really, you'll be happier there. And maybe SF fans can stop seeing their favorite authors write books like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Interesting from the first till last page.

It's possibly the most (accidentally) intriguing aspect of this novel.Haldeman is a brilliant writer - I've read The Forever War and the Worlds Trilogy so many times, the books fell apart in my hands. This one isn't in the same league. For one thing, we almost - but don't quite - bond with the characters, in part because too many points of view are offered. The female protagonist's relationship with her husband is left unexplored, though as depicted it elicit too many nagging questions to be left alone. The response of the citizens of earth to the possible approach of an alien craft are quite hollow.Haldeman at his best draw us in with vibrant, lovable characters (like Marianne O'Hara from Worlds and Mandella from The Forever War. He could have done that here with a longer, more detailed book, but it didn't quite happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED!","review":"Very disappointed. This was supposed to be about aliens coming to visit the Earth. This was supposed to be Science Fiction. This was very boring. This novel is very little about science fiction, (ok it is set in the future), but more about how the city of Miami and apparently the whole world has become utterly depraved and run by minor mafia hit men. The big surprise ending doesn't land with a bang but fizzles before it gets there.

Mr. Haldeman had always been able to tell a great story without resorting to explicit descriptions of sexual acts and repeated crude profanity. I guess he had to use these tactics to disguise the fact that he didn't have any concepts to stimulate scientific speculation. I kept hanging on, hoping it would improve, but it only got worse. If I wanted this kind of drivel, I would just buy the latest best-selling technothriller at Costco.

(Other than a sprinkling of gushing praise, probably from the publisher). The more interesting question is \\"Why?\\". Other reviewers have advanced various theories. My guess would be either that it was done on a bet or as a joke for us, the great unwashed herd of SF-consumers. In any case, the characters, plot (such as it is), sub-plots, themes, build-up, ending and \\"science\\" are a collection of random accidents that go absolutely nowhere. Maybe that's the point? There is a coded message in it somewhere? Or maybe it's the beginning of an entirely new genre and someday will be hailed as an all-time classic: \\"Plan Haldeman From Outer Space!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful novel, avoid!","review":"Too many characters, the author should have focused on the scientist instead of trying to create so many useless characters.

If you want to read about maffiosi or problems of homosexuals - there are better books for that. I like most of Haldeman's books, this one is his weakest."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice original format, but very short on science","review":"I gave the book a couple of stars because the presentation is very original -- we get to hop around between various persons and their points of view as the alien visitation is approaching. It creates a dynamic flow that keeps you with the story. However, the story itself is lacking. It's bigger on sex and blackmail than it is on science. I was hoping for something that discussed more of the characters feelings towards the alien arrival, but what you get is just a bunch of uninteresting personal side-stories about who's had affairs with who. The book also loses a star for having the characters speak a dialog that is a mixture of spanish and english. The author probably has a point here -- English will continue to absorb spanish words, but the effect is distracting and just didn't work for me. Lastly, the ending seemed rushed and poorly thought out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all in English","review":"While I greatly enjoyed reading Haldeman's Forever trilogy and Worlds trilogy, reading the first 30 pages of The Coming was a toil. About every tenth word is in a different language. I have no idea what langauge (if any, it could be giberish) he is using. I speak fluent Latin, Italian, and Russian, but I didn't recognize any of the non-English ones. Imagine trying to read a book with random words blacked-out. It's that bad. I gave-up after 30 pages, and I can't ever remember not finishing a book I started. Unless you're willing to spend time researching other languages to trackdown meanings of words Haldeman uses, don't bother with this one. Your time is much better spent reading the Worlds trilogy.z"},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick easy and very very light read.","review":"It is difficult to believe that the author of this novel won the Hugo and Nebula Awards and that he won them twice. \\"The Coming\\" isn't much of a novel. If you are really into science fiction this novel is not for you. It is futuristic to some degree but is very light on aliens and space travel and such. In fact, it is pretty light on story as well. \\"The Coming\\" is really more about politics, government and relations between people and set in the not so distant future.

For those of you who've just stepped off a plane from outer Mongolia, or some other sufficiently isolated place that you're unfamiliar with the \\"Dilbert\\" books, the basic concept is that they are collections of newspaper comic strips dealing with life in corporate America; the characters generally resonate with anyone who's had to work in a modern office and deal with the foolishness foisted on employees by clueless bureaucrats and other bosses.Any \\"Dilbert\\" book is worth reading; this one is one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"More American than English","review":"The key word in the title \\"American Heritage Dictionary\\" is American.

This diffuses the work, rather than complements it.What it lacks in etymology and usage, it tries to make up in presentation. The result is disappointing. As a dictionary, it lacks the substance and authority of either Oxford or Merriam Webster.On the plus side, it is reasonably \\"up to date,\\" and has some useful appendices.

There are three worthwhile chapters: Mistakes, Masters, and Contemporary Affairs. The other 30 percent of the book is entertaining, but not particularly enlightening. The cartoons did not add anything to the content. If you are contemplating an affair, the author provides some good common sense rules of thumb (don't leave receipts for sexy lingerie lieing around) but does not provoke thought or insight.

This was his comeback outing and it is a stylized erotic journey that would have been grossly misplaced outside NYC. These are New York characters. No other way to describe them, no other need to. Harold Becker is an under rated American director and this is best best work since THE ONION FIELD (1979). The music is seductive (save for 3 versions of the title track). And wickedly sexy Ellen Barkin literally works off with the film when she meets Pacino in a West Side supermarket wearng only a trenchcoat and heels. It was enough to make me shop there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Remember Sea of Love","review":"I've watched it many times and never get tired of it. \\"Sea of Love\\" is one of few films where Al Pacino is very sexy, and it is adds to the film's many pleasures. The rest of them are - well constructed story of a New York Homicide cop (Pacino) attracted to a mysterious blond woman with a charming crooked grin (Ellen Barkin - talented, sexy and underrated actress) who may or may not be a serial killer. The chemistry between Pacino and Barkin is powerful and undeniable and the love scenes between them are among the best and most memorable ever filmed. John Goodman is very good as Pacino's partner and friend and yes I love the soundtrack and the title song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pacino At His Best","review":"Four years after the dismal failure of \\"Revolution\\" in 1985 Al Pacino made a remarkable comeback with SEA OF LOVE. Pacino again plays his charcter with such raw intesity and creditbility it's no wonder he remains one of the elite in Hollywood. Pacino plays a NYC cop who's burnt out both mentally & professinaly when he investigates what could be a femaile serial killer killing men who take out personal dating ads shot in the back of the head in bed. as the story delvops pacino falls for the prime suspect Played by Ellen Barkin. The passion scenes between pacino and barkin are intense as is the storyline as it builds and comes to an explosive climax. The supporting cast in the film is great especally John Goodman who plays Pacino's partner is often quite funny in scenes of the film. An enjoyable little thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"VALENTINES PICK......","review":"Today is Valentines day friends (ewwwwww...) and I heard the song (Sea of Love) on the radio this morning, which made me think of this pretty great movie from 1989.

He goes undercover, checking out all of the singles that could possibly be the killer.He ends up falling for the one that ends up being a very likely potential, Ellen Barkin (wowza) .. and this turns into a very great romantic thriller, with alot of steamy situations...worth the rent...with or without a date you will enjoy...;your welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Romantic Thriller","review":"My three favorite romantic thrillers are \\"Vertigo\\" \\"Body Heat\\" and \\"Sea of Love\\". Screenwriter Shane Black got a cool million for the script and it's easy to see why. The story structure of this search for a woman who's killing men she meets via personal ads is tops.When Al Pacino falls in lust with a possible suspect the suspense builds with each scene. And each scene on it's own is entertaining. This is one of Pacino's best roles and the supporting cast shines as well.It's movie makiing at it's best and not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Entertaining","review":"Al Pacino, Ellen Barkin and John Goodman are all so entertaining to watch that I've always enjoyed this film no matter how many times I've seen it.The suspense is what this film is all about, but I am fascinated with these actors, including supporting performances by Michael Rooker and William Hickey. Although her looks are a little hard and her mouth way too profane, Barkin never looked better and sexier. That Pacino's character, \\"Detective Frank Keller\\" would fall for her is understandable.However, adultery, once again is excused in this film along with other not-so-moral acts so this isn't a film you want to show to your church group. All three of the leads are very weak, ethically-speaking.The fact that this film can go on for almost two hours with very little action and still keep you riveted to your seat speaks highly of its entertainment value. Why national critics knocked it so much, I don't know. Hey, it's good entertainment. What more do you want?"},{"rating":"2","title":"i think it was great/ i loved it","review":"Al Pacino was great along with Ellen Barkin. the movie was interesting and kept me in suspense.

Pacino plays a NYPD detective who falls in love with Ellen Barkin, a woman who's the main suspect in a murder case he's investigating. The mix of suspicion, fear, and sexual arousal is enough to keep the most jaded viewer riveted to the screen, wondering who or what will break first. The chemistry between Pacino and Barkin is intense enough to make the love scenes qualify as some of the hottest of the era.Super-duper in every way. Wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - full screen version cropped to fit widescreen","review":"This version (Collector's Edition)is worse than the previous pan & scan full screen version.

I have both the old video and DVD of this film, I would have to say that the video release has a better picture quality than the DVD! The DVD looks grainy, washed out, faded colors and to top it off it is in full screen, and is single layered. Shame Universal Studio's for putting out a DVD of such substandard DVD quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is scene with Lorraine Bracco?","review":"In the network TV version of this film there is added footage showing Lorraine Bracco as Pacino's ex-wife confronting him at the police station. She is sick and tired of his harassing her and her new husband, and the information she gives Pacino is a release for him. It changes his actions toward them and makes him emotionally free to pursue Ellen Barkin.Aside from Bracco's terrific performance in this small role but important scene, there is definitely a gap without this footage. Why not add it to a new release? I would buy it in a second and rate it 5-stars without a doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suspense","review":"I enjoy this movie so much I've watched it over a half a dozen times.

It's every bit as bad as it sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheesy book","review":"I love my Conan books, but this one is horrible.First, it's just plain cheesy. The writing - descriptions, point of view, etc. - is elementary. The descriptions are pathetic and vague: \\"The Kralix was one of a kind... It most resembled a thing that might have been born of wolf, bear, and toad, had the three somehow mated together...\\" (p. 124) The plot is predictable. There's no suspense, nor are the characters materially different. The point of view is ineffective, given that everyone thinks the exact same things. The repetition is almost unbearable.Even a marginal editor could have reduced it by a third by tightening the grammar, eliminating repetition, and rewording the descriptions to be more descriptive and precise.Oh, and despite having to read about it a few times, you never do get an image of a wolf/bear/toad."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!!!","review":"OMGosh: I saw this on Dr, Oz and while I know he is always clear that he is not endorsing any products on his Show, I assumed SAFE.

First and foremost, a recipe book should make a person salivate as they look through it. The pictures lack clarity and good lighting, and the book's design is almost too simple. That being said, the author does have some really good ideas and tips for making up your own recipes. Think of these recipes as very rough guides, just waiting to be tweaked to your own personal tastes. Her dips, pates, and marinara sauces are delicious though, and in my opinion they make buying the book worthwhile. Just don't rely on it to be your main sourcebook. I should also probably mention that the author isn't as picky as other raw chefs about most of her ingredients being raw. One of her soup recipes is actually cooked. On a sidenote, most of her dessert recipes call for avocados, so if you're allergic to them, like me ( oh, the pain!), you'll have to do some adjusting or just find different recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life-Changing Book!","review":"I LOVE Jenny's new book!

Maybe we just have the same taste. For instance, many raw foodists make a mock chocolate cake with walnuts, raisins, and carob, a combination that makes me ill. Cornbleet makes this instead with walnuts, dates, carob, and vanilla, and making that change is a stroke of genius.Also, the recipes are not complicated and don't take a long time to make. (Raw Food/Real World, for instance, has gorgeous pictures, but the recipes are so labor-intensive I never feel like attempting them.)The only downside is that because the recipes are supposed to be for \\"1 or 2 people\\", I always have to double or quadruple the amounts if I want more than a single serving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbook whether you eat a raw or cooked food diet!","review":"Excellent cookbook.

There are some color photos, nicely done, that add to the overall quality of the book.I did see one rating with three stars because they are a pro cook and the cookbook was \\"easy\\". Please view that as an isolated opinion since the cookbook never suggests that it is gourmet therefore why discredit it for being easy and simple.Give it a try - I think you will really enjoy the food you create!

So be prepared to add some of your own ingredients for more flavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!!","review":"I own many Raw Food recipe books and this one is one of my favorites.

There are lots of very easy recipes. Although, some are a little too easy (such as \\"apple juice\\" - take four apples and juice them), there are many that are fantastic. The author uses a lot of nuts in her recipes taking this uncookbook well beyond salad. The best part is the list of pantry items and weekly grocery list that, when combined, allow you to create nearly any recipe in the book. So far, every recipe I've tried has tasted absolutely fantastic.

It has lots of easy to follow recipes that I would not have thought of. Vegan diets are very beneficial for the environment compared to meat diets so it makes good sense to reduce the amount of meat and animal products we consume and palce a lot more emphasis on plant based diets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Easy......","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. The number of \\"recipes\\" having only one or two ingredients was ridiculous. I mean, Lemonade: 4 lemons; Carrot Juice: 6 carrots. I would think a professional could get a little more creative than that. I also found it annoying that the photos in the book were placed no where near the recipe they depicted. Bottom line, I was so put-off by the number of \\"non-recipes\\" in the no-cook cookbook that I returned it. I also just got The Raw Food Detox Diet and Rawvolution and both of those are excellent so far and are much more creative and helpful to a newbie raw foodie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not great","review":"I've had this book for about a month, and I've made many of the recipes. They were all very good. But, as someone who does not only eat raw food, I find myself drawn to the recipes for things like guacamole and olive tapenade, which I could find in a lot of other books.I was also really disappointed that so much of the book is devoted to useless recipes for smoothies and salads. Who actually needs to follow a recipe for a garden salad? And the recipe for the cantaloupe smoothie can be boiled down to \\"cut up some cantaloupe and stick in it a blender\\". Duh.Still, I'm going to give the book 4 stars. There are a fair amount of creative recipes in here, and they are all pretty easy. I really like the fact that all the necessary equipment and ingredients can be found at my local grocery store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood Memories","review":"This album has been played in my house at Christmas since I was little.

As Conrad tracks down these people he finds that so far all but one is dead. In digging a little deeper, Voort finds himself the target of some very dangerous and unsavory characters. This particular book didn't hold as much interest for me as his first two because it was focused largely on military/government, but as far as the actual storyline and plot, it was a little more intricate than Black's other books and very well written. Black is proving to be a top-notch novelist. I will definitely continue to read books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sammo's masterpiece!","review":"This ranks as one of Sammo's absolute best and certainly his best self-directed film. Everything in the film is top-notch; in fact the only reason this will never get the global recognition of the alleged film intelligensia is that Sammo dares put in action. That action though is some of the best to come out of Hong Kong. The performances are excellent throughout the cast and the mixture of action, comedy and tragedy has rarely been equalled.

I don't understand how people thought this book was romantic. They meet and marry within 1 day, after having no more than 15 words with each other. Then in the first 50 pages, they lie to each other, one is accused of murder, and then they run away together to avoid the situation. The hero seems more like a boy than a man, while the heroine is par to say the least. Also, the dialogue between the characters is boring. The only good dialogue is when the heroine stands up for herself to another woman. I've read many many romance novels, and this one did not deserve a 5 star rating in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avid Romance Fan","review":"I agree with the comments of the reader from Boston. I only gave this book a one-star rating because there was no option for no star. This book was so boring I finally threw it down in digust, unable to finish it. That is rare for me as I feel compelled to finish what I begin. The characters are one-dimensional; the dialog is trite. The writing is simplistic, to say the least. There was nothing to hold my interest. It almost seems that the author created this as an outline, and then forgot to fill in the details with character development, an interesting story line, etc. This is the first book I have read by this author, and suspect it will be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tubular 15 watt bulbs","review":"Received the product in time and it was just exactly what I needed.

Qué te paso Gustavo ? Acaso evolucionaste demasiado que ya no te podemos entender ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cerati: el del oido bionico","review":"Ciertamente, es indudable que Gustavo Cerati es quien lleva la antorcha de la modernidad del pop en español. Su amplio oido recibe, quizás, demasiados estimulos para luego pasarlos por el fino tamiz de sus canciones. Prueba de ello es la gente que lo rodea alrededor de este trabajo: su colega Flavio Etcheto (otrora excelente trompetista, hoy maquinista infernal de Trineo y copiloto de Ocio junto a Cerati), Pablo Schanton bajo pseudonimo y Leo Garcia, la promesa del pop argentino (mal que me pese). Bocanada nos quita el aliento. ¿Cómo pudo un sólo disco contener desde referencias al easy listening, pasando por techno carnavalitos, refinado funk, excursiones electrónicas y aguerridas canciones pop, no resultar un mero catalogo de caprichos?. Solo este tipo puede hacerlo, y bien."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bocanada revew From TijMex","review":"Muy buen disco, uno de los mejores temas para mi es \\"y si el humo esta en el foco\\" , Vervo carne tiene excelentes arreglos orquestales muy bien ensamblados con la percusion electronica, felicidades Alejandro Teran, los arreglos son dignos de cualquier orquesta Londinense y Raiz, algo pocas veces visto, hecha solo con acordes menores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Esto le hubiera gustado a Anita, la chilena :)","review":"Hay temas que parecen estar escritos para Anita, la más fanática de Gustavo Cerati, y que gracias a él pude conocer... Una vez más gracias Gustavo, y espero que lo disfrutes Ani, donde quieras que estes... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good","review":"For those who don't speak Spanish, don't worry! Music is the universal language, and Gustavo speaks it fluently. Now freed from the constraints and expectations of Soda Stereo, Cerati folds all kinds of interesting influences into this revelatory disc. Many of the songs are somewhat progressive in sound or structure, yet they all go down smooth thanks to great melodies and Cerati's exquisite voice. This is highly recommended.If there are English speakers who want to hear some wonderful rock (which just happens to be sung in Spanish) start here. Then proceed to the last few Soda Stereo releases (Cancion Animal and later), Cerati's Amor Amarillo, La Barranca, Santa Sabina, and Jaguares. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"bossa nova to new age","review":"a very cool CD, starting off with bossanova influenced music, thro some later soda stereo style music to the rarified outserspace music ideas of Cerati. Its a laidback CD, that grows with every listening. Very pervasice music, full off little details that may be hidden at first. Its like a journey that gets increasingly insane and wild, in a positive sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuando la sensualidad se hizo musica","review":"Un disco maravilloso, tal vez uno de los mas preciosos que he escuchado hasta hoy. Un intento exitoso de capturar el lado sensual del amor, del cual CERATI nos ofrece ilustraciones cada una mas preciosa que la otra.Una poesia, un hechizo, una musica delicada y extraordinariamente compleja ; un mundo aparte que lo envolvera y llevara su corazon hacia otras realidades... Hacia una dimension donde el contacto de piel, donde las miradas, donde este increible sentimiento de ligereza del amor se hizo musica...Y si de casualidad tienen la suerte de estar con su pareja al escuchar este disco veran que solo les llegara una palabra para expresar la noche que pasaran : MARAVILLOSA, al igual que la musica de este disco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Che","review":"Cerati is an absolute genius.

Gorilla of Antivirus software, but I think more and more people are realizing that bigger does not mean better!The old days when Peter Norton made an excellent antivirus program are long gone, and these days Norton is just a mass produced product of Symantec's.Customer service is through an Internet Database, and you must pay over $40 just to speak with someone even when Norton lets you down and lets a virus slip in. The biggest problem is that this program is a huge hog of system resources. It is no wonder that the ratings are so poor on Norton these days.

Once upon a time, Norton was the epitome of well-designed, thoughtful, customer-centric software, but they've degenerated into outsourced hacks trading on a well-established name.

The walkthrough is detailed enough but not too complex, and the overall package is very simple and easy to read. The controls are all very accurate (even though they are for the PC), and Roberts knows what he's talking about. If you buy one Tomb Raider guide, make it this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK REALLY STINKS","review":"ON LEVEL LONDON - Aldwych there is suppose to be 5 secrets and the book only list 4. I've also notice other area of problems as well. I'm wondering how many other problems will present themselves from this half baked book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Embarrasment to Reggae","review":"I bought this disk on the strength of the reviews here at Amazon. What a major disappointment this disk is. Embarrasingly amateur, with keyboard loop drums and keyboard basses, it is difficult to believe that these are well-known professional reggae singers as well. Another case of \\"dumbing-down\\" music for children, something definitely not required to fully engage kids with music (the outstanding Putamayo series for example is presented no frills, no dumbing-down). Good \\"children's music\\" inspires both parents and kids, and kids react positively to that in their parents. A shame to pay $... for this disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great expectations, dashed","review":"After reading the reviews, I anticipated a rollicking good time but was left sorely disappointed. Now I'm not a reggaephile, college being 15 yrs ago, but the arrangements here are thin, lifeless, and sound as if they were mixed with a 1985 Casio Mix-Master. If you're thinking \\"Great, Legend for Kids\\", think again.Here's my advice: Leave this fellow to the side and go with Garcia/Grisman Not For Kids Only, Doc Watson's Songs for Little Pickers, Gemini (Anything) or any of the Woody Guthrie children's CDs.My other piece of advice to establish my bona fides with other parents: Aquaphor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this: many better alternatives for children and reggae!","review":"I am deeply disappointed with this collection. The tracks chosen are neither the best for children, nor for reggae as a whole. You get many songs not sung in English--sung in Jamaican creole, and many with a some sound. I think you're FAR better off looking at almost ANY reggae from the 1960s (and some from the 1970s too).Let me list a few: Desmond Dekker, Toots and the Maytals, and of course Jimmy Cliff. Look at buying instead This Is Reggae Music--the first two cds are great for kids! If you're on a budget try \\"Reggae Up! 40 Classic Reggae Cuts.\\" Despite the nice packaging a promise of children's reggae, this album is poorly executed and a waste of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned this","review":"I returned this item - something I rarely do. I was very disappointed in this chess set, even though it was purchased for a child. The playing surface is heavy grade paper, but not coated in any way. It is sure to be damaged in no time since it also serves as the exterior of the case. The cheapest checker/chess sets come with coated paper surfaces. The pieces were plastic, the wood box itself was pretty cheaply constructed. Although I only paid $30, I've seen beginner sets in much better quality with wood pieces on wood boards for the same price. Overall, not at all worth the $$. Skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so healthy!","review":"Yes this is a book of raw vegan, multi-ethnic recipes but that does not necessarily mean the recipes are healthy! Quite to the contrary, even though the editorial reviewers tout how \\"healthy\\" this collection of recipes is, I was personally shocked to see how very high fat practically every recipe is! True, many of these recipes are interesting and different, some are standard and usual, but all seemed to be based on an inordinate amount of nuts, seeds and oil and also represent very poor food combining. This is not healthy daily fare but very rich raw foods which should be enjoyed in moderation and on special occasions only, if at all.To its credit I have to say that it is a nice, organized, well written book with a few pretty and appealing pictures but overall I do not find it to be a very useful book or one I would want to keep in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The raw and the living unveiled on the plate","review":"Learn how to prepare raw and living food with a book which covers fresh foods 'still growing'.

While all the stories had potential to go interesting places, each was over in what felt like about three minutes. They weren't even digitally remastered (the preview was). While I found it interesting, I don't see it provoking much conversation in Bible groups, and the pastor's filmed introductions were just boring and redundant.C'mon, Christian film industry!

Try harder!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Of The 'Relentless' Series","review":"This is a rough film, make no mistake, but it's very interesting all the way and he best of the \\"Relentless\\" movies. It has many of the same elements the two other films had: some grisly scenes, rough language but a fast-moving film which really goes fast considering it's only 80-some minutes long.Leo Rossi once again stars but I liked his partner (Robert Costanzo) much better. William Forsythe once again plays a creepy killer. He seems to be typecast. The female lead is someone I haven't seen before or since: attractive Signy Coleman.I did get confused a couple of issues such as how the detectives figured a few things out and that end. Also, whatever happened to \\"Marianne?\\" They do discuss something briefly but I couldn't get it. I don't claim this film is a great work of art: just entertaining.Without giving anything I will say I liked the ending which wasn't the usual clichéd one. This is the only one in the series I would consider re-purchasing for DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff!!!","review":"Even though I knew this was only an Audio Course, it is the worst I have ever experienced.

I generally like light, comedic detective stories but I didn't like Madeleine because she's just too dumb. She got into just too many scrapes that could have been avoided by any person of ordinary intelligence. It seems like the author tried to prevent Madeleine from being a ditzy beauty queen, but she didn't quite succeed.

I enjoyed reading about a mystery set in my back yard as it were. The characters were well defined and engaging. I found myself wondering who from a cast of suspects would prove to be the killer. I felt that there could have been further developement of other suspects as red herrings. And the suspense would have been greater if the variety of suspects had been evenly developed from the start. However, it was a fun book to read and provided me with a pleasant afternoon of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"This book just wasn't worth the time. Find a book with a real mystery. At times I forgot what the mystery even was because of the number of background characters and mini-mysteries (none of which were intriguing or attention capturing).

Unlike many others, the cord that came with it worked perfectly. Its good if you just want to plug it in to the front of your computer, but if you want to put it on a desk, like me, I recommend getting a longer cord.

What a set of pipes!! To my ears more complicated arrangements than rival STAX, FAME envelopes Ms. Staton's stellar vocals with hard-edged, passionate sounds, creating a true interplay between singer and band that carries you through astounding performance after performance. Even her covers are jaw-dropping: check out her take on \\"Stand By Your Man\\" or the soul standard \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\" to see the power and the glory that this collection represents. Sadly, she went on to California in the mid-70s to become a disco queen, but having heard this collection, I can only say: It's ok -- you made your mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Simple","review":"This book was nice and simple.

Having said that: I cannot begin to tell you what this book did for me. Opening my mind on many levels it helped me to redefine my Jewish Spiritual journey. Up to this point I was spending a great deal of energy in multiple directions.On the learning level I did not really expect much.

As a result, I got a lot more out of the book the second time around. I suspect I would find it even better if I knew more about Buddhism.Rabbi Yitz Greenberg, one of the Jews who met with the Dalai Lama, perhaps summed up what was most important about this meeting between two ancient religions:\\"All religions,\\" he said, \\"not just Judaism, are now being placed in a new situation. At first I thought the culture was forcing us. But I've come to believe this pluralism is God's will.

The arrow keys are not in the same layout as the standard keyboard, and the 6 keys above them 3x2 instead of 2x3. This is enough to screw up anyone, especially if you're like me and have multiple systems and keyboards you use. Oh if they only made the Natural Keyboard Pro still. That is the best keyboard ever made. I'd use a newer model of it, but they also ruined the layout when they added the shift feature to the function keys. Would have been fine if the default was for the function keys, but no, they made it for the others, which have always been shortcuts on your keyboard anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"For UNIX?","review":"I really regret that I brought this junk. I was deceived by its stylish look, and when I started using it, immediately I found that the cursor keys and the page up/down, home/end keys are so awkwardly placed, making the keyboard virtually useless in OS where you absolutely need those keys -- like Windows. I doubt if Microsoft has made this keyboard for UNIX users, those who are used to vi or Emacs, where you type Ctrl+F to move the cursor to the right, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"BEWARE: This keyboard only works with older outdated operating systems.

It definitely has an ergonomic design. At first it might feel a little odd working with the keys, like this. However, after a short time, one will feel more comfortable with this type of keyboard. I think the design of this keyboard puts one's hands at a better anatomical position verses a conventional keyboard.Peace and Happiness,Patrick Leonardi"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the large one, but watch out for the arrows","review":"I have been a Microsoft Ergonomic keyboard user for quite a while. I like a fresh response and sometimes replace it every 6 months to a year. This model types about the same, feels about the same, and is smaller without a soft wrist wrest to the previous Microsoft models. That being said, it functions well, really does help with reducing my shoulder strain and I can type very efficiently on it.So now for the drawbacks:The arrow keys are strange. The up & down keys aren't back to back. To save space, the left and right arrows are back to back. This causes me a lot of heartburn because I'm a big arrow user. I'm still adjusting.As well, the page up/down button area is also slightly different than the typical keyboard. If you're a big user of any of those keys, you may also want to be aware of the difference.I do like this model because it fits my desk better, but the arrows issue still bothers me. We'll see if I can get used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch the height if using on a computer desk with slide out keyboard drawer","review":"Watch the height if using on a computer desk with slide out keyboard drawer. Didn't think about this and since the height of the keyboard(2.6 according to manufacturer) is different from the regular flat keyboards(1.5 inch). When sliding the drawer in and out the keys rub the bottom of the desk even though I have a 2 and 1/4 inch gap between drawer and bottom of desk which is probably a pretty standard gap on computer desk, measure first. Other than that it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil key layout!","review":"My experience parallels a previous review. I also used the older Microsoft Natural keyboard (now the Natural Pro) and it relieved my persistent pain. When I accidentally killed my keyboard, I ordered the Elite model without thinking. Within a few days I was desperate enough to go back to a conventional keyboard. The arrangement of the Home/Page Up/Page Dn/End/Delete/Insert and arrow keys may allow the keyboard to fit in trays, but otherwise it is insane. I never realized how much I use those keys until I was swearing at this keyboard. The arrows keys are nearly impossible to use, especially for gaming. Unless you truly need the keyboard to fit in a tray, please stay away from this annoying, frustrating, and unusable keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keys poorly laid out and miniature in size","review":"As with several other people who have shared their thoughts on this product, I must say that I absolutely hate it because of the tiny arrow, page up/down, home, insert, delete, and end keys.

Otherwise, it's was a functional, ergonomic keyboard, that is, until the \\"1\\", \\"4\\", and \\"7\\" number keys stopped working.Three-year manufacturer warranty, so have to decide if it's worth the shipping costs to get another one (who knows how long that would last)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine ergonomics but stiff unresponsive keys","review":"I appreciate the effort that went into designing this keyboard. The layout is optimized for lengthy sessions without causing typical fatigue associated with standard keyboard layouts. Unfortunately, my unit has poor tactile response. They feel sticky and require considerable effort to press which makes typing a chose. I've had others that felt fine, but this one, for whatever reason has not delivered the expected level of quality. I gave it away to someone else who types much less than I and he hasn't complained."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't hold up","review":"just didn't hold up for me. the keyboard response was weak and just felt cheap. i have a similar one at work, microsoft but different model, and it is 10x better. i guess you get what you pay for with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"6 months then would not work","review":"This keyboard was great for 6 months, then the letter B stopped working.

Ergonomics must not be making them much money.","review":"I've been using split keyboards since 1995, all Microsoft.I could tell the current keyboard (of 8 years) was beginning to skip letters as I type -- warning signal!So I purchased a new one which has now moved to storage until I am simply forced to use it:1) Keyboard clicks are sharp or tinny -- I think due to the thin materials used for the housing.2) The keyboard speed is maddeningly slow. I have tried the new keyboard on both XP and Win 7, set both OS's at the highest speed and still the keyboard creeps until I want to throw it out the window. Regular typing is OK, but if you want to move the cursor to somewhere else on the page that has no keyboard shortcuts, take a long deep breath. Deleting, whether forward or back is also annoyingly slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better choices available","review":"I'm writing this review on a Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard. I bought it for the price and soon learned you get what you pay for. I've used ergonomic keyboards for years because they are much more comfortable to my arm angle and hand placement. The problem with the Natural Elite is the key action. Stiff and jerky. After an hour or so, my finger joints are sore. The adjustable height is an advantage, but virtually every keyboard has it. Only because I broke my Adesso (better, but not great) am I on the MS Elite. Spend a little more.

After only a few days of use, the spacebar stopped working, and the number keys were either broken or typing strange combinations...I have never had this happen with a keyboard, nor have ever heard of it happening. I can only assume that these are constructed *very* poorly. I even unscrewed the back and looked inside the 'board. Nothing seemed wrong.

The keyboard is much smaller (and as a result less ergonomic) - they have managed to do this because the keys are smaller and placed closer together (especially the arrow keys!).

I replaced it almost immediately with the same keyboard because of how much I liked the style and because I was so used to it.My new one, which I bought in July, shorted out after less than a teaspoon of coffe dripped on it. I've had keyboards that have survived major spillage, cleaning products, and being dropped, yet this keyboard died after such a small injury.I have tried to contact Microsoft to return it.

The only difference is they added an adapter, in the form of a 4 inch cable extension. This is *NOT* is USB keyboard with a PS/2-USB adapter. This may not be important to some, but its important enough to me that I returned it because I already have a Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite PS/2 and just need to connect it to a PC without PS/2 ports.

Also, the home/end/insert/del/pg up/pg down cluster has been dissected and rearranged, which causes me no end of grief and mis-keys.As a touch-typist and a programmer, I've come to expect these keys to be in a certain position.

I have a hard time with those, but not enough to be looking for another keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad this is still made","review":"I (and my wife) have been using this style keyboard for years including a custom, pull out drawer specific to this shape (that is no longer made). The space bar on one stopped working after more than 5 years of regular use. I'm glad this keyboard is still available. I thought Microsoft was going to drop it years ago, but perhaps there were enough complaints to confirm the demand. I'm a large fellow, and my hands don't meet on a standard keyboard without significantly distorting my wrists, so this Natural keyboard is the answer. Bought a spare at this low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best layout for a keyboard","review":"I love this keyboard layout. My hands and wrists are so comfortable when using this at home and at work. I've never had any sort of cramping or discomfort in almost 10 years of use.I don't like how they rearranged the arrow keys from the previous model... they are now in a cross shape and it's hard for me to use them well without looking, or to have my fingers find a home position."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keyboard review","review":"For the most part this is a good keyboard. I got it because my company provided me a POS keyboard that was leaving me with hand/wrist pain. I find that this new keyboard helps reduce the frequency of the hand/wrist pain. It's relatively easy to type and adapt to, but some of the keys, backspace, delete, home, end are not well positioned and it can be a pain the A when working in MS Excel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable, but horrible layout","review":"As a programmer, I can't stand that they changed the layout of the center row (ins, del, pgup, pgdn), slowing me down considerably, as well as the arrow keys (too small & awkward).NOT recommended if you have to switch between keyboards (at home/work)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but ...","review":"Pretty good in general. Two things, though. This keyboard is wider for some keyboard trays. So make sure it fits the keyboard tray of your computer desk before you buy it. Second, I type in both Chinese and English. My typing in Chinese was not standard typing before. I needed to reach out to the other half at first and obviously that kinda hurt my finger muscle. Now I've changed (or forced to change). I got used to this keyboard fairly quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite","review":"If you have ever had carpel tunnel or problems with your wrist, this keyboard is for you. I had one at work and went back to using a standard keyboard and after a week all my pain was back. Now, I not only use one at work, but I purchased one for home use directly from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt good, failed quickly","review":"To be blunt, it \\"crapped out\\" after 4 months and I don't do a lot of typing. I work on electronics for a living and I know how to care for and maintain devices so I tried to clean it. Nothing changed. It simply had several keys quit working. I had to go back to using the keyboard that came with my computer which is especially disappointing because I got used to the feel of the ergonomic keyboard and liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD so you know it's elite","review":"Compared to the other quiet keys (and nearly all keyboards), the space key (which is obviously used very frequently) is incredibly clacky. I've found this to be true on multiple MS natural 4000 keyboards in our IT dept. It's a design flaw, and makes the keyboard wholly unusable. I don't want to type on a typewriter all day, and that's what it sounds like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Noisy","review":"I didn't purchase this keyboard, but worked purchased it for me.The key feed back is really loud on this computer. I tend to be a \\"heavy\\" typer so I prefer quieter keyboards so I'm not driving my coworkers crazy.The caps lock broke with in 2 months of using the keyboard. The base back is very \\"hard\\" and uncomfortable.I will say that the \\"spacing\\" was nice, as well as the key layout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good positive keystrokes","review":"I use this keyboard at home and a conventional one at work. At first I found the conventional one tight after using this one for a bit. The key angle is good. I like the lights down the middle also.After 5 years or so of use, the keys respond as well as ever with good springback and never missing an action. The same model's been on sale that long in the UK, which actually says something about its popularity.The one drawback is the footprint of the feet is too narrow and its tricky to stop them from sliding. I've used ridged fabric, but a different shape and rubber on the feet would help a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lotsa love for this keyboard","review":"The keyboard really gets some getting used to. However once you do, you will never go back to a standard keyboared. The design puts the keys at a comfortable angel. I believe that this is better than a total split keyboard because it positions the hands at a correct angel and you can not undo it. Of cource they do have some that are adjustable. Anyway my typing has improved in speed and accurracy. This is great for people begining to learn to type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks","review":"This keyboard is a decent ergonomic, but I would expect better for this price. Especially from Microsoft. It is nice that the feet to angle the keyboard are in the back as opposed to the front like many ergonomic keyboards. It is more comfortable that way. However, like many others have noted, the key layout of the arrow keys, the 6 keys above them, and the function keys (F1 - F12) are not the standard size/shape. This slows me down considerably. Also, the wrist rest is not removable or replacable. Overall Microsoft could have done a LOT better. Major thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"MS hardware on the cheap","review":"I bought this to replace a MS ergonomic keyboard from 3 years ago that gave up the ghost. My previous keyboard had a solid feel and the keys were very responsive. This thing is cheap plastic junk. I broke off one of the \\"legs\\" just leaning on it the other day. The spacebar is half-responsive, and the tiny little function, arrow and page keys are a nightmare.Avoid this keyboard at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"MICROSOFT NATURAL ELITE KEYBOARD","review":"THIS MICROSOFT KEYBOARD IS THE MOST RELIABLE, DURABLE, AND COMFORTABLE BOARD I HAVE USED IN ALL THE YEARS I HAVE BEEN USING COMPUTERS. THE ONLY REASON I HAD TO REPLACED MY PREVIOUS KEYBOARD,(SAME MODEL) WAS DUE TO A FRIEND WASTING AN ENTIRE CUP OF COFFEE ON IT. THE KEYBOARD POSSESS ALL THE KEYS THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD USE. THE MONEY I SAVE FOR A NEW KEYBOARD WITH AMAZON VS EBAY WAS AN EASY 50% SAVINGS. THE COST OF AN USED BOARD ON EBAY WAS EVEN HIGHER. AS ALWAYS I RECEIVED THIS AND ALL MY PRODUCTS WELL AHEAD OF TIME WHEN PURCHASING FROM AMAZON.

Keys: T,R,F,G,V stopped working after four months. I don't eat at my desk, so there wasn't anything to clean when I took the keyboard apart. Stay away from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft Keyboard","review":"I have been using Microsoft ergonomic keyboards all the time. This one has got a little jinx in it. I wonder why are the arrow keys are placed so. The up and down keys are not placed back to back, but up and down arrows are placed back to back. This causes a lot problem while using the arrow keys. They should have followed the normal standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of all Microsoft keyboards","review":"The Elite's key layout is non-standard: the Ins/Home/Pgup and Del/End/PgDn key grouping is rotated through 90 degrees. This means that you have to re-learn your right hand typing behaviour. To make matters worse the reduced-size cursor keys are not in the usual inverted T, but in a cruciform arrangement, which makes this keyboard pretty useless for people who engage in FPS games like Quake 2/3, Unreal etc. They're really only fit for people with fingers like pencils.On the whole, the Elite keyboard is only for those who suffer from restricted space (such as those who use pull-out keyboard trays), but MUST have a natural layout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"This keyboard has had a mind of its own since it got here. When you first open a document or a blank email, sometimes a random key takes off. It can be a hundred 2's in a row or it can be stuck on ESC or it might be the ENTER button. If you're lucky, the ESC button will stop the insanity. I have had the keyboard for 6 months because I hate shopping for them and I'm too cheap to buy a new one since I know how to make this one behave, but now it's starting to just quit working for no reason. I got one with a wire so it wouldn't have to have batteries, but now I'm having the same problem as if I had batteries that were dying. Waste of good money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps wrist straight, VERY SOFT KEYS","review":"I was given one of these at work. WHile it does keep your wrists straight, the keys are EXTREMELY SOFT TOUCH.

It will not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Worthless Rubbish!","review":"This kit contains 2 tubes of weak rubber cement and an assortment of patches. I tried to use it to patch a bike tube but it won't hold. The patches are think and chunky with square edges, not tapered. I tried gluing one on the tube to patch a hole but it wouldn't stay. The patches are so thick I don't think you could get the tube in without knocking them off but it didn't get that far. I glued one on with the supplied rubber cement and put weights on it to hold it flat until the glue dried but later the corners of the patch were starting to curl up and I found that I could easily pull it off with my fingers so there's no way it would hold against the pressure of inflating the tube. These patches might work to fix a puncture if applied to the inside of a car tire but they won't work at all on a tube.

If there is another one I'm unaware of it. I love the beautiful illustrations and photos of the ride incorporated throughout the pages. This is jam packed with all sorts of great information on how the idea of a Disney Attraction came about decades ago leading up to the movie that later came out with Eddie Murphy. Although that movie was watchable it was on the corny and disappointing side. It's my understanding that Guillermo Del Toro is developing and filming his version of the Haunted Mansion which will be absolutely delightful. He's got a dark vision and imagination and that will fair well in adapting a more accurate Haunted Mansion film. I got off track, but this book is a definite keeper. It's the #1 choice I recommend on getting a book about the Haunted Mansion."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Won't Find This Anywhere Else!","review":"If you like the Haunted Mansion ride, this is the perfect book for you.

I'm quite the Disney aficionado and love to learn things about my favorite place, I get even more thrilled when I find out something I didn't already know.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was I found the chapter based on the Haunted Mansion boring.

Of course, the author knows virtually nothing about technology (or at least ignored it in the book), the characters are tissue-thin, and the plot is ridiculous. In a farce, these are not bad things. This book makes even lightweight stuff like Po Bronson's \\"The First $20 Million is Always the Hardest\\" look like a scholarly disseration, which is not, again a bad thing (considering Bronson's questionable grasp of tech--though his book is good, too).

There are twists and turns throughout the book which leave the reader constantly guessing as to who the killer actually is.Ms. Scott's writing style approaches the poetic with wonderfully crafted descriptive and words that flow smoothly and gracefully. The inspirational cast to the book enhances the story line of this contemporary novel. The characters seem real and pull the reader into their fictional lives. The very end is mystifying and left me thinking about the book long afterward.This is a book I had trouble tearing myself away from. An exceptional novel by this first-time author and I eagerly anticipate her next one.

With those courses you very quickly learn basic and intermediate sentence structure as well as a decent amount of basic vocabulary. However, this course lacks any such direction or structure. It is essentially Michel reading out items such as, \\"January is Januar, February is Februar...\\" Unlike the first two courses there is no obvious places to pause and come up with sentences on your own. In fact, he really doesn't ask you to. I just didn't know what to do with this course.

Someone said that every man should read the book. I think women should read it as well.

But of course I will try anyway.Each instrument (including the vocals), if you were to pick them out individually, is very dynamic alone. And somehow together they do not clash, they enhance and compliment... the writing and arrangement is near masterful in my eyes. The lyrics are delivered with such a range of emotion its insane.

He is also a fantastic nature writer, weaving simple but elegant stories in and out of the science, stories mostly set in his two main observation sites, Vermont and Maine.

Brave, fast whirling, love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no, not painful...but far too anesthetic","review":"I have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band. All of their records, in general, sound exactly the same, and this one is no exception. Post-Velvets guitar/organ drones, lackadaisical vocals, blankly uninteresting non-lyrics (they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting), and a dramatic lack of energy; all of Yo La Tengo's trademarks are fully represented here, and if you can stay awake through it, you're a better man/woman than I. A surpassingly boring record, even from this usually very boring band. If you've heard the Velvet Underground, Neu!, Stereolab's early records, and Sonic Youth, you've heard Yo La Tengo in total. If you're a big enough fan of those named bands, YOU could probably write songs that sound like \\"Painful.\\" But you would probably write better ones. Avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Initial D","review":"i could not possibly give the 'Tokyo Pop' versions of initial D a five star rating due to the differences from the original show in japan v/s the 'Tokyo Pop' version.

This collection of songs has some wonderful gems - although not the \\"big hit\\" breakthrough, \\"Message to My Girl\\" is a beautiful song and as always, the Finn brothers can sing like no other. \\"Our Day\\" and other songs - well, there was a common thread through these songs making the album very listenable, almost like an escape, taking you on a journey with the artist, a thoroughly enjoyable on. This makes me remember a time when music really went straight to my emotions, my senses were wide awake. This record does this to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Book","review":"This is a fabulous books that reminds you of probably all the things you set out to do for your children but get distracted along the way, for all kinds of reasons.

Today I pass it on to one of my daughters, age 33, who is using this new addition to help her with her three children. This helped us through the 70's and my children still talk about the methods we used in those days that were recommended by Dr.Dreikurs. I think this book is oustanding and actually phenonmenal. Most of all it is SIMPLE. I recommend it to anyone trying to raise children without understanding or guidance as to where to start. It is so simple, it cuts out all the screaming, fighting and manipulations little ones are goo at and saves Mommy from frustration and insanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Parenting Book","review":"I first purchased this book 21 years ago when my oldest daughter was 9 months old. I didn't want to be the same type of parent as my parents with yelling and spanking. With the help of Children: The Challenge, my husband and I have raised two beautiful daughters with many compliments on how well-mannered and polite they are. People often joke that if they could be guaranteed a child exactly as my oldest, they would not hesitate to have children. I now purchase this book to give to friends that are expecting their first child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Nothing New","review":"I started to read the book and decided to return it.I found that the ideas presented nothing really new.I did not like the examples.I bought this book because it got excellent reviews on Amazon.com and found out that it did not match my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Tested Advice","review":"Although an older book, the advice given still applies to this day. There are many short chapters on varying topics and each chapter is thoroughly illustrated with many examples. The concepts of this book can be readily applied to most families.It promotes understanding rather than telling parents what to do in all situations.Some modern books that I found similar in theory are: \\"How to Talk so your Kids Will Listen and Listen so your Kids Will Talk\\" and \\"The Manipulative Child: How to Regain Control and Raise Resilient, Resourceful and Independent Kids\\".Some explainations seemed long at times but overall a very interesting and well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A necessary parental read!","review":"I wish I had read this book while my child was growing up! Being a recently retired school teacher I firmly believe if all parents read this book and followed the guidelines, our society would be a safer haven for all of us, and especially the children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't really care for this book","review":"This book contains some good advice, but isn't full of it. I was actually hanging my mouth open during some chapters and the suggestions that were given. I feel that the material is a bit dated. However, if you have a problem child (which I do not) you may find some of the advice in this book much more helpful than I did. There a pros and cons to this book. For me, the cons outweighed the pros."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously outdated, and somehow still so relevant","review":"I bought this book because it's supposed to be the very base of the Adler (democratic) parenting theory. The book is so so old. It contains numerous examples of parents spanking their kids, which I guess was much more acceptable in the 60s (when the book was written). If you can overlook this minor disconcerting fact (it really is minor), then this is an amazing book which manages to be accurate and relevant to this day too. To me it was eye opening and enlightening.After reading this book, my husband and I signed up for an Adlerian parenting seminar. The teacher there, by the way, says she's read over 50 parenting books and recommends this book. However, she gives the highest recommendation to the book \\"Ain't Misbehavin'\\" by Alyson Schafer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any biplane and WWII fan","review":"I loved this book. It is well written, funny and interesting. The author has a relaxed chatty way of writing that instantly captures you. If you have a love of bi-planes as I do and are mildly obsessed over them and WWII history of actual flying. This is the book to read.He writes of his experience piloting across the States and disperses through this experiences of WWII pilots with the Stearman and other aircraft both in the US and in Europe.As a funny aside. I am a student pilot and it helped me realise that some of my fears up there are what most pilots have been through at some stage. It gave me confidence and I hope that when I finally do my taildragger training - that I'll remember some of the advice. :-)I highly recommend this book. It is brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty handy","review":"I put this out and rotate my latest most-played CD's... it's handy the way CD's flip, makes browsing easy ... in hindsight it seems a bit overpriced with shipping, like it should be $10 on the store shelf.. but I haven't seen one on the shelf"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality and great looking CD holder!!","review":"This CD holder is truly one-of-a-kind!!

Also, many opportunities to take a glimpse into the daily life of an ancient Roman; not so different from us, eh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Secular Bible for the 21st Century","review":"Seneca's one hundred and twenty four letters to Lucilius constitute a secular bible, an ethical catechism written in a gnomic and epigrammatic style that sparkles as it enlightens. So impressed were the early church fathers with Seneca's moral insights that they advanced (fabricated?) the speculation that he must have come within the influence of Christian teachings. T.S. Eliot sneers at Seneca's boyish, commonplace wisdom and points out that the resemblances between Seneca's 'stoic philosophy' and Christianity are superficial. For those seeking a practical, modern manual on how to do good and how to do well, written in the 'silver point' style that values brevity, concision and memorable expression, Seneca's letters are indeed the Good Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"MUST READ\\" FOR ANIMAL LOVERS","review":"I read this book years ago and just recently re-read it!Anyone who is interested in the mysterious bond between humans and animals will enjoy this book.

It's a truly warm, feel-good story.Hats off to people as passionate and giving as Mr. Gonzalez!My only problem with the book is that even though it's short at 160 pages, I got tired of reading about the series of cat rescues after awhile...it began to feel repetitious, as fascinating as it was for the first half of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ginny","review":"Ginny had a gift for finding stray cats.

The only problem I had with this book was its short length. I'm used to her 300+ page books, with all those wonderful details, and this book came in at approximatley 230 pages.I wish her editor would've done a better job dividing the original on-line work (\\"Tropical High\\") so both books would've been of a comparable length (\\"Red Sky...,\\" the first book, was over 300 pages). I guess I felt a bit cheated in terms of length and money spent (I read the book in one sitting, and that's not normal for a Missy Good story. I like to wallow in them and get lost in the characters, relationships, the conflicts, and the plot).Can't wait until 2005 when the next sequal comes out.

It seems a bit harder to listen to the film, and the riffs, AND the audience and still enjoy it. The random split screen to see the guys was... meh. The shorts were great, but here is my question; if you cannot watch the entire film in 1080p stand-alone, why buy this on blu-ray? to see Michael J Nelsons' pores on his face?

My family is a \\"good 'ol southern family\\" so they are picky about their tea. My mom raved about the tea that the press makes. My dad loves the coffee that comes from it. I am the only person that likes tea in my house, so it is easy to make tea for one. I use theBraun WK200W Aqua Express Electric Water Kettle - Whiteso it is super fast and easy to use.I rarely get any grinds in my coffee or tea leaves in my tea (I use loose leaf tea). There is a mesh at the bottom of the press part so it helps a lot. It also comes apart at all the right places to clean easily. The main problem is that the tea leaves sometimes get stuck in the wire around the press, but it takes a minute or less to wash all of that out. I highly recommend this press or any that are similar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well With Tea","review":"We use this with Barry's Tea Gold Blend loose leaf tea and it works great.

There are crackles and hiss which you can expect on any old reggae recordings, but some tracks have that repeating sizzle of a scuffed record.

I have some of these songs on other CD's that were mastered from the original tapes, and they have none of these problems, so it's frustrating because the crappy quality of this CD ruins the excellent collection of songs, which you won't find together on any other CD.Never trust a review from someone who does not own the product, this is not a five star CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bettie Serveert Rocks!","review":"Lamprey is a great cd all around.

Each one has lasted about 1 year and then quits. I have purchased the most expensive to the least expensive wireless door bell set I could find but nothing seemed to last. I found these at a local discount home improvement store and also on Amazon.com. They were less expensive on Amazon.com so I decided to purchase them. At this point I have been able to get the chime on the front door to work, but not on the back door. I am sure there is something interfering with the back door set and have someone who is going to come over and try to help me figure out the problem. I really do like these chimes and love the look of them. Hopefully someone will be able to figure out the problem at the back door because it is right at the driveway and that is the first door anyone goes to. Right now I have a sign on the door that the door bell doesn't work - to please go to other door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't meet specs","review":"The specifications say the door chime kit has a transmission range of 150 feet.

When explaining the range was only 10-15 feet, the service provider said that was because of the wall / door blocking the receiver. When we said it was a doorbell and therfor needed to be outside the door, the service rep became unkind.

The product's range is diminished to about 15 feet max thru stone. Mine worked fine for front door when I moved the chime to 10 ft. What I don't understand is the front door and frame are all wood, with no stone obstruction to chime and still the stone somehow absorbs the signal. The other front door is about 25 ft away and it would not work when up against the house..... fine for holding it in the air, but not up against the house.

The 12-18 month size is a huge jump from the 6-12 month size. The information page does not even give the correct pediped sizing options. It lists the sizes as small, medium, large and XL without telling you what those are affliated with (6-12, 12-18, etc) When you click on the the merchant sizing link, it is completely unrelated to this particular product.Ireally wanted these shoes so I took the chance and ordered the Medium.

Claudette Colbert and Charles Laughton are fun as Poppea and Nero, but they're hardly in the picture, far too much time being taken up with Frederic March hamming it up as Marcus Superbus (no, really) as he falls for Elissa Landi's Christian gal Mercia (no relation to the county). It's restrained to the point of being inert at times, with far too much of the dreary Christians, although it does perk up for the arena finale which features dwarfs battling Amazon women, elephants crushing Christians and gorillas menacing naked women.

I also heard interviews with the author which made it seem as if the book was full of many juicy Lennon tidbits. I was wrong. Essentially, this book is a semi autobiography about the author and his life as a teenager, growing up, getting married, having children, etc. Apparently he worked for several years as a close associate of Jack Douglas and there is much information there, but from my point of view, who cares?This book sucks most people in because it suggests never before released info about John Lennon.

This band is musically as tight as any death metal band I've ever heard. Great guitars, punishing drums, and those twisted evil volcals make Demigod a must have. Not many bands that play this punishing brand of death metal can break into classical guitar and make it work. Fans of Decapitated, Morbid Angel, Nile and bands of that nature will not be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant to \\"Critical Thinking\\" Novices","review":"It is a pleasure to review Roz's book on Critical Thinking in Nursing. I am most impressed with her ability to \\"compartmentalize\\" the learning about the concept of critical thinking in nursing without reducing this to a task. Roz provides the reader with multiple perspectives, critical thinking exercises, and text boxes with \\"jewels\\" of information that elaborate, further articulate, illustrate, or clarify the concepts she is discussing. The author further provides exceptional structure for each chapter through \\"chapter at a glance\\", learning outcomes, and a prechapter self-test. This is an appropriate resource for all nurses beginning to explore, understand, and apply the concept of critical thinking to their evolving nursing practice. Finally, it is a great review tool for practicing nurses; to \\"remind\\" them of the inherent bias that becomes integrated into our practice if we do not apply these concepts continually and diligently every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy way to learn about critical thinking in nursing","review":"This is really a great book! It presents and discuss very important concepts in a practical perspective, with many examples and comments from nursing leaders.

I thought it was broken at first, but if you walk outside, or stand under a \\"regular\\" light bulb the calculator (Canon Flashcard LS-716H) comes on and works fine. And if you hold the calculator VERY CAREFULLY to directly face a powerful fluorescent light, it will come on and work. That is a profound flaw!! I bought another random other (slightly larger) solar calculator and it works PERFECTLY in all conditions like fluorescent lights. I usually love Canon products, I own Canon printers and digital cameras, and I am usually impressed by the Canon quality and ease of use -> this was a BIG disappointment.Other than the fact that the calculator won't reliably come on, it's pretty nice. It is *EXTREMELY* compact and has a nice solid feel (about three credit cards thick) and looks pleasant.

He also likes crawling through the tunnels. This works well indoors and outdoors on a LEVEL surface only. You can't really stake it down outside so it does need to be level. It's VERY easy to set up and easy to take down. Takes up about the space of a 8x10 notebook pad of paper when folded. Great for trips to the park or beach. I like this toy much better than the inflatable ball pits as it can't leak. You could easily fill the center part of this with balls. Just as a side note, when we leave this up overnight our cat also loves to use it to sleep in (he prefers the yellow tunnels!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Time Tent","review":"Here at MomMom's house, I have just the tent version which my grandson has enjoyed since he could crawl.

Written in the fictional style (the author served in the Army of the Potomac)that the population of the 1880's could understand I found the book both entertaining, fast moving and historically accurate. In fact I did not want to put it down, wanting to see what would happen to the main characters as the war unfolded. Perhaps not up to the style of \\"Corporal Si Klegg\\", it never the less is a first hand account of army life and Civil War service and is well worth the read.

It has so many English loanwords (words that are the same in English and Hindi) that it should be called 'Your First 25 Words in Hindi\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Beginner Book","review":"I bought this book in order to familiarize myself with Devanagari script prior to tackling my Hindi grammar book. This is a terrible book for learning the script. It may serve as a good exercise book if you are already somewhat familiar with the characters. However, it gives a very brief 4 page explanation on the script and the rules and when explaining rules says, \\"This is mostly true in modern Hindi but to keep this book simple....\\" and so you are left with a brief explanation that may not even be completely accurate. The rest of the book is just flashcards and exercises where you connect words to pictures except that you were NEVER taught how to write the characters or how to join them into a word. I am buying Rupert Snell's book in order to learn the script. Once I have a decent understanding I will move on to the exercises in this book to test my knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Poet","review":"This is a nice collection of Robert Burns poems and songs.

Light My Fire is a rare exception but I doubt any source would ellaborate on the four minute instrumental solo.What's interesting here is that songs from the Other Voices LP are included in this songbook. Other Voices is the first Doors record that was released after Jim Morrison died. It features the vocals of Robbie Kreiger and Ray Manzarek. Too bad that record is so difficult to find. Also included are stories about the Doors music/recording history as well as an interview with Robbie Krieger.Overall an excellent resource for musicians who like the Doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I wanted","review":"I still have not received my refund!

The entire disc is incredible. Ira Kaplans guitar playing is inoovative and mesmerising. Georgia Hubley proved herself to me as a drummer with her simple counter-point sense of time. Each song is crafted not so much as a song but as a musical quilt where even the vocals are as much sounds as they are words. This Disc is not POP and it isn't for anyone who is afraid to venture far from what gets played on the radio, but as far as indie bands go, this is as good as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick and Energizing","review":"The best way to experience this album is on a long drive, alone, late at night. It's so musically and lyrically alive that it seems to take over the car and drive for you. It's like cruise control for your ears. By the time you get through its defining song, Blue Line Swinger, you'll be ready to cry for the experience of having listened to a very good album by a very secure band. Only a few middling tracks keep it from the five stars it otherwise would deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best","review":"This is one of my all-time favorites. I had always liked YLT pretty well from what I had heard in passing, but the first time I heard the song \\"False Alarm\\" I knw there was something really special about this band. The creepy organs, sloppy double-tracking of the voice and the frantic drum beat make this song one of the most original and compelling songs I've ever heard. Of course the rest of the album is nearly as amazing, as is pretty much the entire YLT catalogue. If I could be in any band working today it would be this one. They play very serious music but never, take themselves seriously. Go see them live if you want proof of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"YLT Stretches Out","review":"It makes perfect sense that this platter sits between Painful and I Can Hear... The song writing and selection is not as tight as Painful and the songs don't touch on the pop sensibilities of the latter. They stretch out in many directions, with the low base line of James McNew weaving through moody tone paintings. The feedback drug dirge of the opening track finds a beautiful counterpoint in Pablo and Andrea, one of their best numbers. The solo on P and A is worth the price.. Sonic Youth, Pavement fanst and even deadheads will find this in their league.

A singel word discription is tastefully writen at the bottom of each card wich is quite helpfull. Some ( very few) of the images seem quickly drawn but all are well painted.

I give it 1 star only because that's as low as the ratings go. The artwork is unattractive at best. Major problems I have with it include: 1) the high priestess looks like a man, 2) the Heirophant looks like a woman, 3) the \\"humanoid\\" charachters have been stripped of their sexuality, 4) a Magen David on every other card (it really gets old fast), 5) lame geographic symbols on the minor arcana suggesting that the artist ran out of ideas and had to beat a deadline.

I'm not crazy about some of the other flavors, especially the tangerine one because I can taste the concentrated raisen juice. I used to really like that one in college. Then I discovered this one. I don't know why the retail stores & grocers in my area don't carry this anymore. This is my favorite of the inexpensive hot teas to mix with my favorite hot chocolate mix.

I don't mind the 'talking' or any of his soundbites. In fact, those were the very things that drew me to Mark in the first place. On this particular cd, it just didn't click for me. Well, that's my story and I'm stickin' to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near Farina's usual high standard","review":"I'm a big fan of Mark Farina's DJ mixes, so I expected a lot from Air Farina. It's a perfect example of why it's easier for producers to move to DJing than DJs to move to producing.The production of this CD is amateur at best. The beats are flat and uninspiring. There's no swing whatsoever... it sounds like it was programmed by a robot. Every other sound on the CD sounds like it was pasted in at random intervals on top of these beats. Every song on the album is exactly the same.It sounds just like the kind of music I made after two months of playing with my gear. The difference was I realized I sucked, and Mark Farina is a world class DJ. When judging your own work it's hard to be critical, especially if you're surrounded by \\"yes\\" men.Mark Farina is a superb DJ, but he needs a lot more time to develop into a competent producer. This album should have had another producer since the concept was workable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good record! :(","review":"For quite some time now, I have been hearing great things about Mark Farina.

The book is not indexed, there is no table of contents, and it is sometimes hard to follow.I suggest reading this book in conjunction with Prince of the City, by Fred Siegel, a much more flattering (and better written) book about the Giuliani years. It is interesting to read the two books together and see how two different authors write about the same events.Jim Fiorentini, Mayor, Haverhill, Massachusetts"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled whining from a bitter, failed Mayor","review":"As someone who saw how Ed Koch pushed New York to the very brink (and how David Dinkins pushed it over), I find it ironic that the famously prickly Koch could attack Giuliani the way he does. Yelling \\"How'm I doin'?\\" doesn't constitute real leadership. Cleaning up the streets and making New York livable again, as Giuliani has done, is what being Mayor is all about.Maybe some people are nostalgic for the Koch days -- record crime rates, a city in deep debt, Boss Tweed-style graft and corruption, and a Mayor too indifferent to take on real problems -- but reading this book left me wondering just whom they might be.There are occasional moments of ironic humor -- Koch seems to think that he could have done everything Giuliani has done, only with more grace and style. It begs the question: if Koch was such a great Mayor, why didn't he get the job done like Giuliani has?This book is a bitter, angry little screed. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair criticism of a good mayor and good man","review":"Those who repeatedly label Giuliani 'nasty' fail to understand him. It's true that he's a tough mayor, but his toughness has actually been an asset in governing New York City--and he's also genuinely a good man who cares about people. Just listen to his radio show or watch his press conferences (in full--not the media's 10-second excerpts).With crime in New York City cut in half over the last six years, homicides down 70 percent, and something like 350,000 private sector jobs created, Koch's criticism comes off sounding like sour grapes. I like Koch as a man and as a mayor, and am disappointed that he resorts so freely to petty assaults on Giuliani's character. This is a tired drum for Giuliani's critics to continue beating."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment!","review":"I was given a copy of the first Seely CD \\"Parentha See\\", and I must have listened to it fifty times, each time hearing new things in the dense musical tapestries that make up the CD.

When it came, I put it in the player and realized that it was all the same songs as on the first CD, just vastly inferior versions as if they had tried to quickly re-record it.

I appreciate how Liz Curtis Higgs makes it simple to \\"put on the skin\\" of each character -- you can easily see how YOU could have made the same choices that would have led to the same wonderful or terrible outcome. I also liked that she expanded the personalities of all the characters in the story. The Bible doesn't spend a lot of time on Dinah's story, but Higgs makes you see how individual choices and individual personalities can create the atmosphere for sin and tragedy.

Be careful, you will not be able to put this book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace in Thine Eyes","review":"I know this is a retelling of the Biblical story in which Dinah's brothers kill Shechem but I had hoped that Liz Curtis Higgs might spare Somerled's life for the sake of fiction and a more modern setting and let him off with threats or injury instead. I was disappointed that Davina and Somerled did not get to be together because I loved both characters and felt that they were meant to be together and were completely perfect for each other. Adding Graham in at the end just seemed like a way to placate the readers to give them closure but to me fell flat because nothing could replace what existed and could have been between Davina and Somerled. It was still a good book, but the only parts of the book that I truly enjoyed reading were the parts with Somerled and Davina."},{"rating":"2","title":"REMIXED ?

No doubt this first Murphy Lee CD is no disappointment and if you like Nelly or any of the other St. Lunatics then you will be happy you copped this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"hotboymont504","review":"I like the cd murphy\`s law one it murphy lee two it a good cd .it has wat da hook gon be ,and love me baby all in all it a good cd. hotboymont504@i-squrd.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"LUNATICulious","review":"THis CD is MAD CRAZY!!! I knew MURPH DERT had it in him but DAMN!!! This cd is a head banger from begginning to end and is definatley on point. It's made for the ladies by the Ladies man, the booty critic himself. Murph proves that the school boy is a grown ass man. The lyrics to this cd is very sharp and you would never wanna leave this cd at home when you're in the car or vice versa. Every track is more explosive than the next and then it repeats itself from track 1 to track 19. I have fell in love with Murph Dert erry time i hear the opening track I wanna b myself. This lunatic is not an amatuer by far he is the best of the best and the collaborations were something serious Murphy Lee YOU ARE GENIUS"},{"rating":"2","title":"FOUR AND HALF STARS FOR MURPHY","review":"Murphy's whole album was candy to my ears. It's not common to buy a cd and like every song on it. All of the songs kept me moving and doing the \\" Monistari!\\" Murphy's style of music is very versatile. He has some slow in the groove songs as well as some get up and jump ones. The beats were thoughtfully put together by using some older artists beats like Marvin Gaye as well as some new ones. I'm looking foward to buying Murphy's future albums and hopefully so will you."},{"rating":"2","title":"MURPHY LIZZLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This CD is hot.

Cool Wit It....CLosely Followed by Wat The Hook Gon Be. After that the next best is Hold Up, and Grandpa Gametight. Murph Derrt is the real deal, its fresh to listen to a rapper who doesnt spend half the album cussing and/or talking about how Gangsta they are ( not that i dont like the gangsta rappers). ITs just a breath of frsh air.The only song i got a problem with is \\"THis Goes out\\" it seems a little to pushy, and lil jon doesnt make it any better, all of this \\"WHat, and OK\\" business, other than that a perfectly listenable CD, very catchy tunes, and should be immediately considered"},{"rating":"2","title":"Murphy's Law","review":"Murphy Lee steps forward from the St. Lunatics to show us a little more of his own unique rap style in this album. He gives his fans a full serving of the wild lyrics and midwest style we see in all the other Lunatic albums. But not only that, Murphy's Law is a very versatile album with songs ranging from the jazzy \\"Cool Wit It\\" to the laid back \\"Red Hot Riplets\\" to the crunk \\"This Goes Out\\". Not to mention the chart-topping hit \\"Shake Ya Tailfeather\\" and the first single \\"Wat Da Hook Gon Be\\".

Nelly and P. Diddy and \\"This Goes Out\\" feat. Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne, ect.

Murphy Lee cant rap for gods sake, neither can 99% of the rappers on MTV nowadays. Why did my favorite music genre have to have gone mainstream? Rap is just the next disco or funk, notice how nobody likes those anymore becuase pop culture ruined them for people who liked it. ANYONE who owns a Murphy Lee, Nelly, 50 Cent, Ja rule, Chingy, Lil anybody or w/e is not a hip hop fan but a mainstream loving loser who doesnt know hip hop at all and is just trying to like what everybody else likes so they can pretend to be cool or ghetto.

And JD only added to the ready-made HIT! \\"This Goes Out\\" is made for all the rap fans! Roscoe, Lil Jon, Nelly, Murphy Lee, and all the other artists TEAR IT UP! I have to admit, when I first heard it, I thought, \\"This sounds kind of country,\\" when Nelly \\"OH-OOH-OH!\\"s in the background, but the sound does grow on you, and it's a great song to dance to! \\"Luv Me Baby\\"(video coming soon) is also off the chains!

That's the major reason this album gets only a two from me. He has a really good technique but it's just not my cup of tea. The beats for the most part aren't that hot save for What Da Hook Gon Be, which is a straight up Classic across the boards. Matter of fact if it wasn't for that song this album would have went under my radar. But on the real his beats are what really turn me off...they have a 'glossed over' feel and I don't like that I like stuff you can ride to. However I can see how other people may like it...he's a very entertaining rapper with mediocre beats. 2.5 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Murphy Lee's new album, \\"Murphy's Law\\"","review":"Coming behind Nelly and the St. Lunatics, Murphy Lee has been in tracks but not been featured as a MAIN artist.

Murph brings new beats and lyrics to the scene that are unique but still remaining humble to his St. Louie roots. His voice matches every beat used to create even more head bangin' tracks. With appearances by his St. Lunatics, Jazze Pha, Sleepy Brown, Lil' Jon and Wayne, Roscoe, JD, and P. Diddy. He's even got a secret track with the classic Marvin Gaye.

Murphy doens't possess flow like Ludacris does. I wouldn't spend $15 on this, which is better used as a drink coaster than for entertainment. Most of the beats up here don't get your head movin like they should. The cameos from Nelly are what gave this CD a 2 star rating. I hoped for more from Da Skool Boy but he just didn't deliver.

Murphy's got the beats and rhymes that everyone likes to listen to and he ain't rappin about negative stuff. Which is usually the Lunatic way. I gotta say, \\"luv me baby\\" is still the best song on the album. But all the joints on the CD are hot and he keeps me interested. I can't wait to see what he'll do next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Many Cameo's","review":"I really enjoyed this CD and Jason Jay E's production, but the only problem I have with this CD is that it has too many cameo's. It reminds me of the Birdman album. There's only one solo song on the album. Thats it. That just shows how much faith Nelly has in Murphy Lee. But Murphy Lee can spit. He's a good rapper, but he needs to display that more. More solo tracks would have been nice. If you're a St. Lunatic fan, you will like this CD. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is off the hook","review":"Murphy came full blasted, this cd is off the hook. This young raper has many skills and proves it to you in his cd.

He makes his lyrics Humorous on some songs/verses, and also Serious on the others!!! I like the different varieties of songs on the Album...My favorite songs on the Album are... \\"Hold Up, Murphy Lee, Cool Wit It, Luv Me Baby, and Regular Guy.

Though it may not have the awesome lyrics of her first CD, it has tons of emotion. Mindy's voice has diffinently matured. This CD shows her many talents.....almost like a different voice with each song. Songs such as \\"Thunder and Roses\\", \\"Over and Over\\" and \\"I'm Not So Tough\\" will keep the record in your CD player. For any Mindy fan, this CD will remind you of why you feel in love with her the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still cheering....","review":"Mindy McCready continues her downhill spiral with her third album, \\"I'm Not So Tough\\". After a small quality drop from \\"Ten Thousand Angels\\" to \\"If I Don't Stay the Night\\", \\"I'm Not So Tough\\" I fear is going to be pasted over by Country radio and listeners. The only song that stands out is 'Over and Over', while songs like \\"Lucky Me\\" belong a broadway musical soundtrack. The songs sound a lot alike and I am unable to warm to it. Don't get me wrong I am still cheering for Mindy, but if I were her I would shop for a new record label. Not only did they point her in the wrong direction musically there was very little publicity promoting the new album. Hopefully she will be able to recover from this devastating new release."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst album this year","review":"I liked Mindy's work since the beginning with \\"Ten Thousand Angels\\" You would expect an artist to get better with each new album.

It only works great for a day and dries up so that you cannot use it.

Nancy Springer, the editor, has brought together a terrific bunch of writers and the results reflect the quality of the contributors. Springer's own story is a delightful heart-warmer with a good twist. Robert J. Harris' creation, Jim Croaker, deserves a series of his own, and the story is reminiscent in some ways of Mark Twain. Janet Taylor Lisle's contribution is a lovely piece of work, the central character is so very endearing, if very humanly prickly! And Jane Yolen, America's answer to Hans Andersen, delights as ever with a very different kind of Green Plague, and she manages to weave her serious points invisibly into the fabric of her tale.All in all, this is a wonderfully quirky slim volume - slightly outre in places, but well-written, clever, hugely enjoyable and, yes, I found it - ribbiting - sorry - YOU try reading this and NOT making frog jokes for days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Austen meets \\"Emmanuelle\\"","review":"A penniless 19th century Darwinist comes under the auspices of an upper crust Victorian family, and his scientific studies of local insectia becomes a thinly-veiled observation of human nature.

There's something very nasty in the woodshed, indeed. Even though most astute viewers will guess the Tennessee Williamsesque \\"family secret\\" a good 45 minutes before it is revealed (thanks to some rather obvious clues early on), the exquisite cinematography, flawless acting and a fair amount of soft-core sex scenes (\\"Mary Poppins\\" this ain't!)will hold your interest. If you enjoyed \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\", you'll go for this one in a big way."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie will bug you","review":"The story of this movie can be summed up in four lines: Man goes to live at mansion. Man falls for and marries daughter of the house. Man learns BIG SECRET. Man runs for it. That's it. For two hours. Did I hear you say the pace is slow?The filmmakers did manage to make Patsy Kensit's face look repellant. That certainly is an achievement. I guess. Shaved off her eyebrows. Colored her lips and face pale--the death-warmed-over look. There is brief full-frontal, but the effect is spoiled by that ghastly face. (To see what she really looks like, get Adam Bede.)To say that any relations between the bugs and the people is strained or far-fetched at best would be an understatement. But I guess people who paid for this movie need some illusion of profundity to justify their wasted time and money.The big surprise at the end can be seen coming from miles away. In the end, your feeling will be the same as the man's--Let me out of here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need an excuse to see frontal nudity, this is it.","review":"This is a repellent story about an impoverished Victorian entomologist who falls in love with an aristocrat.

The DVD is lousy. First off, it is not a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. It is letterboxed, and the figures on screen come off as being somewhat distorted/stretched, as though one stretched a 4:3 aspect ratio movie into widescreen. The biggest problem, though, is that the video is somewhat out of focus and blurry, and it is so distracting that I could not watch anymore than a few minutes before turning it off.

Esta novela cuenta la vida de una hija, pero no cualquier hija de vecino. Una mujer inteligente, independiente, con la mejor educación y todas las oportunidades para ser feliz pero con un padre acostumbrado a tener lo que quiere...que la quiere a su lado. Narrada extraordinariamente, con diálogos muy bien logrados, Archer nos adentra en el mundo empresarial estadounidense de mediados \\"del siglo pasado\\" y nos muestra lo que la hija de un hombre exitoso tiene que hacer para...ser. Hubiera sido interesante un acercamiento mayor a esas relaciones de chantaje emocional que solemos establecer con los que amamos pero, aún así, es fácil sentir empatía por esa valilente mujer que, muy bien, podría llegar a la Presidencia de los EEUU por sus propios medios (esto es, sin usar el puesto que ganó su marido !!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a great book","review":"First I think that this book is really a great book.

Filled with colourful characters, unbarebly tense situations, a strong, none-preachy enviromental message, and some witty digs at the movie version of Jaws, make this a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read Jaws don't even bother with this one.","review":"I was really disappointed with Benchley's writting in this book. It was just like reading Jaws all over again but not as good as that book. He had characters dying the exact same way they had in Jaws. I was hoping for a little more originality especially since he had done it before, and he had also borrowed these death scenes. From Moby Dick. He went with the same formula that made Jaws a hit, but I really wasn't looking to read the same story twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promised a lot, but lacked more than it promised.","review":"Okay, I like deep sea adventures novels, such as Sphere, MEG, and Goliath and I picked this book, hoping for a somewhat scary novel about a giant squid. I was sadly disapointed at how boring this book is. Even during the most exciting parts of this book, it is dull. I'm just glad I didn't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting!","review":"A rewrite of Jaws? An understatement. BEAST is a bold book with a beast of immense proportions. No dumb subplots to slow you down. Just a bigger, more facinating creature and more scenes of action and terror, and the victims die in pairs. Whip Darling is a more controlled and acessible character than Brody, and his story will suit you nicely. Benchley is at full pace for his classic cynicism and quick, tense moments between people. The humor in the dialogue also soars, and unfortunatly this is his last book that doesn't deliver a series of cheesy lines. All this human material hangs in perfect balance with the BEAST, as it stalks the Bermuda waters. The final sea quest is great and doesn't linger like the Jaws one did. In the end you get a book about a huge squid and The people it affects. It also doens't waste as much time with environmental junk like WHITE SHARK did. So grab the book and read it to the fullest because. . . \\"It's not everyday you get to sniff an randy squid\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you want to forget about that beach vacation.","review":"This is the first, and as yet only, Peter Benchley book I have read. It won't by any means be my last.This book made me want to keep reading, in a way I now wish I didn't, my fear of the ocean now goes far beyond that of a fear of jellyfish (a childhood incident).This book is truly a good read, it tells the story both from the point of view of the human characters but also the 'beast' itself, what drives it to do what it does and how it is that it has come to be in the situation that it is in.I give this book 4 Stars, I look forward to reading other Peter Benchley titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"GIANT SQUID...THATS NEW","review":"A giant squid is a new(but not bad)idea.

It's one of those you love it our you hate it books"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Beast lacks bite","review":"This book is the forth on Benchley's that I have read, and it just seemed like a re-right of the others. Creature was much more exciting and suspenseful. I liked the character of Whip Darling, but thought he and his mate, Mike, could have been fleshed out better. Most of the plot was predictable and seemed to follow Jaws closely. I also thought the ending was weak and just did not have that \\"got to read\\" to find out what is going to happen. The story would have been much better if the secondary characters were more exciting. I recommend skipping this one and reading The Deep instead; both stories take place in Bermuda and The Deep is much better. However, if you are a Benchley fan, I would give it a go. Luckily, the book was much better than the TV movie that was out a few years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untouchable","review":"Once started to read I just couldn't stop.

Desert Dawn however repeats most of Desert Flower and just gives a bit of additional information about the further life of Waris. Sadly enough Waris has not learned much from her own mutilation, which she documents in circumcising her own son. Waris seems to forget that women play an important role in culture and rituals through upbringing and education of their own children.

The best thing about this product is it smells good. That is the only benefit I have experienced with it. It is so weak as an exfoliator that I also tried it with a loofah at times, but it was like lathering a soap with my loofah! Not effective and expensive, for what reason? I also will second guess an RN's suggestion next time as I see it was a marketing attempt. Just because a medical spa sells it does NOT mean it's effective, it's just a fancy looking, good smelling, medical sounding bottle of soap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 2 of Fame was great","review":"I have always loved that TV series and was sad to see it cancelled as it always had good lessons for the kidsThe kids are all grown up now, and I wanted to see the shows again.

Watching Glee made me long for the good old days with Fame, and the issues and teen angst and the attitude and the talent from the old tv show. I know the issues are dated, and the style of song is dated, but I love watching the end credits and seeing who wrote the music--because, on the whole, they didn't do covers of others' music, yes, there are several, but then there are some original compositions, even from the actors. I love the Wizard of Oz take, and I dissolve into tears every time I watch the Greg Evigan episode (country/western Romeo and Juliet, but that's not why I cry)--(all one has to do is quit doing the math). It was a more innocent time (or maybe more censored before the competition of cable shows), and a less \\"in your face\\" time, so issues are addressed without having the visuals to go with it. Okay, it's not perfect and totally realistic, but what a great time I have watching these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Crissy collector book!","review":"I am a long time doll collector and have many doll collecting books.

I also like the many pictures of the dolls outfits. The book also has a great price guide in the back to help find the value of different dolls. Many of these details about the Crissy doll I did not know. I found out that my particular doll because of her flower shaped turning knobs was one of the first models produced. The author really knows a lot about Crissy dolls and I hope she writes more doll books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!","review":"Last night, my boyfriend and I snuggled up and thoroughly enjoyed this show! We just kept watching it. He thought it was funny when I shouted out, \\"Kick it in the teeth!\\". I really got into it, in a really good, clean, fun, interesting family way. It reminds me of how much I LOVED to watch In Search Of with Leonard Nimoy, as a child. This show was interesting, showed great photographs, and was done with lots of fun and good footage. We kept asking is that real video?But then we kept watching it and it got so unbelievably lame! that we thought it was so stupid and a waste of money! and also, it seemed to be about showing girls in white t-shirts and bikinis who couldnt act and the reactments were soooooooooooooo lame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!","review":"Avoid this movie at all cost!

The information and dramatizations are setup in a way that really draws you into the myths and other supernatural happenings in a way that avoids disbelief and debunking. The whole point of it all is to give the best case for these things happening with all the evidence available so that you will find yourself a little less likely to walk up to the native american wearing wolf skins, or a little more cautious when going out at night. It is a show for believers and those that want to believe as well as those that want something to scare them a little and help fuel their imagination. The series is very well made and highly entertaining and will be enjoyed by just about everyone, even debunkers may enjoy the chance to scrutinize the show in front of them. I hope everyone gives this show a watch because it is one of the best supernatural series to be seen on television and is worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staged Footage About Cryptid Beasts","review":"I was expecting an actual documentary on the legendary Thunderbird, but instead was disappointed to find that this was nothing more than a staged act done on purpose for the sake of provoking a reaction of 'what if this really happened?'

If you want a more 'serious' take on the subject, I would suggest looking at 'Monster Quest' from the History channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"Bought this for my father in law.

Silly! Silly!","review":"When I bought this item, I thought I was buying a real-time, scientific study of cryptozoology. What I got was a series of stupid, fictionalized, very badly-acted accounts of what may or may not have been attacks by various mythological beasts. It was like watching episode after episode of the inane Blair Witch Project with different monsters in guest-starring roles. My favorite laughable moment was towards the end of the section on the Chupacabra when a thermal camera picks up three people being chased through the desert by an image who looks to be about the size and romping friskiness of a German Shepherd puppy.In my opinion, this series was a total waste of money. My advice? Anyone who is in search of a good education about cryptozoology as well as a well-done, technology-based search for said creatures should opt instead for Destination: Truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun family film","review":"This is a fun family film.

Instead, it's a fictional show pretending to be using people's lost video tapes as \\"evidence\\" of paranormal or fictional beasts (Bigfoot, lochness monster). The idea of the show is somewhat interesting but the \\"actors\\" in the \\"home movies\\" are terrible. We had to turn it off within 10 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swiss Army Compact Pocket Knife","review":"This knife is around the same dimensions as the Spartan, Tinker, etc. That means it bears the length of the 3.5 inch knives (closed) with the least amount of width. Its features, which are included in the description are functional besides the hook and the straight pin, not that I'm complaining. Quality of the knife overall is very good (as usual) except for the fact that the tip of my blade seemed slightly rounded. Perhaps it is an isolated issue.On a personal note I bought this knife to replace my Soldier knife which (I wanted to keep it in good condition) has a slightly more sturdy handling and in my opinion is truly the most beautifully designed knife aesthetically and functionally. For reference, the Soldier is slightly thinnner than the Compact and while the blade is opened the Soldier is slightly longer, maybe it's because the Soldier blade is perfectly pointed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most useful tools in a compact package","review":"Has all the tools I actually use. Rides easily in a pocket. Typical high-quality Swiss workmanship. Classic, people-friendly design. Makes a great gift for anyone, but be sure to get one for yourself, too.The only downside is the \\"multi-purpose\\" hook, for which I can't imagine even one practical use for. The literature shows carrying some kind of parcel wrapped in string. I haven't carried a parcel wrapped in string in, I don't know, 100+ years. If they replaced the hook with a phillips screwdriver or an awl this would be the perfect carry knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right size and functionality","review":"I like the black finish over the classic red. The black finish, I think, is more sylish and makes it look different from the normal Swiss Army knives. The black finish is similar to that used for the Mont Blanc pens (visually, at least).The model is just about the right size. It is not too 'fat' like the knives that have a whole bunch of features. It has just the features I need most often for everyday activites. The scissor and the knife is essential. There is the bottle opener and the corkscrew. The hook, I think is more useful than the reamer which is more common.It is hard to believe that a product of this quality can be bought for about $20. Or that it's manufacture has not moved to China."},{"rating":"2","title":"great quality","review":"the product was in perfect conditionthe box it came in was smooshed but otherwise it was perfectgreat gift idea"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product delivered seemed to be old and used","review":"I am pleased with all the tools the knife has, as expected, but bizzarely, it seems that the knife I received was not an original.

The package did not include the standard Victorinox leaflet with instructions for use/maintenance, but the packaging looked like original packaging.

The main character's, Nora Blackbird, thoughts became incomplete towards the end. It seemed as though the author was just tired of writing and ended the book. Without giving anything away, I will say that at least two of the conclusions reached by Nora were pulled from thin air. There was no mention of even how the character came up with the solutions. It just did not make any sense. Also, the book seemed unfinished. There was an issue that seemed unresolved.

His journey back home, enables him to free himself of his pain and truly see that he isn't the only one that's suffered heartache and pain along the way. He also discovers the love and acceptance in a family he never thought he was a part of. This story pulls at your heart strings and shows you how important a father's love and acceptance are to his son.

The mathematics seems to be just right for practitioners: no martingales, no girsanov theorem, but a complete treatment of binomial lattices and a semi-quantitative introduction to diffusion processes and to stochastic calculus. Problems are very well chosen. The organization of the text is standard, except for the last two chapters, related to optimal growth portfolio and to real options. Final remark: the book is excellent for self-study. I learnt the subject from Prof. Luenberger himself, and he was repeating each single word from the book, saying (as a disclaimer) that \\"it's not me copying the book... it's the book that copies what I said.

The claustrophobic setting of a funhouse after closing time is the perfect stage for elegantly lit carnage. Director Tobe Hooper made more successful films, but in my opinion, this is his best. Carpenter dazzled with suspense in Halloween, sparking the best and worst period of horror-film making in history. This is one of the best of that period. Clever opening credits tip off the edge this movie has over the spate of low-budget splatter fests that turned increasingly sadistic as they tried to outdo each other in violence levels.

It took quite a bit of time to get to the first plot point, the kids witnessing the murder. There were a lot of boring scenes at the fair before they finally got to the fun house.

The second album's tracks are also longer songs - no idea why they decided to change the formula that worked well in their first album.

I can not comment on reliability but so far so good!Also, when I bought this station I also bought the Aoyue Soldering Iron Tip Cleaner with Brass wire sponge. When assembling the iron holder for the station I realize that the holder for the brass sponge is made to screw into the same hole as the regular sponge holder that comes with the station. All you have to do is flex the handle out of the hole on each side of the sponge holder then the lip around the bottom lines up with slots on the bottom front of the iron holder.

I had no trouble soldering some heavy gauge speaker wire with this, and no trouble soldering very fine gauge battery leads. This is a very powerful and versatile tool that should definitely be on the list for electronics people who are on a budget.The only drawback I've experienced is that the barrel of the iron gets warm (but not uncomfortably so).

The sponge included is very thin but I don't recommend using them anyway due to thermal shock stresses on the tip. get yourself a nice brass wire tip cleaner. Hakko makes a good one.When done using the unit, lower the temp to the lowest setting (200) and wait for it to reach that temperature before turning off. This will prolong the tip life. Also, before it cools off, apply some solder to the tip and let it harden on there to prevent oxidation.The only real grip is the iron holder - I would have liked to see that designed a little better.

It also comes with superb instructions for this type of product, I was expecting to get none at all and was pleasantly surprised. As for performance, it heats to regular temps within one minute, although the tip takes another minute to get stabilized. The tip that came with the station is a bit small for most of the work I do, but still usable. As other reviews noted, it also came with an additional heating element.

I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"Had this soldering iron over two years now. Hate almost everything about it. It doesn't seem to make temperature, ir thermometer sets it at about 50 degrees less than the digital read out shows. The iron itself is a two piece design which allows for the ceramic heating element to be changed. This would be a nice feature however, the nut that holds the two pieces together expands when it gets hot (its on an soldering iron). When it expands it slips and the iron become crooked and unusable. You then have to wait for it to cool (or burn your fingers) and replace the nut, only to start the process over again.Do yourself a favor, spend the extra 20 dollars and just buy a weller.

In my opinion, it speaks more to Gunsmiths, and people already in the know, so to speak, than it does to someone interested in learning about the 1911-A1 pistol.Unlike many other gun publication that educate the reader through words and pictures, on a step by step basis, this book jumps right into techical jargon that was very difficult to follow and for someone new to the 1911, I found this very frustrating.

This movie enabled you to catch a glimpse of the other side of Chow Yuen Fatt ie. being funny. His versatility is what made him an international star today. If memory serves me rite, this would be Cherry's final movie before she was married to a businessman.

It's a very light-hearted, comedic movie with a pinch of romance and of course action sequences. Chow Yun Fatt, Leslie Chueng and Cherie Chung are all wonderful in the movie, but it is Chow Yun Fatt who steals most of the scenes. The 3 have a great comradery and the viewer is let in on how their relationships are interwoven with flashbacks. The movie plot is one that is familiar and similar to the better known American version of the movie, but John Woo has made this his own with the addition of a splendid sub-plot and twist at the end.

Reuniting Mr. Chow with Cantopop superstar Leslie Cheung (Kit in a Better Tomorrow I & II), This film also brings in the subjects of loyalty and betrayal.

And then they split up. The A-ha songwriter Waakatar released an album under the guise of Sayoy. Not a bad effort in itself, but it lacked any real character and direction. So that's the end of the A-ha story...... Well belive it or not, but the lead singer Morten \\"Girlie Magnet\\" Harket has managed to keep the attention of any fans left still interested. How? By releasing one of the most underrated albums of the year. \\"Wild Seed\\" is an aural rollocoster of Morten's darkest corners. Still present is \\"The Voice\\" and the unusual topic choice, but this time it is matched with some wicked songwriting, catchy tunes and an excellent production. Anyone genuinely interested in discovering good music would find it difficult to listen to this album with an unbiased ear and remain uninterested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of an angel!","review":"Having bought this album whilst on holiday in Norway, at a fantastic price, I was so grateful that I had finally found it. I loved a-ha in the eighties, but Morten's style on this album is so non-a-ha. The songs are beatifully worded and extremely moving, and sung by a guy who in my opinion has one of the best voices of our time. I feel this album is very understated and would reccomend it to any one. It has moodiness and emotion in all the songs. My favourites are the haunting rendition of spainish steps and ready to go home, which move me every time. I didn't know what to expect when I heard the album for the first time but now it is in my collection as one of my all time favourites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review of the music of an artist.","review":"I have been a fan of A-HA since the release of HUNTING HIGH AND LOW. As the years went by, the music of A-HA got better and MORTEN'S voice grew stonger. When I found out that he had 3 solo albums out, 2 of which are in Norweigan, I had to buy them. It was money well spent. His unique style and voice character is by far the one of the best in music. With the release of WILD SEED, MORTEN has taken the solo artist label and has put himself in a category apart from all the others. He sings with the grace and style that is lacking in today's music. Buy it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful album","review":"WOW!

The sure thing is that Morten keeps on moving towards the top !"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favourite album of all time","review":"This album is an absolute must whether an a-ha fan or not. Morten's voice continues to be unrivalled in the pop world and having recently attended a-ha's concert in Oslo I can tell you that a-ha are even better than ever with some songs on Minor Earth, Major Sky being hauntingly reminiscent of Wild Seed. A though provoking album taking you on a roller coaster ride of emotions Wild Seed deserves to be in everyone's record collection.

I have loved him since I was 15 and I still love him to this day (Don't tell my husband...LOL) His voice has carried me through so many tough times in my life. I am not sure where I would be today if not for him.This album is beyond wonderful. Every song is done with such passion. 'Los Angeles', 'Ready to go Home', 'Spanish Steps' and 'Lord' are incredible. They bring tears to my eyes whenever I hear them.Morten Harket is so very much more than a pop idol from the 80's, he is a brilliant song writer with a voice that the boy bands of today can only dream of matching.

The velcro strap at the top holds about all the weight, and is more than sufficient to secure the bag.

I keep fearing that he will become stale or repetitive, but the stories flowed as fresh and funny as ever. It was wonderful to revisit Harmony, and to experience that great combination of old friends and edgy humor. My only complaint may be that Gulley was a might too edgy with this one. The character of Dale comes to mind specifically; he did not seem quite so ignorant in previous books, nor did Sam seem quite so callous towards him. Then again, it is almost worth it to see how Dale is contained (temporarily I'm sure) in the end. When I did reach the end of Signs and Wonders, I found myself a little sad that I won't be visiting Harmony until the next book comes out.

Not a satisfying read from an author who can do much more"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose \\"tales\\"","review":"\\"Lizard\\" is the third release by Banana Yoshimoto. It is a collection of short stories. My first impression was that these are very bizarre stories. Everybody is pretty much messed up. However, I thought that there wasn't much character development since these were only short stories. \\"Lizard\\" and \\"A Strange Tale By The River\\" were pretty good, though. Banana focused more on Buddhist type faith and spirituality more than anything else. These souls aren't lost to the darkness of nothingness... but rather... to an endless cycle of rebirth or patterns.Perhaps great story concepts, but a little untidy since left undeveloped. Even if they all come together as flashes of darkness, which I first thought, it seems a little lacking in strength to pull it all together. An interesting read, nonetheless. The language is not difficult, and it's interesting if you're not over-analyzing or looking too deeply into things."},{"rating":"1","title":"These stories are so rambling they don't have a point","review":"I found this book to be a jumble of words that were trying to tell a story.

I guess I enjoyed it; I did finish it and have few complaints. However, I felt that it lacked a certain fluidity of language and style. Who knows? It is difficult to say when you are dealing in translations. Whatever the case, there were a few redeeming qualities and underlying themes... Yoshimoto's skill for creating images that stand out, her ability to hint at bigger themes (although it is disappointing that she neglects to pursue them more deeply.) Such themes that she touches but does not tackle include the transitory nature of things, living a pop culture sort of life in a pop culture sort of world, loss/growing up, self-discovery, reflections on everyday events and how they eventually shape who we are, and the constraints of traditional Japanese culture and the changes within it. But Yoshimoto just touching these matters makes it seem simply... cliche."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheers, Cheers For Old Notre Dame","review":"Being from Miami, you can only imagine how much my title hurts. Anyway, this is one fantastic movie, and you cannot help but cheer during it.Sean Austin plays Daniel \\"Rudy\\" Ruettiger, an undersized student who always dreamed of playing for the Notre Dame college football team. To get there, he has to overcome many obstacles, and play for the practice squad, running the opposition's plays. It is a difficult course, but one in which Rudy refuses to give up on.The acting is great, as Austin turns in a remarkable performance. Charles S. Dutton plays his inspirational friend/boss very well, and Ned Beatty is excellent as Rudy's blue-collar father. The plot, based on a true story, is nicely drawn out, and leaves you feeling inspired.Overall, this is a real entertaining film that you are guaranteed to enjoy.

As for originality, well, I think I can stop here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rudy was a professional pest.","review":"A gifted athelete that overcame the odds? No. A stellar career in college sports? No. An enormous desire to have a Notre Dame education? No. Rudy had an unhealthly obsession with ND football. He was not good enough to play for them. He merely wouldn't go away and so he pestered his way into a couple of plays (if that). Mind you he should be proud that he got an education at a fine university like ND but that isn't why he went there. If you want a good ND film try Knute Rockne All American. Do you want an inspirational sports story, try Brian's Song, The Pride of the Yankees or Hoosiers. These are the stories of athletes that gave it all for their team. Rudy had nothing to give so he asked the team to give it to him.

There is NO method here."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Dead on","review":"I'm not one to leave verbose feedback - especially about a book. However, the book describes someone like me with uncanny accuracy. I've always joked that I have ADD. What I learned though, was that ADD is more than just being distractable. It is also about the tendencies to \\"think outside of the box\\", look for faster solutions, different approaches, and in general, how ADD people are \\"different\\" from societal norms.What attracted me to this book is its premise that ADD types are \\"different\\", not broken. It endorses the Hunter/Farmer theme espoused by Thom Hartman.While the book does not compare ADD to Myers Briggs, I suspect there is a correlation between ADD and such Myers Briggs types of ENFP, ENFJ, etc. I say this as I've done Myers Briggs profiling and am an ENFP. The description to this is very similar to ADD traits. So, I am curious.I highly recommend the book if for nothing more than its elaborations on what characteristics a person with ADD has."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The absence of method is the method\\"","review":"\\"The absence of method is the method\\", finally on page 246 Loporto reveals the truth.

The author's ability to coherently intertwine these three mysteries into one grippingly satisfying, if at times nail biting, drama, make it a novel that will appeal to all, and the author's ability to weave together into one tale the intellectual, emotional , and spiritual aspects that accompany any tragedy will draw you into the characters as few novels have ever done. It is not just a book for mystery lovers, or Viet Nam Vets., or for any group or sect, it is a book to be enjoyed, and treasured by all."},{"rating":"1","title":"These taste terrible!

I would recommend this to others as I think the taste and ingredients are better than the rest. Even my kids like them!

It sort of reminds me of a standard granola bar, but with \\"more\\" to it. Plus they are still a little chewy.

The PowerBars are an easy way to bring something along to eat, so that I do not threaten to gnaw off my arm during class. I really enjoy their taste - they are more like a granola bar than a traditional power/protein bar. They remind me of a mix between a Luna Nuts Over Chocolate bar and a Quaker chocolate chip bar. Only - the PowerBar, being larger and having more calories, stays with you longer than either of those alone.If you are trying to avoid excessive sugar - you may want to stick to fresh chopped veggies, because while the PowerBars are tasty - they do have 18 grams of sugar each"},{"rating":"1","title":"little disappointed","review":"I was a little disappointed in the taste, I felt it had an aftertaste.

Listening to this album is best done in one sitting, as an entirety, rather than dissected track by track.

He does have some great sounding vox here & there, but personally I think LG did a better job. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Aside from the vox, the album itself is pretty good.

But it's very enjoyable especially when the film is flawlessly written, directed, acted & photgraphed as is Midnight. I grew up as a kid back in the late '30s & '40s enjoying Don Ameche & Claudette Colbert being paired in various movies. As wonderful as they are, seeing John Barrymore is a special delight. He could take a poorly written script in a B movie & transform it into a one-man show. milking it for all its worth. He doesn't have to do that here of course, but he is an added attraction to an already superlative movie. Flawless entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy of Manners Jumps Curve & Goes Screwball Masterpiece","review":"Holy Cow! Here's a screwball comedy that's goes well beyond the curve of all others. Watching Midnight is like riding up a rainbow; it takes every opportunity to go over the top, then, with each outrageously inventive plot turn made more devilishly elegant than the previous, goes ten paces further. My jaw dropped. Pure shimmering wit and droll pleasures await, along with a head turning postmodern twist on the 'comedy of remarriage' that's eons ahead of its time. One of the most divine pieces of entertainment ever devised for celluloid. This long overlooked masterpiece is easily a candidate for one of film history's greatest comedies. Oh, did I mention I loved it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little-known film!!","review":"It's enjoyable from beginning to end, with superb performances by Colbert, Ameche (one of his finest) and a slipping John Barrymore.

The suggested characteristics of both nannies and parents described by the authors were fair and will make the hiring process easier for all involved. The authors recognize that it is just as difficult for the nannies to find the right families as it is for the parents to find the perfect nanny. I found this book to be very helpful through this process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!","review":"This is a most interesting account of the life of Abigail, wife of King David.

Every once in a while, I find a philosophy, concept, or book that greatly enhances my improvement process. Amy's book does this for me. Unlike many self-help books that belabor a subject, Amy describes her lessons in simple but direct terms. She goes straight to the point and does not over-write the subject.Having been in quite a few relationships over many years, I have read many books about the single life. Take Heart! is one of the best. Buy the book, read it, use it as a tool for improving your relationships, re-read the book from time to time. I think you will be amazed that Amy's lessons will change your life.Take Heart! Stories of Encouragement for Singles, PLUS 10 Lessons You'll Need to Find Mr. or Ms. Right by Amy M.

I wish so much I would have known about it several years before I did. I know it would have helped me in my dating relationships - especially the chapter on pacing relationships. I didn't fully appreciate the importance of developing a relationship in the progressive manner suggested in Amy Owens' book. After reading the book, it made sense why some of my relationships were not successful. I can definitely see now why it is such a necessity to go through the various stages and the importance of communicating that to your partner. I would highly recommend this book and have, in fact, given several copies to my newly single friends as a show of support - passing on what I wish I would have known sooner. It definitely contains great, practical advice - even for those of us who had been single for awhile before they learned about the book.

The valuable contents of the Church History, along with the Life of Constantine and the Oration in Praise of Constantine, make this one-volume compendium of Christian history indispensible. The worth of this volume cannot not be over-exagerated, when the scholarly and comprehensive introductions are considered, and when the vast and learned footnotes are rekoned as well. This is just the work for the engaged and concentrated reader of this period in history. The whole Church Fathers series by Phillip Schaff is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inspiring karate movie","review":"This is one of the best double feature can offer. The first one deals with self struggle to win a competition with Korea team in a tornament. Very good feel movie, kinda like Rocky 4.

There's a courtroom scene which took over 8 hours to shoot and is about 3 minutes long. That's the only reason I saw it. This movie stunk. The plot was lame. Nothing surprising. The writing sucks. Philip Rhee isn't the best actor. Gina Gershon can act but the writing, again, it poor. If you actually like the first two, then I guess you'll like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just about what I expected, only more boring...","review":"I'm sorry, I love Gina Gershon and I was looking forward to watching this movie since I do like action films. But this is such a run of the mill martial arts flick. I wasn't even intrigued to watch the whole thing without hitting the fast forward button through most of the show.The basis of this movie - the main character is an expert martial artist who comes to town just as a rising of an Aryan militia becomes prominent nearby. It starts with them killing the black preacher everyone loves who promotes people to stop hate, and the white boys in the militia don't like that. *gasp, I never would have guessed*Main character kicks everyone's behind, gets the girl, acting is horrible and the plot could be pasted to any B flick action film.Your time could be better spent watching paint dry. Or if you're desperate for something like this then watch Universal Soldier, at least it was funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Best of the Best series","review":"I thought that this third installment was the best of the series because of its story.

I found it very technical and a little impersonal. It offered so many different possible explanation for self injury that all it actually ended up saying was that no one really knows why people deliberately hurt themselves. I also didn't like the way it referred to self injury as \\"self mutilation\\" throughout the book. It is too harsh a term, and not one that sufferers like to use or hear. Overall, the book gives much information about self injury, some of it very scientific, but it is not the best choice if you are a person who hurts yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Goes the Boat","review":"This guy completely missed it.

The author was a doctor at UMC where I earned three degrees, including a Master's in Counseling Psychology.

The depth is incredible; the authors mention somewhere that they stayed in Cancun for two months, and it shows. It's not just Cancun either - the coverage of Cozumel, Playa del Carmen, the Mayan ruins, and all up and down the coast is excellent. The problem with some guides (Lonely Planet, Frommers, etc) is they \\"take sides\\" - they're either too cynical about \\"gringos on vacation\\" or totally ignore anything that's not sold in a package. The Moon book really showed both sides: from beaches and nightclubs and five-star restaurants, to museums and Mayan ruins and street food. (Real culture in Cancun - who knew??)

I will strongly recommend the book to all Master Masons and above who are desirous of having the true explanation of the esoteric meaning of Masonry, as well as its true origins in the Ancient Mysteries. Unfortunately it will not be as meaningful to a non-Mason who does not possess the Masonic keys to unlock the numerous abbreviated key words in the book.

All intensity is driven out by muddled use of adverbs and convoluted plot threads. Horror of any sort, suggested or explicit, does not enter the story into well over 50 pages and the book isn't very long.

The Avate wash cloth I recently purchased here is ok. It shrunk when wet and the ends roll, which sometimes makes it hard to hold onto while washing. It still feels good in that it feels like it exfoliates as described, but I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. It was the opposite of the one I was used to, shrinking when wet and curling.

With this system it is possible to play an entire campaign/chronicle/series/etc and never roll dice, but if the dice are used it is possible not only to do highly heroic feats, but also to slay an opponent with one stroke of the katana (however unlikely against very powerful opponents). The dice system is based on d10, and you'll never need more than 10 of them; the system is otherwise similar to shadowrun, where the face value of the rolled die is actually important.

His specific complaint was that Imply and Infer were treated as synonyms. And while it is true that many people use them that way, educated usage would frown on such. Alas. Those times are gone, my friend. We thought they'd never end.A prescriptive dictionary is probably hard to find these days.

Excellent, excellent book!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this much!","review":"I have read many Autism books and I am always looking to find out more info about this. I picked this book up at the library and I mainly skimmed the book. It was very boring. Chapter 11 Learning and forgetting at school was the only chapter in the whole book that was informative. It explained my son to a tee. The school system does not understand children with autism . They don't understand they learn different, Their behavior is not always them acting defiant. There are many other books on this subject that are much better such as Autism for dummies.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price is to high!","review":"This streaming cost $39.99 and you can buy the bluray box set for $25.00? This pricing doesn't make sense and what's the incentive to purchase streaming when you can have the actually discs for way cheaper? I love this show though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray is cheaper","review":"Seriously Amazon, the convenience factor is not worth almost double the price. Get the Blu-Ray and rip it to a PC, also saves the DRM hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time on Blu-ray and still on a very high level!","review":"The show still keeps the high level of the first 3 seasons, so if you liked them you will not be disapointed. The Blu-ray looks good but not perfect. The picture could be more detailed and some scenes especially those in the McLaren's are quiet dark and on a low contrast level, but still a big leap from the DVD.btw.: the BR is region free!5 stars for the show and 4 for the presentation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sit Com, Perfect for Fun Romantic Entertainment","review":"HIMYM is not so much an original sitcom, but instead more of the perfection of the sitcom. Every once in awhile I feel I've seen a similar episode of friends or will & grace. But I can't deny how much fun the show is to watch. I love all of the characters, and enjoy watching their various adventures. This season had some great stand outs like the news years eve episode where they take three (3) separate stories and find a way to intertwine them, the \\"intervention\\" episode, where they had an intervention because they had too many interventions, and of course my personal fav Barney's family (when you see it, you'll understand.)Sure, the show may not be the most original, but it sure is fun. And frankly, not every show has to be the Wire to be great. I highly recommend this show, and can't wait for season 5!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray discs don't play","review":"Like other reviewers, my discs had trouble launching on our PS3.

I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT show, but not as amazing as first 3 seasons","review":"So I'm a huge fan of this show, I have the first 4 seasons and I can tell you straight off the bat that this show is great! First impression was that I was watching a different version of That 70's show, because it had the same style of sitcom, a mixture of romance and comedy, and definitely comedy!As for the show itself, I definitely recommend watching it. As for this specific season, if you do not have any others I suggest getting an earlier season, my personal favorite is season 2.My reasoning for this is that by season 4, there seems to not be a story anymore, the plot of How I Met Your Mother is based around the goal of the main character, Ted, trying to find the love of his life. By season 4, there's many random episodes, with no part of them having anything to do with Ted searching for love. The same thing goes for season 5.Other than that, have fun watching this show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious show!","review":"Another great season with Ted, Marshall, Lily, Robin, and Barney! Anyone in their late 20's/early 30's can relate to this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Show Rocks","review":"Its great to have such a consistently good show at your fingertips. Sure the first two seasons were better, but How I Met Your Mother has remained sharp and inventive with both its material and delivery throughout its run and I still find myself pulling this DVD off the rack enough to make the others start collecting dust. What can I say, its one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't play on PS3","review":"How can they make a BluRay disc that refuses to work in a PS3 (slim)? Is it some overbearing new copy protection scheme? Something else? I thought these things were supposed to be universally playable, but apparently not. I can't get this to play on a PS3, one of the most popular blu ray players out there. Read around and you will see other people have had the exact same problem. It's been a know issue for months and still no one has fixed it. Wish I could get my money back and buy the DVD instead.

In addition the premise of a future Ted telling the story is getting very old and irritating.

It's like I'm dead inside when I watch this show. Believe me, I'll laugh at anything. I'm practically a simpleton. But this show makes me want to log onto Amazon and write horrible things about it. Jason Segal? Gross. Neil Patrick Harris? Smarmy. Oh and now he is going to infiltrate one of the only shows I make it a point to watch on a regular basis (Glee). Lovely.

Barney and Marshall as ever are very funny and at this stage I'm getting used to Ted's procrastination and self doubt. The earlier parts of the season were a little flat, but once Stella departed the scene, the old magic returned. Overall, very happy with the season. I just wish Ted's story would finally get moving instead of all the false starts we have glimpsed. Even the kids on the sofa are really starting to look uninterested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show, doesn't work on PS3","review":"I love HIMYM, and season 4 was a a good season (not as good as the first 3 but worth every minute).

This set of songs is the ultimate Iris set, and \\"Love is Like a Rock\\" is Donnie's opus. Great, yet under rated artist. This entire set of songs are great, and his later albums are worth a listen. Donnie Iris deserves a spot in Rock history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"The only problem I have with The French Admiral is the atempt to write accents into dialogue.

We can agree they play over two minutes sometimes! Judicial Slime and I, abstain are examples of Napalm Death spewing their genius upon the genre of grindcore and metal beyond. We can take Metal classics like Utopia Banished or leave them to forever decay in the dust.

And some tracks get downright creepy, \\"Contemptuous\\", for example, a wonderful echoing stomp. And you even get the patented throat-bleeding Barney Scream on a few songs to feed your bloodlust.

The little time they actually show Mariah is the same shot over and over, I don't think they had any permission to use actual photos or video of Mariah.

Get it, and read it, before you go, and enhance your trip!!I might note that my high recommendation extends to all books in this series.

The kids in our family love looking at the pictures and I love the color photos identifying not only many of Florida's seashells but also other mysterious matter that you may happen to find on the beach. I've read it over and over and still find something new each time I read it. There's a section on cleaning shells, how shells reproduce (this is mind-blowing!). What is so interesting is many shells are shown with their inhabitants inside so you now know exactly what kind of animal made that beautiful shell you now have in your hand. The book covers areas in Florida such as the famous Sanibel, as well as other beaches on the West Coast, the Keys and South Florida. You'll discover which shell is worth thousands of dollars, which lump of stuff found on the beach is more valuable than gold and so much more.

Then Secrets of a Civil War Submarine is not for you. Secrets of a Civil War Submarine is an informational book about one of the first submarines, The Hunley, and it shows you how the ship works, all of the crew members, and all of the boring missions. Maybe it sounds interesting to you, but to me it is very boring. The only thing that won't keep you from falling asleep is the part where you figure out why the submarine sank. At the end it shows you what they think the crew looks like, and artifacts that were found, and the secrets that the captain kept. If this sounds like the book for you then read it. But I do not like this book, and I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Seafaring stealth weapon","review":"Out of all the books i read this book had to be on my top ten most favorite books.This book was the most entertaining for all ages.This book was about a confederate submarine that was built to destroy the union blockade which was stoping other ships from porting to trade goods and many other objects.So there was a man thats name was Horace Hunley he was the man behind the sub.The sub was named the hunley after horace built it.That was the beggining of a legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price","review":"I find it hard to believe that the cost of this book, and the other series cost...wow I can not believe anyone in his right mind would pay these prices for used books or even a new book...paper back..yes I would love to purchase this series, but at these prices I will Read johnstones books at a very reasonable cost....wow I get upset just thinking about your prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 12 years, I'm buying a new copy","review":"After 12 years of having this indispensible \\"bible\\" in my kitchen, it finally bit the dust, so I'm buying another copy on Amazon today.

A must have for any culinarian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book but not for recipes","review":"This book is one of the best books in my collection. It is not a recipe book, nor is it a book on presentation with pretty pictures. It is a book to help you take the next step in developing your own recipes or to use as a reference when improvising. I have found several uses for this book so far and I keep it close at hand any time I am in the kitchen.1. This is a great reference for what foods go together.2. Helps in figuring out how to balance flavours.3. A source of inspiration for new recipes.4. The few recipes in this book are actually very good.I would not reccommend this as a beginer book. It will be most useful once you have a handle on some techniques and a variety of recipes. I really cannot say enough good things about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"By my side","review":"I initially bought this book, because it was the sequel to Becoming a Chef. Since I have graduated from culinary school, this book has not left my side. The charts of seasonality and flavor combinations are essential for any chef or apprentice chef. There are recipes which can be chenged and manipulated any way the cook sees fit. Culinary Artistry is unbiased view of what some chefs deem important need to know information about certain types of food. This book makes me want to write a cook book. Any home gourmande will also love this book, it holds ingredients in the best light possible. Telling how and why to buy seasonally, to shop at local markets within your area, to support local businesses and people. If you are passionate about food and cooking food, you WILL love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot to wade through, but it's all good","review":"If you're the type of person that loves to cook, already has a lot of recipe books, likes to experiment, and wants to take their cooking to the next level, then this book is for you.Most of the reviews very clearly say what this book is and what it isn't. So I will just reiterate that this book is perfect for advanced cooks looking to really expand their presentation, flavor pairings and artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best place to experience the cult of the New American chef.","review":"\\"The husband-and-wife writing team of Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page -- he is a chef, she a journalist -- has produced four books in the past six years, and these are the best place to experience the cult of the New American chef. The most over-the-top of their books is the second, CULINARY ARTISTRY, which is dedicated to 'the original Creator' and goes on to treat the chef as being only a small notch down from Him. 'We have been awed by the unusual levels of perceptiveness we've experienced America's leading chefs as possessing; we believe some to have certain skills of extrasensory perception,\\" they write. The assumption underlying CULINARY ARTISTRY is that being a great chef, like being a great artist, is far more a matter of talent than of training, and that making great food is a matter of imaginatively, instinctively combining flavors -- Abstract Expressionism with coulis.\\"--Nicholas Lemann, THE NEW YORKER"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"I can't, for the life of me, figure out why this book is getting such rave reviews. I found it to be a major disappointment, mostly because the reviews led me to expect much more. This book is for the TOTALLY clueless, ie., those who don't know that rosemary goes with lamb and chicken, apples with pork, beans with bacon, etc. I can see how it could help jumpstart a kitchen novice, but if a professional chef needs this book he/she is in the wrong profession. There's absolutely nothing new here. To make matters worse, it's in boring black and white with not one image (color or otherwise) to inspire or break the monotony. I've tried again and again to find a reason to keep this book but can't come up with one. It's up for sale. Sorry folks, I just can't agree on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic concept and well executed","review":"This cookbook is truly unique. Instead of merely listing recipes for the reader to duplicate, this book lists flavor combinations that work and teaches would be chefs how to create their own recipes.

This book is extremely important for my son as he is attending culinary school and is required."},{"rating":"1","title":"Culinary Artistry","review":"Culinary Artistry came up with a 4.5 star rating in a search pattern for \\"Garnishing\\". The book is more concerned with matching of flavours - flavours, spices, herbs and foods that go together. In a roundabout way this does have relevance to garnishing. Culinary Artistry is overly engrosed in listing individual chefs favorite ingedients and methods of cooking that I felt was irrelevant and did not in its presented format convey enough information i.e more recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Culinary Artistry","review":"What a piece of Crap...

However, where are the pictures? The title makes it sound as though the book will be filled with all sorts of beautiful images, but the cover is all you really get. Food art is more than simply taste, but it is also presentation. This book lacks presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Book - allows for new thinking on food.","review":"This book opens my mind to new ways of thinking about food and it's presentation.

Amazon got it right in spades: \\"Culinary Artistry\\" is yet another breakthrough approach to thinking about food by these authors. Cuisines, menus, dishes and flavors are both constructed and deconstructed, providing the experienced cook with a blueprint for successful experimentation. This book is an invaluable resource to anyone confident enough in the kitchen to want to innovate, yet smart enough to know that it's important to know the \\"rules\\" before you try to break them successfully. This is an absolutely brilliant book, one that I have referred to almost daily since it's been in my possession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duh, what the hell is this?","review":"I ordered this book, it came, I scanned it and went 'boy, this is useless'. That was four years ago or so and have since discovered that every time I pull pork chops from the freezer and go 'what should I do with this?' - I reach for Culinary Artistry - look under pork and see what other ingredients, spices, wines, cheese - go with it. Its a great way to validate your own instincts about what to combine with what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a useful source","review":"As I culinary student, I bought this book looking for some inspiration as well as instruction. The book begins by showing how it is impossible to learn how to be a culinary artist, that it is a gift. Interspersed are some rules as well as flavor references that left a lot to be desired. The rest includes anecdotes of different dishes that chefs had created. Chefs described their rules for creating art as food, which most focused on using classic flavor combination while denigrating non-authentic or fusion cuisine. Usually these stories showed how the chefs broke their own rules. The book did not flow very well. I was hoping for a textbook or guide, but it was more like reading a bunch of magazine features on different chefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"flavor artistry","review":"A great resource if you are looking to understand pairings of ingredients, complentary and contrasting flavors, building layers of tastes, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information for those who like to cook!","review":"Great book!

There is nothing, I repeat, nothing of value in this book for the cook. It is a series of desultory reflections about food and flavor by famous chefs, none of which are helpful or interesting. And those wonderful tables - lots and lots of them with such valuable insights like bananas are sweet and anchovies are salty. Or that we eat asparagus in the spring. There is no organization to the book (probably because there's no real content), and anything that might be of interest is lost in a sea of tedious irrelvancy. Shame on these two authors. I felt horribly taken advantage of, and this is the only (non) cookbook which I ever threw into the garbage can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit List 1993 movie","review":"This was a good movie....lots of twists, and good acting all around.

The first time I bought it I hated it, but after repeated listens the songs definitely grow on you. They have a certain nostalgia charm about them that gives them longevity. The songs are kind of cheesy, but in a fun way. \\"The Heart Of Rock & Roll\\" and \\"Walkin On A Thin Line\\", for example, don't really have much depth to them, but they're still well done and fun to listen to. Not an essential album, but if you like 80's music or Huey Lewis then you'll probably like this.Highlights include:\\"The Heart Of Rock & Roll\\"\\"Heart & Soul\\"\\"Bad Is Bad\\"\\"I Need A New Drug\\"\\"Walkin' On A Thin Line\\"\\"Finally Found A Home\\" (very guilty pleasure)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Compressed to death","review":"I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should... Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint). I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup. I don't think I should have to disrespect the author of the music by buying a album that is 1/10 of the original data in mp3 format. I would gladly pay an extra $5 dollars or whatever for wav handling, I don't think this is too much to ask.

All the dated synths and monotonous drum machines and the \\"dwee-doos\\" of \\"I Want A New Drug\\", not to mention Mr Lewis' annoying vocal style. Even the #1 hit \\"Heart of Rock n Roll\\" is one of the worst songs about rock celebrating itself. It sounds just like Michael Jackson and Phil Collins, which is not a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive album of Huey Lewis and The News","review":"Sports was a career defining album for Huey Lewis and The News. It heralded their rise in popularity from 1983 through 1984. No collection of 80's albums is complete without Sports.Sports was the big breakthrough album for Huey Lewis and The News that put them on the charts in 1983. For at least the next 18 months, you could not turn on a top 40 radio station without hearing songs like \\"The Heart of Rock & Roll\\", \\"If This Is It\\" and \\"I Want A New Drug\\". Sports pushed them to stardom, and most of the tracks from Sports tend to make up half the tracks of their greatest hits collections.Sports is a great album that is the definitive work of a great band. The Huey Lewis and The News sound is evident in every single track. As much as their sound defines this album, Sports defines the career of Huey Lewis and The News."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! A classic gets the treatment it deserves!","review":"There are three staple albums in the Huey Lewis & The News canon--SPORTS, FORE and HARD AT PLAY (and hopefully their latest, PLAN B, will join them ((please don't be another SMALLWORLD!)))-- but SPORTS, as far as I know, is the only one of their albums to be given the *remastered & expanded* treatment, and deservedly so. It was their first smash-hit and one of the defining musical works of the 1980s. All I can say is wow! Sounds even better than before with the addition of bonus live tracks and session recordings that let you feel like you were sitting in with the band during it's early stages. I hope that FORE and HARD AT PLAY will be next in line and I've got my fingers crossed for PLAN B--Come on, Huey, don't leave us hanging for another ten years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT TO MISS!","review":"Definitively a \\"must\\" for R&R fanatics!

I had the tape of Sports and listened to it for hours on end. Anyway, recently I tried to find my tape and it was gone, so I decided to get the CD. It was as good now as it was back then.I liked the extra tracks on this CD, esp. the live ones, but the extra \\"Heart of Rock and Roll\\" track was AWFUL! It sounds like Huey had a cold that day, and there was no saxophone, just Huey going \\"duh-duh, duh-duh\\", no harmonica, etc. Who in the heck thought that it would be a good idea to include this track on the CD? Couldn't they have gotten their hands on a good live track? Oh well, the live cut of \\"If This Is It\\" makes up for it some...Other than that, this CD rules. You should buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huey Lewis","review":"Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83,I think they really came into their own, commercial and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far much more bitter, cynical sense of humour."},{"rating":"1","title":"A five star album turned into a two star piece of rubbish!","review":"At least one other reviewer hit the nail right on the head with his \\"two star\\" review of SPORTS (Remastered/Expanded Edition). If you can imagine taking your 5-band EQ and turning the treble end all the way down and the bass end all the way up, that's what you're getting on this CD. To quote Huey, \\"sometimes bad is bad,\\" but this is one case where bad is pure garbage.I just put my original vinyl copy of Sports on the turntable, and it sounds fantastic! If you need this on CD, look for the earlier edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remastered? You cannot be serious!","review":"To think I sold my old cd to get the \\"better\\" sounding \\"remastered\\" version with extra tracks! 2 stars because even without the bonus tracks which in this case doesn't help the cd at all, this is actually quite a good album; I also got the cassette when this came out and quite frankly, even the cassette sounded better than this!The sound quality is very, very poor so I'd recommend if you haven't already got this, to wait for another better remastered version or even get the original untouched cd if you can still find it as there is really no noticeable difference. Perhaps if there is a well produced \\"Best of\\" compilation, that may be a good idea to get too especially to get \\"Do You Believe In Love\\" as well which I still think is their greatest hit ever.

Not only that, but of course apart from the forensic evidence and police eyewitness testimony from the crime scene, we have NO IDEA what happened that night. Why? Because we only have the word of the murderers, and I am not about to believe a thing they tell anyone, even if it's at their own expense.

Keyboard player Bob Andrews left the Rumour before this recording and he is sorely missed. Not just because the keyboard playing is bad, which it is. Nicky Hopkins may have played with lots of big stars, but his playing on this record is just dumb, hopelessly confused.Everything that made the Rumour a great band is gone from this record, they sound like a dumb bar band here. None of the great ensemble playing you expect, just pedestrian bashing. Andrews must have done a lot of arranging on those first few GP+Rumour records.Blame it on Jimmy Iovine, I guess. But Parker has to take the blame too. Songs and singing good enough, this record should have been great. It's just lousy."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO WHAT","review":"never captured my attention nothing remotely rememerable, SOUNDS POOR MIDDLE OF THE ROAD latter day weve lost it VITALITY,black,sabatoge; ill take Manilla road any day OR even ORCHESTRAL MANUEVERS IN THE dark any time over this carbon copy vacancy, ALTHOUGH THE cover art is FINE."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it...","review":"If Cathedral was your first encounter with this genre, you'd likely go no further and miss out on some great music. Try Electric Wizard instead -- 'Dopethrone' is a doom-groove masterpiece. Cathedral are just cartoon-Sabbath grinders with a vocalist who sounds like Hawkwind's Dave Brock with a sore throat. Yes, that bad. If they'd mixed him down a bit it might have helped...How Napalm Death could ever have spawned this fossil, especially when you consider the quality of their other offshoots (Carcass, Godflesh, Scorn etc.), is beyond me.

NOTHINGThis is Napalm Death's finest hour, combining old and new influences. The album starts off with a grinding power chord in their classic \\"Twist The Knife (Slowly)\\" and the mind-raping barrage of assault does not let up up until the final blasts of \\"Fasting on Deception\\". Com ... or high water, Napalm Death are sure to shove a good amount of ... grindcore down your throat and have your worthless corpse begging for mercy.Best songs: Twist The Knife (Slowly), Remain Nameless, Plague Rages, More Than Meets The Eye, Armageddon X7, and Throw Away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read.","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. The reasons why:-Well written. Hard book to put down. You want to know what's happening next.-Great insight into early 20th century America.

Too bad, I paid less for another Nvie necklace and I was more satisfied with that one than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"An avid Jance fan, I was greatly disappointed by Kiss of the Bees. Between the Native American legends, multiple flashbacks, information inconsistencies and extremely fortutious coincidences, the story is hard to follow. I reached page 100 and realized that I didn't care about any of the chacters, perhaps because they didn't come across as real people. Also the blood and gore seemed gratitutious -oh, here is a chance to show what a bad guy the killer is- rather than adding to a scarey atmosphere. Also, I'm tired of authors doing the Indian is a mystic power who communicates with the other world, so all the one character has to do is touch the book and he knows bad things are going to happen. It just came across as false and cliche. I love J.J. Jance's other books. I hope she goes back to writing those kind of books - page-turning thrilling plots, and real characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss of the Bees","review":"Shame on Judith...a lexicon of words I have no interest in learning. Please stick with Brady and Beaumont."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean Characters, Little Empathy","review":"Jance is a strong storyteller, but I didn't enjoy this novel because too many of the characters are mean-spirited. I didn't like spending time with them and didn't want to read about them. Yes, they had reasons to obsess over revenge, but since I never felt they were justified, I didn't feel sorry for them. Jance builds suspense, however, and vividly depicts the Tucson setting.This stand alone is a departure for Jance, but I'm not convinced she's stretching herself in believable ways. For example, she has a jailed inmate talking about \\"rewriting a scenario.\\" Maybe this has happened, but it doesn't ring true. She's also quite didactic here. She wants to teach her readers about Native Americans, but this book about violent revenge is the wrong venue to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish","review":"J.A. Jance is a wonderful writer. Her stories are fresh and her characters well developed. I love reading aboutplaces I know so well. But for me she is too violent. I couldn't finish this book.

But I don't think it benefits the soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor character development","review":"I like her JP Beumont books but this book seems to think I have been acquainted with the characters in other books, which I have not.

But, I was not impressed. If you take away all the Native American references you are left with a pale imitation of a Diehl, Cornwell, or Harris book. Lani, of course, is the perfect daughter whom no real harm comes to. In the end Davy's intervention isn't even needed and I couldn't help wondering if the time spent on him wasn't for the purpose of upping the page count. As for the parents they show no insight or realization into their own culpability regarding their children's present day circumstances. This might have actually made them interesting characters. And did anyone not know the killer would die by falling in the hole in the cave?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jance at her worst","review":"I didn't even want to finish the book.

Carcass has sold out big time with this album.Pop culture kills art again with promises of making real money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you're a fan of true Death Metal, check out every album Carcass recorded before this one. By the time they made this album they were clearly not interested in playing Death Metal anymore (neither were many of the founding bands of this scene by this point). This album is a silly blend of what the band used to be (Death Metal) and something akin to early 80's/late 70's British heavy metal. If you're into watered down pseudo-Death Metal, then this is for you (although there's better bands out there who do this lighter form of metal better, i.e. Iron Maiden or Judas Priest), but if you're a fan of true Death Metal and music that is heavy and fast, check out Carcass's earlier albums, or pretty much anything by released before 1994 by Napalm Death, Entombed, Morbid Angel or any number of other good bands that were out there founding the Death Metal scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring and stupid carcass...","review":"I wish carcass kept grind because they suck at trying to be deathmetal...Just doesn't work at all!

Even the cover art is crap. Come on a peace sign??!! Carcass was my favorite band for a while. They were everything you could want in music. Fast, aggressive music with intelligent lyrics mixed with excellent musicianship. Now they sound like every other band out there. I hope it was worth it...selling out all of your fans for this heaping pile of crap....If you are into grindcore steer far clear of this album as this is NOT what Carcass really is (was)...this is there \\"Black Album\\" what a bunch of sell outs...I NEVER thought that this would happen to Carcass...Pick up everything that they released before this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sellout? I think not..........","review":"It's always amused me that so many people label this as Carcass's \\"sell-out\\" album. So what is wrong with having a solid production effort, and providing a more melodic approach to what at the end of the day is still an extremely hard-hitting and mind-numbing sound? Make no mistake, this is still Carcass in all their glory, but that is what sets them apart from so many of their contemporaries in the genre; an ability to adapt, develop and ultimately to not take themselves too seriously.\\"Heartwork\\" sees the band drop the medical dictionary fixated lyrics, but the music is still as heavy as it ever was. Bill Steer's guitar work in particular on this album is peerless. From the musicianship on display on this album, right down to the HR Giger cover art work, this is a band at the height of their powers, and the finished product is certainly one to be savoured if you like your music hard and uncompromising. An absolute must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually lots of great tips","review":"I'm a long time Photodshop user and I did find lots of very useful tips.

The big international hit is the only sad song here, although it blends in well with the rest of the album.Many of the other songs are originals. My favorites are River road, All I wanna do in life and the title track, but all of them are brilliant. There are at least two covers. The oldest song here (It's all right with me) is by Cole Porter despite being sometimes credited to Irving Berlin. Green door was a fifties pop hit in the USA for Jim Love and in the UK for Frankie Vaughn. It was revived by Shakin' Stevens in the eighties.This was a brilliant album when first released and still sounds brilliant today. All of the tracks have been re-issued on CD compilations at one time or another but it's nice to hear them together the way they were originally released."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one REALLY takes me back!","review":"I have to say that this album was very formative during my childhood.

Many pieces do not line up correctly and I couldn't get a couple of the screws to go in completely so a few are sticking out.

(he also made Outlanders and Caravan Kidd) It's another fun romp through a sci-fi/fantasy world as a very un-princess like warrior princess meets random people and kills lots of fish. (heh, sounds odd -- but yep) Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drakuun?","review":"This is not what i expected from the creators of caravann kidd, but it is still one good read with some funny moments for irony there.

I finally went down to a local camera shop and took pictures with the various lenses. I took the pictures home, and WOW - the L line really is worth the $. The focus of this lense is incredible, and the pictures are bright and vivid. Only this lense was able to focus on a close up shot of a brown fabric. Seeing the threads was unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic zoom lens. L quality at an affordable price.","review":"I would not hesitate to recommend this lens to anybody. The lens is super sharp and the colors are fantastic. I am shooting with a Canon Rebel xti and this is my favorite lens thus far. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading pricing, you are actually paying full price","review":"Buy this item if you want, but try to get a get a better price. The list price is misleading. You can buy it from Canon for this price. If you pay more than 650 for this lens you are not getting the best deal. That being said, at a range of $550 to $700 this is the most affordable L lens out there(L lenses are top of the line for Canon), so if $600 is all you can spend, and you want a 70-200mm f/4L lens, you won't be disappointed with this one. Just try to get a real deal, Amazon is trying to trick people into thinking that they are saving 44% of MSRP. That is a lie; their price is almost the same as Canon's MSRP. Another thing to consider is that, if you can afford to spend a lot more money, and if your camera merit it, Canon has better options and you will get more features, such as IS and better f-stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best quality to price ratio out there.","review":"Extremely sharp, smooth, quiet lens that is worth every cent. I am very happy with the lens, the sharpness and contrasts of the produced images is stunning. I cannot imagine being unhappy with the lens, the only improvement is to either go with the f2.8 or the IS version. Both are heavy lenses, weight-wise and cost-wise, but they are as good as it gets. For the money, this lens is a steal. Buy it with confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still going strong","review":"I've had this lens for almost 3 years now and it's still going strong.

This 70-200mm f4 telephoto zoom lens is among the cheapest lenses available in the superb L Series, but it does not at all lack the high quality expected from it and the other lenses in this line. I have seen excellent nature photography and photojournalism images taken with this lens. If I have a minor criticism, then it is that Canon lenses do not quite have the contrast one sees in lenses made by competitors such as Nikon, Leica, or especially, Zeiss. Otherwise, I might be tempted to trade my manual focusing SLR system towards a Canon autofocus SLR kit which would include this lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome starter lens","review":"This was one of the first lenses I bought for my camera beyond the kit lens, and I must say it has served me very well. At the wide end (70mm) it is just wide enough to capture the majority of the shots I need, and at the long end (200mm) it provides the extra reach I need to get closer to my subjects, without getting in the way. This lens is also reasonably quick (f/4) and works surprisingly well in low light conditions. Unfortunately I now need something a little longer and faster, and even with a 1.4x teleconverter, it's just not enough.Pros:Quick and decent performance (even in low light conditions)Good range with wide angle and telephoto abilitiesLight and Compact that makes it easy to carry around all dayCons:Not as long as I'd likeNot as fast as the f/2.8 lens (Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras)No Image Stabilization"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"I was very excited to receive this lens after reading the reviews here at Amazon. However, my disappointment was big as I didn't notice better image quality compared to my beloved Canon 28-135 lens. Also, the 200mm zoom is barely better than the 135 zoom. And I'm not able to shoot any people that are standing close to me. This requires a constant change of lenses, which is a real hassle. For this price this lens doesn't deliver much satisfaction. The 28-135 lens is way better, comes with an Image Stabilizer, awesome sharp pictures and is much shorter, therefore easier to carry around. I'll return the L lens...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value - Great Lens","review":"Can't say much more than others have on this lens. Reasonable performance, L series glass, fast auto-focus. I'm very happy with it and Amazon on the purchasing process.I'm using this on a Rebel XTi (EOS 400D), and I have no complaints.BTW - the lens comes with the hood and lens bag in the box.Tim"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent lens and a fantastic value","review":"I owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f/2.8 version. Overall I was very happy with the f/4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight. Sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses, and the f/4 can provide plenty of background blur. If you are shooting mostly outdoors I would recommend the f/4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for your Money!","review":"This is my very first \\"L\\" (for \\"Luxury\\") lens and I'm just elated with my purchase. It's below $1000 (which most L lens inversely cost) but the quality of the shots I've taken looks so professional. Only drawback is its f/4 maximum aperture. But as long as I'm taking pictures outdoors, the f/4 opening is just fine. I did try taking pictures with it indoors, I just have to push the setting to ISO1600 and sometimes pop up the flash and the pictures also turn out well. For an amateur like me, this lens is a very GOOD buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The White Lens","review":"The Canon 70-200mm f/4 L is the most amazing lens I have used. The images it produces are razor sharp and the speed of the autofocus is lightning fast and silent. The lens dosent weigh very much so you can carry it around your neck all day with no problem. Like most other reviews I read I was looking at this lens as well as the 70-300mm is usm. The 70-300 felt like a toy when I tried it in the camera shop and I could not justify the $600 price tag for it so I ordered this from Amazon.com and got it the morning of my trip to Gatorland. I am very happy with this lens and anyone else would be too. It is great for wildlife, portraits, photojournalism, travel, sports, etc...And besides it's cool and white."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Will Ruin You For Lesser Optics","review":"Everything the other reviewers say about the incredible sharpness, rapid auto-focus and build quality of this lens is absolutely true. What else can you say? It's a truly awesome piece of glass that will leave you wondering why you didn't get one sooner. It will also make it impossible for you to consider buying anything besides \\"L\\" series glass in the future. That's the bad part. While this lens is reasonably priced, it stands by itself in that category for \\"L\\" glass. Now if Canon would just come out with some \\"L\\" series EF-S lenses, they might be able to offer them at a similar price. But for now, this baby's the bargain of the bunch. And don't worry about the 1-stop loss of light compared to the f/2.8 version. Just change from 100 ISO to 200 ISO and you've got the same shutter speed. Worried that it doesn't have IS? Get a tripod! You should be using one anyway. Stop reading and buy it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This lens is extremely sharp, and i use for outdoor shooting.

I bought this lense to replace itand I have to say .. its wonderful .. great price . smooth, fast , quiet operation. Most importantly .. NO CHROMATIC ABERATION .. and the images are a great deal more sharp and clear compared to the USM III under thesame conditions. It even came with the lense hood .."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"This is my first \\"L\\" Series lens and I have to tell you that I'm very impressed.

The build quality was great and the image quality superb. I since upgraded to the 70-200 f/2.8 IS Mk II, which has a wider aperture and includes IS; however, this lens is much lighter than the 2.8 so you can carry it around without getting tired as fast. As for lack of IS, it depends on what you're shooting. For outdoor sports you probably won't need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER SHARP !","review":"So sharps, it cuts ! My thirty-some female friends are completely exposed around this lenses and now they are organized to prohibit me from using this piece of equipment around them.

Other than your thirty-some female friends, everything else will be award winning works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely gorgeous","review":"The optics on this lens are out of this world. The daytime photos I've taken with it have been excellent. The colors, sharpness, and contrast with this lens make it worth every penny. When shooting with it, I rarely have to do any post processing because the photos come out gorgeous almost every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality optics!","review":"This is an entry-level \\"L\\" white lens, but its optics are quite sharp even wide-open. It is definitely sharper than theCanon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens for Canon EOS SLR Camerasand has similar optics to the much more expensive and heavierCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras.The main difference? No image stabilizer and it is slower than it's f/2.8 brother. But if you are going to use a monopod/tripod or have good lighting to get some faster shutter speeds in, don't hesitate to buy this lens.PRO:- Cheap, compared to other L class lenses.- Can take in 1.4x extender with little impact on image quality (IQ).- Very sharp, similar sharpness to its more expensive brothers.- Very light weight! Other 70-200mm lenses in Canon's line are heavy!CON:- Not fast, not slow, the f/4 is just right for ideal situations or flash. Low light won't work.- Not weather sealed (though it will endure, it is still pretty solidly built compared to plastic lenses)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM Telephoto Lens Review","review":"This is the first lens I purchased for my Canon Rebel XSi. I bought this after doing a considerable amount of research - the majority of which gave this product outstanding reviews. I am happy to report that my experience has been a very good one. I was a little concerned about not having some sort of image stabilization feature, but since most of my photograghy is outdoors - it has not been a problem. The lens delivers outstanding pictures,is a breeze to use and is so light that I can use it for hours at a time without tiring. I saw this lens on many sites for hundreds more than I paid for it from Amazon - so do a little research before buying. A great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to add to their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"So I'm starting to get more serious about my photography. I went out and bought this as my entry to the \\"L\\" class of lenses. I mounted it on my 40D at home and I didn't really see what the big deal was. It wasn't until we went out for an Engagement shoot that I found the magic of this lens. The Bokeh was wonderful for my portrait shots. Absolutely wonderful. Very crisp pictures.Almost perfect because of the f4 - it didn't do so well in the shade. But, I can't really complain since the 2.8 is almost twice as much and the 2.8L IS which is almost unreachable for the amateur. But one day it will be mine, oh yes, it will be mine.I don't mind the white paint either, makes it look \\"professional\\". We were out on location and as soon as we took it out bystanders got out of the way of our shoot.So in summation, it's a great price to try out the \\"L\\" lenses. This and the 17-40L. But remember that it's an f4 and that it's white if that makes a big deal to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product for a great price (used)","review":"I really wanted to step into the L series of Canon lens', however photography is not my profession so justifying the money for this type of lens was tough. I chose this because it was the most affordable L series. It does not have image stabilization, but oh well. You really only need IS for inside shots requiring more light, portrait shots. This lens is designed for action shots and I use it to take pictures riding big mountain (skiing). The price difference between this lens and the EF 70-300 F/4L IS is about $700. So it was a perfect fit. It is one solid piece and is top quality. I would highly recommend, if owning a DSLR camera to have an L series lens in your bag of tricks. You do not have to have a Full Frame camera to get amazing shots, you just need an amazing lens!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pictures","review":"I was tired of looking through my camera with the lens that came on it and seeing the subject close up;then when you actually print it they are not as close as they looked. This lens is great. The quality of the picture is wonderful. I can take pictures of my grandchildren's football games from the stands and get pictures that look like I was right beside them. I can also take a close up of a flower and the quality is perfect and very close up. It is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Canon Telephoto Lens","review":"Could not be happier with this lens. Great all around lens that provides the versatility I was hoping for. If you are ready to expand your camera capability this is a super lens to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sharp Lens","review":"At first when I got the lens and started to useit, I thought all the reviews I had seen before buying it were all lies. But after learning how to use the lens, the fact is that it's a gem. I have taken a lot of pictures of birds with it and almost all of then handheld with a Canon Digital Rebel XT, it renders great sharpness. The thing is, you have to take pictures with shutter speed of at least 640. Sometimes you can get by with less and it seems to be at it's best at 5.6 aperture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Simply put, Psuedo-Historical nonsense that was written by a hack LINGUIST.

The selection this year is particularly poor, with very few exceptions. The problem is that both Collins and Lehman prefer a kind of watered-down, anecdotal style rather than truly challenging work.
