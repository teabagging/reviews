The music and performance, with Domingo and Sarah Brightman at the top of their form, was as good as I remembered. But the sound is pirate-video quality: hissy and broken up. The video is almost OK, but faded-looking. I know this was taped 15 years ago, but I have jazz recording from the 40s that sound better.

What a disappointment! Sarah's voice lacked in experience on that stage. Of course I like her very much, but I can do without listening to the video again.Every time Sarah opened her mouth, she squeaked way out of her range. The sound of the recording is of poor quality too! It sounds like a child recorded the musical. I was bored too, listening to the program. There was only one uplifting song. That is \\"Hosanna\\". The boy choir sounded shrill, as a result of the poor recording.The whole video was a waste of time and talent. I'm glad this was one of Webber's earlier attempts at bringing Sarah to her place at the top. I voted the video 1 star because of Domingo. Other than him, nothing moved me.

All the men are insensitive and unable to detect the needs of the women in their lives. All the women are tortured by insecurities about their bodies, but know themselves as creative, devoted, and nurturing. Resting heavily on character development like only a novel can, the movie lacks any real plot. Instead, the audience is treated to an ever deepening intimacy with the open sores that are the lives of three sisters and their mother. Well acted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waist of celluloid...","review":"Lovely and Amazing should have been a brilliant film about a family of women dealing their inner neuroses while trying to maintain a sensible family dynamic. What came out was a droll, boring, and unwitty. Katherine Keener, whom I generally like was unwatchable as an unhappy housewife who is forced to get a job when she can't sell her tacky craftwork. Emily Mortimer plays a typical actress type with a low self image and no ability to say what she wants. Brenda Blethyn, typically a strong acctress, is weak as the mother of this motley crue. She is seeing the signs of old age and decides to have plastic surgery, there are complications and she almost dies. This even brings the family back together and all is right with the world again..

All we really wanted them for was playing in our back yard, so quality wasn't too big an issue. The items shipped in standard time, and arrived in fair condition. The visor on one had pulled apart, but it was an easy fix. The mask is extremely flexible, so any hard shots aren't going to just bounce off. The visor is flimsy, and like I said, it does come apart rather easily. The worst part about it though is the goggles. They are wavy, hard to see through, and make depth perception very difficult. All in all, they are really cheap masks, which is what I expected when I only paid $13 for them. If I was planning on using them for competition, I'd probably send them back, but since we're only fooling around in the yard, I think they'll work out fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Mask","review":"I ordered this about a couple months ago and still have it (after a few adjustments).

The top visor broke off which is fine. The safty plastic is a great quality and works but if you get shot it leaves a small mark on the plastic which is annoying but will come off with a wet wipe. It has no fog when you breathe. That is exactly what it looks like in the picture. The shipping gets you which is 5 to 10$. but hey I still have it and it works!

Urquhart's rich, magical prose, especially in the novel's opening with Mary and her lover from the sea, is wonderful. However, the language is not enough to sustain interest.

I thought the obsessive love Eileen had for Aidan was over-emphasized and was dwelled upon for too long. I got the point long before she wrapped up the story. Considering we had already encountered an obsessive love through Mary in the first half of the book, it seemed somewhat redundant to go into that much detail of this obsessive type of love again through Eileen."},{"rating":"2","title":"a mystical journey floating through time","review":"Jane's writing flows over you like a lace curtain, billowing in an open window, hovering over a soft, warm breath of moist air.

I now wish I had given this recording a five star rating.Because the chants are so short, those new to kirtan may find this recording to be a gentle entry into kirtan.While I am enjoying all the chants, one stands out for me over and above the rest. It's the final chant, Shanti Om. This is perhaps the most hauntingly beautiful chant I've ever heard. The first time I heard this chant its depth and intensity drew me inward and expanded my awareness, if only for a short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kirtan Classic","review":"This is one of the best kirtan CDs ever recorded. It doesn't get any better than Stringer's \\"Hey Shiva Shankara.\\" Stringer and Krishna Das set the standard for the whole genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best from this author","review":"I have read many of Lavryle Spencer's books and this is the first time I have really been disappointed. The story starts out great but then just moves too slow, and like the other reader mentioned, Clay and Catherine just can't seem to get around their problems and grow up. And so much of the book focused on her problems instead of the growing attraction between the two characters, which is usually what you get from Lavyrle Spencer novels. Definitely not worth the time I spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book, but couldn't","review":"I've enjoyed all the other Lavyrle Spencer books that I've read, but this one just frustrated and annoyed me.Spoiler alert.Throughout the book Catherine is stubborn about resisting love. This goes on for 320 pages out of the 340 page book. Immediately after Clay gives up, she does a 180 within a page or two and suddenly is open to being loved. But it's still not good enough, and Clay has to continue to do all the work. The author does give her reasons for what she does, but let's be honest: just because someone had a traumatic childhood, that doesn't mean you really want to be around them. THis was like spending WAY too much time with a whiner and a bore. I just spent the whole time feeling sorry for Clay; he deserved better than her."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"Separate Beds was the first novel of Lavyrle Spencer's that I read. It was absolutely breathtaking and by far my favorite. (Like many of her fans, I've read them all!) I couldn't escape any emotion...I laughed...I cried...and yes, even got angry!!!! Immediately, I shared this book with my mom. I anxiously awaited every year for Lavyrle Spencer's new novel to appear. It's sad to see she is retiring. I will miss her adventurous stories. \\"Good Luck in everything you do, Lavyrle!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. The herione was completly dumb and it was just unrealistic. They argued all through the book.

I Loved It !","review":"This was the first of Lavryle i have read, and it was a wonderfully romantic, moving story. Catherine did make you want to smack her sometimes though! Clay sounded sooo handsome and intriqing. I hope there are more like this one! Bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written and seriously dated","review":"I realize this is a book written in the mid-1980s. However, one of the things I judge a romance by is how well and realistically I feel the male dialogue is written. Generally, female authors do just fine with women's dialogue, but can be hit or miss with the men. WHen is the last time you heard a 30 year old man use the term \\"davenport\\"?? I was about the age of the hero in this book in 1985, and I swear that the only person I ever heard use that term was my grandma and she was born in 1900. I also got annoyed with the heroine--you love the guy, quit giving him such a hard time, especially when he's being really nice. For me, the book was way too long in the build up and way too short on the resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner for Lavyrle!","review":"I love all of Lavyrle Spencer books, however I have two favorites. This one and Spring Fancy. This book made me feel like I WAS Catherine. I felt like I was a teenager in love for the first time. I will read this one over and over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book is a constant arguement! I read the first hundred pages, and skimmed the rest of the book. I got so tired of the argueing between the two characters. My friend loved the book and said she has read it several times, but I was very bored with the bickering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible second half overshadows wonderful first half","review":"This book was on such a good track. The first half of it was heavenly - the perfectness of the angst both Catherine and Clay felt was well done, the hardness of her decision, her fear, her desire not to end up like her mother.After their first Christmas together... ugh. The books spirals downward. I understand these things have a set pattern, and I do love romances. They meet, the fall in love, neither can admit it to the other for fear of rejection, they reject each other, are miserable apart and reunite. I GET IT. The problem with this book? NO ONE is as STUPID as Catherine is when it comes to love. NO ONE would live with a man she's \\"married\\" to and not realize he's falling in love with her.I can't STAND stupid heroines and LaVeryle drags out the gawd-awful part of this book for almost half the size of the novel. Boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my all time favorites","review":"mostly i read fantasy. my mom suggested this book.the first romance i ever read. since then. have bought the book both soft cover and kindle version. have read it five or six times over the years. i like the character development and storyline. always a feel good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I like all LaVyrle Spencer books but I find them a little pricey, but I plan on reading more of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Separate Beds","review":"Loved this classic story!Such a breathtaking story in a wonderful plot and characters…would certainly recommend this book to friends !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This was my first time reading this author and have already downloaded another one of hers.

Put a call into Amazon and received another set of discs the next day (kudos to Amazon). Sadly, the same issue; 2 copies of disc #4 and no disc #6. I've tried to contact fox...good luck with that one. At this point all I can say is, for the price fox is trying to charge, you should get at least a full season...not 5/6 of a season.

If you can deal with the fact that it is sung in French, you are in for a treat. It includes a superb accoustic blues penned by Hallyday himself called \\"La musique que j'aime\\", a gorgeous ballad called \\"La solitude\\" and two beautiful Hallyday originals \\"La prison des orphelins\\" and \\"Le droit de vivre\\". The personnel includes Peter Frampton, Bob Mayo and Frank Carillo on guitar and Bobby Keyes on sax. It only gets four stars because of the horrible corny \\"Comme un corbeau blanc\\" which is one of those insufferable French \\"variete\\" type of songs and an awful cover of \\"Suspicious minds\\". Every other song is great. When is this guy going to finally record an album in English? He has such a gorgeous raspy voice that you will feel like you understand the words anyway!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as fun as I thought","review":"Boring, small print. Difficult to read.

WILL.I.AM?!?!?!?! Who the hell was responsible for this atrocity? The movie is rather disrespectful to the fans and an insult to my intelligence. Wolverine origins is the equivalent of jaws 4 in the way of how they decided to screw up a franchise in the name of greed. If I could, I'd give this movie 0 out of 5. Unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother...very disappointing...","review":"ok, i get it, sometimes the movie version is always what it's cracked up to be, but they did a COMPLETE HACK-JOB on this one!!! i was looking forward to this movie from the day i heard rumors that it was in the works for production. recalling how much i enjoyed the graphic novel, and how cool i thought it was going to be on the big screen, only to see a COMPLETELY different, and not clever or good different, version on screen. i was very happy that i got this dvd as a gift and didn't spend my own money on it, and i was even happier that i was able to sell it! for x-men fans, you're missing nothing but disappointment, for non-x-men fans, maybe on a lazy sunday, when it's on tv, with commercials, because at least some of the commercials will be worth watching!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc does not work","review":"Rumor is there are problems with the BluRay version. It won't play on many BluRay players. This is the first BluRay out of many that has not played on my HP laptop. It pissed me off as I was anticpating watching this thing all day. In the end I watched some episodes of the British show 'Shameless' which was pretty damn entertaining. I will be sending this BluRay back and just suffer through the DVD version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, hard to believe that Wolverine would be this bad...","review":"I heard that this movie was terrible, but I couldn't believe it. \\"Hey, it's Hugh Jackman, it's Wolverine, how bad could it be?\\" Well, it was pretty bad. The best thing about it was the opening sequence and the credits, and it just went downhill from there. What was anybody's motive for doing anything at all? It just didn't make any sense. What's all this nonsense about having a battle on the narrow concrete ledge on the top of a nuclear power plant cooling tower? Why does Scott Summers need to show up? Horrible on all counts.

Hugh Jackman gave us an excellent performance as Wolverineonce again!2. Ryan Reynolds was great as Deadpool!3. The visual effects were great!4. Most of the under foot actors were great!5. Gambit was awesome!What I didn't like about the movie was:1. My biggest complaint is; what the heck did they do to Deadpoolat the end of the movie?!?!2. Most of the action sequences in the movie felt forced!3. They under used too many characters!4. The movie kept building-up and building-up, but the pay off inthe end was not satisfying!5. I am still confused if this is a reboot or a prequel to the firstthree movies...!6. Too many dull moments/ the pace was not good!Bottom line: While Hugh Jackman gives us a great performanceonce again, most of the other elements in this movie werenot good!My grade: C or two stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good but not as good as the latest","review":"Obviously its Hugh Jackman and his acting is phenom. So as usual, there is a good story line and interesting mixes on what you think this leads to - I love how you can keep trying to put the pieces together and try to associate it with what happened in the carton series...fun stuff! Great movie on a weekend night in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wolverine Flick","review":"When I first heard that Hugh Jackman was going to play Wolverine in the X-Men movie, I said, \\"Who?\\"But, wow, he does a great job. My favorite part of the first X-men was, as Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura would say, the lumberjack cage match between Wolverine and all comers. (Wolverine was always my favorite X'er) I really looked forward to seeing the Wolverine Origins movie after seeing the preview. And I wasn't disappointed.Huge and Liev make a great pair of brothers. I guess they were destined to play relatives (see Kate & Leopold). People think that Logan is dark. Liev makes him look like Little Miss Sunshine.I don't plan to purchase too many Blu-Ray movies. Only the ones that are worth it. And this definitely qualifies (as does Iron Man and Planet Earth).Great cast and great special effects. It was much better than Cats. I'll watch it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is where Wolverine got his start","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. it was a bit odd to see Professor Xavier walking. I thought he would have been in a wheelchair in this movie. it was a bit odd to see Cyclops going to school as a teen and Gambit on here as well. this movie has tons of action. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine, who was a Weapon X. it is hard to imagine, through all the X-Men cartoons I watched in my 20's, that Wolverine and Sabretooth grew up as half-brothers. there were some funny parts in this movie, such as Fred \\"Blob\\" Dukes boxing with Wolverine, however, eventually, it is the Blob that gets knocked down. I am really surprised that Magneto and Mystique were not in this movie. I recommend this movie to X-Men fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT","review":"Huge Jackman is so hot and amazing in this movie.

The plot holes in this movie are big enough to drive a truck through. Wolverine makes action driven movies like Transformers 2 look like Schindlers List.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs!!!","review":"This is, without-a-doubt, one of the worst movies produced in the last 10 years. Honestly, a 9-year-old could have wrote a better plot and better dialogue. This movie's plot has more holes than a battlefield after a bombing run and the production value is abysmal. The special effects look like they came out of the 80's. As a comic-book film, this movie is awful. As a general film, this movie is STILL awful. Seriously, I have never met a person in the real world who actually liked this piece of trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than X-men","review":"Not sure why some hate this movie so much. The movie and story is great. It breaks down the origin for people who are not comic book readers in a well-done way. If you were to get the entire origin on film, it would be a tv series not a movie. Action was great, Jackman was great, Sabretooth was great... The rest of the cast was good...One problem I have with it is hollywood taking and changing an existing character to create a new one? You will see. Not sure why they do this when there are so many characters to chose from already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"I'm sure the movie is terrific but the blue ray would not play on my 3 month old player, the digital copy was unplayable on my state of the art mac, customer service was unavailable for both and I am extremely irritated. The only customer service option was by filling out an online form and waiting -- well waiting longer than I want when I had movie night planned at a time certain. I'm sure security is a concern but is it too much to ask that I be able to watch a movie I just purchased -- on new equipment -- without a multi-hour customer service component?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story, Excellent Movie!!!","review":"Dare I say, better than the original 3 movies of X-Men? At least for me it is as good, if not more interesting. The only thing I felt was that some of the \\"Effects\\" were a little cheaply done by today's standards. Such as his claws once he gets them replaced with adamantium. They were to shiny and to make it more realistic, they could've had more reflection in them. They were too perfect.The story was very good. Telling the origins of how he grew up as a mutant and well I won't spoil much, but how him and Beast were both involved in each other's lives. Very cool. So in reality, we saw the origins of both Beast and Wolverine. Sooo coool. There are even appearances of characters that are in the original X-men.This movie delivers full on action. I recommend this movie to be part of any super hero library.The quality of the Blue Ray is just AMAZING!! Every frame is stunningly presented and the sound was fantastic as well. Great quality, great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall series","review":"If you like comic books turned to movies you'll like this. X-Men Orgins Wolverine is the best of the 4 in my opinion, action scenes are better, but the trilogy pack has a better storyline. Wolverine's flashbacks in the Trilogy series isn't exactly like Orgins, but its close enough to work. This is a set where if you are good at picking up on little things, why the people are how they are is explained. There is some comedy thrown in through out also, like when Wolverine complains about there black suits and Cyclops says \\"would you rather it be yellow spandex?\\" Not the best movies ever but pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than i expected it would be.","review":"When i first saw that this movie was coming out, i didnt have high hopes for it at all. i thought they were gunna ruin it like they do w/ other series of movies. but i was completely wrong, and gladly take back my negative thoughts of it.i was blown away w/ this movie. it definitely gave the element of surprise with a few twists and a big give a way near the end.definitely check it out its worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting...","review":"If there's one thing I hate, it's eye candy, something thrown up on the screen for its own sake and no deeper meaning to it at all. This is just such a film. This movie's plot is an insult to anyone over the age of 3 and the characters often act in ways that are completely contradictory to what was previously established. This is primarily true of Wolverine (sorry Hugh) but also of Gambit. I couldn't wait for this thing to end, much likeTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Single-Disc Edition), another attack on thinking people everywhere. Unless you're a hardcore fan of X-Men or Hugh Jackman, avoid this like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Male Testosterone","review":"I just watched the DVD of \\"Wolverine\\" and thought that men made it, for men, and without any heart and soul. It is full of special effects, no real character development, and few females ...only the weak subservient ones for the strong males. Hugh Jackman did this for the money. Anyone can be bought. It does not have the warmth and camaraderie of the previous three X-Men movies (this could be because of the absent of real, strong, female roles), and there is violence everywhere. We have become numb to seeing killings on screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful","review":"With a horrible script, shoddy CGI and and complete bastardization of some of my favorite comic book characters(for God's sake, there's not even continuity between the previous X-films!), X-Men-Ridiculous Title:Wolverine goes down as one of the worst summer blockbusters in recent history, if not of all time.

I almost thought I had a lobotomy. Origins has no plot, subpar special effects and numerous gaping holes due to comic book characters having several thousand different story lines and experiences. Fights, fights and more fights are what we get here along with the usual \\"oh, so that's how Wolvie knows Blob\\" scenes. Gambit is here just because he's Gambit and fans have been screaming for him since the first X-Men film. Otherwise, he serves no necessary function. And the script is terrible, typical summer shlock, but what do you expect from comic book writers? If you really need to kill some time between jobs, pop this joint in and smoke it, but don't expect a memorable high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter utter garbage","review":"I loved X-Men and X-Men 2, X-Men 3 was quality but lackluster / compressed. Wolverine Origins is complete garbage. Don't get me wrong, I like Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, but this movie blows. Deadpool is Baraka / Cyclops? Adamantium bullet made Wolverine lose his memory? Almost no blood in the fighting scenes? Wolverine WILLINGLY went to Weapon X - to get back at Sabretooth no less?Just garabage, they should reboot X-Men simply because of this movie.

I had fun watching this movie and enjoyed the action, no it isn't going to win awards, but it provided enough entertainment that I will watch it again. As far as the transfer goes, the quality of the Blu-ray is great for both the video and audio quality. Additionally, I like these Blu-ray movies that come with the Digital Copy as it lets me take the movie with me when I travel to have my own entertainment instead of paying at a hotel or watching a movie I don't enjoy on a flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good action movie with great story line to show how Wolverine got his name from","review":"X-Men Origins Wolverine is a good action movie with great fight scenes between all the characters. Also has some amazing special effects in mutiple scenes, plus another aspect I enjoyed about the movie was the backstory on finding out how Wolverine got his name from. Also another good point in the movie was the flashback to the wars make the scenes so real with the fliming. But if your a X-Men fan in general or die hardcore fan then pick this movie up and watch how the character Wolverine came about from both what you already know and what info you may not know yet. One bonus note to add if you have other mutants you like from the series a few of them are inculded in this movie like Gambit, Cyclops, and so forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Men Origins: Wolverine Bly-ray","review":"Awesome movie but i wish it had Magneto and Mystique in it they are my two personal favorites.

Okay, maybe it's too much to hope for full screen versions of movies, but how about a more realistic ratio, like 16:9, where you can see what's going on? People with high definition are going to be ordering in in Blu-Ray, and converting the movie to one's MP4 player is a waste of effort (if the movie was worth the effort in the first place).In short, either produce the movie in full screen edition or at least have it available in both.

And i do agree that the other 3 X-Men movies were good but they too didn't really follow the comic story. Cyclops was a weak leader, I think Halle Berry wasn't a good choice for Storm bad accent too. I know Wolverine is the most exciting character in X-Men but the other characters also have alot to bring to the team. I hope they remake the X-Men with the original 5 Iceman,Jean Grey,Cyclops, Beast, and Angel. And then gradually bring in other X-Men characters. All these comic movies need to stick to the comics in some form or manner.

Hollywood really Hollyized the X-men. It fits in well with the Hollywood version or the X-men. It makes a good movie but it's not the Wolverine I grew up with. Still, I watch it over and over. I hope they keep Avengers close than they did the X-men. Spiderman was real good and the changes to Fantastic Four were brilliant. Nothing was as close to the books as Daredevil and Electra, I thought Electra used the comic for storyboards. Why didn't the ecknowledge Frank Miller? Sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"duh...loved it, can beat bluray quality and a 61\\" samsung either","review":"duh, loved it, being a big comic fan its hard not to. it lived up to the quality of the other xmen flics. i actually had my 12yr old daughter save her money and told me thats what she wanted so i wanting it also didnt think twice, and amazon has the best pricing, and the amazon prime gives me free two day shipping, cant beat it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoy your One Viewing.","review":"The first act and opening credits of Wolverine are very strong, except for an uncomfortable, almost comical bit where a little boy runs around with claws. The Logan character, as played by Hugh Jackman is very well realized and easy to like - but the overblown plot around him is not going to make this movie watchable for generations. Hats off to Hugh Jackman for the performance - I paid to see the movie just his artistry more or less.Just eat your popcorn and enjoy the ride since it's not one you're likely to revisit.SPOILER: The Uncanny Valley is breached in the final scene when Professor Xavier (represented by the lost digital rights of Patrick Stewart) shows up looking like a broken Disney Animatronic. It's horrible. They should have cut that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Am I rating the movie or the service?","review":"I assume the movie. It was good: Hugh was hairy and clawy. Liev was toothy and clawy. And they fought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Great movie. Love the special camera tricks. The knives on his fingers look so real when their coming out from his hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this set overpriced?","review":"I think there is a mistake in this set's price, because if you buy the X-Men Trilogy and Wolverine separate, you will pay half the price of this set. Please Amazon review this item price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relatively Enjoyable","review":"There are some very bad action films and some very bad comic book adaptations. So, relative to much of the sorry entertainment that comes ouf of Hollywood, this movie was fairly decent. It wasn't great and it's probably my least favorite of the X-Men movies, but it was an enjoyable story. From my perspective, the only real problem with it is that it covers too much material in too short of time. In particular, it would've been much better if it had focused more on the relationship between Wolverine and Sabertooth. Their conflict is never fully explained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Quality and content, the movie was silly though...","review":"I am an avid comic book fan and I make no excuses for the lack of cohesive storytelling. However the fight scenes and special effects were excellent. The acting wasnt oscar calibre but it fit into the action genre the way it needed to.Wolverine was tortured by his past, Sabretooth was ruthless and menacing and Silverfox was the one who did it all for love. The others did a bang up job too. Everyone from Agent Zero to Deadpool played their parts to perfection. Bravo. The content was awesome. The character profile that actually had the character talking as thier characters, nice touch.The deleted scenes needed to be just that. The interview of Lien Wein and Stan Lee was great. It's a nice touch to see the creator of Wolvering get his just desserts. All in all great product fora great low price. Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT EXPECTATIONS BUT DOES NOT DELIVER","review":"What can i say, this film was a shame to the x men movies. The fx were horrible considering that a 30 mill movie from five years ago impressed me way beyond this film.

Though this film made enough to warrant a sequel, you won't see me in the theaters paying hard earned money for that garbage.The only thing they did right was casting Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and the symphonic score.Fox please get Brian Singer back and do a real X-men sequel to the first two so we fans can forget the awful films that came after like X-3 by Ratner and this the worst of all. This film makes Ratner's film look like an absolute masterpiece in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not support this drivel","review":"This is exactly the kind of loud and dumb movie that the X-Men franchise specifically sought to avoid becoming. The first two films (X-Men and X2) were some of the best examples of a smart, socially relevant story adapted into an epic, fun and wholly emotionally satisfying adventure. Since director Bryan Singer stepped away from the franchise, these films have (seemingly) been overtaken by mindless Fox execs who have no idea how to handle these characters in a way that doesn't become an uninteresting paint-by-numbers explosion B-Reel.And no, \\"It's Not That Bad\\" is not a reason to see Wolverine. That's an unnecessary excuse that, give the leaps in quality the Comic Book genre has made, it's a completely erroneous excuse. It just plain IS that bad, and sure as hell not worth any of your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such potential...wasted.","review":"This movie was amazing until the end.

I had no expectations of this movie. I had not been pining away at message boards waiting for spoilers or buying wolverine related stuff to bide my time. Put simply this was a great Friday night movie. There are some good and entertaining actors in this one. I wish Ryan Reynolds had more screen time as Deadpool ala wisecracker, but the 'mutant killer' Deadpool was pretty wicked. And yea some things were different than I expected, but honestly as swiss cheese full of holes wolverines origin has been over the years who cares? Seemed like they hit a lot of good beats. Just wait, more will come..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst origin for Wolverine","review":"There are multiple origins for Wolverine. This is quite possible the worst. A forgetful cast, broken scenes (Logan gets smashed by a truck and tons of lumber fall on him BEFORE he gets the adamantium skeleton), predictable (stupid) plots and horrible writing. Anyone who has read the X-Men from the 1970's through to the 90's knows how mixed up the story is in this film. Add some Matrix and anime fun into this movie and you get a mixed salad of garbage. All other features on the blu ray disc are very well done. Do yourself a favor and read some of the old books or watch X-Men 1 and 2 which were not as bad as this shipwreck. Wolverine is basically a few steps short of simply being superman. Not the Wolvie I grew up liking.

Big disappointment. In the first 5 minutes, we see a young Logan grow out little baby bony claws. I immediately thought \\"uh oh\\", and boy was I right. I waited for it to get better, but it never did. Skip it. Revisit the Wolverine/X-men franchise in 5-10 years when they get new actors (or when CGI can make Hugh Jackman look about 30-35 again). Hugh's my age, and he seems like a great guy, but I'm too old to play Wolverine too. You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overated","review":"When my friend let me borrow this DVD i thought it looked really cool but I was wrong. Overall the movie is Bad. The action is not that great and the story line is not great either this film is very overated. They hardly show cyclopse, Gambit, or any of the other characters.

This is the best example of when Hollywood totally ruins a great concept. They did it with Spider Man, Star Wars, & X-Men Last Stand. Soon to follow looks to be Iron Man.This crap of a movie was a joke. I have seen better CGI from Clash of the Titans. I love how his claws floated with the worst angles after he escaped to the farm house and they had that horrible bathroom scene. By far Liev Schreiber stole the show, his role as Sabretooth is the only redeeming quality in this film. Oh yeah Sabretooth couldn't get metal claws either. Also did I mention that Ryan Reynolds is a tool and they TOTALLY ruined Deadpool and I am going to kick whoever makes a Deadpool movie in the crotch for yet again ruining a great concept. One star for Liev if not I wouldn't have even bothered putting a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've ever seen","review":"This really is the worst movie I've ever seen.

So far I've had that with all 3 of the other X-Men series but all other (non rights managed) movies seem to play fine. They load in fine after the code key but then play 2 hours worth of grey screen with no sound. It's too bad, makes paying for a digital copy pointless. If you have iTunes and want a digital copy - you're better off with piracy! At least then, you're sure they'll play!! No way I'm buying anything else with a \\"digital copy\\" included until they get this fixed (yes, I've tried both contacting Apple (who tried to figure it out at least) and the studios (who just don't care as it doesn't affect everyone, yet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"civil war ended in 1963","review":"There where tons of horrible things about this film,but only one really angered me.

They are an amazing line of well crafted and extremely well designed set of action figures! Lots of attention to details. Which is why this one figure in the line is so strange!!! On the Simpsons TV show, Database is one of the larger children in Bart's and Lisa's circle of friends. But for some reason, this figures is not only smaller than almost all the other children (he is still bigger than Maggie) but he is also disproportionate to the rest! It's like he is a large \\"toy\\" for the other toys to play with. Weird!! Playmates dropped the ball with this one, but I forgive them! Or at least I would if they would make a Jay Sherman Simpsons figure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree...!","review":"...I was talking with my brother about how small it was when I got it.

The extremely thin plastic is deformed and the halves are not round, so they won't mate together and close properly.

She is frustrated she can't get them in or out by herself, and is frustrated even with me helping her. I'm going to buy the Fisher Price one where she can take the top off herself!! I spend lots of time with my kids, but need them to at least be able to play for 1 or 2 minutes without needing my help, and this is not the toy for that. Since its a ball, it is not sturdy for little hands to try to put pices in (unlike something that can sit flat on the ground). My 2 and 3 year-olds aren't enthralled with it either. I'm surprised so many people love it - didn't work for any of us and I just sold it on Craigslist!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for mom and dad than baby","review":"This is a \\"parent\\" shape sorter. While parents should be constantly involved with their children, the child should be able to operate a toy on their own. The problem with this shape sorter is that the child has too many pieces at the age it's designed for. Give your child too many pieces and they will get frustrated. Give them only the circle and they will find the spot and it goes in like \\"magic\\"! No other piece is a starter piece for a child of 6 months. The ball is IMPOSSIBLE for a child to open on their own until they are past the age where this toy is developmentally appropriate. By the time they can open it, they should be on to much more advanced educational toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tupperware Shape-O ball","review":"I was very surprised to see this offered by Amazon.

This is great for recognizing and sorting shapes-circle, oval, square, wedge, triangle, trapezoid, pentagon, hexagon, star--good for motor skills, too.I think it is a bit pricey for some plastic, but it is better than other shape toys I have seen and the BEST THING OF ALL: IT DOES NOT PLAY MUSIC, MAKE STUPID NOISES OR SAY ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

MUCH better than the more expensive german style big kitchen knives, which are very slippery to handle and seem to dull very quickly.You can really whack big stuff like melons (I even did a coconut once), but also do delicate work on tomatoes. The tip (corner) is very sharp and more maneuverable than you would think.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because there are other, cheaper asian knives though maybe not quite as solid, which you can buy in any china town for a fraction of the cost. But you really can't go wrong either way, especially if you want the designer wood handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"hollow ground","review":"This is a hollow ground blade (not flat ground) which does not cut straight.

I almost thought that I bought a white gold band. This ring has a very flimsy feel to it and it's cheaper than I would have imagined. Not to mention that the ring was an imperfect circle. I wouldn't be surprised if it bent if I squeezed it. I am even more disappointed because Amazon did not send a certificate with it like they did when I purchased my previous ring.

Third Bass were great white rappers but just like in sports when something is popular and marketed well the money starts pouring in. While I think you have talent and I'm not hatin' on you, you've bragged on yourself in tabloids and compared yourself to Eminem. You are not bringing a style to the table that warrants lots of discussion. Eminem is a profound rapper but he really just sounds black, not always like a great rapper ie: Tupac, JayZ, LL Cool J. Your style is ok. I heard it before. Just don't pull the race card here. If you were black you'd be ok. So you're a pretty white girl. I'm feelin you.

Then, and only then, did they announce she was white, so don't make this into a color thing. Honestly, the girl is pitiful! I have no problem with party songs, but at least write some cute lyrics to them. The song is so bad, it's hilarious!But now for the color thing. If Eve, Missy, or Kim had lyrics like these when they went into the record company's offices, they would've gotten turned away!

I think comparing her to Eminem does Eminem an injustice, and it doesn't accurately describe Sarai. Her lame rhymes and overproduced sound almost makes me laugh, as if she is parodying Slim Shady. She tries to tell us she's independent, but her content sounds a little too much like other hard core rappers for me to believe her. I don't think we'll see Sarai much in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the kind of garbage thats giving hip hop a bad name","review":"Being a long time hip hop listener, I gotta say that this album is straight wack with a capital W.

My advise is dont cop it!! if you like bubble gum rap go to a candy store and ask for the neptunes new track. I bet this chick will be turning tricks in some back alley in a couple years for some c-rock hey then maybe this album will be worth something! but then again i guess the pre teen white kids will love it you know what i wonder how much she signed for??????.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"medicine rattled!","review":"I expected to hear something totally different when I popped in the CD. First of all, they sound much better live than they do on this recording. Second, with Billy Zoom from the band X producing the CD, I expected him to capture their raw, country/rockabiily-tinged \\"X-ish\\" sound. But the production quality is weak; a REALLY weak guitar sound (c'mon Billy), way too much yodeling from the singer, and watered down versions of the songs I've heard them play time and time again. Only a couple of the songs on the CD captured the energy they've displayed on the Los Angeles club circuit. Overall: very dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband claimed it as his","review":"This is something you'll be glad to have more than one of.

Naturally, I start all my purchases with research: test drive it at the library first, and then see if you have to have it. The history, the stories, and finally the recipes make this a keeper. Granted, the paperback doesn't have all the recipes the later edition hardcover has, but, it's easier to store! Besides, comparing the two editions, copy a missing recipe, insert it, and all is well. All the recipes are RIDICULOUSLY simple--and the food is the star, not big on the dressy stuff. You get to taste the product (\\"St Peter's fish\\" is my fave). It plays into the current local foods movement very well, with the Bible history right there showing Bible folk were the ultimate locavores, eating what they grew or caught right where they were.

This book consists of a father's letters to his daughter per her request on how to keep her husband loving her forever. Charles Shedd, Karen's father is a pastor, counselor and has a vast knowledge of failed and successful relationships. He covers everything from sex, to communication, to cooking, all so very objectively and with God as the sole motivation behind his theories. Karen's father is a very learned and qualified man for the task given to him by his daughter, and this book would be very beneficial for any prospective or seasoned wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Letters to Karen","review":"Timeles truths for those preparing for marriage (be sure to read \\"Letters to Phillip\\" as well)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chief Export of Chuck Norris is Pain","review":"A fantastic book with many ups and downs. This book is an inspiration for all. A book to be had in anyones own personal library of favorites. Perfect for sitting down and reading in front of a fire. You may be skeptical at first about this book from other reviewers saying that it isn't worth the money, but you shouldn't believe them. They are just people who don't understand literature like this filled with metaphors and secret meanings that aren't obvious through the first read-through.

Go Chuck Norris go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent story; incorrect details","review":"While the plot of \\"Walker, Texas Ranger: The Novel\\" is good, it seems that Mr. Reasoner would do well to watch the show a little more closeley. For example: 1)C. D. owns \\"C. D.'s Bar & Grill\\", not \\"C. D.'s Place\\"; 2)Past episodes have shown that Ranger Trivette has GREAT DIFFICULTY in riding a horse (an admirable acting job by Clarence Gilyard, whose biography indicates rodeo experience); 3)Likewise, Trivette had to learn to drive an 18-wheeler in one episode; and 4)Ranger Walker talks less on the show than he does in the book.These are some of the things that caught my attention. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed the book, and I hope Mr. Reasoner writes another one soon. (I'd just like to see things a little closer to the show's portrayals.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undemanding fare for Walker/Norris followers.","review":"A fairly non-descript tie-in for Norris' morality/martial arts-lite tv vechicle. There is a great character submerged here, i.e Lone Wolf Gonzales upon whom the earlier incarnation of Walker was derived, but, heartbreakingly, here, in Reasoners novel as with the tv show, the grittiness and any much needed depth is absent. Perfuctionary stuff as it is, Walker is a difficult figure not to warm to, as this book demonstrates, but one gets to feel almost as frustrated as the real life Texas ranger may have, in the sense that his true colours and abilities, and ironically, those of Norris' are being diluted, understandably, for mass appeal. Walker needs to get down and dirty to make the character breathe, and unfortunately this offering barely touches the surface. Still, if Walker does it for you, great, but, for this reader and viewer Norris' original take on this theme, JJ McQuade holds far more creditable dimension and weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black coffee DVD","review":"Great DVD, watched it with my kids and we all enjoyed it.

This movie came out before audiences (female primarily) didn't realize she was no threat to any other woman, and so many negative comments were made about her, especially in this film while it was playing on the screen -- but they did go to see it. Without spoiling it for anyone who has not seen it yet, look for Marilyn's position on the floor in the penultimate and last shot of her! Check it out!

It was filmed in technicolor, directed by Henry Hathaway. Although noir- ish in tone the photography is quite lush. I find Jean Peters as alluring as Marilyn Monroe. Joseph Cotton is always excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots To Look At And Admire","review":"The great scenery and colors of Niagara Falls, two very attractive female leads, and an interesting story all add up to a very good rating for this classic film.The DVD offers a very nice print: sharp, with color restoration that makes it look great. Niagara Falls never looked better (and I live just 25 miles away), and either did Marilyn Monroe or Jean Peters.Everyone knows about Monroe's beauty (and, I think, underrated acting talents) but Peters was a beautiful woman with a great body, herself. It's the men in here who are goofy: Joseph Cotten and his whining and mental illness; Casey Adams with his nerd-ish personality and Adams' boss Don Wilson, who is even more of a cornball.This crime story is a suspenseful film with several twists and turns and segments that keep you on the edge of your seat. It's film noir material even though it's color which might disqualify it for some purists."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Barrel (over the Falls) O' Fun\\"","review":"This is a wonderfully suspenseful movie, shot with the grandeur of Niagra Falls as a backdrop--along with the accompanying noise and mist. Great acting by all parties: Monroe, Cotten, Peters et. al. It is very Hitchcocky in nature. We all know that Joseph Cotten can play evil and diabolical. In later years it was his hallmark.

Highest honors go to cinematography, with a special nod to the eerie, shuttered mood evoked at the cabins. A real bon bon of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Movie!!!","review":"This is, oddly, one of my favorite movies. Marilyn, Jean Peters, and Joseph Cotton all act at their best, and the beauty of the falls adds beautiful, graceful scenery and suspensefulness to the movie as well. I first found this movie when watching the Marilyn Marathon on AMC when I was 10. I liked it so much, I went and bought it the next day. This movie hasn't one dull moment, and I am shocked that such a good movie could be out of stock. This movie kept on building and building suspense all the way up until the shocking, unpredictable ending. If you want a real classic suspense film, NIAGARA is the film for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Marilyn movie","review":"In \\"Niagara\\", Marilyn Monroe portrays Rose, a sneaky, sinister temptress planning to kill off her husband George (Joseph Cotten). Why she wants George murdered instead of simply leaving him is never explained. There are plenty of sexy shots of Marilyn (a couple of them focusing on her rear end), and the clips of the Niagara Falls are also quite impressive. I should mention that although Marilyn gets top billing in the credits, she has less screen time than Joseph Cotten, Jean Peters or Casey Adams, the latter two portraying Ray and Polly Cutler, a honeymooning couple. About the DVD: the picture and sound quality is definitely an improvement over it's VHS cousin. There are a few other extras, but nothing to get excited about. The optional French dubbing is performed very well. The woman who reads Marilyn's lines sounds like her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"What I found most interesting, and refreshing, about this film was the attention paid to the Aga Khan's relationship to the Ismailis, rather than focusing solely on theology. The focus on the story of Prince Karim allows for an informative and accessible means of learning more about both the Aga Khan himself and the tradition as a whole. The film is very well-organized and does a nice job of detailing the development and history of the Ismaili community, especially through the discussions from professors and other speakers. Overall, it is very easy to follow while simultaneously raising complex discussions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for anyone who wants to learn about Islam and the ismailli sect","review":"this is a great introduction and gives good information on the Aga Khan and his followers, the Ismailli's.

For this book to be useful, or to enjoy this book, one should already be very familiar with the subject.Perhaps the book could be useful for reference purposes since it does contain a lot of information. Because everything is so densely packed and not very clearly presented, I found it not useful for a first acquantaince with the subject. And certainly not for beginners.

This one appears to be more of a band effort than some of her other works, with her more than capable sidemen being used to great effect. Along with Bogart's outstanding piano and sax work there is plenty of scorching guitar, and a solid rhythm section. Bogart's mix of blues, jazz, and rock continue to be a unique mix and she deserves more exposure than she has received.

They are in the same price range, are MUCH softer, and have elastic all the way around the sheet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cable is so thin I cut it in 5 seconds with some cheap pliers","review":"Anybody with a cheap pair of cutting pliers will be able to cut through the cable in seconds. I know because I just did it. The cable is very thin and is made of pliable steel wire. You could even use household scissors to gnaw through.Having this lock on is better than nothing because the thief needs to have some cutting tool and then has to deal with the remaining lock that is attached to your computer. However, if you are going to go through the trouble of locking up your computer, you might as well get something with a stronger cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk (should be zero stars)","review":"This is a piece of junk and the description is misleading. The cable is so thin (about the thickness of a thin earphone cable) that I'm confident it could be cut with a pair of scissors. Or maybe you could just bend the wire (it's not really a cable) back and forth until it broke. I have another MicroSaver that has a real cable and would not even consider using this one to secure my laptop. And, to make things worse, the packaging is designed so you can't even tell how thin the wire is until you open the package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for the Kensington 64053 MicroSaver Retractable Portable Notebook Lock (PC/Mac)","review":"Well there was nothing in the description about how there was some sticky stuff covering the entire black color parts of the device.

I agree that this version of \\"1984\\" with Peter Cushing and produced by the BBC in 1954 is the best ever produced, with stark performances and the most chilling portrayal of a totalitarian government I've seen. But this DVD is obviously a bootleg import, and for Amazon to be selling it with no mention of its true nature is deceptive at best. There are numerous video artifacts: pixellation in the video as well as innumerable specks, lines, and a constant flickering. This identical release has been duplicated on two other Amazon products: B0025ZIG8Q and B002KECK1G - all of which are of the same poor quality. If you haven't seen this version, it's worth going to YouTube and watching there, but this DVD-R is not worth what they're asking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a dinosaur game for kids!","review":"I like this game.

As an Eastern European poet, Levchev had to learn much more quickly about the reality of history and politics than American poets do, and he demonstrates this in such poems as \\"The Balkan Dance\\": \\"We are dancing towards a new millennium/and all we can see in our future/is our past.\\" But he also writes perceptively of America in such poems as \\"Washington, D.C.,\\" in which he observes that \\"Freedom has countless swaying faces,\\" and in \\"No Man is an Island,\\" observing that \\"We all live in Manhattan\\" in the aftermath of 9/11.

That seemed like so much work! When I received mine there were no screws! The screw holes are in the lid and box, but no screws came with the filter. The lid doesn't snap on, so I keep the lid and box together with rubber bands I get from the morning paper. I'm using the small pump that came with the pond, and it seems to do a pretty good job. I clean the filters weekly, and lots of dirt washes out. Even a few leaves have been sucked into the filter. I'm curious to know how long the filter lasts before it needs replacement. As far as getting it ready to use, be aware that there are pre-punched holes in the filters that will come out in order to fit the water hose from the pump and electrical cord through their places in the lid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"This is perfect for what i needed.

Benson's characters, living, as they do, lives of comfort & ease in quiet, picturesque English villages, during a historical period of relative peace, manage to get up to the most exciting and riveting, but at the same time, completely polite and respectable social adventures, and display to the reader their own little vanities and self-deceits in the most wonderful ways.

I'm surprised at the number of good reviews this got, but to each his own. If it helps, great, but it had the opposite effect on my son. As an adult, I found nothing soothing about the narrator's voice, either. Any message of affirmation she was trying to convey was lost in the delivery.

At my lamaze class, we learned the relaxation technique through story telling and this is a perfect example (Esp. the Goodnight Catapiller). My teacher read us a story imagining that our arms, legs, etc. were heavy and that they needed to be relaxed. This is just what this story does. It also teaches breathing techniques and helps you to visualize surroundings other than a stressful hospital room.My only complaint is that the deep breathing in the background music during \\"A Boy and a Bear\\" is kind of creepy.

I then placed the antenna on a horizontal beam about 12 feet above the floor. With the antenna on the beam, the signal strength improved and there have been no picture drop outs. In short, I would try this inexpensive antenna first. You may have to experiment with it's placement to get good results. But, that's true of any indoor antenna."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY","review":"I never write reviews, but this antenna is so great I could not help myself.

Needless to say, we ended up returning the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I did much research and ordered this one based on the positive reviews. I guess that everyone's experiences depend on too many variables. I live within the city and no more than 10 miles from the TV stations, all channels come in clearly except for two - which are quite poor. I ordered this antenna with the hope that it would improve the reception for those two channels, but it doesn't even work as well as the rabbit ears that I bought at a garage sale (and are probably 20 years old).Also, the antenna is bigger than it appears, is rather ugly, and is pretty flimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me","review":"I live about 27 miles away from the transmitting towers in my city. I am using this antenna inside my bedroom on the second story of a townhouse, with relatively few buildings obstructing the signal path. However my room is on the far side of the house, so in the direction the antenna is pointing, there must be several walls the signal must travel through to my antenna. I am also using an amplifier with this antenna.With this setup, I am able to clearly receive nearly all the channels being broadcast in my area. It did take some time to experiment with the placement of the antenna before I could receive some of the channels. Also note that without the amplifier, I was only receiving about half of the channels. I have not tried other antennas, so I cannot compare, but I can say that this antenna has worked very well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"HDTV Antenna","review":"I read all the prior great reviews, and purchased this antenna.

I know I won't get good reception, but I didn't think my $10 bunny ears (with a base and a circular loop piece in the middle) from Target was better than this one. The Zenith feels VERY cheap, but it's obviously working for many people. I would've rated it higher, but I can't because obviously, it can't be just my location if my bunny ears perform better. I'm mainly using it for analog reception. I bet this thing is very good if I were closer to the transmission tower, compared to using another type of antenna. But for long distances, this thing seems to be worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good","review":"Does the job.

I have several other pepper mills but based on their price, I assumed these were as good as it gets.Boy, was I wrong!The overall outside finish is impressive except for the very rough unfinished bottom surfaces of both the body and crank arm. The real problem is the fact that one grinding surfaces, (the inside of the body) is just roughly machined out of the cast aluminum itself, while the grinder head is hardened stainless steel! It don't take much intelligence to figure out that this isn't a good combination! The unit I got was very hard to turn, wouldn't stay in adjustment (as far as grind setting), and ground erratically sized particles.Needless to say, this thing was returned very quickly to the kitchen store from where I bought it!

There is verity for all the negative comments so I will not repeat them. I've had mine for 30+ years and I keep at at my stove for use in cooking when I want to use only white pepper. It is not worth more than $10. Very, very, extrement, over-rated. Hard to hold and crank, and you have to hold it carefuly (precisement) so as not to injure your index finger with the inelegant crank when you turn it. The crank turns too freely and grinds just air and then it gets obstructed by a pepper corn and then needs erratically higher torqueing (ergs) to overcome the seed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I've used this at a friend's house and it always worked fine, so I decided to get one for myself. I must have gotten a defective one, because it is very difficult to grind. It works OK for a turn or two, then it locks up and requires a ridiculous amount of force to get it to move at all. I tried adjusting the nut at the bottom to see if that helped, and it didn't make much difference. It's true that it's very easy to fill, it has a good feel (though it's sort of small for a guy's hands, I think), it looks good, and the ground pepper (when you can get it to work) is aromatic and tastes great. If it cranked more easily, I'd be a happy customer, but as it is, I'm returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Perfex","review":"I've used a French made Perfex pepper mill for over thirty years. It still works magnificently now just as it did new. It's always been rather high priced (although mine was bought at much lower numerical dollar amount) but in the long run it's the cheapest option. It'll work beautifully for a very very long time. It's hard to imagine how much pepper has gone through mine over the years (I like pepper) and even use it for recipes that call for a few tablespoons of ground pepper (grind...grind...grind).

The interesting thing is the woman is initially anti-Semitic, but the musician comes from the same town she does in Russia, where most of his family was murdered in a pogrom years ago. His kind manner and obvious trauma turns her around--a little too quickly for me, but after all this is only a three-act play.My only real complaint is that dialogue is written phonetically whenever someone speaks with an accent. I'd rather just be told they're speaking with a heavy German or Irish accent than have it spelled out in unintelligible dialect. Worse yet, the grandmother's lines are entirely in Yiddish without any translation.

I was hoping for your typical 20-something single living in Manhattan novel, which Cat's Meow is, but I wanted some entertainment. The humor was non-gratifying and seemed to play to a very small group in society; the fashion socialites of Manhattan. The author throws around celebrity and fashion guru names as if the general public has any idea who she is referring to. This aside, the biggest problem I had with the book was the mockery the author made out of international adoption.

Can't say that about this particular book. The story seemed so over the top, not to mention it was also told in a rather choppy fashion. The main character Cat is a total airhead and so selfish, it made me want to stop reading entirely. For example, there was a reality in The Devil Wears Prada that made me really like Andy, relate to her and want to see her succeed in the challenging world of high fashion. That reality was definitely not present in this book and I ended up really disliking the characters presented. Even the ending was a total letdown. Cat tries to get bailed out by her mummy at age 29.

(whats the point of hands free?!?!) You never know when the Bluetooth is low on battery, and you cant turn it off..if you turn it on it runs for a long time. Sometimes when you already have it on your year and you want to end a call it will not end the call. When you want to make a call it goes to \\"voice command\\" instead of just regular dial which can be annoying because your phone cant hear you on the Bluetooth. The sound gets very garbled if you are more than a foot away from your phone (again whats the point) I have heard bad things about all Bluetooth headsets so this is just like all the others, but its a good price so if you really NEED one get it anyway (rather pay less then more for a crapy product in general)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great but swivels right off your ear","review":"I am replacing this headset (It replaced an Explorer 320) with a 510 because I am sick and tired of swivel earhooks getting loose and falling off-which is apparently NOT a warranty issue according to Plantronics. Their recommendation? Replace the headset. I ordered my 510 tonight-can't wait to replace this one. Note-it drops calls frequently, which I know is a cell-phone company issue because it happens with the phone too. But the swivel earpieces are ridiculous.

The only thing I don't like about it is that you have to say a couple of extra commands (i.e. 'name dial') before you can call someone. It's a little counter-intuitive, but overall very easy to pair up and use. I lost my first one and re-ordered the exact same one due to its easy functions and mid-range pricing. Definitely a good buy, and seems to have pretty long battery life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never had a problem with Plantronics","review":"I am giving this headset four stars because I have had multiple Plantronics bluetooth headsets, and this is not my favorite, but it definitely gets the job done. This headset retails for approx. $60.00, and so for that I say it is definitely worth it's dollar for what Amazon has it listed for.

I would recommend this headset to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"Although better quality than the price would directly make you think, don't expect too much out of this bt headset. The single button functions are extremely easy to use and the headset fits fairly well on most ears; however, it does not play nicely with (sun)glasses. Range in itself is fine, for about 20 feet it performs like it is right next to the phone.... which is about like most other (nicer) headsets do at 20'. I experience constant static whenever listening to someone, but they always say my voice comes through clearly so at least the microphone works well. As a side note, be nice to your callers; the microphone picks up on high or sharp sounds with extraordinary precision and even a microwave beeping will make them yell at you in scorn. Overall, I still feel like this is about the best purchase I could have made in this price bracket and would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"exelent hearing very comfortable","review":"This is the best offer for a Bluetooth handsetI had Motorola, Erickson this is the best of allonly bad thing is that the battery dais without notice, it gives you twobeeps and 10 seconds to finish your call."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"This headset is low cost, simple, easy to setup & use.

I've used it with my Nokia 6300 as well as my iPhone. The Nokia has voice recognition dialing that can be activated from the headset without touching the phone.About the fit in your ear, well, I know there may be more confortable options, but to be honest, I constantly forget I'm wearing it until my cell phone rings; it is light, has a good grip and fits smoothly on either one of your ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me!","review":"I have had this ear piece for over a year and I find that I can hear voices very well and no one has complained that they cannot hear me. I like the fact that the ear piece flips to right or left and I think it is comfortable in the ear. I have had other ear pieces that have had the ear bud type attachment and they actually gave me ear pain and in a hurry I couldn't place it to my ear and talk. Unlike this one. For me I like this product, the price was reasonable, and it is a workhorse. So what if it flashes blue at least it does what it is supposed to do in a clear, no distortion, manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a great unit.","review":"This Bluetooth lets in a lot of outside noise.

No two products could be more different in quality. True, this headset is much more sleek and modern-looking (the 510 does look a little like a hearing-aid), but it had a great range of at least 15 to 20 feet. This is not AT ALL the case with the 330. You will need to wear it on the same side of your body as your phone if you do not want to deal with unbearable voice distrotion and static. It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.

While at first the book looks like a simple child's tale, I found the picture book to be very adult in nature. It's the story of a young girl struggling out on the streets during old Victorian times. This little girl endures so much pain that the ending is near inconceivable. Surely a happy ending will be waiting around the corner... But this is a book by Edward Gorey.Aside from the actual words within the book, Gorey also gives his readers detailed images for each page. Each illustration contains at least one ghoulish creature, only adding to the book's whimsy. Each illustration is painstakingly detailed, and very gothic. It's a fun read for any adult who's tired of the same old 'happily ever after' tales, but most definitely not a children's book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of his works","review":"This is the first book I ever read by Gorey. After becoming a bit of a fan and exploring his writings further, I think this story holds up as having the best narrative and shock value. A great little yarn and a must for the collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep the sand out","review":"We bought this for our son in the military who is deployed in Iraq.

When I got this, my wife wondered why, but as we watched it she ended up laughing even more than I did. Wilder's antics and his reactions to the extremes he is put through are so funny. Pryor's more practical character's dealings with Wilder, the trouble they are in, and the world in general is great. Even with the way too quickly occurring and too happy ending, this movie is still an enjoyable watch, the ending almost fits the heroes style.

However, along the way, their plans are put on hold as they get framed for bank robbery and find themselves in a Texas penitentiary. They then go through a series of adventures attempting to prove their innocence, escape from prison, and stay alive.The movie does not contain a very original plot, but the viewer can expect many laughs watching two of the greatest comedians of all time at their best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me in stitches.","review":"This movie is a great representation of the comedic chemistry shared by Pryor and Wilder.

What he fails to mention until the latter half of the book is that he considers himself one of the Third Questers who has his own interpretation of the historical Jesus. This revelation immediately places into question the validity of his critiques of the other questers. Without personal knowledge of the thought of the scholars presented, the reader has no way of knowing whether Witherington has adequately, much less accurately, presented their positions. The book is useful in helping the reader to appreciate the vast number of theories circulating about the historical Jesus, but the reader must read Witherington's critiques in light of his hidden agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get the delivery over 1 month","review":"I don't get the book delivered yet. Could you please reprocess this delivery?Grant"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid and querulous","review":"Witherington's book disappoints because it tantalizes the reader intoexpecting a transcending view of the historical-Jesus controversy,but in fact it is merely another partisan effort. You will like it if youalready accept that the Gospels are blandly historical; or, asWitherington hopefully avers in the foreword, if you already believethat Christ is reigning in glory and only waiting for you to notice. Butfor that matter, sermons are much cheaper than hardcover books,and are available in churches all across the land every Sunday."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this one much","review":"Witherington outlines the many different views of the Jesus Quest on who Jesus was and cites a few authors for each view. He just goes a little too far in trashing the opinions of his fellow scholars (many of which are better than him). The most valuable part of this book was the list of authors he has in his table of contents. Marcus Borg, John Dominic Crossan, Burton Mack, E.P. Sanders, Geza Vermes, Gerd Thiessen, Richard Horsley, Elizabeth Scussler Fiorenza, and the Jesus Seminar. Read these authors instead of wasting your time reading about what Witherington THINKS about each of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair reviews","review":"Unlike the other reviewers, I do not see the author as polemic or unfair. He provides reasonable arguements to back his claims. Perhaps he is somewhat harsh on Marcus Borg, but his arguements with the Jesus Seminar are certainly shared by many others (such as Meier). There are only two criticisms I would have: the writing is not as engaging as authors like Meier or Vermes and the book's value primarily would be to those who have read a fair number of the texts he references. To get a picture of Jesus just from this book and biblical accounts would be a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great asian dipping sauce","review":"This tastes EXACTLY like a seasoning pack from \\"Top Ramen\\" Oriental flavor.

GO GIRL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable...","review":"This was my first time reading Nikki Turner, so I don't have any of her other books to compare to. I thought this book was very enjoyable, it kept me turning the page. I do have to agree with some of the other reviewers, that some of the course of events were just not realistic to me. But, we are reading FICTION. The point that I took away from the book was that the main character just wanted to be loved and accepted for who she was. She was doing so much for others trying to get that acceptance, she learned that she wasn't honoring herself in the process. She learned that she had to look out for herself, and not rely on other people. This was a good read in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Nikki","review":"Nikki My Girl!!!To me this one seem to be slow and to long time to get to the point I found my self skipping pages to get the action. Sorry Nikki Your a great writer I just didnt FEEL this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice and comments irritating","review":"While the general flow of the yoga exercises is good, I just could not get past his voice, which I found irritating. I also found most of his interjected comments or random thoughts to be silly and distracting. I donated the book and CD to charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downward Facing \\"Doggy\\"?","review":"He lost me with Downward Facing \\"Doggy\\". It got worse with his use of the word \\"fricken\\". Then I couldn't take any more when he started talking about making love to his lover. All the while I'm having to listen to his irritating lisp. Terrible CD! Doesn't move along at all, boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Better than blowing hot breath or spit on your lens. More powerful than I can spit air out. It's bigger than I was expecting (bulb takes up my entire palm). The red tip comes out and you can invert it for storage. It does what it's supposed to and it does it well. Worth getting if you want to care for your camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which size?","review":"Got myself the large cleaning kit (with the small, bulb rocket blower) and two of the large rocket blowers (one red, one black). With respect to size, the question is should you go for the small, medium or large blower? In my view, go with the large one. It saves time, punches enough air to dislodge dust, and is comfortable to hold as well as carry everywhere. When I received my blowers, my first thought was \\"Lucky I ordered the large one!\\" The large blowers are so effective that I've not yet opened my bulb set (it looks like it'll serve as a permanent, at home, in case I lose my large blowers, backup unit). Giottos and amazon.com rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Was Looking For","review":"Almost like having an unlimited air can that doesn't spray too hard for delicate electronics, glasses, sunglasses, and even blowing the dust out of my keyboard. It does take some serious pumping to get a good blast of air, but I imagine since I got the large its probably more effective than the medium or small. I would recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"The AA1900 Rocket Air Blaster fits well in the palm of my hand and allows energetic air blasts to clean telescope lenses and eyepieces. It is especially helpful with recessed optics, getting dust out of edges as well as on the central surfaces. Have not had it long enough to judge durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocket Air Blaster Man","review":"This thing is huge! It must move an entire cubic foot of air per squeeze. And its not just for cleaning cameras. Blow drying hair while camping, help with starting the campfire, and messing around with babies have all been sucessfully accomplished by yours truly. I know, it can't move that much air, but buy one, you'll see. Great price, quick shipping. Seriously, it saved our vacation pics by removing a piece of gunk from the sensor in the wife's 5d mk ii with no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for lenses","review":"used this to clean my lens before i put my UV filter on.Does the job without any problems"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best around, but don't expect the force of compressed air.","review":"I bought this because I tried a compressed air can (exactly once) and discovered how it showered my UV filter with tiny water droplets, creating a much bigger problem. In short, this is the most powerful squeeze blower, but don't believe the hype that the force compares to compressed air-- it doesn't. Also, the blower is much bigger than the standard silver dollar-size, but it's still plenty small for a camcorder user to fit in their bag (for SLR users, maybe not)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larger than expected but still good!","review":"This item was a bit larger than I was expecting. It fits in my bag, but what I care about most is how effective it is. It works. Mind you it only removes loose particles (anything 'sticky' will require a brush or a wipe). I like it. If I ever have to buy another one, I will."},{"rating":"2","title":"aa1900 Rocket","review":"It blows the dirt off the objects that you want to clean. Just what you would need to do. Very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essentials","review":"is an essential tool for anyone who owns a DSRL and wants to clean safely from the camera body, lens and sensor."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"This product doesn't work any better than any of the other products out there that claim to clean the sensor in your digital camera. All it does is blow the dust to some other spot on the sensor. Don't waste your money. It's probably best to have a professional clean your sensor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Weak for Any Use","review":"This bulb blower is extremely weak. I could blow air out of my mouth stronger than it. I can't use it for my computer or my camera. It's just a funky desk ornament at this point. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used it once, broke my Canon 40D","review":"Title says it all, on the first use trying to clean the sensor of my Canon 40D it broke something. The mirror mechanism no longer functions properly and the camera shows an error when trying to take pictures. Not sure the bust of air that this thing creates is gentle enough - maybe for front element lens cleaning, but not for sensor cleaning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rocket Air Blaster Blasts Air","review":"This is a handy device, built to last. It does one thing only, blasts air when you squeeze it, and does this well. Helps blow dust off camera equipment so you don't touch the galss to clean it. Simple product. Well constructed. Should last a lifetime. You use it to blow air on stuff you don't want to touch. That's all I have to say about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrew's Review","review":"This rocket air blaster saved me money from a shop cleaning the dust off my sensor of my Canon 50D. I was able to clear most of the dust away, there is still a little left, but no big particulates though. For a good cleaning it is a little of a workout, but you have to make sure to make sure you never touch the tip or anything else on the sensor itself. Each time I try and clean it I can see more dust removed. I might try and have it cleaned at some point down the road to see how well they can actually do it but for now I don't really have a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well but large size","review":"Blaster seems to work well. It generates fast air gusts. I don't have room in my small camera bag to store something practically the size of another lens, but well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little blower","review":"I keep a small one of these in my camera bag and the larger AA1900 one at home. Both will do the trick, but the larger one gets those stubborn dust specs off more easily. I have no complaints about the product. It works exactly as described and successfully removes dust specs every time. I would recommend it anyone looking for a product that can safely blow dust off of image sensors or lenses."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can blow harder...","review":"I decided to get the larger version after reading reviews of the smaller one not really doing any good; the large one seems to be just as useless. I'll stick to compressed air. Maybe this has use for camera lenses or something else; I just wanted something to clean the dust off of my computer quickly without having to buy a new can every couple of weeks. Maybe I didn't know what I was buying.P.S. - The title of this review is not, in any way shape or form, an invitation. XD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love em.","review":"I prefer these blowers to any other form of sensor cleaning for cameras. They don't leave anything residuel and the are powerful enough to get most if not all the dust out in one cleaning. I always have one with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dar she blows!","review":"This thin works great. I used it on my lens, laptop keyboard, etc. Good construction. Cheap price. I wished it had more power but I guess I'm used to compressed air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely useful product!","review":"If you have dust in your DSLR camera, then go ahead and buy this! It works like magic. Just remember that if you have dust on your sensor, then you're going to have to turn the camera on, put it on BULB mode and then press AND HOLD the shutter (so you can access the sensor) and at the same time use this blaster in order to get the dust off the sensor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!","review":"This is a great product and a great price!! Fast shipper! I love Amazon there are no issues. The Large one blows a lot of air to remove any dust!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what its for","review":"I bought this to clean the glass on the sensor of my mirrorless SLR and it worked like a charm. I had some dust that needed removal and blew it in and it worked. Not much else to say. Does what it says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"Having DSLR has its own benefits, but cleaning lenses and filters all the time from lint, dust, and finger prints is not one of them! These Giotto's Rocket Blaster can ease your pain of cleaning camera equipment exponentially. This is my third one and by far the best. I've also two smaller ones,Giottos AA1910 Medium Rocket Air Blaster (6.6)andGiottos AA1920 Rocket Air Blaster Small (Black), but this one simply blows the other ones away! You cannot imagine how much air it does blow. You cannot go wrong with Giotto's quality, and they last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocket Blaster is a Blast","review":"The rocket blaster is perfect for removing dust on the sensor. It took two tries to finally get all the dust but it did what it was designed to do very well. The blast is just the right amount of pressure to dislodge all dust and make for a clean job. Well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ought to have","review":"A blower is one of the tools an SLR owner ought to have.I actually prefer my BRUSH for the outside of the camera and the lens, because it takes up less space and works better (had one for years).But the blower can go places the brush can not (inside the camera).PS [camera manual says to use a blower]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job but not as 'super strong' as everyone says","review":"I like this air blaster. It does it's job well and the design is great in that it does not allow for forward facing particles to get into the device. It also has a nice, albeit a touch humorous look, being a rocket and all. This is no way as forceful as compressed air cans, but you would never want to use those near your camera equipment, especially your sensor. It get's the job done, but also will not replace a professional cleaning - but it is a good interim solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"The standard for a hand-squeezed air blower","review":"The nozzle can be stored inside the squeeze bulb if the length is a problem, but I prefer to leave it out so it is ready to use. Large volume of air. Only problem I have read of is you may not want to put this in your carry-on luggage because at least one photographer reported that airline security seized his (presumably because it might be mistaken as a grenade)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Effective","review":"I use this blower all the time to make sure my equipment is dust free. It works like a charm. It provides a very powerful blast of air. I would definitely buy this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as good as compressed air","review":"It works fine and is decent at removing the loose dust. Also provides a good wrist workout. Looks good enough to be left out, unlike compressed air canisters. Comp air, though, is more forceful and gets the more clingy dust off. The rocket's nozzle tends to sway when you squeeze it. Not a full replacement for comp air. I'd only really recommend it for those who are environmentally conscious and/or budget conscious."},{"rating":"2","title":"works like a charm","review":"the giottos aa1900 rocket air blaster is quite the useful tool. i use it for cleaning my dslr camera, although it can be used for anything where dust can penetrate (like computer keyboard, car dash panel, etc). it's a lot bigger in real life than it looks like in the picture, and i thought it would be cumbersome to lug around. but i realize the squeeze bulb has to be big to provide a stronger blast of air. i just carry the giottos with me in my camera bag and do a quick blast on the lens before i shoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Works as advertised. If you get only one size, definitely get this larger one. Blows out a good amount of concentrated air. Would agree with other reviewers that it does indeed suck in air from the nozzle as well as the back - but that's fine. I blew out my camera and all my lenses - now my forearms are quite sore from the pumping action, so you'll also get a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Excellent so far, very usable. I would buy a few more of these just to have as backups. Definitely would do business with them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Use","review":"Do not use this item to clean your camera sensor. It will make a bad situation a lot worse. It just blows dust around and adds more dust. Mt daughter likes to play with it in the tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling apart after 5 years","review":"Just pulled my rocket blower off the shelf after about a year to blow off some computer gear. Rubber turned my hand black. I put a cloth around it as I used it and it turned the cloth black. The rubber is falling apart. It is still working well but it will make a constant mess until it wears out. The QC sticker on it says 2008. I bought it July of 08. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"Overhyped. This product is soft rubber and no better than any cheap(er) blower. Very disappointed. This thing is worth $2"},{"rating":"1","title":"User Error?","review":"Does the tip of the blaster have to be thisclose to what needs to be moved, in order for this thing to work?Tried blasting my keyboard, and it didn't move a single pet hair from the keys.

Any advice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems a bit pricey for such a low tech product.","review":"Seems to me that I could have used a new, unused nasal syringe to blow a little air on the mirror and accomplish the same thing, but then I'm new at the photography thing... someone please explain to me why this is so superior???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just pucker up and blow","review":"I burst out laughing when I opened the container for Giottos Rocket Air Blaster. It looked like the suction device used for infants whose noses are congested. Then I tried it and was annoyed. Its \\"rocket\\" blast was slightly less than the \\"blast\\" from a turkey baster. I leaned over my keys and blew. Same results as the \\"Rocket.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple yet effective","review":"As much as dust was a headache in film photography it also has its challenges in digital. There are two types of dust that adhere to the sensor: dry & wet. This blower is very effective in getting rid of the dry which is what one deals with most of the time. More complex (and expensive) remedies are needed for the wet variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Needed to keep your camera sensor out of dust. Won't damage your camera. A litle too big for traveling. There's a smaller model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will kill your sensor.","review":"I bought one of this blasters like two years ago. The blaster it is not only left black residue in my hand, but it smeared the sensor with the same goop. So, after almost an hour doing a wet cleaning on the sensor the goop it is almost gone. Hope I have not scratched the sensor. It definitively do not work the risk. It will work for a year or two, but eventually will spray the sensor with decaying rubber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better buy a brush instead of this Blower","review":"The item looks very big than I expected and does not fit in my camera bag. My friend bought a camera brush to clean the lens. After a trip to Florida, when we were cleaning the lenses (beach sand accumulated in the lens), this blower was of no use. But was able to do a better job with the brush. I might not recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"useful!","review":"I've been using it everywhere! I don't personally have a camera to use it on,but I bought this to clean out keyboards (laptop and desktop) without buying canned air over and over.It does great job cleaning keyboards, and also cleaning out the fan/heatsink.I use it to clean all small electronics I have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Blows","review":"Not sure what to say other than it blows, blows hard and blows well. It is far better than those smaller round thin plastic blowers with a cheap brush at the end... The nozzle gets into the tight corners and blasts the dust away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giottos AA1900 Large Rocket Blaster","review":"Several have mentioned it is too big, simply remove the red nozzle and place it into the rubber bulb. Next place this combination in a zip-loc bag to keep it clean and dry.Lastly DO NOT, repeat, DO NOT touch the sensor with the red end. It will leave a smudge that is difficult to clean off, even with Eclipse cleaning solution. Don't ask me how I know this. <g> It could damage the sensor too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have yet to encounter antyhign that works as well...","review":"This thing works great and is durable. The only strike against it is that it is bulky."},{"rating":"2","title":"blow the dust!!","review":"i love my rocket blower! i had thought about getting the smaller version for easy to carry, but the large one is better IMHO. just a couple squeeze verse multiple squeeze to get the dust out.after using this, i don't have to clean my sensors for a while, which is a good thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very usefull","review":"Very good material used.

Love that. Can't wait to put this to use and clean my dslr!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"I bought this air blaster to clean the dust that was on my camera lens. This product was inexpensive, and it did the job very well.The natural rubber is quite soft. It also has a bit of a smell, but I think that shouldn't be a problem. I wonder if the rubber will degrade in a matter of 5 to 10 years.I'm not sure why the nozzle needs to be so long. But I can't really complain, since it gets the job done.I highly recommend people to carry one of these in their camera bag, because as we know, dust is everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job, and it does it well","review":"Where do I start. I was so excited to take it out of the box, and when I finally held it in my hand, I started dusting anything and everything in my room. It works like a charm. You can tell it's made of quality materials once you hold it. Very solid and easy to use, and a great workout for your forearm to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look at the dimensions before buying","review":"I bought this because it was a good deal and I needed something to clean my sensor with. I didn't realize it was almost 8\\" long until after I received it, but I don't mind because I don't need to carry it in my camera bag. The bigger size also allows more powerful bursts of air to clean off the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cleanest air blaster ever","review":"kind of weird rating air bulbs, but this one is really good at getting the dust of my d3x sensor, which is a dust magnet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked really well!","review":"I've had dirt and crud in my camera sensor for as long as I can remember, but was too scared to fumble with it and/or get it cleaned. I finally bought this product per my friend's recommendation and all I can say is - so long sensor dusts!

Just follow the instructions in your camera manual in setting your camera to sensor cleaning mode, and squirt away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have had a couple bulb types","review":"but this is the best one so far which his why it consistently gets high ratings.

I have noticed many people using canned air for their laptops/computer keyboards and I thought that has to get pricey after a while. Works just as well as canned air and never runs out or gets freezing cold when using for more than 10 seconds.

I originally intended to use this for cleaning my DSLR, but I found out that these can be used to blow dust off of watches when changing batteries or opening the case. At first I thought it was nuts how they are charging this much just for a rubber air blower. But when I received it, I found out that there is no way you can own a DSLR without owning one of these. These things blow dust out of your DSLR without sucking it back in, it sucks air from the back through a filter and blows it through the front. These rocket blowers are very strong, I tried blowing it on my face a couple of times to test the power, to my surprise I couldn't breath when I do it because it's so strong that it feels like you're dropping from a hill on a roller coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giottos AA1900 Rocket Blaster","review":"My wife and I love this blaster.

It's a must have for your photography equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well at home where size isn't a problem","review":"This does push lots of air, quickly, so works very well for cleaning lenses and other things.I'm not finding any intake from the front as I've read others were concerned about. The air intake is at the base where the legs are, and there's apparently an intake valve to prevent sucking dust in from the front."},{"rating":"2","title":"works fine","review":"This is designed to clear dust from camera lenses but I use it for my keyboard and cigarette making machines. It is not as concentrated or as forceful as canned air (which I still use occasionally) but there is no continuing cost so it saves money. I am sure there will be many one time uses that popup in the years ahead. The rocket shape allows you to stand it up on any flat surface- a nice little plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME book!!","review":"This book is a wonderful book for anyone who loves music.

The piece I got is barely 8\\" at its longest measurement, and doesn't take up much room in my 6 gallon tank.

The one I received was very thin and would not really even be seen above the gravel just laying on top of it. It was mainly just a thin wedge not really even a branch. The length was a good size, around 10in, but it was 2in wide and .5in or less thick, with a 3in section at one end that was the full branch diameter. If I was using several pieces it might have been better, the three inch end looked cool but it would have looked odd in my 20 double high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"Another fantastic album by Armik.

When he travels there in the company of his favorite young cousin, Lord Lindeth, he will meet Ancilla Trent, well born but impoverished paid companion to a spoilt wealthy beauty named Tiffany Wield.Tiffany expects the world (and everyone else's life) to revolve around her. This will lead to all sorts of complications when any eligible males near her pay any sort of attention to other girls/women.This book is charming - you cannot help but love the characters (other than Tiffany, of course, and she is clearly meant to be obnoxious and ridiculous) and cannot help but hope that somehow everything will work out so that the right couples manage to come together to find happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just excellent!","review":"I'm currently going through a phase of reading Georgette Heyer novels (great fun) and of the fifteen or so that I've read to date, this is definitely my favourite.Once again, Heyer provides a quiet heroine who wins the hero through her intelligence and manner, rather than astonishing beauty. In this book, the Astonishing Beauty gets her come-uppance.Waldo Hawkridge is perhaps rather less flawed than most human beings, but the gentle romance between him and Ancilla Trent is lovely to read.The usual cast of amusing characters, great language and amusing escapades makes this book well worth reading. I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"Mostly wanted to just leave a rating rather than a review.I have read many GH books and, for me, this one was ok but not one of her better stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, but less spark","review":"The eponymous hero is in the countryside to fix up a tottering inherited mansion for his pet charity, housing orphans. The heroine is a woman of good birth who has fallen upon hard times and is employed in trying to rein in the excesses of a young, spoiled beauty. There is not much spark between them, but this is a charming book with a host of secondary characters, from a young cousin who is bedazzled by the gorgeous Tiffany, to another cousin who wants to wheedle a stake in a horse-selling business from the great Sir Waldo, to all the younger people in the neighborhood and their seniors. There isn't a complicated plot and the humor is gentle rather than uproarious. This is a low-key, enjoyable book, well-suited for lazy summertime reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"commenting on audio quality only","review":"This was once a favorite album and I had very high hopes for this remastered edition. Unfortunately I can't give this a thumbs up. I find it very harsh sounding and with a muted low end. If you read others that comment about the \\"loudness wars\\" or \\"compressed dynamics\\" of remastered discs - I'd say this one is a prime example of that - of how remastering should not be done. It's too bad, this really is a great album - just stay away from this edition if audio quality is a criteria.

And leaving out key tracks is irritating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crushed Nuts","review":"This record's been around the block a couple of times and even a quick glance here at the other reviews tells me folks out there think the world of Rush but I gots to say first off the dude up front comes way too close to sounding like a cross between a chipmunk and a Muppet. And it's not just the alarming Marc Bolan on helium vocal delivery either, the lyrics themselves made me get up and rummage round for alternative footwear. Shoes really if you must know, very nearly brown ones. I honestly don't think I'm kidding about this--Hemispheres too I've bunged in the Toshiba more than once, well away from that unspeakable cover--so if we could somehow selectively expunge Geddy Lee's excruciatingly cartoonical bleating we might just have ourselves here a right crunchy bunch of Canuckleheads."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best 70s Rock has to offer","review":"The Rush CD A Farewell to Kings could very well be the bands greatest theme CD. The band captures Rock and Roll storytelling at its best. The bands mastery of this musical storytelling really shines through on this CD. With so many Rock and Roll Records taking this path at this time, take Pink Floyd for example, I think A Farewell to Kings is often overlooked.Take the begining of this CD, the gentle guitar into the thrashing rhythems of Neal Pearts drum kit and Geddy Lees Electric Bass. Its a tale of Heros, or lack there of. Its a stroy of the common man, the union worker that strugles to make ends meet. Such a fantastic CD, every Rock fan should enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album and follow up to the classic \\"2112\\"","review":"With \\"A Farewell to Kings\\", Rush achieved a new level of maturity in their songwriting, arrangements, and recording that they lacked on their previous albums. Every song on this album is very good, with \\"Xanadu\\" and \\"Closer to the Heart\\" being the best of the group. Most bands can't follow up a classic album this well, and Rush deserves a lot of credit for putting out a strong record like \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" after \\"2112\\". If I had to find one negative about this album, it would be that it doesn't have the same raw intensity of \\"2112\\". Every Rush fan will already own this, but still a strong recommendation to non-hardcore fans that want to own a few Rush albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like 'Em or Love 'Em","review":"Rush is one of those bands you either love or love to hate. Personally I fall into the former category. A Farewell to Kings was the first Rush album,well 8-track, that I purchased way back at the tender age of 15. The lyrics, the music, the percussion... It all spoke to me then and continues to resonate 35 years later. If you are a Rush fan, you'll love this album.

Nice thing about the late 70's is both were in play in rock music. The ancher of the hard gitars and the ethearic moogs and bass strums which were a bit more than just for volumn as in most bands. Alex still playes gitars with a velocity and vigor rivaling other bands like Led Zepplin, Aerosmith, and Queen's tomfoolery \\"Byt'n the Dust\\". Most of the sound is nulled out in the 80's by Geddy's synth and Neils percussive work. But here the gitar playes the roll it should in additon, not subtraction to the more evolved high tech devices in the later part of the 1970's. Cygnus X-1 uses gitars, not synth to make those unearthly sounds. Only Xanadu actually uses Geddy's Moog with that Fargo sound later ringing in my ears in \\"Hemispeheres\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Stuff","review":"Believe it or not, my 13 yr old son is on his drum kit listening to Xadadu on the headphones.

I even managed to return this record (unheard of those days) after giving the record store owner some bogus story of the vinyl being warped. Not long after returning the album I somehow ended up with a homemade cassette of 'Kings'.I'd give it a listen from time to time. Being in the 7th or 8th grade I had plenty of time to listen to music. It started to grow on me. Before I knew it I had '2112', 'Fly by Night', Exit Stage Left', and 'Permanent Waves'.The world of Rush is rich. Rarely does one find this type of devotion to music (and this much expertise). Neil Peart still manages to amaze me today. 'Kings' is a great place to start your Rush collection. Don't worry. You'll want to fill in the collection soon enough with all their other stuff.If you're a fan and don't have this gem why are you waiting? This is an essential Rush purchase!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute","review":"This house is very cute. My Father-in-law and I put it together in about 45min.

Foremost, the table (with pedestal support) is form-fitted to mount on the inside, NOT the outside as shown! A huge chunk of playspace is now gone. Beyond this, most screw holes are missing and it is impossible to gain entry for a drill. This is most critical when an adult must secure the roof from the inside as the final step. Pushing the screw tip to bite into the plastic can cause the screw head to countersink, or worse!

Once the house arrived my daughter brought out her barbies and princess music and had a wonderful time.

But it has held up structurally and my kid never complained about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! **Updated after 15 months of use**","review":"I bought this booster strictly based on reviews of others. I hadn't even had a chance to shop for one in a store and was out of the country when I had it delivered to our home. We have used it for about 3 weeks now. We use it for every meal at home and love it. It is just the right firmness. It's not hard, but it's not \\"squishy\\" either. There are no cracks or crevices for hiding crumbs so wiping it down and cleaning it up is a breeze. The green is a light mint color. Would buy again and would recommend to friends and family without hesitation.Every positive thing I mentioned 14 months ago still stands. This booster seat has held up very well. It looks as good today as it did when we first used it. Our son has never complained of being uncomfortable in this seat. Would still buy it again in a heartbeat!

It's the perfect size for my 2 year old. It's also lightweight which makes traveling with it easy. My only complaint is that it doesn't strap down to the chair. It doesn't move a lot while he's in it but I'm fairly certain if he really started wiggling he could make it slide around in the chair. I just make sure he's never sitting alone at the table though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and easy to clean","review":"We are using the Prince Lionheart booster seat for 2 weeks already. My 2.5-year old son loves it. For him it has dual function - booster seat and a toy to carry around and kick as a soccer ball. The seat if fully taking this abuse without complaining and without showing any signs of wear&tear. My son never sits still while on it - he is leaning to the side, front, back, climbing on the table, etc. The booster seat stays securely on the chair and that is without any strapping. Our chairs are having a leather seat so I was a bit worried whether the booster seat would not slip and whether it might damage the leather of the seat - well, no, it did not. It is super easy to clean and I use a steam cleaner on it at least once a week because my son makes a mess on it. I would definitely recommend this booster seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing booster seat","review":"The shape and size of this booster seat is perfect, but the material used to make it is awful.

After 18 months of use with our middle child this product has developed cracks around the rear edge of the seat. While the booster is still useable, I'm guessing it will be completely unusable in about 6 months. I'm not sure if the cracks are because of the material used in creating the seat or the the seat design. The seat is open on the bottom with ribs or cross bars to support the seat made from the same plastic material as the seat. The seat is cracking where there is no material reinforcement.Our older child has used the BabySmart Cooshee Booster Seat for 4+ year and it is still going strong. The BabySmart Cooshee Booster has a solid base. I'm not how it's designed internally, but it's held up very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice seamless booster seat!","review":"I bought this booster seat because there was so seams or cracks for food to get into, and it appeared easy to clean. I also liked that there was no seat belt as my son doesn't need the seat belt and it's just one more thing to get in the way and to clean. All in all this booster does a nice job. The sides are easy to clean and it's comfy for him. My gripes are that I wish it had straps to hold it on to the chair, as it tips easily if he tips, and it usually ends up on the floor when he gets down. Also, it has a rougher surface (not uncomfortable though) where he sits, I'm guessing to help keep his butt from sliding. That rougher part is harder to wipe clean. The only way I can get it clean it to submurse it in water. Otherwise the sides of the seat wipe down easily. All in all it's what I was looking for and it meets my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stains and hard to clean","review":"We've had this booster for a couple years now, and I just can't stand it anymore. It just looks terrible! It is impossible to keep clean because it's seat surface is porous and textured. It absorbs stains and is difficult to wipe up messes completely because it isn't smooth. Also, it shifts easily when my toddler tries to climb in himself, causing many near falls. We also have a Fisher Price plastic booster and a Cooshie booster that I much prefer.

I Lost this album years back and was never able to find it. It was then during a random search a i did. The disk was in perfect condition as the album art. The case was damaged inside, but I fixed that with no prob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instar, the novel by Ryder Brady","review":"This book arrived in very good condition for an old (1976, I think) paperback, and, having read half of it, I would say it makes for a lively read. Family story, about an alcoholic husband and South American wife and their four children in New England (shore). Good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dipped in some type of 'coating'","review":"I thought I had read enough reviews before clicking the 'buy' button...maybe I missed the one that happened to mention that this very nice-sized cutting board is not a raw wood board, it has been dipped (or painted) with a varnish type of coating. This means that every time you chop/cut on this board, slivers of the coating will be coming off into your food--This 'coating' should be mentioned and defined in the description. I thought others would want to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid! Great quality!","review":"This board has a groove and a little \\"pond\\" for collecting juices, so you never end up with a messy countertop! It also has rubber feet that prevent it from sliding around on the countertop, plus recessed handles that make it a snap to lift and carry! It also stands up well to a regular assault from my husband armed with an electric carving knife! And the fine-grained wood makes it very easy to clean, although I personally wouldn't put this in the dishwasher. Wood + water + high temperatures tend to add up to warping and splitting, and this is such a nice board, I want it to last for decades!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall","review":"My 10 month old has been hooked on Baby Einstein since he was about 4 months old! His first was Bach. Then Mozart, Beethoven, Mc Donald, and now Da Vinci. Each of them has one part that I usually have to fast forward through because they make him fidgety. However, I use these videos to get him to sit still and eat. I sit him in his highchair and for the 25 minutes (on average) the videos are on, he's completely mesmerized and opens his mouth without any fidgeting except with this particular video he fidgets a little when they draw the body parts. Otherwise, it's a great sing-along for parents too, and a good teaching mechanism for the body parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the series","review":"I strongly suggest not to buy this item. My kids love all the others but not this one. So far the length of it is the longest but full of boring scenes. My daughter is such a baby Einstein fan that I almost bought all their products from books to DVDs, but she won't sit to watch it from beginning to ending the very first time. It's completely a waste of money. Seems they don't have any new ideas to attract young viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Baby Einstein video that doesn't impress me","review":"Featured in this dvd are eyes, ears, mouth, nose, face, hands and feet. Each segment begins the same way by showing and speaking the word in 3 languages; English, Spanish and French. So for face it is \\"face, la cara, le visage\\". Then they show all kinds of faces on people, animals, toys, etc. Then the hand of an artist draws a face and then there is a puppet segment. Afterwards they do another body part and it follows the same routine. They sing \\"Head and Shoulders, Knees and Toes\\". Again, as with the other Baby Einstein dvd's I have viewed, I am just not impressed. It's just boring. Baby Neptune, Galileo, Newton & Numbers Nursery are the only ones that I'd recommend. Read all of my reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"My 19-month old son is a big Baby Einstein fan, but this particular video does not hold his attention. I have been increasingly dissatisfied with the videos since the Baby Einstein Co. sold out to Disney, and I noticed it with this one especially. It seems much more like TV than the earlier videos. The images move too quickly, and the puppets don't have as much character. I'm disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the bilingual children","review":"At first, I did not expect a lot, but this DVD is packed with what us bilingual parents are looking for!! Once you choose which language you want to listen to (English, French, or Spanish,) the DVD plays in that language and the words are written in that language on the screen for you to read to your child. There is also a Bonus Material section which is packed with \\"discovery cards,\\" \\"the five senses,\\" puppet shows,\\" and \\"story time.\\" All narrated in the particular language you choose. So you get more than just a DVD movie.My 18-month-old loves it. We play it in Spanish and he can identify his own body parts as he watches and listens. He points at his nose and eyes when he sees that section.I have been waiting for a DVD like this a long time. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Head, shoulders, knees and toes!!!","review":"My 2 year old loves this video. She loves the puppets, as with the other Baby Einstein videos we own, but she loves this one even more because of the kids. Her favorite part is when they sing \\"Head, shoulders, knees and toes.\\" She follows and sings right along with them. She has lost interest in Baby Mozart and Beethovan, which are geared more toward infants. This one holds her attention. She calls it \\"the monkey movie\\" because she loves the monkey puppets. The only boring part which does not seem to hold her attention is when they draw the body parts. Other than that, this is a great video to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Da Vinci","review":"Another great product from the Baby Einstein company. I am so thrilled with their children's materials. This video is a great learning tool and entertaining. My son actually pointed to my ear the other day after watching this video. I sing the head, shoulders, knees and toes with the video and do the movements and he really is starting to get the body parts. We have purchased many kids videos for my son, as well as being given videos as gifts. Most videos he gets bored with or wont watch at all, but, so far he has loved almost all the Baby Einstein vdeos. This one is a definate must to any toddler's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for very young toddlers","review":"I notice that some of the video's detractors claim that it does not hold their children's attention. I think that perhaps they are expecting it to entertain too old of a child. I think this video is great for babies between 12 and 16 months of age.My 12-month old received it for her birthday and loves it! She points to her own body parts and even yells out at the screen, \\"Eye!\\" and \\"Ear!\\" No matter whatever else is going on around her, she stops dead in her tracks to watch this video. She loves looking at the up-close shots of different eyes, ears, noses, hands, feet, etc. However, I do not expect that it will hold her interest much beyond 18 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just sold ours on eBay","review":"My son got this as a Christmas gift last year along with Baby Neptune (which he loves). The first time we popped the DVD in he cried. For some reason he didn't like the monkey puppets at all and even after one year (he just turned two) he still doesn't like it. Otherwise it seems like a good video to introduce the basic body parts, but the monkey puppets were a no-go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"If you have a premature baby their attention span may not hold, but an awesome CD & was well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't watch it","review":"My son will not watch this Baby Einstein dvd. He doesn't like the drawing aspect. On one instance-it was drawing a face-and let's just be honest...babies don't have the attention span to watch something like that.He didn't last but about 2 minutes-and that was with me trying to be chatty about it while he watched. Not one of the best Baby Einstein dvd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The biggest Hit","review":"We have 8 Einstein dvd is this is my daughter fav. She is 15 months old and we are working on naming/pointing to body parts and this dvd is great teaching tool to help us along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interactive Fun","review":"My 16 month old has been watching (and enjoying) Baby Einstein Videos since she was 3 months. This one is one of her current favorites. She laughs outloud during a couple of the puppet skits and has been quickly learning her eyes, ears and nose. Since watching this video she is constantly pointing at all of our noses and ears and she says \\"eyse\\" out loud. She doesn't like the part where they draw the body parts, but for the most part she really enjoys this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"D.J. enjoy's it","review":"I have all the Baby Einstein DVDs. Regarding the last two releases: My son did not care to much for Baby McDonald the first few times I played it for him, however it eventually grew on him. Baby Da Vinci was an immediate hit for him. I am in the process of teaching my 18 month old his body parts so I think the DVD had meaning for him. I look forward to Baby Noah being released in October."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute for 1year olds","review":"This DVD is a big hit in our house although our daughter didn't seem as interested in it as she did with other ones from the series. Maybe because she already knew most of her body parts by then but I'm not sure. She really loved the puppets, they even make us laugh! Again, great for kids about one year old or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Da Vinci","review":"My grandson, 15 months old, lost interest every time the hand drawings started. I understand that the \\"Da Vinci\\" in the title would imply that there are drawings, but it would have been a better DVD for my grandson if the creators had just left those out. He loves the World Animals DVD, but this one will just be filed away. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning DVD for babies","review":"My 6-month-old has been watching and enjoying this DVD since he was 4 months old. This entertaining and educational DVD teaches body parts to babies in a fun way using puppets, drawings and catchy music. It teaches the different body parts in 3 languages - English, Spanish and French. My baby gets excited, and starts laughing when I turn it on. He especially loves the puppets. It might be boring to adults but it sure is captivating to babies. The only con I have is I wish it allows parents to choose the other non-English languages other than just Spanish and French."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVD","review":"I typically order used DVDs and I rec'd this one last week.I decided to play it this week for my son and it starts getting hung up within the first minute.This DVD will play with skipping and stopping until about 10 min in and then it just stops all together.all in all, I am not particularly pleased with this purchase, but that's the risk you take when buying a used item I guess"},{"rating":"1","title":"momma of super active boy","review":"i got this for my son when he was around 11 months because he loved this other baby einstein dvd that is for sounds I think. well he hates this one. he is super busy and this has lots of parts that drag in it, and he really loves the cartoon monkey and bee but the show more of real life pics in this which he thinks is boring. this is probably fine for those babies that are pretty content with just anything, but if you have a little explorer I would skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO LANGUAGE in this dvd","review":"I was surprised to find that the dvd is pretty much without any spoken language. After reading the description, with reference to language tracks, I expected to find words spoken along with the classical music. That is not the case. Puppets introduce each section of the dvd. They say \\"eye\\" one time and show a picture of an eye. Then there is a long track of classical music accompanied by images of eyes. No repetition of the word. This is the case with each body part.I interact with my toddler as we watch dvds, so I'm able to provide the verbal stimulation, but I was disappointed that we didn't get to hear other voices saying the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Have\\" for Anyone Serious about Security","review":"Douglas Schweitzer follows up with another excellent read and a definite \\"must have\\" in any administrator's library, be he a professional or a home user with only one or twodesktops to manage.

The rest is defining malicious code, basic computer info (what is FAT16 and FAT32), what the FBI is doing about cyberhackers, etc. There is a pretty good chapter on social engineering, but most of the book would only be useful for people new to systems administration and in a small shop. There are only two pages about network firewalls - not much for a book with \\"network\\" in the title.A number of known worms are described but there is no strategy proposed for detecting or stopping them.

Each new subject that the author would talk about would be scattered throughout the chapter instead of being in the near paragraphs to follow. I found myself shifting from one page to many pages away just to piece together what the subject was about. I found it to be unorganized. The book was very dry and could have been worded better. By the way the software it comes with is not all that. It's just a review with cheap graphics.

It is structured well, and is easy to skim through and find answers if you're looking for a specific question. Also, it's not so dry as some textbooks, so you don't fall asleep so easily while studying!The best thing about this book is the CD Rom study guide. The study guide has an overview of the book, with pictures and video clips of computer animated sequences of cell function, muscle function, and many other things. It also has activities in which you click and drag answers for study sheets. At the end of each section there is a quiz, with randomly selected questions from the study material, and at the end of a chapter a unit exam. This helped me tremendously in preparing for tests.

I took a college course that focused on Emily Dickinson and these were the two books used for that course (there were optional books, which I also read, but nowhere near as good as these). The author's analysis of some poems can be questioned (whose cannot?), but the wealth of material presented is incredible. This is THE reference book about her life.

Starting the book left me hopeful for great things to come. He methodically, almost puritanically, reviews the lives surrounding and including the Dickinson family piling the letters upon each other. Yet, in the end, what possibly made Emily Dickinson withdraw into her room and from the world? Forced to abandon suitors by her Father, rejection by Sue after a brief gay encounter, agoraphobia? Any and all possibilities are buried under the letters and placed in obscure footnotes at best.

I would not recommend this to anyone because it is dangerous. Spend extra money and get something that's secure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back 2 years later to buy another one","review":"I've had this bath mat for two years and am back online to buy a second one. I hang it up on the towel rack after every use and occasionally spray it with lysol and have had no problems with it until recently. The suction cups work fine and I have no problem putting it down in the tub, neither does my two year old for that matter. I've washed it in the washer and air dryed. The only reason I'm buying another one is that finally after two years of regular usage I've noticed dark mold spots that I can't get rid of in the washing maching so I\\"m getting a new one. I think two years for $10 is a great deal. As far as suction cups go I lay it in the tub and begin running water and then push down the suction cups before the water level gets too high to allow it to float."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slides around -- the least safe bathmat I've ever used","review":"It has a very low traction on the bottom compared to any other bath mats I've used.

I don't know why, but they do. Some reviewers claimed this was a great mat for them, others said that it does not stick/floats up when there is water in the tub and/or is dangerous. The latter are correct. This mat is a major bathroom hazard!!! Listen to your fellow reviewers and don't buy it. As much as this pains me to say: you will not find a decent tub mat on Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $10","review":"This is one of the worst excuses for a bath mat I have seen. It does not stay put in the tub and is very dangerous to use. The suction cups DO NOT adhere to the tub as advertised and the mat floats on top of the water. Trying to get in the tub on top of the floating bathmat is very dangerous and could lead to serious injury. A total waste of money, DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"About killed me!","review":"This bath mat is incredibly unsafe!! Initially I was thrilled to find it, but within a day it was slipping in the tub, nearly \\"leveling\\" me! I tried adjusting it this way and that, to no avail. Finally realized it just doesn't have enough suction cups on one end, so I cut it for safety's sake. It STILL slips around mercilessly!! I'm very sure-footed, as is my roommate, and we have no elders or young kids at home, but I wanted to warn people to be VERY CAREFUL about purchasing this mat.

The cushioning doesn't hold up very long and the mat becomes flat within two weeks of regular daily bathing.2. The 54 suction cups do NOT hold the mat securely in place. NOT AT ALL. It slides around when you're taking a shower and floats to the top of the water when you're taking a bath.3. Even with regular washings in the washing machine, the mat still mildews and then you're stuck with nasty looking stains.When the mat is brand new, it's incredibly comfortable (but still dangerous) and then everything goes downhill from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior!","review":"I ordered this mat because I have a two-year-old granddaughter who always wants to stand up in the tub.

Her books never fail to engage and keep my attention. When I finish one of her books I often find myself missing the characters I have just spent so much time reading about. The characters of the Templeton family were no exception. I think Kate's story was my favorite as it was the most realistic of the three. But I loved them all. I would love to see more books in the future - perhaps written in a similar fashion to the McGregor family series of books. I would like to see books written about Ali, Kayla, and JT's journeys into adulthood. Keep writing Nora - I'll always be a great fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"Nora Roberts is a great story teller, she knows how to keep you interested in her books. This triology makes you want to buy all the books. Its a great tale of three friends that were all from totally different families and who became the best of friends who were there whenever they were in trouble. No matter what family crisis arose, they could always count on each other. You show them as they were growing up and all the problems that each encountered. It was nice seeing them search for a hidden treasure all their lives and finally find it when they least expected it. It was a great finish to the books. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a Nora Roberts fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Publishing Date","review":"The summary about the book is misleading since it sais that it was published in 2012 when in fact it is a new edition of an old book.

Please Nora don't write books like these anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"The only reason I gave this book two stars rather than one is the HILARIOUS scene where Peter and Josh play tennis. Otherwise... yuck!! First of all, I found it very unrealistic that Margo would simply be able to channel all of her love for modeling into love for her store. You aren't forced out of a high-profile career like that without a LOT of emotional fallout. Second of all, Josh treated her like dirt! Always being the one with the control, making snide little comments about how she brought it on herself. I wonder how well HE would have done without the Templeton family name and fortune behind him. Margo may have been whiny, but she built her career from the ground from scratch and had a lot more inner strength than I saw from Josh. Not that I liked either one all that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring to Dream","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I am going to read the whole dream trilogy just so I can find out what happens to Josh and Margo. I thought that \\" Daring to Dream\\" was an excellent book, but the ending was slightly unrealistic.

He conducted extensive field research and his one on one interviews created a valuable data bank. Wardell Pomeroy was one of his collaborators at the Institute for Sex Research that worked with Dr. Kinsey, this book Dr. Kinsey and the Institute for Sex Research is an interesting insight into Dr. Kinsey and his work.Dr. Kinsey took his work seriously and his contributions to the field are invaluable.

It is amaxing when we realize that there were many more burst bubbles long before the recent dotcom bubble of 2000. Who would have thought that people would have gone to such lengths to obtain a tulip bulb. During this era, the right bulb could be traded for a person's estate. What amazing history. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone intreested in history in general, or to the individual fascinated by our more recent business booms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"As a history buff, there is nothing more exciting than finding a well-written book on an aspect of history that I know nothing about. This book on the tulip wars or mania of the Netherlands is written with wit, style and surprising depth for such a short work. I read Tulipomania after reading Longitude, which I found rather disappointing with its extremely narrow focus, and its inability to make Harrison come alive as a human being (although I understand the author was hampered by lack of primary sources). Tulipomania makes these 16th and 17th century people come alive and seem relevant to our day (I'm thinking about the stock market fascination with all the dotcoms of the Internet). I would give the book 5 stars, except for it would have really benefited by some drawings of those wonderous flowers."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy, in-depth read","review":"Mike Dash's \\"Tulipomania\\" is typical of the current crop of \\"popular\\" history books. Much like Dava Sobel's \\"Longitude\\", Mr. Dash takes a narrow topic/event and dissects it in great detail, while presenting his findings in a manner that is palatable to the academic and non-academic alike. The Dutch Tulip Craze of 1636-37 is one of the most overworked stories in the world of business, but Mr. Dash does well in interweaving his narrative of the Craze with anecdotal stories of the famous and common people whose lives were affected. The description of economic conditions and everyday life are rich and detailed. (Anyone in the brewing industry will salivate at the beer-consumption figures for Haarlem in 1636!) But the book does not get bogged down in detail and keeps a fast pace. Though not as strong as \\"Longitude\\", \\"Tulipomania\\" is a worthy addition to the canon of microhistorical works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burst Your Bubble","review":"This slim volume is a remarkably entertaining cultural history of the tulip, focusing its particular attention on the Tulip Bubble of the Netherlands in the 1630s. Dash, however, back up and provides a very readable history of the flower and how it first made its way west to Europe, why it took root, so to speak, in the United Provinces, and how the sale of this flower evolved from the passion of a few dedicated botanists to a financial mania that swept the entire nation. Dash has done his research remarkably well (and I very much like the way he organizes his notes thematically), and he conveys his research in a way that is both erudite and charming. I heartily recommend for fans of popular history, financial history and gardening buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"ignores the most interesting question","review":"I found this book to be a light, breezy read. It's great if that is what you are looking for, but I would have liked a little more depth. The question that is most interesting to me is ignored: how did people propagate and hybridize the tulips? I am a gardener myself, and i would love to know the answer to this question. Every time the book says \\"...and soon there were dozens of tulip gardens...\\" i got frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I had such high hopes for this book after reading all the reviews and hearing so much about the 'tulip craze'. I also love popular history books that focus on a single topic, like The Arcanum by Janet Gleason ( a brilliant read!). This book meandered so much and completely failed to capture my interest. I ended up skimming most of it and couldn't wait for it to end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Topic, Bad Writing","review":"I have been left completely unfulfilled. I wanted to learn about the Tulipomania and the ensuing chaos, but all I got was a poorly written collection of hyperbole, conjecture, and unorganized thought. The author clearly disagrees with himself in different parts of the story (when he discusses the fall of the trade he mentions the demise as being both instantaneous, and not happening immediately), and seems as if he read a few historical documents and then pieces together the story on his own. He spends too much time on insignificant examples or individual tulip purchases (they are not used as supporting information, but used to drive the story), and seems to impress himself with his ability to convert Guilders into Stuivers. I was REALLY disappointed with this work, and could not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat History","review":"I'm a history buff that discovered the tulip mania phenomenon and was eager to read an exciting, in-depth account of a truly fascinating piece of history. Mike Dash's non-fiction attempt, laden with cumbersome statistics and repeated points, was disappointing and impossible to read through as anything but research. The focus jumps around and is hard to follow or care about without any connecting characters or themes, and I was thoroughly disappointed overall with this book.

I felt enraged, crazy and bereft, but I couldn't really explain what happened to make me feel the way I felt. I could deal with the abandonment and adultery, but I could not deal with the preplanning that went in to the actual divorce.

There isn't too much detail in this book unlike Tony Robbin's \\"Unlimited Power\\". It is best that you really have a good idea of how to properly visualize beforehand because this book doesn't really spoon feed beginners. There isn't anything magical or instant about this book either. It really just helped me to have a positive attitude. I felt that \\"Unlimited Power\\" gave me better directions on strong visualizations and Robbin's exercises were more instant pushing me towards my goals.

But even the good ones usually don't work because all self-help books require you practice and practice. While reading them they seem amazing and then you finish them, put them down and you're back to your old ways.This book won't let you. It is too thought provoking to let you just procrastinate again.It requires a complete change in your way of thinking and gives you the right tools to achieve this change.

First, the installation disc does not contain the software that allows you to create the appropriate synchronization links (it is outdated for Vista). You have to go and load Windows Mobile Device Center. After loading the new program I could get the units to acknowledge one another existed but I still could not get the 2 units to transfer data.

However, like most books they include sections on stuff that you should already know before you buy the book. For example, how to play a CD and stuff like that. However, this book does succeed in providing information on XP, but I still feel that some stuff was left out. The book needs to be a little bigger. Due to the fact that this book is based for the beginner I cannot recommend that you get this book if you are trying to get more knowledge about XP. Instead I would recommend that you invest in Microsoft Windows XP Inside and Out, Second Edition. This book will give you all the information you want and then some.

Not a bad goal, except I looked at the good reviews, bought this copy, and ended up wasting my money. This book is a scanned copy of the online version of the original text. The translation is horrible, and there are textual errors, strange spacings, and phrases of complete gibberish throughout.

The publisher makes a disclaimer about the possibility of inaccuracies but this in itself is inexcusable.

The book has been OCRed, so the markings that were on the book (underlining, circling, hi-lighting, etc) have become illegible characters inside words and sentences in the text. Furthermore, footnotes were not seperately recognized by the bad OCR software, so there are points where the text abruptly starts talking about something else. There are maybe one or two pages that i have found that have not been ruined in these ways, but on the whole the book is illegible.I am keeping my copy only because i think it is funny, but i do not suggest that you do that unless you are mildly masochistic.This could have all been avoided by merely using the scan and directly printing it, like what was dont for Matter and Memory, instead of copying and pasting to a word document."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked For Me","review":"I have a German Shepherd thats terrified of the slightest noise that comes out of my wood heater.

I do however find it sad that women are being not only judged by their age and physical appearance in the workplace, but also, the clothes they wear. Whether the outfit be too frilly or plain, people see women everyday and look at them more critically than men. Malloy wants to help women dress so they can get the promotion? Well, good deal. However I find that society could benefit from hiring people by the skills they posess, not by the maker of their blouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEW is hardly the appropriate word!","review":"The only thing new about this book is the insertion of the word new in the title. Whilst the fundamental methodolgy seems sound, this book is a total anachronism. It is riddled with references to class stereotypes which have been largely rendered redundant by the new economy. When the new generation of technology millionaires wear sneakers and T-shirts, advice on how to pick an \\"old school tie\\" to impress the boss simply doesn't cut it.There is, no doubt, a modern day \\"dress language\\" analogue to Molloy's original work, but there is scant evidence of it in this book. The methodology needs a fundamental re-work to bring it up to date and earn the title \\"new\\". If the author took the trouble to do this, no doubt he would have another best seller on his hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dandy is a flash chap","review":"A \\"dandy\\" was in the 19th century a man who dressed in the latest styles. For example, he was careful to wear a top hat and thunder and lightning trousers in the 1840s.Ironically, the original \\"dandy\\", \\"Beau\\" Brummell, an intimate of the Prince Regent, recommended in place of cheap flash attire dressing with utmost care, neatly and soberly. He moderated the *incroyable* fashions of the *jeunesse doree* of the 1790s, who'd adopted extreme fashion in reaction to the Puritanism of Robespierre.John Molloy's book is completely out of date. Ask your boss what you should wear to work.

Besides, he said, 4 button suits are called leisier suits.He later told me that he has followed dress for success since he found the book. I have noticed that many of the things like \\"red tie, white shirt\\" still get more respect than something else that is in style. I look very young for my age (21 looks 16) and the advice in this book help me to get respect when I conduct business meetings. I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dressing Sharp says: \\"I am professional, and I am here to do business!\\"","review":"I read this book some time ago, but many of the concepts are still valid.

I would respectfully disagree. Dressing sharp on appropriate occasions lifts the spirit, says: \\"I am professional, and I am here to do business!\\"Malloy's book is a classic on showing how men can dress for success. For men who aren't knowledgeable on what clothing to wear professionally or socially, this book is a good starting point.The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"},{"rating":"2","title":"Although apparently out-dated, it still applies","review":"I'll agree, I was skeptical about reading a book on dressing for success that is 10 years old, however the underlying concepts do hold true yet today. One thing I think we all need to remember is, the people making the decisions about hiring us or promoting us are generally 'old school'. They believe what is in this book. I don't think you can go wrong by reading and following it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible for certain professionals","review":"While the book is dated, most of the information is timeless and very useful. All politicians and trial lawyers MUST read this book if they hope to be successful, since the voting public and juries are made up of the people Molloy researched. Other executives, include those giving press briefings, dealing with reporters, and some sales professionals should study this book carefully.However, the book has its problems. It is in need of updating for information regarding casual dress. Many firms, including the old guard firms, are going business casual. Sales professionals are meeting customers in business casual dress. While the book speaks of the casual wardrobe, it assumes you are on the golf course, for example. My advice: buy this book if you deal with the public at all. If you are in a back office working on the network server for 12 hours a day and your boss doesn't care what (or if) you wear, go buy a couple of t-shirts instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"On its Last Legs","review":"I forgot to check the copyright date when I purchased this book and was disappointed when I found out that I purchased a 1988 book. This book was written when Reagan was President. I continually had to take Mr. Malloy's advice and project how his advice would apply today. I should not have to do this for a book titled the New Dress for Success. On the other hand, the underlying principles this book presents -- your dress matters -- dress to suit the situation -- do your research -- still apply. Consequently, this book still provides useful information for someone who needs advice on business dress. On the other hand, the color photos are very poor. This is a shame because much of the information presented requires photos of what does not work and what does work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 'Dated Prospectus' For Investing in Yourself.","review":"Too old for me (1988) - I wouldn't invest in a company with a 12 year old prospectus, why would I (or anyone else) invest in me with 1988 ideas?

I'm sure some changes have occurred in conservative men's fashions ( prevalence of silk summer jackets which Mr. Molloy says is unacceptable ).

As the other reviewer pointed out, this is the \\"texte integral.\\" This is not an edition to be read by somebody who is beginning to learn French. I consider myself very fluent in French and still have difficulties with some parts of the text.For a more advanced reader such as myself, this book is an excellent read. Dumas is an excellent author and I have enjoyed every story of his that I have ever read. The plot is well developed and engages the reader through to the end of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The text format of this book is terrible!","review":"Dumas rates five stars; the story rates five stars, but the formatting makes reading it on the Kindle a nightmare! The lines of text are fixed-length, and they are longer than the width of the Kindle page, even at the smallest character-set size. Thus each line displays as one full line, followed by a short overflow (or word-wrap) line. Ugh! I asked for, and received, my money back, and I deleted the item from my Kindle. I am VERY disappointed, as I wanted to read it in the original French, but I couldn't cope with the jerkiness that the ridiculous text formatting imposes on the reading process.

I now understand that there were only three of them, and the one I read had left me curiously enthralled. A true antihero, a man curse with immortality out only for himself. I lot touch with the character for many years until I stumbled upon this book with its sixteen short stories about the big warrior/sorcerer cursed by a mad god for the murder of his brother. And the stories didn't disappoint. Kane is evil, but he can accomplish good as well. Sometimes by chance, sometimes to destroy evil that has gotten in his way. Wagner is a terrific writer who definitely knows how to turn a phrase. Sixteen stories separated by the centuries lived by an immortal man. I recommend this book to any lover of fantasy, especially sword and sorcery."},{"rating":"2","title":"An empowering girl song","review":"This is one of those songs that girls just love singing.

And that \\"No Scrubs\\" theme was played out back in 2000 but Beyonce is still dragging it out. If she's not singing about how sexy her body is or going clubbin' with her girls, then she's singing about some loser. Some women think just because they're attractive and buy their guys expensive gifts, then they're going to have their behinds ki$$ed. Then when it doesn't work out they get upset and start singing \\"Me, Myself, and I\\" Part 100. This song lacks maturity and depth and is for simpletons."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish This Song Would Go Away!!!","review":"This song is more of a Destinys Child first album song.

Very enthusiastic I might add. So i decided to buy a cd from them. And I was amazed. Great production, not to polished, not to raw. I wouldn't call this death metal though. It's more a blend of traditional metal and hardcore. A bit like pro pain, but more intense. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The magnificent 2nd album!!!","review":"Make no mistake, this is the finest Swedish in style metal from Aarhus DENMARK. Hatesphere's 2nd album is even better than the ripping debut album from 2001. More versatile with more slower, real heavy passages and brutally grooving riffs. Good and classical use of keyboards by producer Tommy Hansen and a wider range in his vocal use by Jacob Bredahl. Especially check out the tracks \\"Kicking Ahead\\" and \\"Low Life Vendetta\\" along with \\"Insanity Arise\\" and \\"Deeper And Deeper\\". But all 9 tracks (european version) are extremly well written and virtuosly performed. Don't miss out on this great album, and be sure to check out the band live in action for a convincingly intense experience, featuring sublime performances by Mikael Ehlert and the rest of the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"only wanted the large, but...","review":"I've been looking for a mini whisk, but had no luck in the local stores.

One of the wisk was already rusted inside the clear package. Needless to say I am sending it back. Also they are much much smaller than I thought they might be.

Other than that, spend a little more and get something you can use."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't rust any more readily than any other whisk","review":"All steel, \\"stainless\\" or otherwise, will rust if kept wet for extended periods of time. Rinse them off by hand and dry with a towel before putting them away, and these will do just fine.They're quite handy for mixing extremely small amounts of things in extremely small vessels, like say, matcha in a shot glass, and I've gotten more than five dollars' worth of use out of them already.

And throughout the book, Ms. Roush is very honest, and shows great insight into herself, and both Saudi Arabia and America.Pat Roush is an inspiring role model who has shown steadfastness and determination through troubles that would have crushed a lesser person.This book is one I'm always going to keep on my bookshelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best out there","review":"I have read many books on the Middle East.

By the end of the book I still felt terrible for the girls but only annoyance for Ms. Roush.It's horrible to think about two American girls being trapped in one of the most repressive countries on Earth but what can be done really? Should a team of commandos be sent in to snatch the girls or should the American government hammer Saudi Arabia with sanctions?The first option won't fly. Nobody wants to see American soldiers get killed for the sake of a domestic dispute and if America punishes Saudi Arabia what about all the other countries? American children are in Germany and other European countries with their mothers and their American fathers can't even see them. The situation is also reversed. American parents have snatched children away from foreign born parents.This is a sad story and there is a lesson in it for the reader: think before you marry a foreigner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Waste","review":"This tote is not very convenient, the outside pockets are much too large and stuff just falls out, in addition, the craftsmanship is very poor and the bag did not hold up well.

They carry it with them everywhere to try to get the monsters and the items. You need to keep the comic book so you can get health, so don't lose it.

Now it does not work either.I am very disappointed in this product. When it works, it is a lot of fun for kids. Problem is, it is not durable for use by a careful child and won't last a second in younger, less experienced hands. It also is difficult for yonger ones to make the scanner read bar codes.

TTWBM is just as exuberant, funky, and soulful as her previous two albums, and she's tinkered with the sound only slightly. Musically, it seems to have more spacey electronic sounds thrown in to spice up the more traditional R&B production. Lyrically, she's on pretty familiar territory, exploring her spirituality and sexuality with a healthy dose of humor. \\"When I See You\\" is an funky ode to fighting just to make up, \\"Come Together\\" explores our society's attempts at unity after tragic recent events, \\"My Fondest Childhood Memories\\" is Macy's THIRD song about a murder fantasy, and \\"Screamin'\\" is about finding relief in sexual ecstacy.

The second was a funky mess. This one drops the adjectives altogether. The melodies feel second-hand, and the only interesting musical moment comes when she snitches a rhythm track from Kraftwerk (those funky homosapiens!). She also snitches a song title from the Beatles and constructs some sort of ambivalent reaction to the war around it that ends up being as muddled as everything here. The much-discussed \\"Childhood Memories\\" is nothing more than a novelty song; and the novelty that is Macy's croak really wears thin on this, to the point where the shrill \\"Sreamin'\\" is unlistenable.

(Although I've never heard it, they later released \\"Advanced Therapy\\", which is presumably another version of this song). \\"Tantau\\" is an ode to road rage (before they called it that), a story about dodging cops and running over a member of the Ku Klux Klan, which if nothing else seems to illustrate where Diatribe's political allegiances lie.

It smelled worse than a 20-year old ashtray. Not only was I not able to read the book, just being in proximity gave me a headache. I was not allowed leave it in my house. I even tried to seal it in plastic. I ended up throwing it away.I am very disappointed that the vendor (Joan's Collections) even shipped the book. I would like to pursue a full refund. I recommend that you suspend this vendor (Joan's Collections) from doing any further business on Amazon.com. This was not a mistake. No one could have shipped this book without knowing the level of toxicity.I demand a full refund on both the price of the book and the shipping from Joan's Collections.I do look forward to reading this book one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This is a very interesting book.

Gerard could have made the book half this length, including only details of the missions and a brief history, not 150 pages outlining eachn soldier's personal backround and if the ate steak rare or well-done. Overall interseting, but absolutely not a page turner. Only about 50% of the book is truly worth reading, the rest is irrelevant and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing that there was so little deception and so much","review":"I was expecting a book concentrating on how the military cleverly used deception (camoflage, sound effects, props and acting) during the war. What I got was too much a story of how bad the war was (the war was bad, being a soldier was bad, the officers were bad... ). While it's important to remember the horror of war that is for a different book, even if the horrors are displayed in the form of personal recollections. I accept the set up where the nature of the soldiers in this special unit was explained, but towards the end it really dragged as it carried on long after the end of the units active participation in the war.Needed more focus on the use and effectiveness of deception at war and less on inidividual's recollections of unrelated events."},{"rating":"1","title":"why waste the money?","review":"I'm sorry but why would I waste the money on a little calendar when I can buy Paige book for a dollar or so more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Horrible product.

Kagome almost got killed by Kikyou in the book and that gave Inuyasha a very uncomfortable feeling. Of course, Inuyasha wanted to be with Kagome, however, he still couldn't bare leaving Kikyou on her own after all those things b/w him and her in the past.

First of all, it isn't the \\"bad\\" kind of nudity. It's non-sexual. It's just a girl taking a bath. A reminder that in Japan, showing nudity in comics or on cartoons is just typical. I don't get why people would find the nudity in Inu-Yasha offensive because NONE of it is sexual.Anyways, I found this, like the other Inu-Yasha volumes, BRILLIANT and I want to read more.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best","review":"I don't think that this book was as good as McNaught's others. The hero was just cruel and mean to the heroine all through out the book. You don't see any warmth from the hero until towards the end of the book, which by then seems impossible that the heroine and the hero would be together forever. I'm not sure why others thought this book was romantic. I thought that the two characters were always arguing or that the hero was being cruel to the herione. I'd suggest reading Until You instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite romance novels.

He is an ass in many parts, but when we see his other side it all makes up for it. When I finished this book I wanted to cry because there was no epilogue. I wanted more Miss Judith McNaught!!! Ihave gone back and reread this book because I had so much withdrawal. I read it the first time from the library, and when I returned it I immediately went out to buy my own copy. I did have some issues with him going to his mistress after they were married, but McNaught made sure to let us know it was only to relieve his ache for Victoria...lol. I saw some low ratings, and I guess I loved this so much because the hero is such an alpha male. He is mean and scary, but when we look closer, he is so much more. I felt the butterflies, the sadness, and the triumph! McNaught is one of my favorite authors. I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"I know this book has already received so man reviews, but I had to write about it. I loved this book. I've read a lot of romance novels and I sincerely think this is one of the best. I love the fact that Jason and victoria fell in love slowly and not right away like some other novels and when they did, they did it deeply. you could watch their love unravel. Victoria wasn't some soft heroine that chased after a man and he didn't chase after her. it was all mutual when it happened and the whole story was very believable. The story is not strange like many make it seem, it was just more real than some of the other novels out there. There's a lot of dialogue between them so you can see what turned them on to each other. this is a must read.The only thing I hated about it is that the author never said when he left his mistress and it didn't have an epilogue. I would've loved to see what happened to them years after the story was done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"This was the first Judith McNaught book I read, it was wonderful! As soon as I finished it, I was out looking for more of her books! I could not put this book down and finished it in 1 day."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"blatant racism and abuse does not equal a romance novel.please read books by other authors if you need to know how a romance hero is supposed to treat women.it boggles my mind that so many women like the fact that the only decent character in the book, andrew, gets tossed aside for f'ed-up jason.edit- i just read mcnaught's kingdom of dreams. that book is really good. can't believe they're both by the same author. read that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"I read this book when it first came out and it was a book I could not put down. After all these years I still pick it up and reread it frequently. I love the characters and the way she developes them and their stories. A great read and high on my top 10 list. A KEEPER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My absolute favorite by Judith McNaught","review":"I will always regard Once & Always as my favorite JM book. This is the first book that ever made me cry. I was in agony reading about Jason's past and I longed for him to have a happy ending. I though Victoria was a wonderful spirited girl, but one who wasn't so perfect that she was annoying.I hold this book as the measure against which all other romance novels are judged. The same is true for Judith McNaught."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and boring","review":"This story was so boring. It's the same old stuff, man has a tormented past and can't treat anyone humanly... I was looking for romance, not a disgusting rape scene. Also it totally bothered me that Ms. McNaught would call another race as \\"dirty Indians\\" or that \\"Indians are barbarians who don't object to that kind of cruelty\\". Really you know first hand. What a bigot!! I'll be sticking to classier writers like Susan Elizabeth Phillips or Nan Ryan!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing tale, containing the perfect characters","review":"This is my first time reading a novel by Judith McNaught and let me say...I was not disappointed. I finished the book in less then three days :), I couldn't put this book down. Now I have been reading romance stories since I was in middle school...I am 19 now and I am going to have to admitt, that J.M. is a very talented writer and that \\"Once and Always\\" will have to go on top of the list with Kathleen Woodiwiss's \\"A Rose in Winter\\", along with \\"The Prize\\" and \\"My wicked Enchantress\\" & \\"The Ransom\\". I have just ordered two more of her novels, and I know they will be amazing. I would recomend this story to any romance reader who enjoys the \\"troubled\\" man, with a painful past, and the feisty, outspoken female as the main characters. Great book, READ IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreaking... --SPOILER ALERT--","review":"Romance Reader (Post: September 15, 2006 ),I agree with you wholeheartedly; I did not like the way this was done. Jason was indeed a difficult man to like due to his treatment of Victoria. It was disheartening that Victoria put up with it. Also, the story took a light attitude about a heinous deception that was instrumental in denying a love match between Andrew and Victoria. I didn't particularly care how others involved themselves in Victoria's personal relationships as if they had the right to determine her destiny. Then the novel ends on a happily ever after note but this wasn't the case, not for everyone. A good man (Andrew) had to leave England and return home to America without the woman he knew and loved most of his life because of the interference and deviousness of others :( The whole thing just left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment!!","review":"after reading 'Whitney, My Love' and 'Almost Heaven', i thought this one will have the same excitment as the other two have but i was so disappointed in this story. it doesn't have any warmth and love to it. Jason shows no love feelings or emotions until the last minute, which was impossible to believe. Victoria is not as strong as Ms.McNaught's other heroines. she tries too hard to please Jason. the storyline was not as intense as the other ones. the dialogues were not heart pumping speeches. there's no humor or laughter in this story. this is NOT one of Ms.McNaught's good book. i don't recommend to anyone else!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Awful","review":"To make this short and sweet: I hated Once And Always. The hero was just plain mean and paranoid, the heroine was practically groveling at the hero's feet for affection and there were too many misunderstandings based on the stupidest things. I agreed with one particular reviewer, the only character who was likeable was the heroine's ex-fiance, and he got tossed aside for the cruel, emotionally screwed up hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LONG SERIES OF BIG MISUNDERSTANDINGS, UGH","review":"The heroine is too perfect, except when it comes to common sense. The hero is so tortured that his intelligence is impaired, which makes him jump to wrong conclusions time after time after time. Ms. McNaught jumps from misunderstanding to misunderstanding, which frustrated me because the main characters did not seem to learn from their past mistakes regarding each other. Finally, after spending so much time on melodramatic nonsense, there is not an epilogue that shows how the protagonists managed to overcome their lack of effective communication to understand each other and live happily ever after. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"OK this story has so much to offer but the hero was an absolute jerk and I have NO IDEA why she stayed with the guy. I mean the guy was nasty to her....I also don't like it when a guy in LOVE will go and fool with his mistress. Just doesn't do it for me. If your a McNaught fan I'm sure you'll like it but otherwise I could have done without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy this one!!!!","review":"I got this book by accident and was glad I did. It was abused and battered, the cover hanging on by a thread. Obviously well read, I picked it up figuring someone in the past must have loved this book for it to be in this condition. From the first chapter I found that I was captured into the story. So rarely today do we see such a complex structuring of the characters and their story. This is Jason and Victoria's story; there is no murderer to be found, no waif to be saved, no wrong to be righted (inless you count an interfering grandmother) just the indepth growth of a relationship.We all make mistakes in relationships, misjudge people, assume motives, and mistakenly hurt them. It is the relationship that can survive this, that thrives. What a poignant moral for a story. Although the copy of my book was printed in 1987, see if you can pick this story up, its worth the read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF HER BEST!!!!!!!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have read a few bad reviews about it now I'm wondering if they read the same book. If you like Judith McNaught books you will love this one. If you never read anything from her, You'll love this one. I couldn't put it down when I was at work it was all that I could think about. Maybe its a mood your in when your reading certain books. I think this one is a keeper and will reread it someday..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"I have to be honest, I was hesitant to read this book because a lot of reviews said this was a darker romance. Yes, there are some disturbing scenes ( actually, only one if you ask me) and yes, Jason is a jerk, at times, but we musn't forget what he went through and the era which this book talks about. If a modern day romance had a scene like this, I would be appalled and refuse to read further. I think the reason I really liked the book is because of the early interaction between Jason and Victoria, the romance was very sweet and fulfilling! Unlike other books, where the hero and heroine only meet after a 100 or so pages or go in flashback, this book was to the point and focused on them entirely. Victoria is one of the sweetest heroines and perfect for a man like Jason. Like all Mcnaught protagonists, these two will also remain close to my heart forever. Just wish there was an epilogue too. Please do not let the one scene in the book miss you out on such a sweet and fulfilling love story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I thoguht the characters in this story were very WEAK. Especially the heroin Victoria. The only character I thought was the least bit likeable was the one that was treated the worst, barely made an appearance, and got completely shattered in the end. Andrew, Victoria's friend from childhood and a man she thought she would marry before she became an orphan. I thought the deception that her dear \\"uncle Charles\\" pulled on her was heinous, and was shocked that the heiroin would forgive him so fast for messing with her life to the extent that he did. She dropped Andrew like a bad habit with out so much as a glance back! Andrew seemed like he was the sweet good guy that could not hurt her. Jason repeatedly hurt her feelings (the scenes with the mistress were repulsive) and she was to weak to stand up to him and too weak to see that \\"uncle\\" Charles lied to her to get what he wanted. Not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I bought this book thinking it was something else, but inspite of this loved the story line so much that I stayed up all night reading it.The heroin was beleivable and loveable, the minor characters were quirky and helpful and the hero was a great example of a fellow worth saving. Definitely a worthy addition to any Romance readers collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book......Just One Problem","review":"This is the first ever Judith McNaught novel that I read and I am an avid romance novel reader...well I'm an avid reader of almost anything. Anyhow for a first time read I must admit, it was a page turner. I laughed, cried and got a little angry with the characters, so I bargain I got my monies worth. But the one problem I had was with Victoria's sister Dorothy, yes I know she was a supporting character, but I felt as though I wanted to get to know her better and didn't get the opportunity because she seemed to always be packed off to some distant land. And at the end of the story I got the impression that there was going to be a follw up story all about her, but there doesn't seem to be any and to be honest the ending was bad it left me with a few unanswered questions. Did anyone else feel that way ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gentleman! Sweet, lovely story...","review":"This novel was really breathtaking. I love the way Tory (the heroine) was determined to make Jason happy. She certainly wasn't the typical heroine we always read about. Throughout the story, it was so sweet how Jason slowly opened up to her. What can i say but he's very sweet and \\"gentle\\". I gave it a four star because I thought a certain \\"key\\" character's presence in one of the scene was very short. It left me saying, \\"That's it?\\" It didn't bother me THAT much but I also thought the ending was quite rushed. It could've atleast filled up one more page ..then I would've given it a happy full thumbs up! But in any case, it was a lovely lovely story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All-time favorite!","review":"This book made me a Judith McNaught fan instantaneously! I wish she would write more historical romances set in the regency era."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Story Ever","review":"I find this story somehow the best of what I had read in my life. I just loved this book.Supriseing,I have read it a couple of times and still I am not bored of it.Judith McNaught is one of the best author I have read,her romance's book,I would be eager to read it everytime she published a new one,I have read almost all her book.I just loved her story because the romance of her character is so full of passion,full of true love,unlike Dannielle Steel which her story are based of real story,I prefer a historican romance set in the 19th Century.Last of all,I trully loved this story. Read it,I'm sure it will be the best you have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Spellbinding!","review":"Where do I even begin? I have read all of McNaught's works a million times over but Once and Always holds a special place in my heart. McNaught is a GENIUS when it comes to storytelling. I love the complex, deep and passionate characters in this novel. The book is incredibly witty, clever and emotional. It will leave you smiling, laughing and crying within seconds of one another. If you haven't read any of her other works, I strongly recommend you do - they're simply spellbinding."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't get past how mean the Hero was...","review":"The heroine was easy to like, the hero was NOT. I ended up skipping a dozen pages at a time after the first third of the book because I got so tired of how mean the hero was. I have NO idea why the heroine could love him. He was just plain awful. I plowed through to the end, since I had spent money on the book, and normally like Judith McNaught, but this book is NOT a keeper. In fact, it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"You may read this only Once, but you'll love it for Always..","review":"this book is simply wonderful. i liked that there is more emotion placed on BOTH characters. jason and tory are not perfect people, both have their own personal demons to battle especially upon becoming married to each other. but they are perfect for one another.as is denoted by a McNaught novel, this story is laden with heart-wrenching scenes and unforgettable lines. we all know that in the end the couples always end up with one another in such romance books, but there's just something inexplicably unique in having characters (esp sexy, hunky, de-lish heroes) with flaws. jason is a very embittered and cynical man and having him commit a grievous sin against tory (which i also hated and is very controversial) just shows that not every romance tale is perfect.i must admit that the ending was quite weak. it felt as if it was written in a hurry. but all-in-all, i really loved this story. hmmm...not as good as Until You, though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best romance I ever read","review":"This by far my favorite romance novel. I have read it multiple times and still enjoy it just as much each time. I love Judith McNaught's writing and this is her best. I envy those who haven't read it because they get to experience anew when they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to read","review":"Mcnaught has to be one of the greatest romance author I have ever encountered. Every book by her is just too good to put down till the end. I love it how she is able to combine humor and romance but at the same time never bore the readers. I love how I can relate to the characters through out the whole story ... its almost as if the characters are real and you wish that you cold be there with them or be them. Simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Should All Live This Way","review":"By this point in Judith McNaught's career, one would thinkshe had developed a story line she's comfortable with andsimply modify it a tad from novel to novel. Nope. McNaughtjust keeps on creating, though retaining her hallmark offlawed, endearing principal and supporting characters andbeautifully scripted plots.The lovers this time around are Jason Fielding and VictoriaSeaton. The chief trouble is: they don't know they're supposedto be lovers. Uncharming, impenetrable Jason feels incapableof love, while Victoria is all too capable--with another man.The two dance around each other and Charles Fielding,convinced his son and distant cousin belong together.By the end of the novel, you will be convinced, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"rape scene equals bad (spoilers ahead!)","review":"Ok, I know that the male heroes in Judith McNaught's novels are brooding and dark, with deep secrets that explain why they are who they are etc. But for me this one took it just a bit too far with the wedding night rape scene. And at the end, when through a series of elaborate misunderstandings the hero realizes the heroine isn't dead, it seems like he wants to beat her senseless for scaring him! Um, this one was just a little too angsty/ravishment fantasy/weird for me. Ms. McNaught, you grossed me out.Interestingly, I read this novel for a class on popular literature, and I was looking forward to reading something fun for class. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEART WARMING","review":"Jason and Victoria are one of my favorite couples ever--and I've read a lot of Romance Novels. Victoria is a tender hearted beauty who despite her fears helps Jason heal from past wounds. Jason is not the most entertaining of Judith's heroes. However, his vulnerability hidden by a hard exterior draw you to him. I love the devious uncle in this book and am thankful he has the couple's best interest at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd review","review":"i love this book. it was the one that got me hooked on judith mcnaught. it's perfect. jason's a jerk, but can't help but love him. victoria's naive and innocent, but can't help but love her too. i love that you can pinpoint the exact moments when these two fall in love with each other. i fell in love with them too. no spoilers here, if you love pure romance, then, this is the book for you! i read this book 10 years ago and it still haunts me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, but don't read this one first!","review":"There are some very good reviews of this book following, so I will be brief with my 2 cents worth! I love Judith McNaught's writing and this is a very good book - well conceived and convincing. If you are new to her brilliant romances, I would suggest you read Something Wonderful or Almost Heaven first. Although these Regency Romances are all from the same time period and have some common threads, Once and Always is a little darker and more disturbing. The characters are well developed and Jason's cruelty toward Victoria and mistrust of women in general is explained well as the story enfolds. Having said that, there are some very disturbing sex scenes in this book. I think Jason Fielding is the only one of Judith's alpha male characters that can make Clayton (Whitney My Love) look like a choir boy! While this is not my favorite McNaught book, I still have to give it 5 stars for an excellent storyline and memorable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jason was dull, dull, dull-and did I mention dull?","review":"Jason never jumped off page for me like Clayton or Zach. In my mind he was just a dark shadow making the book bleak and dull. I felt sorry for Victoria for marrying this character instead of her childhood sweetheart.Don't get me wrong-Ms. McNaught won me over as a fan with Whitney, my Love and Perfect to name a few of her wonderful novels this one just did not strike my fancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"RACIST. Rapist. Look. I rhymed.","review":"I know that this book was written a while ago, but that is when I read it. When I was a young Indian woman. Yes. Indian. Born and raised in the US, I already had to deal with the awkward reality of 'one of these things is not like the other' as there weren't many of my ethnicity around, but to read 'dirty indian' in a book such as this had the decided effect of curdling my stomach.I am not a racist. I don't judge for skin color, religion, country of origin, sexual orientation - but I do base my judgements upon how people treat others.Bad form, Judith. This 'dirty indian' was hurt years ago by your verbiage - hurt, but not broken.I just wanted to warn others. This book could make you feel sick if you are Indian like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's me?","review":"I found this book to be very unromantic. I personally don't see what's so great about Judith Mcnaught. After reading this one and Whitney, my Love, which seem to be her two most popular, I can only conclude that some people think rape and stupid misunderstandings make for great romances. I don't. I did like the part where she sees all his scars, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile","review":"It's a wonder to me that this book was even published in the \\"romance\\" genre. Jason and Victoria are at odds with each other throughout the entire book until the last chapter. How is that romantic? Jason is the most hateful, bitter vile character I have ever read about. He is essentially a rapist who exhibits little to no regard for Victoria's feelings. Even his cruel past does not validate his treatment of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corn, anyone?","review":"Good grief! How corny can you get? And is Judith McNaught still writing? Because all her books seem to be reprints of reprints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best!","review":"I loved McNaught's Night Whispers and Someone to Watch Over Me, but Once and Always was too predictible, and when I read a book that says to me, \\"I can write this!\\", something is missing. So, a girl is left alone, moves in with family who arrange a marriage, don't like each other at first--then fall in love, and that's it, except for descriptions about her clothes and jewelry. Think I liked her dog \\"Wolf\\" the best!Perhaps I got spoiled by Penny Vincenzi books with more detail, challenges, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: For DVD-RAM enthusiasts only!","review":"After spending a few hours getting to know this unit, I boxed it up and took it back to the store for a refund. They say that it takes DVD-R, but what you can do with that format is very limited. Do not buy this expecting that you can use it with the same freedom as a VCR. The unit does not take DVD-RW's, so you can't erase and re-use in that format. It doesn't allow you to create chapters or menus with the DVD-R format -- just a straight, plain old record. No markers (after you finalize the disc), no chapters, no multiple programs, nothing! On the other hand, it allows you to do all that with the DVD-RAM format, but it's not a format that's compatable with other DVD players, so you can't share things with your friends & family because it's got this obscure format that nobody can use!

I have spent up to 30 minutes tryng to get it to record on a disc and ended in failure.

Its sort of reassuring to see so many others here who had had EXACTLY the same problems...the machine crashes, locks up, can't recover even by pulling the power out, just because it dosn't like a disc, but then it won't let you get the disc out. It has consumed hours and hours of my time. It will only work with Panasonic discs..nothing else.... but now after 12 months it is just more and more choosy about exactly which disc...indeed it is now no use at all. 400 down the drain, I used to like Panasonic. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Ready for Prime Time","review":"The machine was easy to set up but did not respond to included remote control, which differed from the manual illustration and instructions. Certain functions were not available on remote. Machine will not work with anything but Panasonic disks which happen to cost 2-6 times most other brands. Since I am planning to transfer literally hundreds of VHS tapes to CD-R, this just did not meet my needs. Finally, no matter which output on the machine I used, it never did show up on the TV except when the VHS was playing a tape through the DVD. So I am returning it and may try the Phillips which, even though it is more expensive, might be more what I want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I brought this from Amazon a month ago and it works just as easy as a VHS recorder. All you need is a blank disk and tell it when to record and it will record with it's built in timer. I have been using several brands of DVD-R disk and only have problems with the cheap ones(i.e. no name brands). The problems only happen rarely. For example, the recording will stop and go to recovery mode. But don't worry if goes to recovery mode, previous recordings are not destroy. However, you can't record anymore to that disk. The recorder also uses DVD-RAM disk and this is my most favorite type of disk. It treats a DVD-RAM disk like a hard drive. There is no recovery mode or hiccups that I have seen happen to a DVD-RAM disk yet. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value-time to dump your VCR!","review":"The machine worked great right out of the box. The manual leaves a bit to be desired, however. All of the required info is there, but it takes some digging to find the information you want. The machine works fine with all the brands of DVD-RAM disks I have tried, provided they are formated correctly (which the deck can do). The only real disk compatibility problem I have found is with Imation disks, which must be \\"unlocked\\" on a computer with a DVD-RAM drive before they can be set up for formating and use. I've settled on TDK DVD-RAM disks and have had no problems. Commercial movie DVD's play great, with great video & DOLBY digital optical pass-through to a decoder, and DVD-R recordings work fine. (I've archived some of my old VHS tapes with no problems.) This one's a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy only Panasonic dvd's","review":"I bought this unit based on other reviews I had read regarding compatibility. So far the only disc this thing will read is the one that was shipped with the unit. Even though TDK, Maxell and Sony discs were tried with the correct region and designations, the unit will not read them. Frustrating to say the least and no way to format or no help in the manual if this occurs.

Inflected languages are so foreign to an English speaker that every little bit helps. I understood Latin much better after learning Russian. Since Russian has more cases, they are more logical (in my opinion). In a similar way, the presentation of cases in this book makes everything clearer by comparing the two languages. For me, when I compared the different inflected languages I could get to the basic meaning of each case, instead of just memorizing individual functions. I also learned in this book that \\"accusative\\" is a bad translation of the term used by the Greeks, which is why it doesn't make much sense.

They both played twisted characters obsessed with Sebastian Venable. A movie worth seeing just for the acting nad the unbelievable story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say it, already!","review":"Long, slow, New Orleans-in-the-thirties talkfest filled with hystrionics and over-acting. Hepburn is excellent, playing a Southern grande dame with a decidedly New England accent, Taylor is gorgeous (complete with full makeup, tight dresses, and stilettos while incarcerated) and shreiks a lot, while Clift appears catatonic and bug-eyed throughout. McCambridge minces about with a silly, shrill drawl and looks ridiculous.The whole point of the movie is summed up in one sentence, but it takes 113 minutes to get to it.If you like Tennessee Williams' long-winded speeches, you'll love this movie.

Directed in 1959 by Joseph Mankievitz and based on one of Tennessee Williams' plays, it deals with very disturbing and uncomfortable subjects. Elizabeth Taylor is sensational, playing Catherine, the girl who may have lost her mind after having witnessed her cousin's bizarre death that occurred \\"suddenly, last summer\\" during the vacation. Katherine Hepburn is magnificent as his adoring mother who wants the disturbing memories been surgically removed from the girl's memory.Production design, set decorations, and costumes are absolutely stunning.

She plays a woman who is blamed of an aweful deed, one she is now paying for in a (some may say she was not blamed for it, but if you listen to the aunt, she does blame her for what happened). The rich aunt who just wants to \\"help\\" her, to \\"cut the lies from her head\\", is played by Katherine Hepburn, also fab in this movie. The truth that comes is sort of shocking, but you got to see it to understand because I ain't telling ya. Not for kids, but a very good watch. Tennesse Williams always gets it right, and this one, even though it seems so under-rated, is right.

No one, no matter what age is ready for such a gruesome and downright disgusting film that depicts cannibalism. I am a huge fan of Elizabeth Taylor, and when I picked up this movie, I envisioned a sweet beach romance due to the lighthearted-sounding and very misleading title: Suddenly, Last Summer. I couldn't have been more wrong. People are only attracted to this movie because they find it is different (obviously) and therefore feel they should embrace it because of its controversiality. I guess that's what sells these days-the more horrific, the better. Doesn't any one care about morals? Why should people pay to see the lowest animal instinct come out in humans?

Needless to say, it won't be my last. He's phenomenally adept at developing memorable characters, and weaves all the storylines of the book together is such a way that is enjoyable and smooth. I'm especially impressed with his imagery -- his writing is visceral and makes you feel emotions you typically don't experience in other books. Very impressive!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but a good read nonetheless","review":"Undoubtedly Nicholas Evans is my favorite author, having particularly enjoyed his first three books.

The second half; however, is boring and cliched. It only succeeded in making me angry. Abbie is the spoiled child of rich parents who engages in acts of terrorism, but never has to face the consequencese. Even when she is throwing tantrums and putting her loved ones in jail, no one ever calls her on it. I know this is supposed to be fiction, but it felt much too contrived and was very unconvincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Mystery","review":"To keep you turning the pages, but what I liked the most about this book, and the author in particular, is that his characters are so well developed.

It is slow and the characters are crazy, i do not like reading about a man basically raping his \\"girlfriend.\\" I almost quit reading it several times and the absolute ONLY reason i finshed it was to find out what happened to the sweet cowboy Ty at the end.

I went into it with a some knowledge of programming, no knowledge of SQL, and a strong background in logic.I very quickly discovered that, rather than a learning guide, what I purchased was the source code for several applications with vague descriptions of how data was being handled.In fairness, I do find what i am looking for about 10% of the time. The other 90% I am either checking the web for source, discussions, or tutorals, or I am using the PHP manual and playing hit and miss.It is my experience that anything this book can offer is freely available from the Web. And that the Web offerings are usually better documented.If you are a beginner, look elsewhere. This book will likely leave you dumbfounded.If you are experienced, look elsewhere. This book will likely bore you to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book as \\"short course\\" in php & mysql","review":"This book is very good for \\"not too novice\\" who would like to learn PHP & MySQL simultaneously. It is a nice book. If you would like to learn PHP and MySQL fastly, then this book is for you. If you buy this book, don't forget to buy another book which covers more about basic programming in PHP (you don't get it in this book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Errors in every script","review":"When I began reading this book I was excited because I like the way it explains things. My excitement dwindled when I attempted to install the scripts. I'm no pro when it comes to PHP or MySQL but I do have about 50 other scripts running that use them so I was surprised when I could not get a single script from the CD to work. Every one produces \\"Fatal error: Call to undefined function:...\\"The site that is allegedly associated with the book was of no help. Emails to both authors went without response.The errors could have to do with configuration of the server (or the php.ini file on the server) I am using to test the scripts on...that's just a guess given that some reviewers of this book seem to have had no problem.I wish I had spent the money I wasted on this book on chocolate. It would have taken less time to work off the calories than I expended trying to get these scripts to run."},{"rating":"1","title":"I NEVER RECEIVED THIS ORDER!","review":"RE: MYSQL/PHP DATABASE APPLICATIONS 2ND EDITION BOOKI NEVER RECEIVED THIS ORDER!I DID NOT RECEIVE MY MONEY BACK OR ANY ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF THE SELLER OR AMAZON TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM."},{"rating":"2","title":"No messing straight to what you need to know","review":"I liked this book a lot '- succinct style and LOTS of medium size examples.

Where would one look when trying to learn the how to connect to a database? I would at least expect a \\"hello world\\" example of connecting to a database not just a reference listing of the function call under \\"PHP's Built-in Functions\\".The examples given in the book aren't bad except that there is no mention of the file names so one could look them up on the CD.There has to be better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book contains typing errors and not organized","review":"This book is not well organized. Wrox books are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Fluff","review":"I first learned PHP from Luke Welling and Laura Thomson's excellent \\"PHP and MySQL Web Development,\\" and bought 'MySQL/PHP Database Applications' to provide an alternative perspective on solving problems. Unfortunately, this book doesn't offer enough content to warrant its high price.A full 58 pages is devoted to a PHP function reference which is a bit of a joke because PHP has one of the better online function references available. Code examples are printed with very large font again taking up more space than is necessary.Most important, though, some of these examples are a little bit suspect.They present a Catalog application written using Object Oriented Programming (OOP). This would have been valuable except that the classes they create are so specific that they couldn't be re-used -- basically negating the value of OOP to begin with.They do provide a couple of examples of good and bad relational database schema, but that isn't really worth the cost of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for starter","review":"This is surely great book. For the very beginner it can be a little difficult, but if you have some understanding of what the programming is, this book will move you to the state where you have power to create almost any PHP+MySQL application. Covers many aspects of PHP4 and MySQL application development in both procedural and Object Oriented approaches. There are lots of useful references for further improvement. After reading this book you don't need another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many typos","review":"There are typos everywhere. Often the typos render the code unusable. For the person who is learning these two development tools (which should be the target audience) you can't figure out why the code doesn't work. I hate paying money so that I can be frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"It COULD be worse...","review":"As a general overview, the content of the book is pretty good, and would have been great... but the authors and editors do a VERY poor job of being specific where necessary, verifying that the scripts offered in the text actually run, and explaining the concepts and language constructs before using them. For the beginner, this book would be confusing as all hell, due to the vague descriptions and error filled examples. For the experienced programmer looking to pick up PHP & mySQL skills, the book is pretty much an exercise in debugging and wince-management as the stream of vague descriptions of the topic at hand wash over you, or some language construct is used with no information about it anywhere close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurately updated, not complete","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. There is a lot of inaccurate information (phone numbers, prices) and there is much that is not included, as compared with other guides. It does seem that the author has \\"heard\\" about, rather than experienced first hand, some of the things he includes. For the independent, budget traveller, I would not recommend this book. I just returned from Puerto Rico and used Lonely planet and Let's go PR. Let's go was the best one of the bunch! LP was next best. If you have to choose one, Let's Go would be it. On the other hand, if $$ is not the primary concern, Explore Puerto Rico does include more complete and interesting historical review and details of the environment and makes for a good read for a day at the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very socially responsible, refreshingly honest","review":"It was a refreshingly honest look at the island and its culture. Rarely does a guide book both respect a place and give you the 'warts and all' assessment of what goes down there and how.

It's funny the silly things some of these posters complain about! We found it to be one of the better books, and we stayed in many smaller places we found in here. It also helped us find nightlife (although there is not a lot in Puerto Rico, except in San Juan) and get around. We think some of these people writing here should write the author with their suggestions so this good book can be even better. We used the author's previous edition some years ago, and this one is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Living the vida musica","review":"I am Puerto Rican and visit the island as often as I can. Besides seeing family, my favorite thing to do is catch live music. I noticed in this guide by Mr.Pariser that he says bomba is an obscure music that only lower class Puerto Ricans listen to. I like bomba, and I know that bomba, which is African-influenced, is pretty popular these days and getting more serious attention because Puerto Ricans are learning their history and are proud of their roots. A lot of jazz musicians are now using bomba in their work. Hopefully it won't require Ricky Martin to bring it to the attention of a so-called expert on the island like Mr.Pariser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Lost in Old San Juan","review":"When I was planning my trip to Old San Juan,I bought this book. It was hard to tell from Pariser's short entries for there what the accommodations were really like. He doesn't give many details, including describing the locations they're in. Unfortunately, he has really shortchanged one of the most interesting places on the whole island, the Gallery Inn, which he calls The Galleria. Pariser must not have seen for himself what an amazing place this is. Jan D'Esopo uses antiques, art, tropical plants and birds, and one of the best views to the ocean to create a space that is unique. He also doesn't describe with helpful detail how many places there are with good live local music. Pariser spends more time on the big hotels run by corporate chains on San Juan's strip. If you want to really see Old San Juan, don't be gypped. Check Lonely Planet's descriptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found an old friend","review":"I had used Craig Claibourne's wonderful salt-free cookbook for many years. Eventually it fell apart and was thrown away. I was thrilled to find a copy -as good as new and in hardcover - through Amazon. Now I can refresh my memory as to the recipes I had continued to use, having learned them from the book, and rediscover many others.This is not only a collection of wonderful salt-free recipes, it is a guide to a new way of cooking, easy to use and delicious for everyone, not just those with high blood pressure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good map that could be much easier to use","review":"I like this map, but it could be much easier to use. It doesn't have any sort of easy-to-use system, aside from a basic index, and so any goodness it contains often goes wasted.It does have a lot of features of southern New Mexico that other maps don't, and a lot of dirt roads that others don't, but it's not necessarily complete.I'd recommend the New Mexico DeLorme map over this one, but used together the two can be very helpful. (Unless you're lost in the maze of cattle roads off of County Highway 52A, off of North 14 between Madrid and Golden. In that case, both maps will fail you, you will make the mistake of using a windmill for a landmark--there are dozens--and you will drive around until you run out of gas. You'll have fun though.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on Benchmark","review":"It started for me with the purchase of Benchmark's Washington State road & recreation atlas at Costco. Now I'm the owner of New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, and California, which I bought from Amazon at approximately the same price offered by Costco, but Costco outlets only offer the state they're in or immediately surrounding. Lets face it, I'm a map junkie, a roadtrip-a-holic who is always on the lookout for the back road to anywhere. That being said, I try to stay on pavement, at least 98% of the time and am a little color (ok, a lot) blind so most maps with the color coded roads don't help much. The Benchmark maps use dashes and superior detail to make road conditions and names obvious - even for me. If you like to keep to the interstate, you have no need for these, but if you're like me and anxious to explore the outback, buy Benchmark maps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Benchmark New Mexico Road & Recreation Atlas","review":"Great contour atlas, easy to find objects of interest.

The production is good and the playing is solid. Rik Emmitt is in fine form and on the title track (My personal favorite), he is flawless. A world of fantasy is also a really strong song, and the Ronald Reagan intro to Too much thinking is just too cool. My only complaint is the record is too short,only 8 songs. I would still say this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best!!","review":"Fantastic! It mixes, in the right proportion, virtuosity, velocity, good lyrics and rock'n roll.

The inspirational lyrics remain- and turn cautionary on \\"A World Of Fantasy\\"- and the guitar work by Rik Emmett is exemplary as usual. What amazes me is that bands whose work has not stood the test of time so well, such as Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot, sold millions in their day, yet Triumph and their US counterparts, Zebra, have been unfairly neglected. It's really our loss, as Triumph have always been highly inspirational to me as a person."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER SURRENDER, because they'll release something good.","review":"This is a deception, coming after the good \\"ALLIED FORCES\\".

It was a great strategy on the part of Parker, but it stifled the career of Pendarvis. It did, however, make Pendarvis a wealthy man! Call it conjecture or call it rumor, but this was the \\"scuttlebutt\\" going around in the late 50s.Now as to this album by Tracey Pendarvis: this album is what made it onto the music market BEFORE Colonel Parker made the deal with Pendarvis...therefore it is a \\"MUST HAVE!\\" Be smart...buy this puppy while it's still available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Jagger Biography so far","review":"This is the only book by Christopher Sandford I've read, but I must say he's done a good job.

Both Matthew Broderick, and JeffreyJones steal the show, and the movie is very well directed, not unlike another of my favorite movies, the Breakfast Club. (Same Director). Anyway, give it a rent, I gaurantee you won't be disappointed. It's very funny, with likeable characters, and some very memorable scenes.

John Hughes' comedies about over privileged Chicago North Shore teenagers are a relic of the Reagan years that we need to expose for what they are and get down to the serious business of building an economy in which there is a level playing field and financial wrong doers are punished and barred from misleading innocent people.It's difficult to believe that cute little Matthew Broderick who shown in Torch Song Trilogy lend himself to this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I received this DVD in a timely manner, only it to have been the wrong item (movie).

This is a quintessential 80s movie, along with the Breakfast Club, Back to the Future, and Ghostbusters, among others. But high school hasn't changed too much, and the characters in this movie ring true no matter what decade it is. The scenes with Rooney and his secretary, the scenes with Ferris and Cameron, Ferris's monologues to the camera: this is near-timeless comedy, employing time-worn classic character types and scenarios, and a theme any one-time high school kid in America can relate to.

Where his preceding efforts like The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles were rich, moody tales set almost unanimously in small high schools, Ferris is a plucky, enthusiastic fantasy that breaks free from the confines of an institutional setting and celebrates life outside the walls. Matthew Broderick brings the brash, popular title character to life with an energy that's so infectious it's easy to overlook a few ridiculous twists and turns, and the plot takes full advantage, pushing the envelope as far as it can feasibly get away with. Great comedic timing, an astoundingly deep, versatile cast of characters and the rocketing pace of an out-of-control avalanche help make this a timeless comedy that's aged extremely gracefully. The only sticking point, really, is the totally '80s wardrobe."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!","review":"i am just happy i can watch this movie without it being censored. <3 matthew broderick. <3 this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUELLER!","review":"If you love 80's movies, or comedy you'll enjoy this!

I'm really unhappy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating movie","review":"This is a film that has bugged the heck out of me for years.Maybe I should give it another shot, but what's to like about a film that glorifies a narcissistic jerk who cuts class, disrespects everyone in his life, and pursues a crazy adventure that you know he's going to get in trouble for?Why exactly do people think this is a classic? If I want this kind of a movie, I'll turn to The Graduate, because at least that film starts out with a sense of restraint. This movie is a set of snapshots of an unsympathetic prodigal son, leaping out of the nest at breakneck speed with flagrant disregard to everything except his own inner pleasure-seeker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ferris Bueler family friendly?","review":"Though the item came in perfect condition, I don't think this title is family friendly. Sure, it's a hilarious movie but foul language is continuously uttered throughout. The movie would be just as funny and entertaining without all the swearing and would be appropriate to a larger audience.It's so frustrating when film makers/writers continuously show that they have no knowledge of the many thousands of words available for use in the English language, and limit themselves (and the viewer) to the same mundane use of the \\"famous 7\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic 80's comedy","review":"Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), his friend (Alan Ruck) and his girlfriend (Mia Sara) decide to skip school and head in town to Chicago and spend the day hanging out. Very funny, and has some classic lines like \\"Life moves so fast, sometimes you need to stop and check it out.\\" Also stars Jeffrey Jones, Charlie Sheen, and Jennifer Grey."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best John Hughes film!","review":"Better than Uncle Buck, better than Sixteen Candles, and better than the Breakfast Club. I thought this was one of the best movies of the 80's. I saw this on Comedy Central a couple of months ago and I liked it. But I think if your only in middle school I think it's that kind of movie that you want to watch over and over again and never get sick of it but once you'll hit high school you'll probably think it's gotten boring and stupid but it's still the best comedy movie ever made. I mean heck I'm in high school and I think it's a great movie and I love that feraii!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good cast in an annoying movie","review":"I like Matthew Broderick very much and the other actors here are quite good, too, but this movie is as irritating as they come. It's a \\"rich-kid fantasy cartoon\\" of a movie, firing at easy targets and reminding me of the many reasons I hated growing up in the comfortable suburbs. If your idea of compelling characters is spoiled, obnoxious brats who think the world owes them everything, help yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I'm all alone on this one","review":"High school student Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) decides to take the day off from school and uses his superior wits to treat his best friend (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend (Mia Sara) to a good time. I am astonished that this film has developed such a following over time. It is a very slight story, not particularly funny, with a sappy ending and two truly annoying performances from Broderick and Ruck. I didn't like it when I first saw it back in the 80s and it hasn't improved over time. However, 256 (as of this writing) other reviewers have apparently taken this film to their hearts, so why listen to me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bueller?....Bueller?","review":"I'm watching this movie now actually on Comedy Central, I also watched it last night! That is how great and hilarious this movie is! Never gets old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What I wished I'd done in high school.","review":"Matthew Broderick's role in this movie makes you wish that high school really could have been that much fun to get away from, (or that easy.) Of course then you have his sister who thinks that he's out to make her life miserable, but he's only trying to show how much fun life can be if you only let it. His exploits around the town keep you wondering if he'll actually get away with skipping school, and if he can ever get Camaron to relax and enjoy it. Then to make the movie even more fun you have Principle Mooney who knows what kind of a person Ferris really is and will got to almost any lengths to prove it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My All Time Favorite!","review":"It doesn't get any better than this! No matter how many times I see it, I'm still laughing! It will always be my favorite movie of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Funny Movie","review":"I love Ferris Bueler. It is one of my alltime favorite movies. Everything about it makes me rate it a five out of five.Matthew Broderick is excilent as Ferris a high school senior with a HUMONGOUS case of senioritis who wants to ditch.Alan Ruck from Spin City plays his always sick pal perfectly, but I always wonder why they picked a 32 year old married father to play a 17 year old high school boy.Mia Sara is good as Ferris' girlfriend Sloan also.All in All I would have to say this is a great movie because it is every high school kids fantasy. Hang out with your best friend and girl/boyfriend and actually get away with skipping school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny!","review":"Ferris Bueler (Matthew Broderick) decides to skip high school (again) and live the good life. He takes his best friend, the uptight Cameron (Alan Ruck) and his eager girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Patterson) on the funniest adventure in Chicago.The funny 'Save Ferris' line always pops up, and Principal Ed Rooney has set his life goal to capture Ferris in the act. His dim-witted secretary is hilarious, and Ferris's jealous sister is also one of the best. Get this movie now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bueller on Blu-ray....... Ohhhhhh Yeah!","review":"What a perfect John Hughes 80's masterpiece! Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of my top 5 all time favorites. This Blu-ray is awesome where it counts most. The picture quality is the best this 1986 film has ever looked with a crisp clean presentation. The audio is excellent and exceeded my expectations. I really enjoyed the extras featuring the amazing John Hughes and cast. Overall, Bueller gets an A+. Take a day off with this inspiring 80's masterpiece featuring unforgettable performances by an exceptional cast. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paramount screws up AGAIN","review":"Are you thinking about buying this edition? Well, don't do it. Fortunately for you the original dvd release of this is still available and it is the one you should get. Why? Simple - it has the John Hughes commentary and THIS ONE DOESN'T. Paramount, what is your problem? Can't you do ANYTHING right? I would have picked THIS up again - if it had the commentary. Don't waste your money on this edition. Paramount can't even release an excellent film like \\"Breakdown\\" without screwing it up (on that dvd, the menu is presented anamorphically but the feature IS NOT!). Believe me, if I was running things at Paramount you'd get VALUE for your money, not WASTE like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love it!!!","review":"Don't listen to the comment above from Amazon about how today's kids won't love this movie the way we did. My 10 and 12-year-old LOVE it! My ten year old boy, especially. He watches it over, and over, and over...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny!","review":"This film starts out very funny. The first hour or so is great. However, the last half hour gets kind of boring. Nevertheless, this film starts out great. Matthew Broderick plays a high school student who basically doesn't want to go to school one day. He calls his friend, who is extremely sick, and convinces him to take his dad's sports car out for a spin. Ferris, his girl friend, and his best friend spend the day going to Chicago, and hanging out there. The plot isn't that great, but for a movie this funny, you don't really need a plot. Again, the only major downfall to this movie is that the last third of it isn't as great as the rest of it. However, this movie is still outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"no matter what...","review":"this film will remain near the top of my a-list until I meet my untimely (as they always are) end. I, being the horrible young person (19) that I am, still find myself a kindred spirit to good ole' Ferris. No matter how much times seemingly change, teenagers remain essentially the same... When first I viewed this spectacular film, i was awed with how closely it resembled how i felt and acted (or at least wanted to act)... girls, parents, friendship, and, of course, the undue stress that came with high school. These things are timeless, and contrary to what some persons may believe, are just as substantial today as they were in '86 when the aforementioned film was first released. This is a film to adore, to laugh with, and to reminisce with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My Gawd","review":"Could this movie be the best teenage movie ever made...i think it can. There is nothing that can be said, for words could never do this movie justice. Thank the world for Matthew Brodrick."},{"rating":"2","title":"And the grandmother, too","review":"I always thought the middle ofthe movie lagged too, but when I watched it recently I found it rather innocent and sweet. John Hughes (Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, Breakfast Club) never eclipsed the high he established in \\"Ferris\\". Will somebody please release finally release the soundtrack?!!?!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should have a Ferris","review":"My brother is Cameron Fry and it wasn't until his first year in college that he found his Ferris Bueller. This is a classic that every high school student should see. It's a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the best. It's easy to tell from this film that Matthew Broderick was destined to be a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Blu-Ray, always fun to watch the film though","review":"2 stars for the classic itself, but a horrendous Blu-Ray.The picture quality was right up there with the worst transfer I have seen. Large volumes of grain, hair, spots on the lens, blur, etc. Every once in awhile the alternative camera provided some nice clarity (the aerial city shots and one road sequence with the red car). I panicked one time thinking a pixel had failed on my plasma, but upon inspection it was a dot on the lens. There was absolutely no effort put into the preservation here.The sound was standard, and typically the only clear mixture was the \\"Oh Yeah\\" end title sequence and one or two other music montages. There was no time spent on cleaning up the monotone 2.0 either.Extras: All the same ones (word for word) as on the special edition, nothing new.This has been 0/2 on new BDs this week...frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"Ferris Bueller is a great movie and everyone should own a copy. You get to go through a day of ditching school in Chicago and see all the wonderful things to do downtown. Everybody has at one time in their life, wished that they could ditch school and take a wild trip and never get caught. Well if you were never able to do this, then Ferris can help you.Ferris has a master plan of how to enjoy his day home sick. Being a great friend he can't forget to include his best friend and girlfriend in the day trip so they are along to join him. Throughout the day many things happen that normal people would end up getting cought. This movie is just over 90 minutes so everyone should take time and watch it.

It's a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ol' flick from the eighties","review":"This movies is probably one of my best memories from the eighties, (other than legging's. I really miss them.) Pretty much the entire cast is made up of stars you'd recognise today, -Matthew Broderick, Charlie Sheen, Alan Ruck(Spin City), Jennifer Grey(Dirty Dancing),Ben Stine(He does that boring professor on Visine commercials).Ferris Bueller is a popular high school kid who decides to play hooky and has a memorable day of it. The events that occur and the things he gets away with during this day are laugh-out-loud hilarious, and will definately make any one smile. This film is a classic that you'll want to own to play at parties or dull nights in the dorm. Even if you didn't remember the eighties or hated them, I'm sure you'll at least appreciate this product from that decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!!","review":"This movie is classic...Should not be missing in any movie collection...Makes me remind my teenagerI love this movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Ferris","review":"I loved Ferris Beuller\`s day off.Matthew Brodrick is so funny in this comedy that makes you laugh so much that you\`re bouncing off the walls.You\`ll be laughing ang crying from laughing when you see these kids learn from a troublemaker and find out what New York City is really.You\`ll laugh so hard you\`ll need a bucket.Really enjoyVictoria Knops"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ferris Bueller rocked the 80's","review":"Ferris Buelller was all an 80's kid wanted to be. He had charm, balls an luck. No one will forget the museum, twist and shout at the parade or the sports car being crashed at the end of the movie. Since the beginning, when Mathew Broderick is taking a shower and paraphrases John Lennon we know that this cynic is the real thing. He has a pretty girlfriend, he can fool his parents and can hide his frights about the upcoming future with wisecracks and style. This movie won't mean the same for a 90's or 2000's kid. It can't. But for all of us new wave and 80's teenagers will surely mean a lot. If you are in your 30s, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is not only for teenagers","review":"I disagree with the poster who said this movie was for teenagers. I am 30 years old and still crack up when I see this movie. Movies are a way to escape reality and this one makes you do that and if you are in need of a laugh, this movie will do it for you.

Ferris, I'm sad to say, is the worst that I have seen when it comes to the so-called widescreen format. If you have ever compared the full screen version to the DVD widescreen version you will see that all was done basically was to insert the black bars on the top and bottom of the picture. There are scenes where we should be seeing people's entire bodies but in the widescreen they are cut to the waistline. If you still have your VHS copy, KEEP IT! At least until the studios stop cheating us and start to actually release true widescreen formats on ALL of their DVD's and not just a select few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commentary missing??????????","review":"I just got the Bueller..Bueller edition. The great Hughes commentary is missing. I guess I'll have to rent the old dvd to hear it. But I just wanted to say that Paramount should put this one up the a for leaving out the only special feature that's interesting to film enthusiasts like me. I mean, come on!! Just give us a product that will satisfy us. They put commentary on the new Airplane and Tommy Boy dvds. Why couldn't they fit it onto this? They suck.. All you should buy the old dvd for 9.99. Thanks to all the reviewers who wrote what the commentary said. Could someone at Paramount slap someone in charge please? I'll pay you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ferris Burllers Day On","review":"Matthew Broderick's stunning portrayal in \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" brings more than just a smile to your face. It brings back memories of high school, those daring teenage years and the trials and foibles of youth. Jeffrey Jones' depiction as the bumbling school principal, was underrated, in my opinion, not that the rest of the cast didn't perform admirably. A great, lighthearted but revealing story of daring vs. the system.

Great times, although his sister does not think so!I love this classic! This movie is a great reminder for us all to take some time out and enjoy life! Great 80's comedy! Life moves pretty fast, if you dont stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Movie","review":"Classic movie, well written and a fun distraction for most anyone young at heart (and a need or wish to skip school just once)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still entertaining today","review":"Ferris Bueller, the most popular guy in high school decides he wants to take a day off school and hang out with his friends. It is a comedy and bends the rules of realism to produce a lot of slapstick comic moments. The dialogue is sharp; the look is SO 80's (look back and weep at the shoulder pads). It is a real trip down memory lane for me. The film is all about grabbing life when you can. There is a serious counterpoint made in the movie when Ferris's friend Cameron decides to stand up to his parents, I'm not sure why this is in the movie. But all in all a pleasant hour and a half spent, remembering the joys of a misspent youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of garbage!","review":"I just can see no way that the acting could be any worse.

So this may account for my bias, but I believe that his photos of modern-day China are among the best taken during the post-Tiananmen era. During my decade as a correspondent in China, I always wanted to work with Mark because I thought his gritty, in-your-face pictures captured a side of China that often was overlooked. Instead of showing us the by-now stock shots of high-rises and neon lights, he took viewers to the street level, his 28mm lens always getting reeeeaallly close up into people's faces. I loved it and this book brings back in superb detail the China that I knew in the late 20th and early 21st century. I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in China--it's a beautiful, affordable addition to anyone's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"i think a one star rating is being generous. i bought this used and wished i hadn't wasted my money. the cover of moondance is worth keeping only because of kenny rankin's vocal, the champlin song is ok but certainly not as good as another reviewer suggested and the remaining songs are mediocre smooth jazz (and that's being kind). i really don't understand why a cd this poor gets released while a really fine recording like nightrider is only available as a used lp. if you haven't heard nightrider you should consider buying it on vinyl if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very \\"complete\\"","review":"I was expecting a soup to nuts video of detailed motorcycle tank painting.

By far the majority of people who enjoy 20's jazz are not likely to be fans of todays R&B/ Hip Hop genres, besides they are totally out of place on this cd.

Hearing the actors singing, hearing that some of them can sing better than a lot of singers nowdays. The music business is finally refreshed with something new. THe music business which has too many not-worth-to-mention pieces! And all of the songs of the soundtrack is brilliant, starting with Anastacia's Love Is A Crime or just thinking of Macy Gray's amazing voice.

While both have very pleasant voices, they lack the \\"umph\\" which the London Revival Recording so well portrays. ALL THAT JAZZ, sounds faded, weak, and missing something. FUNNY HONEY is a nice attempt, and I do give Renee credit, but I still feel that Henshall was best. Overall, get the London CD, you will be much better off for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad ending of a cd that started out great","review":"i was very disappointed in the cd. it started out great but there was no reason to put in all the hip hop music at the end.the ending of the cd was bad. i would not recommend this cd to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as Moulin Rouge","review":"now, this was a story written a long time ago. but it still falls flat. the songs are unemotional and stupid. the beats are too modern, now sounding like something that was trying to be a hip CD. the music was supposed to sound old and untouched. the lyrics can be funny, but are not top noch. if you need to listen to a good musical, listen to Moulin Rouge. Moulin Rouge was much better than Chicago. Chicago, in my opinion, was just trying too hard..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost better than the movie!","review":"I enjoyed the movie, but the music absolutely blew me away!I greatly appreciated the fact that the actors & actresses did their own singing (& dancing) ... it's nice to see evidence of their true talent occasionally. Listening to the soundtrack makes me want to watch the movie again, just to see the parts where they're doing the 'scenes' from the soundtrack (which is most of the movie, *?*).The only reason I felt this didn't deserve a '5 star' rating is simply that Queen Latifah's rendition of \\"He Had It Comin'\\" (Track 17) was so far removed from the movie, in my opinion it just absolutely doesn't belong on this soundtrack. (Her other contributions to this movie, musically & otherwise, were fantastic I thought!) Track 18 is only slightly better, but at least it's a little jazzy, not the hip-hop rap stuff that so definitely is NOT what this movie & music were all about.If you at all enjoyed the movie, I think it's safe to say you'll really enjoy the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Soundtracks","review":"I dare anyone not to tap there foot while listening to this CD. The only track to moderatley lose it's luster in the transistion is \\"They Both Reached for the Gun\\" and that's due to the show stopper of a number in the film. The CD does what it's supposed to: captures the feel of the movie and makes you want to see it again. The last two \\"Bonus\\" track are good, but they make a hard turn in a different genre so be prepared. That aside, definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just blew me away!","review":"My husband and I saw this movie for Valentine's Day, and were both just astounded. Everything about this movie was excellent, but the music has to be the best thing about it. The songs are all sung by the actors and actresses themselves, and most people will be amazed at the vocal talents of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rene Zellweiger, Richard Gere, and of course Queen Latifa. The songs are strong, emotional, power-packed, and just plain catchy to boot. No one who hears this soundtrack will walk away without goosebumps, and humming a tune!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! However...","review":"This is a great soundtrack to a great movie! However, the Queen Latifah, Lil' Kim, and Macy Gray remake of \\"The cell block tango\\" is really horrible.

Catherine Zeta-Jones does an excellent job on \\"And All That Jazz\\" especially."},{"rating":"2","title":"urgent, vibrant recording","review":"After seeing Chicago (the movie), I picked up the revival cast recording, and I was surprised to hear how lackluster it sounded in comparison.The motion picture soundtrack is far superior to the revival cast; everything sounds dynamic and intense, and I believe that the characters are really interested in their fates. The music is good, and the source material (the musical itself) is great.I could live without the bonus hip-hop stuff; hip-hop is fine, but these tracks are pretty lousy. Still, the point of this CD is the musical, not the miscellany. It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"We finally go back to the true feeling of Hollywood","review":"I must agree with everything tha has been said, not only is Chicago by far one of the best films of the past years, it has also an excellent soundtrack.The music,each song, the melodies, it all helps to feel the movie justas it is. Spectacular voices that bring all the feelings into the screen and with this cd into our homes.Unfortunatly i haven't had the chance to see the play, but the motion picture was enough to make me a fan of this spectacular show and an adict to the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHICAGO soundtrack brilliant and fun","review":"This soundtrack is incredible. From the first song on the CD your toes are tapping and your head is into the plot. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zelweger are fantastic and so full of life and command so much attention. You feel the songs all the way deep into your soul. This soundtrack blows the actual play out of the water. Moving, exuberant and sexy! Loved it, listen to it every day. If you like musicals and jazz, this soundtrack is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They Got It Right!!","review":"Rob Marshall and company got it exactly right in transferring Chicago to the screen. Though I was not a Renee Zellweiger fan, she changed my opinion with her total tartiness here (and she was terrific in Cold Mountain), she dances competently, and sings the role wonderfully. Katherine Zeta Jones was perfect as Velma Kelly. The rest of the cast are marvelous too....Queen Latifah coudn't have been better cast. Though I have never been conviced of Richard Gere's acting ability, he pulls off the role of Billy Flynn admirably, even his singing and dancing work effectively. They brilliantly wrote a screenplay to encompass most of the stage show, where songs were cut, they needed to be. A well deserved Oscar winner for effectively bringing a musical back to the screen!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catherine Zeta-Jones steals the show","review":"I personally think Catherine Zeta-Jones steals the show in this sound track. She really puts on a great perform through song. I think she does a great job in the movie (sorry, but I had to reference it) and it definitely is heard through the songs on the CD as well. You can hear her character during each performance she sings. Quenn Latifah also brings out her best. I wish she was involved in more songs however. For me, Richard Gere is so so in his performance. But overall, I really enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHICAGO DAZZLES","review":"This a a must have cd.It will razzle dazzle you.YOU saw the movienow buy the cd.I also would buy the cd BROADWAY MY WAY by LINDA EDER.Shes a great Broadway star.Her cds are great.Make sure tosee LINDA EDER in concert.Also buy the CHICAGO cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Imitation of the Broadway Soundtracks","review":"This is enjoyable, but not nearly as good as the Broadway versions. 1996's cast album with Bebe Neuwirth and Ann Reinking is fabulous (James Naughton is an excellent Billy Flynn). The Gwen Verdon/Chita Rivera/Jerry Orbach album is also wonderful. The movie soundtrack does not come close to rivaling either one -- the actors were cast primarily as actors, not singers! Richard Gere comes off as especially weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHICAGO is musically true to Original B'way","review":"The soundtrack recording of Kander & Ebb's \\"Chicago\\" is a surprise and a delight. As a Broadway purist, I really had doubts about a filmed version of any Broadway musical, let alone one as quasi-traditional as \\"Chicago\\". Rest assured, it is fairly true to the original (and 1996 revival). The vocalists are fine (not belters, but good anyway); orchestrations good (a little slim, but authentic to the period); and material relatively unscathed (although trimmed). But what is with the 'material inspired by Chicago' on the end of the album? Is it really necessary to accommodate and mislead a non-musical audience into believing these artists are part of the film? 4 stars for underutilized CD booklet (jacket). With the possible return of movie musicals to theatre screens, wouldn't it have been interesting to know just how & why \\"Chicago\\" came to the big screen??"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Good, It's Grand, It's Great","review":"The first thing I said when this movie ended was that I had to go buy the soundtrack. Then I had to wait 4 whole days for the soundtrack to be released! I was not happy, but I am now! The movie was fabulous and the soundtrack recalls all the music that made it great. I am amazed at what great voices Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere have. Who knew any of them could sing this well??? Queen Latifah's \\"When You're Good To Mama\\" is a highlight of both the movie and the soundtrack. But it's difficult to single out just one or a few songs to listen to because they all deserve equal playing time.My advice? Run, don't walk to your nearest theatre to see this movie, then run, don't walk to your nearest music store and buy this CD! Trust me, you'll thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally All That Jazz!","review":"If you saw the film, you'd definitely appreciate this CD! The music is excellent, and really makes you feel great. And don't forget the Enhanced CD portion. The music and extras make this a CD way more worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife likes it","review":"She enjoyed the film, the original broadway production, and we've seen the play twice, so it was a no-brainer decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love \\"Chicago?\\" Get the music","review":"Great movie, great songs, and great actors who double as excellent singers as well. Everyone who is in this movie deserves special recognition for their singing (as well as dancing) abilities. After many listens, I still can't choose a favorite song, my choices lie in between \\"Overture/And All That Jazz\\" sung by Catherine Zeta-Jones, and \\"Nowadays\\" sung by Renee Zellweger. It was a nice surprise to hear John C. Reilly sing \\"Mister Cellophane.\\" There is a song on here that was from a scene taken out of the movie called \\"Class.\\" There is a second version of \\"Cell Block Tango,\\" except it is done in the form of a hip-hop song by Queen Latifah, Lil' Kim and Macy Gray. Surprisingly the song fits in well enough on this album. You can also use the CD in your computer disk drive to watch behind the scenes footage, and interviews. The only thing I was not crazy about was the Anastacia song, \\"Love Is A Crime.\\" If you love this movie as much, as I do, get this soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All that jazz!","review":"Wow! There's never been a soundtrack that I've enjoyed as much as Chicago--the only two tracks I skip are the two awful, out-of-place songs at the end. What were the producers thinking sticking those on? I would have taken a half star off the rating for those, but amazon does not offer that option.Upbeat, comical, and full of pure talent, the Chicago soundtrack will make you laugh, think, sing-along, and get up and dance. If you're in the car, you'll be bouncing around in your seat, singing and pounding on the steering wheel. The all-star cast presents the songs in an amazing way, so that you can envision the movie while listening. It's a great listen!Well-worth the money.BEST TRACKS: \\"All That Jazz,\\" \\"When You're Good to Mama,\\" \\"Roxie\\"WORST TRACKS: \\"Cell Block Tango (He Had It Coming) #17,\\" \\"Love is a Crime\\" by Anastacia"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!! All That Jazz and More!","review":"Nothing else can be said except that this is amazing. I agree with other reviewers that the last two tracks are not necessary to the soundtrack, but the other songs, even if not obviously in the film or not in the film at all, are stupendous. The movie was an entertainment smorgasbord for kings, and this soundtrack allows for lovely memories of a wonderful meal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A clarification","review":"Yes, it's wonderful. Etc, etc, etc. They all have great voices.But I think the Lil' Kim/Queen Latifah/Macy Gray version of Cell Block Tango is great. Although yes, the amazon.com reviewer is correct, \\"Love is a Crime\\" is blah. In fact, it's horrible. They should've left that off and put \\"I Move On\\" last, in my humble opinion.Still, go buy it! It's got some great bonus material on the website you can unlock when you buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent recording","review":"I really enjoyed this album, though I think I do like the 1996 cast a tad better but the actors have decent voices and I have to give them credit for doing their own singing. My favorite track is \\"Cell Block Tango\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!","review":"This is one of the best movies we have seen in a very long time!! It's no wonder it's been nominated 13 times. Photography is exceeded only by choreography...would recommend to anyone who likes music! Rene Zellwieger shines as Roxie and Richard Ghere brings out a side never seen before."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHICAGO IS THE BEST!!!","review":"SOUNDS AMAZING! AND SO EASY TO PUT INTO ANY OTHER DEVICE! WAY MORE CONVENIENT AND CHEAPER THAN ANY OTHER WAY :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Chicago.","review":"To be honest, I've never really like the show CHICAGO very much. I find the show too negative, pessimistic, and depressing. Despite this, I will admit that the show boasts some memorable and impressive music numbers and from time to time I find myself humming or singing a tune from the show. The film version of CHICAGO did a wonderful job at bringing the show to the big screen and this album captures much of the musical showmanship on cd. If you like the movie, you will probably enjoy this soundtrack. If you prefer the stage show, you might or might not like this album (I know how particular musical fans can be). Personally, I like some of the songs and there are others that I don't. Out of all the music on the album, track #9, \\"Mister Cellophane\\" is my favorite. It has an everyday, average-Joe quality about it that is lacking in most of the other tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fun To Listen To","review":"The soundtrack to the Oscar winning \\"Chicago\\" is one of those you can listen to all the way through and feel satisfyed when the last track finishes. Track eleven, \\"Class\\", is a hidden gem that should have made it into the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah belt out a haunting ballad of dispare and unsatisfaction. Although the track is littered with swears, it's great nonetheless. Every track is a stand-out with the exception of the final two. These songs were not in the movie, but were instead \\"inspired\\" by the movie. They were sung by main-stream artists, along with Queen Latifah. These seem like an attempt to make the soundtrack appeal to more people, but they just end up cheapening the other tracks in the process. My personal favorite is \\"Cell Block Tango\\". Overall, a very good soundtrack, with the exception of the final two tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"STUPENDOUS","review":"Now that the CD is out the jury is in! Here is a disc of pure magic that successfully documents just how cool the cast is in the musical vein. Renee Zellweger is in fine voice and has just the right sound for Roxie the chanteuse. Catherine Zeta-Jones knows how to belt out songs like \\"All That Jazz\\" and really sell them. Richard Gere is a major surprise - his 'Razzle Dazzle' sparkles as much in pure vocal form as it did in the wonderfully cinematic form. Queen Latifah is well known for her Rap gifts, but here she sings like a Mae West or Sophie Tucker, completely immersed in her character. John O'Reilly has one of the best bands on the CD with his tender 'Mister Cellophane' number that evokes all the beauty of the old vaudeville theater tunes. The CD is well engineered and a welcome addition to all music lovers' libraries. Signed by: http://www.making-strides.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling!","review":"An incredible soundtrack to an incredible movie. Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta Jones, and Richard Gere give pitch perfect performances, and who would have thought. Catherine shines on the opening All That Jazz, its sexy and exciting. Renee Zellwegger impresses on the sultry Funny Honey, with her soft, angelic voice. Richard Gere is suave and cool on Razzle Dazzle. There are so many other highlights. Queen Latifah knocks em dead on the brassy When You're Good to Mama, proving that some Rappers can sing as well, and the Cell Block Tangois fun and hilarious. The new songs added to the soundtrack don't really fit in with the entire soundtrack, but Anastacias powerful, sultry pipes on Love is A Crime is alot of fun. The rap version of the Cell Block Tango by Queen Latifah, Lil Kim, and Macy Gray is a bad attempt at trying to create another Lady Marmalade, however, its a small problem in a otherwise perfect album. The must have soundtrack of the year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful musical experience","review":"Much to my surprise, I had to get this CD right after seeing the movie and have played it every day since I've purchased it. Who would have guessed that Catherine Zeta Jones, Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly and Renee Zellweger could excel in this genre?From the first strains of Catherine Zeta Jones and All That Jazz to the last \\"legit\\" soundtrack vocal of Hot Honey Rag, this CD is a winner. Other standouts include Queen Latifah's When You're Good to Mama, John C. Reilly's Mr. Cellophane, Cell Block Tango and Renee Zellweger's renditions of Funny Honey, Roxie and Nowadays.The extra songs, Love Is A Crime and the hip hop version of Cell Block Tango, aren't bad but they simply don't belong on this CD. It's a blatant pandering to a younger generation that will enjoy the soundtrack songs on their own.This soundtrack could have easily turned into a very bad joke. A wild round of applause to the producers, director and actors who made it happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Can't I Give This 6 Stars???","review":"My only complaint is that the prologue to \\"Roxie\\" that Renee Zellweger does in the movie is not included on the soundtrack. I thought it was very effective and moving (and funny) and would have LOVED to have seen it included on the album. Oh well, can't have everything I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Soundtrack","review":"I will say that i really don't care too much for musicals but this has to be the one musical that i can really like the music. Catherine Zeta Jones voice is excellent and really deserve that Oscar!!! Queen Latifah should have more songs, but the songs she does have she gives her all on them and surprises you and her vocal abilities. Renee also shocked me with her wonderful voice!!! Well please go get this you will not be sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Overall, I have to agree with most of the reviews already posted. The music is incredible. On the downside, The bonus material is weak. Queen Latifah should have just not done her song featuring Lil'Kim and Macy Gray, and Anastacia's \\"Love is a Crime\\" is as about as exciting as watching mud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible score to a rather dull movie","review":"I love the songs from Chicago. In my opinion, these are the best you can find. the Original recording was British, and in my opinion, sounded odd in some places, like the Cell Block Tango (but still good!)Catherine and Renee' have great voices, and make a great team. Who knew they could sing! I was blown away. The best song on this album is deffinately Cell block tango, but All that Jazz is amazing, aswell.As I said, I thought the movie was rather dull. It was very... classy. Classy in that old aged show-biz kind of way. Everyone was on stage, everyone looked glamorous, and everyone's voice was great.And still, the movie didn't appeal to me. It seemed like everything happened too fast. She shot her lover, ended up in jail, and all that Jazz. Something just didn't seem to fit into place.But the music makes up for it, nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago Soundtrack (2003)","review":"This soundtrack is awesome! A wonderful mix of Renee & Queen...they are a great duou!! I give it 5 stars because the music and how it is arranged is just awesome!! One of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CHICAGO ROCKS!","review":"I saw Chicago for the first time the day it hit theaters. I instantly fell in love with the performers and the music. Immediately after the soundtrack [was released] I ordered it. The best songs are definetely the overture/all that jazz where Zeta-Jones shines vocally. Number three: When you're good to mama is an excellent showing of Queen Latifah. Cell Block Tango has such power and sex appeal in the vocals and the music. Mister Cellophane is a great song in which John C. Reily does an amazing job. His voice is beautiful.All in all, this soundtrack is amazing! The last two additional songs aren't as good. But I reccommend buying this album for a great music listening time! Or should I say a rockin' music listening experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Band","review":"Wih wild hip hop voculs of jazz it's no wonder it's now became a film.Never hearing the music befor I was swayed into the lyrics and also amused at the same time.With sexy and swavy taste of talent and sounds.Loud voices and music have a blast with this soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A KNOCKOUT!","review":"This is truly an outstanding version of the classic Kander/Ebb score. Catherine Zeta-Jones' rendition of \\"All That Jazz\\" is second best only to the amazing Chita Rivera [the original Velma]. Renee Zellweger does an excellent job with \\"Roxie\\", I can't bear listening to Ann Reinking's rendition from the 1996 revival. Richard Gere shines most with \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" and Queen Latifah socks it to you with \\"When You're Good To Mama\\". I could have lived without the hip-hop version of \\"Cell Block Tango\\" and Anastacia's \\"Love is A Crime\\", which was \\"inspired\\" by the film.Luckily these two tracks are at the very end so my CD's laser lens will never go there. This CD will find a permanent place in my CD shelf alongside the legendary Original Broadway Cast Recording. If you loved this movie BUY IT you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"The cd is very good. There are only songs, no speaking parts really, even ones that precede certain songs. There are a couple of songs that are not in the movie or that were inspired by the movie. The first time you listen to it if you haven't read the fine print it kind of throws you for a loop. I highly recommend it for all who love the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the years best...and all that jazz","review":"I love this recording of \\"Chicago\\". The movie is wonderful; one of the best musicals made into a movie-musical I have ever seen. Catherine Zeta-Jones was OUTSTANDING in the role of Velma Kelly. She has such amazing vocals, and in the film, her dancing is remarkable. Renee Zellwegeer is perfectly cast as Roxie Hart. She added such life to Roxie, and the sultry vocals and the smooth tones of her voice are just wonderful. Richard Geere wasn't that bad as Billy Flynn! He can really sing! I loved his rendition of \\"They Both Reached for the Gun\\". It was just a wonderful record and just an outstanding movie-musical,and all that jazz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent soundtrack","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed the movie and bought the soundtrack the very next day.My personal favorite song of the movie would have to be Mr Cellophane. John C Reilly's version is haunting and lovely, the man can sing. All of the stars are excellent in their roles, Queen Latifah has a fabulous voice and does an amazing job. While this album does have some extra songs that aren't in the film, at least most all of the actual film versions are on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good...","review":"So bad quality. First it recorded EP not SP. I regret buying this one. I should have chosen another JFK bio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bosh Hubris","review":"I must have come into this film with unjust pre-conceptions of it being a B-grade 1970s horror-film-laugh-a-lympics in the same vein as Wolfen or Zombie, because I came away rather disgusted and feeling cheated. What little plot this movie had was lost in its club-footed slowness and aloofness. You never really get to know anything and by the time you do you already have a great animosity for the characters and wish the greatest amount of harm to be inflicted upon them. The banal and \\"who-cares\\" combination of storyline and characters is the most unsympathetic feeling I've ever experienced watching a film. It wasn't even ennui or uneasiness, it was pure waking sleeplessness. A thudding into walls in the dark. Something you'd like to fall asleep to after a root canal because it lacks both the capacity to hold or be remembered by as anything but second-rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digo My Brain, Boring","review":"This film wants to be too many things at once, preposterous art house flick, horror film, and porn film but in the end, it turns out to be stupid and quite boring. The premise is that a child, with disturbing qualities, namely a shyness that is so terrifying, and an excessive imagination. There is absolutely nothing in this film that qualifies it as a horror flick so I suggest people ignorning it. A big waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wendigonnastop!","review":"This movie was okay. the acting was good, and the characters where likable. Problem is, it wasn't scary at all. The director used alot of shaky cameras and weird movements, but in this genre it is exceptable, but other times it looked as though he no clue what he was doing. I literally yelled out \\"STOP WITH THE ZOOMING!\\" There is nothing else that can reveal a \\"amateur\\" than zooming. Zooming is the worst thing you could do as a begginer. It's fine for a special effect shot, but this guy looked like he had no clue what he was doing. Skip this and see something better. Not as bad a Scream mind you, but still one worth avoiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"WENDIGO - SO MUCH PROMISE WASTED....","review":"If you want to waste your time on a movie then here you go! Being a film critic amongst peers and a indie film creator, I was simply blown away by the dry and plodding direction of Wendigo. Look up the term Wendigo, it is a Native American legend. There are so many heart-pounding possibilities that could have spawned from the palette of the Wendigo legend, and yet this pathetic movie does not even bother to dabble it's brush in it. Both my wife and I had a difficult time trying to understand why this contemptible movie was made. Simply put, a WASTE and FAILURE! It easily placed itself within my MP10 (Most Pathetic 10) list."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!","review":"WOW, what a piece of garbage! This is by far the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of being exposed to. I would not wish this movie on my wost enemy. The picture quality is terrible, the story less than great and the acting! all man is the acting the wost I have ever seen. Who ever made this movie should be fined and barred from ever making another film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a wretched, wretched movie","review":"I watched \\"The Others\\" immediately before I watched \\"Wendigo,\\" and I was struck by the differences. Both films rely upon atmosphere, not gore, to provide their chills, and The Others proves that a good scary movie doesn't have to look as though it was shot in an abattoir to make the viewer squirm. HOWEVER, a good scary movie does have to scare you, or alarm you, or at least leave you feeling vaguely unsettled. There is not a solid \\"gasp\\" moment anywhere to be found in Wendigo. The movie is pretentious, pointless, and worst of all...DULL. The only thing I felt at the end of the movie was pity for Patricia Clarkson, whom I like as an actress. Please do not waste your money on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Budget Bomb","review":"Low budget, boring, bad script, bad acting . . . not much more to say. As far as comparisons with \\"The Shining\\" and \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" go - yes it's obvious that they ripped off a few effects from both movies, but it's still a bad movie. Save your money or buy \\"The Shining\\" or \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" instead. If your still unsure, rent it first. You'll be glad you didn't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wendigo","review":"This movie is low budget, but it is very much like the Blair Witch. The acting is really good and the story leves the viewer wondering what just happened.. Although this Wendigo is not like the one you would see in the comics such as X-Men. In this movie the Wendigo is more of a myth than anything else sorta like Bigfoot. This movies has certain elements that are like the movie Sasquatch. This movie is worth the watch even though it's not scary at all, but it depends on the person who's watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's nothing here","review":"I watched this movie today. For more than an hour, nothing happens. We get to see this city family muddle about in a country cabin, get into a spat with a backwoods redneck, go sled riding and shop at a thrift store. This goes on for more than an hour. And still, NOTHING HAPPENS. When things FINALLY get interesting, we are treated to an amateurish looking monster and a inane ending. This movie is pure boredom and a total waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"If you are at all familiar with the \\"Wendigo\\", don't expect this movie to reflect it. The only thing they got right was that it is an Indian legend. This movie is all about sex in front of a red-neck deer hunter, constant profanity in front of a little boy and a guy with deer antlers racing through the forest. What a mix. It is neither frightening nor entertaining. Additionally, the audio is so poor in certain parts that it's hard to hear. Actually this is probably more of a blessing than a detriment as it makes it easier to nod off. In summation the only thing scary about this movie is how bad it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is one too many...","review":"This is a lousy movie. Don't waste your money or time. Like many horror movies, this one starts out interestingly enough, but quickly spirals down a slippery slope to the garbage heap. It coulda been something, it coulda been a contenda, but it only really stinks. Not scary, kinda silly, especially the Wendigo itself, which is so fake, with special effects that had to have been created by third graders. The back of the DVD is incredibly misleading; I think they where writing about a different movie. Not worth renting, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious","review":"I am a fan of independant films, and have often found joy in little heard of low budget movies, but his film is positively horrible. Chock full of needless character over-development, a purely gratuitous sex scene and a useless \\"Matrix\\"-like pan and scan, this was two hours of my life I would like back. To make this worse, the director's commentary, which is usually enjoyable on any film, was nothing more than the director stating it was my fault as a brainwashed audience member if I didn't enjoy the movie as I obviously was lacking in imagination and an open mind. No horror or suspense combined with poorly used ideas make this movie a must miss feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, an intelligent horror movie","review":"This is a very smart film that actually has a message about human nature and the horrors of real life. If you're looking for CGI monsters, vapid teenagers and dialogue that hits you over the head like a hammer, look elswhere. If you are a fan of the smarter, more subtle horror films of the late 1960's and 70's, snatch this one up immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"horror\\" movie forgot the main ingredient in horror...","review":"...namely, HORROR! I can't recall even one scary moment in the whole movie, but I can recall being very bored for the entire duration. My friends and I watched the movie all the way to the end, as we hoped that SOMETHING, ANYTHING would happen, but it didn't.The Wendigo \\"monster\\" was funny as hell though! I would recommend seeing the movie if the deerlike Wendigo creature was around more than 6 seconds, as that thing was hilarious, but they just didn't show that comic gem long enough.Avoid this movie at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No-budget horror done wrong","review":"After watching this on DVD and on HBO this independent horror movie has to be the absolute worst horror movie since\\"Blair Witch Project,Cabin Fever,House of the Dead,Wrong Turn,and Halloween 3. Wendigo is a no-budget movie that has no special effects or blood or a monster or villian but a curse and a forklore about a deer. A boy and his family visit a house and then start to meet three weird people that hunted a deer and then the boy has hallucinations and then a man gives him a little souvenir of a deer on a totem pole and then that causes his dad and a few others to die. Not one scene is scary or suspensful but the movie is weird and boring. the ending is by far the worst ending in a horror movie history. Please avoid this movie at all costs and if it is free at a video store don't rent it because it is a rip-off. If you want a good no-budget horror movie rent Basket Case or Evil Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"It had no plot and no point.

Windigo is actually mentioned 3 times in the whole movie and is actually a bad representation of the legend. Now don't you people get mad at me for stating my own oppinion, I belive that everyone is entitled to their own oppinion, and my oppinion is that this movie sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good movie","review":"The ONLY thing that was good in this film was the 'atmosphere.'

From the man in the rubber monster suit to the obligitory sex scene with a half-second flash of breast to the grainy film quality. The only reason why I give this two stars instead of one is that the acting was not as bad as some and the twist at the end was moderately original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thrilling At First, But. . . . .","review":"I expected this film to be at least a LITTLE scary, but it was not. As the movie progressed, I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. Nothing ever did. The beginning was great, but the follow through was mellow. If you are looking for a film to entertain you, skip this one. On the other hand, it is a decent piece of film noir with many hidden signs and symbols where then you may be able to stand the humdrum plot. You could apply the film techniques and turn it into more of an artsy kind of film if you wanted to. But it would still take some time and analyzing. Its acceptable presentation of film noir saved it from me rating it only one star.If you are looking for any kind of thriller or horror film, you need to look elsewhere. One of the only movies I have ever bought where I thought it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"looked like a college film project","review":"The Wendigo is an odd film. It has a few good things going for it. The child actor playing Miles is excellent and Patricia Clarkson as the high strung mom is the best of the adult actors. Her character starts out as the kind of city person you love to hate but she later shows great strength and devotion to her family.Now for what's wrong. Wendigo looks like a a college film projects. It's poorly edited, looks like it was shot on cheap film and and the special effects are pathetic. On top of all this there is entirely too much talking. Conversations go on forever. I mean it. The whole movie comes to a stand still while one character does a monolouge. By the time the six armed deer man shows up I didn't care anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's that smell?","review":"Is it turkey? This is one with all the trimmings. Bad dialog,bad acting, really bad improvization, no plot. Lots of real kewl camera and editing work.

I even contacted people from the website to find out when it was coming out on DVD (I had missed it in the theater). I love horror movies, however this movie totally stinks. I read some of the other reviews here and I don't understand how there is anything positive to say. The acting .... Special effects were bad. Cinematography was lame.

Wendigo is an extremely enjoyable film for the small budget it was made from and it builds tension superbly. All the actors are very good especially the very convincing erik per sullivan as spooked miles. But despite being a very good film the wendigo itself is laughable and the ending is a bit of a kop out,like there's a scene missing. I still enjoyed wendigo despite the ending and i recommend you check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!","review":"This movie is THE worst movie I have ever seen!!! There is this absolutely stupid, fake, moose that is supposed to be the wendigo (I am not sure which version I saw, so if this is the wrong one, I apologise). At first, I was thinking, this is gonna be good. Then, I was thinking, I can't wait to see the wendigo. After, I was thinking, OH MY GOD!!!! The worst part is when you see the wendigo running through the woods. It moves like Barney with these effects that make it even worse. I couldn't believe what a let down it was. So no matter what you see on the back cover, ALWAYS either come to this site and read at least three reviews, or call your friends and ask if they've seen it. Because there are more movies out there just like this one and I hope you don't accidentally watch one. CAUSE THIS ONE REALLY SUCKED!! Thank you for your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the rest of it?","review":"This movie ends suddenly, seemingly without warning. The plot staggers along without really getting started and finishes with nothing having been revealed or resolved. The movie has moments that seem reminiscent of Stephen King's work, but there is no storyline to draw events together. The \\"Wendigo\\" monster, once finally revealed looks like Bullwinkle on steroids and is more comical than frightening. Overall, this movie should never have been released. It should have been finished and then re-edited into something at least semi-worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading marketing.","review":"I don't know what the people who liked this movie are drinking cause the last time I looked up the word \\"horror\\" in the dictionary it didn't say anything about people standing out in the snow for 85 minutes talking until finally a cod-piece wearing devil deer comes running by at 60 mph (on his hind legs) clucking like a woodchuck.If the whole movie had been like that 5 minute deer part this would have been the funniest movie going but instead it was so boring I wanted to smash my face into the coffee table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Very Afraid...","review":"Yes, be afraid of the Wendigo. This movie really scared me. It scared me that someone thought that this worthless script needed to be made into an actual movie. It scared me that any self-respecting actor would waste their time and effort on this movie. The corny sound track and hokey special effects did coax some chuckles out of me but no screams. This movie was so bad I feel a little guilty for actually wasting my time to write this review. If nothing else remember this, if you see the Wendigo, be afraid, be bery afraid and get yourself as far away as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"PRETTY & GREAT CHANGING TABLE!!!","review":"We just put this one up in our little baby girls room and it looks great and very sturdy. A lot more stable than many changing tables out there and for a great price as well!The baskets are cute but we didn't use them, since I wanted to use some other baskets. We used the baskets for other storage though. Easy to assemble and did have a paint smell to it when we first put it up, disapeared after 1 day or so. RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but disappointed..........","review":"The product looks sleek and I especially like the wicker baskets it comes with. However, the changing table/wicker basket has an odor to it - especially the baskets. We have tried to air out the baskets in hope the odor will go away, however they still have an odor. At this point I read somewhere that one should leave vinegar in a bowl in the room and it should absorb the odor, so at this point this is what my husband and I are trying. If the odor does not go away, then no matter how nice it goes with our other furniture we will have to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Design from start to finish.","review":"This is my favorite art book.

The process is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk!","review":"I am very upset I even got this thing. I could have bought a better one at Wal-Mart.

The whole sight is made of lightweight plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"scope","review":"terrible mounting system cheap scope all it is is plastic and you cant sight it in pretty much a fail i just have it for looks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Well-Balanced and Well-Researched","review":"I really enjoyed this book because I felt it struck a good balance between the actual crimes (written as though we are riding along with the killer in gripping detail), the personal life and background of the Killer (so many books seem to leave out that serial killers are somebody's brother, son etc.), and the difficult and incredibly complex trial that follows (this was one of the longest and most intricate trials in all of CA history). I couldn't put it down. I am impressed with the amount of work that went into writing this book and it certainly seems to have paid off. Just like \\"The Only Living Witness\\" is one of the best books written on Bundy, I feel this is its equal in terms of Ramirez. Excellent, won't dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me remain objective","review":"The book has it's dry spots. One example being is the 2 or 3 chapter written on Richards parents, however I seen it as necessary in order to understand the psychological development of Ritchie. All in all Philip Carlo impressed me with his halfway objectiveness. After all, who isn't a little biased? Carlo isn't your typical Diane Fanning or Anne Rule. He lets you see that Richard was a child once, that he was a victim just like every one else. Honestly, the writers empathy made me tear up at times. I highly recommend this book to any one who wants to know more about Ramirez."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"This is a strong book that always keeps yo guessing and on the edge of your seat.

I felt bad for the killer some times and other times i am like well he deserves everything the most touching part is about his childhood i felt really bad for him i think your opion of him will change when you read about his childhood. i feel really bad for him cause none of the good looking women are his admires haha. read the book it is really really great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything (and then some!) you need to know about the Night","review":"This book takes you through, in great detail, every crime Richard Ramirez committed, the investigation,search, and capture of the Nightstalker. His rampage that left more than a dozen people dead and HURT. From there, it details his trial and his experiences in prison/death row. Mr. Carlo leaves no stone unturned in this book. This book is REAL hard to put down.If you are looking for information on this case, get this one FIRST!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps the reader interested all the way through!","review":"This book is one of the few True Crime books I've read that talked more about the crime, and less about the trial. I enjoyed the way it described the movements Richard Ramirez took with every murder & his childhood. I am not interested on every detail of the trail or how the trees swayed in the breeze. I like more information on how the crime was acted out. For instance, when it talks about events Richard did before and after each break-in. Also it goes in great detail about his childhood so the reader has some idea of where he was coming from with each kill. If you are someone who likes more crime & less trial than this is an excellent book to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who let this guy get into print?","review":"If you just want a recitation of crimes and facts, then this book will probably satisfy you. But if you want analysis and insight, you're out of luck here. If you expect continuity, good grammar, and proper spelling -- in other words, basic good writing -- you'll be even more disappointed. Shame on the editor who let this mess get into print."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Night Stalker","review":"I had become very interrested in Richard as I grew up in California and lived there durring the time these crimes happened and was all scared all over California so I had to know why. I also felt compelled to know him, to know why, and to understand why. After reading this book, though I felt the author had him already guilty from the beginning of the book. He tells about all the horrible crimes as he says Richard explains them to him, then goe's into the family history, they the capture and court preceedings. I thought in the US one was innocent until proven guilty. It's not what happened here all though there is overwhelming evidence here, the fact remains, that this man's rights were violated.......... The author had to be in it for the money, otherwise he would've started from the life of the Ramirez family or the court proceedings then the life and then the crimes he claims Richard confessed to him. Another great injustice in our so called freedom of the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drab Recitation","review":"This is one of the few books I couldn't finish. The book starts off really strong for the first 100 pages or so. You get to read a detailed, journalistic account of Ramirez' crime spree, and some interesting information about his youth as well. But about halfway through, the novel transforms into one of the most boring courtroom \\"dramas\\" you will ever read. Carlo details all of the legal maneuvering, but Ramirez is so blatantly guilty that it is all rather pointless. And considering how the lawyers that strive to defend him are so shallow and fame-seeking, and the groupies that adore him so nasty and mindless, Ramirez almost seems like the most respectable person in the book. More detail about the crimes and less of the courtroom would have made this a far better book. Ramirez is only an interesting character because of his sociopathic tendencies. What happens after his capture can only be trivial and dull by comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Night Stalker","review":"As sleazy, trashy, sensationalized and exploitive as they tend to be I still have a weakness for true crime books. What Ramirez did was very disturbing and out and out evil. He did things like stab old ladies while they were sleeping and rape invalids. Almost equally as disturbing is this guy had female groupies fighting over him, including a juror, and Church of Satan nerds fawning over him and visiting him in prison.In this book the author put it together by doing interviews with Ramirez, the Ramirez family, detectives involved in the case and other people connected to the case in one way or another so I think its pretty credible as far as what actually went down compared to a lot of other true crime books I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See from Viruta and Capulina!","review":"In La Batalla De Los Pasteles/The Battle of the Cakes, an indignant, disgruntled, would be fiance puts a time bomb in a wedding cake!

That said, I found this play to be the worst Williams play. I read \\"The Glass Menagerie\\" and \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" and I found both to be emotional, engaging, and thought provoking. This play does not include any of that. I failed to see the point, and I didn't understand the motivation for the cruelty shown to Margaret (Maggie). I was very disappointed. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Usual Obligatory Hysteria From Tennessee Williams!!!","review":"This play is the usual extreme histrionics that I have come to expect from Tennessee Williams. In this book set on a Southern Plantation we have the obligatory hysterical woman, an alcoholic and a homophobe. After a while one cannot help but get the impression that Mr. William's works all consisted of the same stock, cardboard characters and he only changed the settings and their names.I do give this book 5 stars because I have always liked Elizabeth Taylor who starred in the movie of this play although she is in fact a Real Life Serial Monogamist as the Sociologist would refer to her ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Pointless, with annoying characters. The one character I did like, Maggie, was completely WASTED! Williams did nothing with her, which was a sin since she's a great character.

Still, can there be at least one good person in the story??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Arrived on time. The only disappointing factor was that the cover was not the same a the picture on the listing. In good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!!","review":"I loved how the book made me feel, every conflict was somehow interwoven into the big conflict about Big Daddy's condition. While reading, I could feel the heat & humidity of the moist Mississippi weather through the stress that each character possessed and the tension that every person added with their own problems. This is a book that really makes you think about how you yourself view the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychosexual subtext within the subtext","review":"What most seem to miss about this work is the subtext placed by Williams on the psychosexual drama at work not between Brick and Maggie, which is obvious, but between Brick and Big Daddy, which is much less so. The homo-incestual dynamic between Big Daddy, who can't stand the sight of Big Mamma, and his son, Brick, who can't stand the sight of Maggie, powers the drama, and is, ultimately, the great unspoken thing, beyond even Brick's relationship with Skipper. Williams can't allow Big Daddy to make love to his son, of course, and so both must die, the former in reality, the latter only symbolicly. Left completely out, of course, are the women, who seem to have no operative place in the resolution of the conflict, but who exist merely to provoke the men toward their ultimate confrontation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julbo Looping 1 infant sunglasses","review":"Works as advertised.

But if you want a nuanced, and intelligent, approach to the problems of the professoriate, you will have to look elsewhere. The author piles egregious examples on top of one another and then thinks he has a case. To make the case that he wants, he needs to show that the majority, or at least a significant number, of professors pilfer away their days in idleness. Instead, like journalists who are on the prowl for \\"bad scoop\\", Sykes finds what he is was looking for ... but this is journalismscam, not research! I know far too many professors who work too hard even to be bothered with studies like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Tabloid Journalism Has Feet Of Clay","review":"On the face of it the author makes it appear that he has a well-researched and persuasive case. Profscam is a sloppy and misleading diatribe. A professor myself, I am the subject of one of his claims. I looked into the note that he used to support his claim in my case and found the citation date to be ten months off for the referenced article (Chapter Five, #9, dated January when the publication was the following November). The quote cited was taken out of context and the cited article was decidedly positive while Sykes has tried to make it appear negative. This work is suspect and I am surprised and disappointed in those who have embraced its message. The careful reader will be able to deconstruct the author's real intent only to discover that the exercise was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very jaded view....","review":"Sykes has a horrific chip on his shoulder. His condemnation of higher education is a biased, one sided view. He attacks the professoriate here with urgency, suggesting that every academic is a lazy, sloth.

There are many more objective reports out there which outline the weaknesses and strengths of today's college campuses....hold out and buy something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate depiction of the rot in higher education.","review":"Some professors still revere scholarship and take seriously their professional responsibility to pass their knowledge to succeeding generations.

The original owners lost the charger so I came to Amazon to replace it.

Eventually I realized that the connector from the actual Jeep to the battery and the connector from the charger to the battery do not look alike (at all) but both work. When this charger is inserted into the center portion of the grey battery opening, it will work perfectly. It took me about a month to realize that because I thought the connector should fill all three holes instead of just the one. Once I figured that out, we were golden. My kids love this toy now.I had to come back and edit my original review where I indicated they don't match.

Hollywood is in the remake era right now and most remakes are better than the original, and this movie is no different. Adam Sandler and Chris Rock together should be enough to go see this film, but with all the guest star appearances it makes it 10X better. All I can say it that if your a fan of comedies you will love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful attempt to recreate a classic","review":"A remake, such as this one, begs to be compared to the original. If that's the case, this is one awful movie. Adam Sandler is completely mis-cast as the character Paul Crew. I didn't believe he was an ex-NFL quarterback for one minute and his pedestrian effort throughout the entire movie did nothing to try to convince me otherwise. Even Burt Reynolds (who was excellent in the original) seemed lost as to what the director was trying to convey. Chris Rock could have been more memorable in the role of Caretaker but the director made poor use of his talents.If you enjoy huge, sweaty, steroid infested non-actors mugging and growling and screaming in front of a camera, this may be a movie for you. I prefer a compelling story mixed with a bit of a message, which was present in the original movie.

His latest film \\"Broken Embraces\\" has beautiful Penelope Cruz in a lead female role that she carries on well as always. Although the story is unique, it definitely is a typical Almodovar movie in which he employs many of his ideas from the previous films. Homosexuality, obsessive love, revenge and femme fatale are themes his fans will recognise quickly throughout the film.This is a story of two people who loved each other deeply and sincerely. Power, money and possesiveness got in a way of them being together and like most doomed relationships, this one was not to last. The mere impossibility of such love to exist makes this story so lovely and touching.Must see movie, regardless if this is the first film by this director you have ever seen, or one out of many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was surprised at how disappointed I was with this movie. I like Almodovar's movies quite a bit but the freshness of energy and the unexpected turns of events were missing I thought.

I borrowed a cheaper model and wasn't satisifed with it. On this model, the mattress has more cushion and is therefore more comfortable, especially when placed directly on the bottom of the play yard for older babies. When elevated for new babies, the mattress support is better and does not \\"sag\\" when the baby is placed in it. My only complaints have to do with the storage bag...It is way too small!

The included changing station is certainly strong and we use it almost exclusively now, but our baby at 5 months has almost outgrown it. In a few months, I expect her legs would dangle over the edge.

As a guy, I hate having to look at assembly instructions. But I had to look at the instructions for this thing, because assembly wasn't looking so intuitive. And that is when I found the worst instructions ever provided for a consumer product. All they would have had to do to make the instructions work is hire an illustrator for a day to make some drawings. If you took 10 people off of the street, gave this bed rail and the instructions and put them in locked rooms such that they couldn't come out until they were properly assembled and installed, archeologists would be later digging up their bones."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT For Co-sleeping Families With Bigger Kids & Pillow Top Beds!","review":"Once our little co-sleeper was almost 4 years old, we replaced our flat top (and baby safe) king mattress with a nice pillow top. Problem was, our little octopus had to sleep between us, because we could never find a bed rail that was secure enough, high enough or strong enough to offer safety to our 40 pound 4 year old. Then I found this rail at our local Babies R Us for a mere $19.99!! It fits beautifully on our 17 inch pillowtop, and the safety strap that goes across underneath the mattress stretches all the way across under our California King with strap to spare!! Our little one is very, very excited with her new rail, and so are mom and dad!! You can see our rail in use in the Customer Pics! Very, very happy!

I quickly returned this product for the Safety First bedrail that folds down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instuctions need to be improved","review":"I bought 2 of these rails (in white) and the instructions do say to be used with a matress & boxspring. I had to use commonsense to install it since the instructions are of no real help. We have a twin size bed with a high matress for our 2 yrs. The square bar is just below the top of the matress so that it does not touch her when she's sleeping. She's been taking her naps in her bed and no roll overs or falling out. So far so good. The only con is the instructions. It does not say how to fold it down. I got it by looking at the image. When you have the lower bar set to unlock,each of the hidged bars have arrows on it. Pull them up at the same time and voila! it folds down!

And pictures could have been helpful since the instructions suck.

And like another reviewer stated there is no instructions on how to lower it in the fold position. It was completely unusable to me.

It stated not to use on a toddler bed but it seems to work just fine on it. (we have a crib mattress on the toddler bed. I just left the strap off like the previous Mom had said.I have been searching everywhere for a bed rail that says it can be used for a toddler bed and I was unable to find one but this rail works just fine on her bed. If you bought one of those converter beds, from crib to toddler bed then this is your best bet and best priced.Last piece of advice, take your time putting it together, wording faces out and don't let the straps get tangled :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recomend","review":"I purchased this rail a few days ago after returning the Safety First model.

It got mostly good reviews and looked to be the perfect thing for my son's bed. So I bought it...big mistake.First off, it does not tell you on the information page that this rail system should be used on a bed with a mattress and box spring. My son has a captain's bed, therefore, no box spring. Secondly, the directions are not properly illustrated and leave out a vital piece of information until the END of the instruction page. (This being that the 'pocket' for the square tube must face inward towards the mattress) I had the whole thing assembled (wrong, of course) before discovering this valuable bit of information.Lastly, they provide NO instructions on how to fold the rail down. I still have no idea how to do that, not that I can because that function doesn't work on my son's rails since he has no box spring.I am very disappointed.

In spite of this process, the sound quality is very good on most tracks.Listening to this CD you'll realize why some of these guys never hit it big...they just didn't have the talent. Others might make you think why didn't they make a name for themselves. Most of the tracks are along the lines of Johnny Cash and Hank Williams rather than rockabilly artists like early Elvis and Carl Perkins. You'll hear steel guitar solos and fiddles on several tracks (as well as hot, and not so hot, guitar solos). If you're more into straight-up rockabilly, you might want to look at some of the other Buffalo Bop or Bear Family compilations. However, it's still a lot of fun to listen to if you're into roots country and early rockabilly."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a client's point of view","review":"This seems to me to be a pretty standard exposition of how to choose a therapist. It may work for an average client. The author agrees that therapists are different in their success with therapy, but as with many another on the topic does not really know why. What does one therapist do in therapy that another does not? Why does one therapist actively listen, immediately aware of his or her own thoughts and feelings during a session and able to make use of this awareness, and another just goes on \\"instinct\\" without being particularly self-aware? This can be the crucial difference in therapy. It allows a therapist to let a client be entirely separate from the therapist, and lets him or herself hear the experience of the client, an experience which may be very much more extreme than the average person's -- and this factor is almost never discussed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great coffee table book","review":"I bought this for my daughter, who has an Arabian horse.

I would give this release 4 stars however my review is based on the remastering from according to the record label \\"Original Masters\\". I listen to my music on a full stereo set up with pro speakers and this edition sounds awful! Sounds too compressed and the separation and mix of the instruments needs some serious improvements. This also sounds very thin and could use some extra bass.

My favorite tracks: the Phil-Spector-esque \\"You took the words right out of my month,\\" \\"Two out of three ain't bad,\\" \\"For crying out loud,\\" with echoes of the Boss, and of course, the minor classic \\"Paradise by the dashboard light,\\" with a cameo by Yankee great Phil Rizzuto.

I have heard this music in it's original form many times, and it is amazing, but this remastered version seems to have upped the bass element to a point that I developed listener fatigue halfway through the first (title) cut. I tried adjusting the bass on my stereo (yes a real stereo, not an I-home or Bose) but along with bringing the bass in line it destroyed the rich tones of Meatloaf's vocals.My next purchase will be the same album only from a used un-remastered 1980's CD (if such a thing exists) or to dig out the old turntable and buy a 1970's vinyl version at a rummage sale and hope it's not too scratched up.

This an overproduced silly and dated sounding mish mash of violins and bad guitar playing. The lyrics are utterly forgettable as well. This disc can usually be found as a super saver for $9.99.

Meatloaf possesses one of the most uniquely powerful voices in the rock industry. His range was (and still is)unbelieveable. To have produced \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" when it was done, and to have it possess the power and majesty it does is truly unbelieveable.

There have been many albums I did not like when there were first released but later ended up liking. We just agreed to disagree.Anyway, I guess I should be appalled that at this day in age there are still people who think of this as classic stuff, but by and large I just shake my head in disbelief.

The three, working with a band built around the members of Rundgren's band Utopia, have crafted a sound that's a blend of Billy Joel, Ted Nugent, and Springsteen, to create a rock opera for the late 70s. It's much better than The Who's TOMMY because its lyrics are totally about a normal adolescence, without any of the spiritualistic questioning and messianic overtones of TOMMY. The remastered version is even better than the original, with two live bonus cuts. I was five years old when the original version came out, so I discovered it as a young adult, and have loved it ever since.

I mean just look at that horrid cover art. It is so ugly that hurts the just eyes to look at it. But never judge a book by its cover, they say, and they same should apply to albums.Unfortunately this is NOT the album to prove that point.

Take a huge, overweight, singer with a silly name, give him a set of overblown and pretentious songs, produce said songs with a style so overwrought that it puts Phil Spector to shame, and have the singer work himself into such a frenzy on stage that he passes out and is rushed into an oxygen tent for revival. Remember folks, it was the 70's when mindless excess ruled the day.That was 20 years ago. I suppose \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" might serve as an amusing time piece of sorts for those who weren't there, but for those of us who were should have no problem giving this the eye roll it deserves and shaking our heads over its continued popularity.

I have nothing personal against you, your music, or the artist who performs it. I'm sure Mr. Loaf is a fine, outstanding citizen that anybody would admire in person, but as for the style of music he performs? Attrocious! These bombastic, over the top, pseudo opera epics sound more like a Broadway musical than rock n roll. The songs are boring and tell long winded stories with involved plots. The production is over the top and bombastic.

It was available on CD, but dad never caught up with these times! Still, even when I didn't know what Meatloaf was singing about, even when I had to be in bed by 8:30pm with his music ringing through my mind, I felt it.10 years down the track, and i've managed to pick up both the vinyl version and the remastered CD. Both have frequent play, by both me and my teenage mates. So many years down the track, this album still gets the blood pumping of the teen generation.It's epic. It's melo-dramatic and far, far over the top. But that's why we love it.

To call him original would be mere understatement as there was no one like him before him, and no one like him after him. Meat Loaf does not sing Jim Steinmans' songs he devours them-he swallows them whole and when he releases them what emerges is a primal scream that soars to the heavens then down to the bowels of hell and back again. I always suspected that Mr Loaf is not of this earth but a demonic choirboy from some other galaxy and praise be to however, whoever, or whatever sent him our way so we mere mortals can stand at his altar transfixed and yes even terrified and elevated by his larger than life presence shaking as he performs his music like, like A BAT OUT OF HELL.Meat Loaf should be considered a National Treasure as well as this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Piece of Music","review":"This was released the year after I graduated from High School and it is truly just as great today as it was back then.This brings back so many memories for me because the lyrics were so great for a teenager.

Also, All Revved Up With No Place to Go is great and of course the title track, Bat Out of Hell is classic.For me at least, Meatloaf's Bat Out of Hell just stands the test of time. Once again, It is as great today as it was back then!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Great","review":"How do you knock Bat out of Hell? There is nothing wrong with this album.

Something that dared to live, ferociously.\\"Bat I\\" is without a doubt the finest of the three \\"Bat\\" albums, achieving much more than its predecessors in 25 less minutes.

All this and at the same time, probably do much to convince young people that science can be cool, fun, and fascinating.Admittedly the recent sexiness of the whole dinosaur epoch adds to the momentum of uncovering the answers to one of the gretatest bio-historical questions of all time.

Easy-to-read, yet complete with notes directing you to additional resources, T.Rex and the Crater of Doom would make an especially inspirational gift for the aspiring geologist.

Geologist Alvarez, a major proponent of the impact theory of the Cretaceous extinction, then begins an amazing and highly readable account of the worldwide search for and discovery of the many pieces of evidence supporting this theory. This book flows like a scientific detective story, laying out the characters, clues, arguments and false leads until it finally arrives at the \\"AH-HA!\\" moment when the Crater of Doom is found.

Similar to Mustard Plug (only with a much cooler singer) this is a CD definitely worth adding to your collection.

This is very critical since most doctors recommend a visit to the emergency room if the child's temperature exceeds 105. With this thermometer there is - at least for me - no accurate way of telling.In addition, the button that activates the reading process gets stuck a lot, thereby producing no result at all.

It appears, by visual inspection, the cutter has been redesigned. The cutter now appears as if the individual cutting elements are wider and not thin blades as in the past. Consequently, the experience is pure torture. The order through Amazom expressly identifies the Braun Activator 8585 series. I was sent the 8000 Series product, which indicates it is for the \\"Series 5.\\" When I questioned Goodman's about the difference, they simply stated that it was the same product had been \\"modified.\\" This is no longer the product I have used and respected.

I ordered the part in the first week of May '06 to only have it delayed 3 times for shipment. I just got another delay notice from Amazon today, July 10. At this rate they'll never ship the item.If they can't ship, why in the world do they list this item???UPDATE: Amazon finally shipped the product after the 3rd delay. Replacing the screen/cutter restores the shaver to like-new performance. Overall I find the Activator to give a decent shave with minor irritation. Using a William's Lectric Shave helps even more by reducing irritation to nearly zero, lightly lubes the screen/cutter and keeps the screen reasonably cool to the touch. My previous screen did last about 19 months so the longevity (in my case) is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun Activator Combi-Pack Foil & Cutterblock","review":"I have ordered this item several times.

This is Braun's replacement #51S and it SUCKS! The cutter blade design has changed and it does not shave anywhere near as clean as the older design.

The fit is perfect, and the blade style is of the thinner variety formerly used in the Activator. I had an immediate improvement in shave closeness--with none of the hair pulling of my old replacement blade. If you own an Activator and you're about to toss it out because of the terrible quality of these replacement blades, you might want to search for \\"Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo\\" and try my route first. Hope this is helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Extremely Disappointing Replacement!","review":"My son has been using the Braun 8595 for several years, which afforded him a comfortable shave, and we used the replacement foil and cutter \\"8000 Series\\" Activator during the past years, which was a perfect fit and replacement, like the original. Braun apparently discontinued this foil cutter block, and the new one caused my son great pain and discomfort during his shave! I had to go out and buy him an entire new system, and am going to try to return the unused, and hopefully the slightly used foil and cutter. The REPLACEMENT foil and cutter says: Braun 51S Series 5 / 8000 Series, 360(degrees)Complete, Activator. If you are at all sensitive, you might not like this replacement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New foil heads are defective","review":"I believe Braun has changed the way they make the new replacement cutters and foil heads for the 8000 series razors. The older ones had grey plastic clips on the ends and the new ones have black. I have purchased three new sets in four months and all three have lost a clip off of the end. This causes the foils to vibrate. It is a very noticable change in the sound when turned on and the quality of shave is greatly reduced. I have used this razor for three years and never had this problem. I used the last replacement head two times before it broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS REPLACEMENT","review":"I never thought I'd say anything bad about my Braun 8585 shaver, but the replacement foils and cutterblock have ruined a wonderful product.Here's what happened....I used my original blades and foil for 2 to 3 years. The shaver gave me a GREAT shave. Then I replaced those blades with replacement foil and cutterblock. What a mistake! Apparently Braun was bought out by Gillette in 2005. Gillette changed the design of the blades and moved the manufacture of them to China. Well, now blades that are supposed to last 18 months only last 2-3 months. They are HORRIBLE.I am so frustrated because it now takes me 3 times as long to shave and the results are just terrible. The shaver is cutting my face and not my hair. Yesterday, I ordered a Panasonic shaver because I can't afford to replace the blades every 2-3 months and get a crappy shave.I used to love this shaver. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor reliability","review":"The \\"new and improved\\" foil with Gillette technology is too fragile.

Over time I must have forgotten how well and easily my 8585 worked when it was new. With the replacement parts in place my Braun has a brand new feel to it. I'll probably try changing the parts again in 12-14 months. It's well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"I used these replacements for my Braun 8595 and they work fine.

For the \\"bare essentials to pass\\" crowd (including me), sometimes I felt the author spent a bit too much time on things that weren't directly on the exam.

This is the best investment I have made in books. This book is not for the begginer. It is a treasure chest of practical information. It feels like I am speaking to a very experience professor whom is giving me all the tricks of the trade. This guy actually answers questions others assume you know the answer for.

The mistakes are minor and won't trip you up when it comes time to take the exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tremendous Help","review":"I just passed 70-176 today and I have to give James Foxall's book a lot of credit. It covered all the areas covered on the exam and does an excellent job at it. I do have to say this, however, that his or anybody elses book alone will not guarantee a passing grade. You definitely need to supplement any book with Transcender. Transcender helped me uncover the areas I was weak in and Jim's book helped me brush up on those areas. The two together will go a long way towards success. I also have very little real world experience in VB. Most of it was through what I did on my own and what seems like a mountain of exercises. So any of you that have day to day experience in VB and haven't taken any of the exams, then this book + Transcender + your experience --- hey, you've got it made."},{"rating":"2","title":"I passed 70-176 with the help of this book","review":"This is a very valuable book. It defintely helped me not just prepare, but learn those aspects of VB that you don't use every day, like ActiveX Docs, and the P&D wizard. However, I couldn't bring myself to give it the full 5 stars for this reason. Even though the book was an excellent source of info for the test, I still had to buy another book - even though I have been using VB for several years. I still had to brush up on the basics, which Mr. Foxall does not cover. As a VB programmer, I don't keep everything in my head all the time. MSDN is always readily available to me, so I do not have to memorize certain things that are covered on the test. Regardless, the book did help, and for that I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book","review":"I have been reading this book for a couple of hours.What I like about the book is that it covers subtle but very important points in understanding VB coding, like COM, and how it works. Unlike other books that give you bits and pieces of information and huge coding examples, the author painstakingly limits his discussion to get the point across without confusing the reader. The author clearly understands what makes Visual Basic tick. This book is going to be a big factor in passing the exam. Maybe the only computer book that I can't put down.With this said, this book is not for someone new to VB. You must know VB topics such as what event driven programming is and at least basic computer syntax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most bang for the buck!","review":"MCSD in a Nutshell is by far the best book you can get for Visual Basic certification exams. It takes a no-nonsense approach to the topic. The most basic areas are not covered, but it covers a lot of ground. If you are well versed with visual basic, then this book will give you the boost you need to brush up on your skills, prepare you for the obscure topics of the exams, and make you aware of how to use VB in general. Not just for the exams, it's an excellent quick reference tool.It's not riddled with code, but it uses code in adequate amounts to explain the section in question. Its \\"Key Facts\\" section summarizes the chapters very well - something that one can scan through before the exams. There are also a proportioned amounts of questions at the end of the chapters for self testing.Considering the low price as compared with other competing books, MCSD is a sureshot winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another awesome book by Byron Barton","review":"A staple board book for a 2 yr old!

Even my 8-year old noticed right away - \\"Oh this is the caterpillar story\\" and \\"this is the boy and the bear.\\" We really liked the first CD, Indigo Dreams, and since this was described as for age 8-12, we thought it would be that \\"next step.\\"Yet I feel we completely wasted money since we already had the first. But if you don't have the first, then this is a great item. I don't know too many 12 year olds who would listen to it, but it's great for kids 6-10ish who need to learn relaxation techniques. Right away my son incorporated some of the techniques and is beginning to make some process with his anxieties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely soothing messages for kids","review":"My 7 year old daughter loves this CD and listens to it during the day as well as at bedtime. She loves the stories and it sends her off to sleep really well. The music at the end is also lovely and soothing. It is good to know that something positive and healthy is going into your child's mind, with all the crazy stuff on TV these days. Very highly recommended especially for kids with stress and anxiety. The stories on this one are quite long so this CD could be used for older children too - maybe even teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Hubs and I separated last year, and our 6 year old daughter has had some adjustments. I started to play one segment per evening with her (only 2x/week). To help her relax, just as the story begin I let her lie on my bed, put some moisturizing lotion on her feet/hands, and put on a dim bedside lamp. She has thoroughly enjoyed listening to the stories, is able to relate how the character wants to \\"be the boss\\" of his own feelings. I lie in bed with her many times, and she enjoys it as a bonding time. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing nights and sweet dreams....","review":"I bought this CD for my 10 yr old, who often has trouble settling down at night. For the past three nights she has put on the CD and rested comfortably and fallen to sleep very easily. Last night she started on story #4, since she had not gotten to hear the end of the CD yet! I laid down and listened to the CD with her the other night and was amazed at how relaxed (and sleepy) I was afterwards. The stories teach the kids lessons about how to cope with everyday stresses, and teach slow deep breathing. And, the soft music between the stories help wash the trouble of the day away. I recommend this CD highly, for anyone who needs help to wind down before bedtime. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Suitable for Boys 8 and Over","review":"All my 10 year old did was roll his eyes and laugh, \\"This is baby stuff\\" I feel like the other reviews I read were made up by the author's friends.

Most songs in this Cd are taken from Live performance, but the sound quality is superb. The weak point is there is no details of where , when, or which band or who the conductor assisted Mr. Damone. I enjoy this Cd a lot, for the Vic Damone fans, you should listen to \\"All the Things You Are\\" , sung in Swing Style , and the melancholy-Here That Rainny DayOn the Street Where You Live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average material","review":"It looks as if the bad boys of the 1980s are not as bad as they once seemed, or has the level of badness just skyrocketed and left Camisa de Venus behind? For sure, the things that Camisa de Venus (the Brazilian word for condom) sing about are as risque as could be aired on the radio in the mid-1980s (rape, kidnap, murder, domestic violence, cheating etc.), but with a mild rockabilly style more typical of Raul Seixas-era Brazilian rock, Camisa de Venus fails to rock. Furthermore, on this live CD, one that is a collection of their best songs, the producers failed to include the song \\"Deus me de Grana\\" (God, give me dough- as in money).

It has tawdry romances, dramas, intrigues, centering mostly around shallow characters with predictable emotions. But through the main character, Michele, Moravia explores contemporary trends in modern Western culture, society, and thought.So this book is both a pleasantly engaging page-turner and a pleasantly engaging intellectual treat. It's still not as good as Moravia's later works, particularly Boredom and The Conformist, in sexiness, intelligence, or originality.

Although it is very difficult to pick out 32 of his best songs (because every one of his song were a hit), this album comes close enough. The great thing about Frankie Ruiz is that whether you like old-school salsa or modern salsa, Frankie is the man to listen to. Because of his great complexity, versitility, and that great salsero voice like no other, Frankie managed to be THE GREATEST SALSERO OF ALL TIME.! It will be a long time before another Frankie Ruiz comes along the scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaker Furniture Making \\"Barney-Style\\"","review":"This book is fantastic.

As one of the many thousands of persons hooked on \\"The Ring\\" operas and puzzled by their peculiar power, I wanted to find a study of this which did not require specialized musical training, and was written without jargon. Treadwell does a fine job of discerning themes he calls: romance, revolution, exile and religion.

She obviously has a double for a lot of these sequences, but when they show her face she looks pretty good. Then we meet lo lieh and along with a couple other good actors, I thought this looked pretty good. But there needs to be a story. If this was not kung fu, it would be fine. But it seems as cheap as any fu movie I have ever seen. And the fighting is not choreographed very well at all. I never felt excitement. So I somehow made it through this(fastforwarding over 20 minutes). And there is a great dramatic battle sequence at the end. I wish things leadign up to this would have been somewhat enjoyable so I may have felt something for the characters.

This contradiction is reflected in Buy's lyrics, and in the music, which combines a brittle dissonance with a brutal funk rhythm, perfectly intregrated, if its possible to express an integrated contradiction (or paradox). I believe that in its many different incarnations, the Contortions of 1980-81 (in live performances) were one of the best funk bands in musical history; unlike many better known acts, James (following James Brown's mid- and late-1960s bands) realized that funk is essential a stripped-down, unembelished and severe music, and he added a lot of humor and irony to keep it fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"This lens fits onto the camera fine, but the image quality is poor at best.

Remove the lid from the tank, remove the cardboard tube in the center of the roll and cut the toilet tissue in half with a bread knife. The two halves will just about fill the box to recreate the absorbent. Here's the kicker. The printer reads a chip on the tank and remembers the last two tanks, and maybe more.

Some of the reveiws for this book make me sad. All those people are saying \\"It was the worst book I've ever read, and Larry McMurtry's books aren't ever right in terms of history, and blah, blah, blah.\\" Thats ok, Larry McMurtry is a wonderful author, and his books don't have to be historically correct for them to be great literary works. I love the way he writes, and I could really give less of a damn wether they are historically correct or not. If you want historical facts from one of the time periods from his books, go get a history book, and stop complaining about the books not being right. Thery're still WONDERFUL books!!!!!!!!!!!! I would DEFINATELY recommend ANY of Larry McMurtry's books, it's not a waste of time or money, I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor disertation on both Crazy Horse and the West.","review":"McMurtry should stick to fiction. He spends as much time taking the Army generally, and George Custer specifically, to task as he devotes to Crazy Horse. Very little, if any, new information is learned about Crazy Horse. Again, he spends much of his time trying to sully the reputations of the Military leaders of the period.When one looks at his references it is evident that he spent little time searching for a balanced view of the period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mcmurtry seemed almost flippant regarding Lakota issues.","review":"I did not like this book much at all. I think McMurtry needed to do much more research regarding Lakotas, Crazy Horse, and the Plains Indian Wars of the mid 1900s. I wonder if he spoke or consulted with any Lakota people regarding this work. It would seem he did not. This book doesn't do justice for the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lousy Book","review":"If \\"Crazy Horse\\" is indicative of the quality of the Penguin Lives series, perhaps readers would be better off staying away. The book is dominated as much by McMurtry's towering ego (endless use of \\"I\\" and \\"me\\" in a book about someone else) as by the title character. McMurtry even uses descriptions from Africa to describe events in America, as if there weren't first-person accounts from the American West.Had the editor taken the time to do some serious cutting this would have been a decent book. That didn't happen, though, and the result is more than disappointing. If I could get my money back, I would.I expected more from McMurtry and from Penguin's Lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"McMurty starts off by saying not much was know about Crazy Horse and then goes on to tell the reader exactly that, not much.

It should have a big disclaimer printed on the front of the book: \\"This book is a work of fiction!\\"McMurtry has the audacity to malign other writers and researchers for their conclusions and then he proceeds to do the same poor job of second guessing. Throughout the book he continually guesses at where Crazy Horse might have been or what he might have been doing. For the love of writing . . . if you don't know then say so. Don't just write to sell something!The book was the WORST I've bought in years! I've demanded my money back, and I think McMurtry owes us all a big apology for wasting our time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Unless you're interested in the inner musings of McMurtry, don't bother with this hefty-priced, hard-bound 'pamphlet.' I knew very little about Crazy Horse before reading this book and just as little upon finishing it. I'd like to read several of the other volumes in this series, but I feel so ripped off by this one that I won't buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"McMurtry unqualified","review":"What are McMurtry's qualifications to write about Crazy Horse, one wonders? Does he know the Lakota people? Has he lived among them? Has he heard their oral tradititions? Does he have the vaguest idea of what Crazy Horse means to Crazy Horse's people? In general, James Atlas, editor of the Penuin series of short biographies, is on the right track in not seeking academic scholars and similar authorities to write these books, but SOME expertise, one would think, would not be amiss, especially in dealing with a figure so lost in myth as this compelling Oglala. The best book on Crazy Horse is STONE SONG by Win Blevins. It is a novel. McMurtry also writes novels and needs to stick to the form."},{"rating":"1","title":"A snooze","review":"I am a great McMurtry fan (Lonesome Dove, etc.).

About 1/4 of the way through the book, I began to feel sick. I just kept thinking \\"Oh my, these kids are innocent!\\" For a book that is supposed to be showing you WHY and HOW Jessie, Jason, and Damien killed these kids, I was not seeing that. The facts are the facts, and the facts were telling me this was very, very wrong. I asked a few other people to read the book and give me their opinions, just to see if they came to the same conclusion I did, and they did.

A much superior book, \\"Devil's Knot\\" has been released recently andI recommend that over Blood of Innocents. For the most part, this book is written from the official perspective that Damien, Jason and Jessie are guilty of the crimes they were convicted of. It focuses heavily on the writings of Damien Echols which prove nothing except that he was a disturbed teen while ignoring or glossing over the evidence pointing away from the three. This is your garden variety true crime book full of lurid detail but little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good companion with \\"Devil's Knot\\"","review":"Although this book seemingly attempts to present Damien, Jesse and Jason as guilty; the authors piece together a poor attempt at presenting hard evidence that the three had anything to do with the Robin Hood Hills Murders.While there are a lot of facts left out of this outdated book, and while new evidence has surfaced, as well as some of the testimony being recanted or proven false, I found it a good companion to Devil's Knot by Mara Leveritt.I also encourage any reader of this book that is not familiar with the case to do some extra research...there are a TON of people online that have been very willing to help and answer questions if you are confused.As long as you don't rely on everything this book has within it as fact, and it is used as a companion with new and current information, I suppose it is worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"Devil's Knot\\" first!","review":"This book is long on supposition and short on objective fact. In a nut shell, the book seems to say \\"The WM3 are guilty-take my word on it-don't be confused by facts, the story flows so thats all you need to know.\\" Unfortunately the Arkansas penile system (and jury pool)seems to think this way too.

Skip it and read Devil's Knot and watch the movies instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and incomplete...","review":"I read this book when it first came out in 1995, and the best thing I can say about it is that it ignited my interest in this case. Although the book is completely biased, I found enough inconsistencies and doubts to continue researching the case. In the years since, many new details have emerged and with them an ever-growing group of supporters who believe in the innocence of the boys that were convicted.I hope that anyone who reads this book does so with an open mind and a willingness to learn more about the case. I would strongly recommend viewing the \\"Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills\\" and \\"Paradise Lost 2: Revelations\\" movies as well as reading \\"Devil's Knot\\" by Mara Leveritt and visiting the website - www.wm3.org."},{"rating":"2","title":"morbid comedy","review":"Bill Knott is a great poet.

However, it doesn't overdose you with facts about the society or the culture. It so beautifully and subtly introduces it to the reader. It's really a mesmerizing book. Just make sure to take notice of all the names that you will come across. It could be a bit confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I LOVED this book. It is an honest, heartbreaking and heart lifting portrait of a family. This book spoke to me as a mother, a sister, a daughter and a wife. It was one of those books that you start to read more slowly as it comes to a close, just to savor the last moments and to keep it from coming to an end. Buy this book, read it, love it and share it with your family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read","review":"The Mother figure is such a wonderful character, the book was a delight. Made me forget the horrible cold that I was nursing while reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Physical Beauty Trumps All Else","review":"While I found the book to be well-written and compelling as it explores life through the perpectives of 3 generations of diverse and interesting family members, I was irritated by its emphasis on physical beauty.The overall importance & worth of each character seemed totally dependent on how physically beautiful they were--and consequently, everyone else (regardless of their soundness of character, level of kindness, etc) was portrayed as deeply & irreparably flawed. Perhaps the author sees the world that way, but hopefully most others outside the book do not."},{"rating":"2","title":"* I WONT BE ABLE TO DO IT JUSTICE *","review":"I am NOT a writer so bear with my lack of talent when it comes to wriiting reviews,I wont be able to do the book justice that it deserves.Take it for granted that, if you buy this book, you should only begin it when you have an available sick day coming..... youll be up all night reading it........literally !As the editors have accuratly stated, if you love Esquival, Tan, Hoffman, or Allende, ( etc etc) then youre going to ADORE Manicka.

The story starts right before World War II and finishes in the present times. Not only does the author deliver an amazing story of one family , but also she takes you on a journey to the exotic places, inspiredly describing them with poetical subtlety and imaginativeness, so that you can feel the flavors and spirits of the southern Asia. After reading \\"The Rice Mother\\" I felt richer with knowledge, inspiration and....experience!Believe me, while reading this book, you are invited to enter its world and live the life of each character. It may sound surreal, but I assure you it's true! It's definitely the most passionate and multiple-dimensional novel I've ever read. Hard to describe, a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but flawed","review":"I agree with the reviewer who found it irritating that each word is presented in isolation, rather than making comparisons. For instance, what is the difference in pronunciation between faire and fer?Another irritation is the fact that an English speaker introduces overall sections (this is good), BUT that for the most part, we listen to native French speakers, some with strong accents, speak English as well as French. For instance, the francophones are the folks telling us how to hold our tongues to pronounce \\"r\\" or \\"l.\\" Why not have the English speaker do ALL of the English, and let the francophones do the French?I debated giving this a 3, but the sounds covered and the extent of coverage of each vowel make it worth a 4. It is also valuable that the CDs run through the pronunciation of groups of vowels, such as \\"eil\\" (soleil)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Pronunciation Guide","review":"The text and CDs work quite well as a pronunciation guide. However, they are not intended as a teaching guide for learning French. They should be used only as a refresher for those who have a basic knowledge of French or as a supplement to other teaching materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"not used!","review":"I do not use this reference. I tried but it does not come together as a way of understanding how to pronounce. I went throught the entire program and it helped very little.

If you want to know more about Mr. Wunderman's life or the history of direct marketing then this book is for you. However, the book promises to deliver on \\"making advertising pay\\" and it simply doesn't. What techniques you learn about direct marketing are antidotal and have to be mined from a lot of ore. The first few pages enumerate Mr. Wunderman's 19 principles which is about the only direct how-to we get."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting guide to the history of direct marketing","review":"This book is interesting particularly for the evolution of direct marketing that Wunderman describes--and to a large degree, instigated. Readers will notice a tendency for Wunderman to toot his own horn, but don't worry; it doesn't ever become obnoxious.The book would be good as a general guide as to what works and what doesn't--and why--in direct marketing. If a company is looking at direct marketing as a possible direction, this would be a good place to start to get an idea of what is involved, and what it takes to be successful. It may or may not help the reader that Wunderman describes using his techniques in marketing both goods (flowers) and services (credit cards).In the end, you get more history from it than hard, specific tips. A very good read, but don't expect it to be \\"100 tips to direct marketing success\\". The hints are there, but you'll need to dig them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look at the changing business-consumer relationship","review":"Now in an updated second edition, Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay presents the wisdom and practical experience of advertising legend and direct marketing pioneer Lester Wunderman, perhaps best known for his guidance behind the ubiquity of the American Express card, the creation of the Columbia Record Clob, and the well-known L.L. Bean. Although Being Direct focuses especially upon successful direct marketing, the experiences recounted within the pages are critically important to any business striving to get the most out of its advertising budget. From inventing new direct marketing media to how to successfully start an advertising agency to speculations of changes in the future and more, Being Direct is an eye-opening look at the changing business-consumer relationship from the point of view of a man who not only adapted to modern revolutions of information technology, but put them to use for success beyond anyone's dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good on flint and stone working...tools","review":"The discussion of tool industries as to how they were produced and how they were used by early man and his ancestors is very good: the best I have seen.The book is dated for sure, but the place names and dates are still pretty good as reference. The writing style is somewhat dry, but readable.The mention of carbon dated hearths in the new world at 23800, 28000, and 37000 years and then the default to Clovis was a disappointment.On reason this book is as dated as it is, is because of recent resultsin this area of new world dates.

We have a great location for it in our house, but I can see how it would be too massive for a lot of people. The best thing about this toy is how many other things you can do with it. We race matchbox cars on it, roll balls up and down it, and it is PERFECT for the Tonka racerback remote control car. We also have the Gator Golf game, and it's a lot of fun to put the golf balls at the top of the ramp and putt them down the ramp and try to get them into the gator's mouth. I have not found a single negative about this toy. I got it for under $90 at Sam's, which makes it even more enjoyable. This was definitely the best toy from Christmas, made even better since it can be used in combination with so many of our other toys.

We purchased this for our grandchildren ages 3 and 2 and so far we have narrowly escaped visits to the Emergency Room. The seat is fine so long as it remains at the top, when the child attempts to roll down the seat flips over the side of the pathway down. I am in the process of returning it since it has been used less than three times. We will not allow the children to ride it any longer. There was adult supervision at all times and that is what allowed us to avoid a tragedy. This item is not suitable for two or three year olds and I am reluctant to say that it is suitable for an older child because of its instablity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame toy.","review":"Got this for my daughter as an extra special gift for her 2nd bday.

When I received it, I was surprised how short the track was. Clearly I didn't understand how short 10 feet of track is. Case in point, my 2-year-old literally took one ride on it and said he was done. I kept it out for several more days and he didn't take one look at it. This toy may last a child from ages 1-2, but that's about it. The car is kinda fun and a child might like scooting around it without the track, but this set really only works for young toddlers under age 2. It is colorful and well constructed, and easy to assemble, but don't be fooled by the photos that make you think your older toddler will get much out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandkids love it","review":"Got this for the grandkids, for our hilly backyard!

They love riding it and both of them in a matter of a few days have figured out how to roll the car back up to the top and climb on all on their own. Its been incredible to watch the trial and error as they experimented with different ways to get it up to the top. They have also been rolling their toy cars down it, rolling balls from top to bottom and then trying to push them back up to the top again. They walk on it, slide on it, climb over it and ride on the car by itself on the floor.

This toy is wonderful for my little one's (22 mos.) motor skills. She has to get the little car on the track, push it up to the top, climb off the track then climb back up the little steps to get on the car and then give herself a push off for the little two second ride over the \\"bumps\\". And she will do it over and over and over again. I also have an electric ride on train and I prefer it when she plays with this because there's so much more interaction with the toy itself.It's a very popular toy with her play group friends. The track is 10' long so you need a pretty good size space to set it up but it can go indoors or out so don't worry, you can probably manage it. Set up is so easy you don't really need the instructions. A little side note, her Little Tikes sit on car also fits on the track so if you already have one of those you really have two cars to use!Set it up and get ready to hear Wheeee! for about an hour or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy","review":"My 2 year old got this for his Bday.

She is able to push the car up the track, get on, and push off by herself. There have been no injuries and I dont forsee any - even with her riding it backwards.

Shame on the FDA.This book, The PDR Family Guide to Prescription Drugs is nothing more than an advertisement for the Drug Industry. The Physician's Desk Reference, on the other hand, is for medical doctors and contains vital information on all popular drugs prescribed today. Information from the pharmaceutical companies, how the drug should be used, how it should not be used, and most importantly, the contra-indications (\\"side-effects\\"). The side-effects of many of todays drugs are astounding and anyone considering taking them should be fully informed to make a conscious choice. The PDR (Physicians Desk Reference) for the current year is the book to buy for this vital information, not the Family Guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"the next great cult classic film... you've got to see this","review":"I saw this movie when it came to the Boston Underground film festival.

It's very durable and has plenty of room for your child and anything else you need to take for the ride.

Which is also dangerous.I really researched these wagons and I thought I was going to be getting the best one according to all of the reviews I have read but I am not satisfied with it at all.

It keeps my son busy watching the dogs so we are all happy. It also fits two children very comfortably as we used it when he friend came over last week, they were both so content, they seemed to really enjoy the smooth ride and the room they both had !

It is big and wonderful. She could even sleep in it if she wanted to. We love the cooler. I only wish it came with a rubber plug, but it's easy to find something that will work to stop the drain. When we don't use it as a cooler, it's great for holding my wallet or keys or anything else that's not immediately in use and we don't want little hands getting into. The sippy cup holders are perfect and they can even hold juice boxes for when my daughter masters using a straw. The wagon is light weight in comparison to wagons of the same size. Easily fits two kids with LOTS of room to spare. The arms is extra long so you don't get your heels hit by the front edge of the wagon. It was also very easy to put together. I can see our growing family using this wagon for many years.

It's huge, basically as large as a whole bath tub.It maybe isn't the best size for pulling around a baby under a year old, and of course it isn't small enough for a baby to push around him or herself after learning to walk. It really is meant for carting around toddlers only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio Flyer Discovery Wagon...the minivan of wagons","review":"Got this wagon for my 5 year old son.

There are also cup holders that will hold either cans or boxes. Easy clean up just spray with garden hose. The rubber wheels make it easy to pull on all surfaces and give it an easy ride. It's large enough to hold 2 older children comfortably and if the children sit in train fashion it can fit up to 3. This is a must buy and a great investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeet!","review":"We absolutely love this wagon!

Amazon was the same price, but wanted $35.00 to ship it, plus sales tax. Where is the deal in that? I saved the $35 and will most likely never buy any big items from Amazon until they figure out a way to be competitive with their pricing.As for the wagon itself, my son loves it! There isn't anywhere he doesn't want to take it. With my SUV, it fits easily, and can actually be used to store stuff on the trip to the park, beach, etc. Being a little bit of a daredevil, he has already taken it down a few hils, and both survived without any injury. It also comes in handy around the yard, and doubles as a planter wagon for the garden.

Yes, there is anger and frustration. But the author's excellent prose elevate the stories beyond stereotype. He is compassionate without making these characters into martyrs of white America.Of course many will argue these stories are badly dated. And true, America has moved on (generally for the better) since the early 1950s. But it would be unfortunate to overlook these stories for this reason. Baldwin captures the essence of where American society has come from, and we can all learn from history.

His writing style is very drab and he introduces way to many characters in the book to the point you begin to just gloss over names as you realize no one matters, as there is no point to any of his stories.I cant describe other feelings as this book has left no impression on me what so ever and a better read if your looking for a bit of history and insight upon the inner workings of Wall Street tycoons is \\"When Genuis Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long Term Capital Management\\" by Roger Lowenstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liars and their wake...","review":"This book was a nice prelude to the 2008 disaster. It is unbelievable the complete disconnect between the financial institutions and their sense of responsibility to their clients.One of the clients they toyed with had 82 million invested with them. Exactly how much money to you need to have before someone on Wall Street actually values your patronage?!It was and still is a public sector without values and run on ego and competitive lust. Millions have suffered directly from these peoples' actions...people have loss their retirement, homes, jobs, everything. And some have even died early because of the stress. And why? So a few dozen self congratulating fools can buy $20 martinis confident in the knowledge that they will never come face to face with the people they hurt so grievously. I hope there is such a thing as Karma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete exaggeration of life on Wall Street","review":"If you want to believe all the myths you've heard about Wall Street, read this book. If you want to really learn about what sales and trades is like on the Street, read a more factual book, like \\"FIASCO.\\" I felt that Lewis did a lot of embellishing so he could sell more books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated, sensationalist.","review":"This book is tremendously overrated. Lewis' writing style, while amusing, is also quite amateurish. Plus he seems to have a major superiority complex - is he really the only honest guy on Wall Street? Puh-leease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, boring","review":"This book is terribly overhyped. Overall, it's a pitifully dry memoir of a man who never made it big on the street.I would recommend Rolfe & Troob's _Monkey_Business_ over this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was pure drivel.","review":"I read the comments of both the customers and critics and was excited when the book arived at my home. Then, after reading the book, I re-read the comments to see to see if they were perhaps talking about the same book I read. This was pure drivel. Read the back cover on the book...then multiply that drivel by 250 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored me to tears","review":"Got about a third of the way through it and couldn't take it any more. I was surprised because I liked some of his other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Probably, I misunderstood that I would learn something from this book about finance or markets in general and would be able to use these ideas to add to the bottom line - make more MONEY. But it seemed like my goal behind reading this (or any other) book was too clearly defined and this book did not help at all. If you have too much time, nothing to do, and are looking for something to pass time then read this. But if you want to achieve something such as gaining insight into trading, selecting, analyzing stocks or securities etc then do not waste your time. This book has no direction, no substance, and not much to learn from it which can be used to produce results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother if you are interested in learning","review":"I have to agree with the older gentlemen above. I am 28 years old and have pretty worthless IRA's and savings plans that I am trying to grow at a better rate. Before buying a book I like to read the good and bad reviews, and like most of the 1 star reviewers, I can't believe anyone gave this book 5 stars. I suppose from an investment point of view I would encourage the ignorant to waste their money chasing fast easy money, but for those who actually know or want to know more about investing and the workings of Wall Street, do yourself a favor and pass over this book. I don't know the average age of the readers of this book, but I am guessing that I must be older than most of them because even I can't help thinking this is a hollywood rendition of a \\"real life\\" experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty Expose of Wall Street Culture","review":"This a very funny and well-written account of Lewis' brief career as a Wall Street bond saleman in the mid to late 1980s. The culture at Salomon Brothers is, in essence, to set 250 junk-yard-dog trainees into the backyard over the winter and see who remains alive next spring. It's an ultra-competitive environment that encourages risk-taking, often at the expense of the customer. It also creates a weird kind of loyalty to the firm that chews you up, albeit one that pays ridiculous amounts of bonus money to twenty-somethings.Lewis captures the brutal politics and humor of this culture. To his surprise, he succeeds as bond salesman only to walk away from the rat-fight to become a journalist.Although dated, the book does capture some essential truths about Wall Street culture. The 2008 collapse does not seem surprising in light of this culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and informative","review":"The book is hilarious. It's still one of my favorite gifts for friends in school or starting out in the business. Some people don't like the middle of the book, which is a bit of a history lesson. But the history lesson is a good one and should be be compared to in the industry today for those who are in the business. The beginning and the end are hilarious"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wall Street Classic","review":"This book is a must for people interested in Wall St dealers. It's entertaining, but does not discuss anything in depth in terms of trading strategies. It's the story of John Merriweather, Lewis Ranieri and their crew...It gives a detailed account of who the top traders were at Soloman and where they ended up. The book is very good with describing the specific of individuals responsible for making Salomon the bond house of the 80s and 90s. This book describes how the mortgage market was invented by Lewis Ranieri who started out his career in the mail room"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this one!","review":"I have a hard time deciding 4 or 5 stars for this book. Lewis paints an enjoyable and informative picture of Wall Street and the London branch of Salomon Brothers, but takes a long hiatus in the middle chapters, delving into more history and neglecting his own experiences entirely. It's the (more) boring middle chapters that rehash Wall Street's history and cause a reader to lose interest.Lewis is at times funny, but this book is FICTION and loses some of its power when the author chooses pseudonyms or oblique references for real people in real situations. All in all, a good, easy read -- but don't expect a Salomon learning experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"good story","review":"It is a lot fun to read this book.

This insiders' look will make you giggle as you read about the antics of Wall Street while cringing with a sickening, sinking feeling that said antics shape our economy and likely our politics. Keep a pen handy and take notes as Lewis provides an apt description about the structure and movement of funds associated with the bond markets. Lewis occassionally hops on a high horse to issue judgement on his then colleagues, but they are typically spot on. Filled with outrageous characters that one will love to hate and bizarre personalities, this is a must read for any American wondering about the state of our economy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside look at how Wall Street functions","review":"An informative read.

Americans should be fighting this legalized larceny tooth and nail. We have such a short memory we cannot remember the damage done to our nation and the world by a small group of spoiled brats who just happen to be a little brighter than the rest of us. Wall Street needs more regulation, not less. As long as these clowns continue to operate in an unbridled manner we will have huge, divestating swings in our economy. Our silence is nothing more than tacit approval of their terrible ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Your Broker Your Friend?","review":"Nothing funny about this book..as some reviewers have tried to say.

I still haven't finished the book and I bought it over 6 months ago. It's just dry. If you've ever worked on the floor of an actual exchange this is like kissing your sister. I have a totally different view of trading in the 80's and institutional trading isn't it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"Speaking as a Los Angeles Economics student I found the book to be a highly entertaining, refreshingly interesting, delightful tour through the day-to-day activities of what was at one point the world's premier investment firm. Mr. Lewis provides a fascinating insider's look at the bond markets and the leveraged buyouts that made the period famous. Highly recommended for anyone tired of stultifying economics textbooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was excited when this book finally arrived. However, after reading 3/4 of the book, I felt the reviews were highly misleading. Lewis is by no means a highly gifted writer. This book is sloppy and disorganized. He throws around dates and names in random pages, which leads the reader out of the loop. Most of the names could have been left out and weren't important to the story. A brief synopsis of the story goes like this \\"Yah, we made a lot of money in the 1980s at Salomon Brothers\\". And for the a whole synopsis, reiterate that 100 times in a 100 different ways. I'm so disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true pespective on the in inside","review":"My son who is halfway through a business degree said to me the other day that he might get into the merchant banking scene when he graduates.

Everyone else has read it, so they will sprinkle their narratives with examples from it.2. Is funny, wonderfully engrossing biography of Lewis's life at the company Solman Brothers.3. You'll slice thru this book like a stick of warm butter. Just one of those books that you read in one or two sittings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping yet entertaining narrative","review":"Liar's Poker is a fascinating and fun account of the world of bond trading.

I read the entire book over two weekends; a difficult task for me because of poor reading speed and poor attention span. I generally do not like to read and find most of what I read a painful bore and highly unbeneficial. This book was an exception. This book gives us an interesting insight into Michael Lewis' real world experience, something we cannot get a real feel for in traditional textbooks. If it is not already, this book should be required reading for all MBA programs. Thank you, Mr. Lewis, for sharing your story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liar's Poker","review":"This book is an interesting, readable, easy to follow and informative book. It throws light on aspects of how the wall street works, this is very revealing for people like me who are not familiar with the inner functioning of that system, specially as concerned with human relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book from a great writer","review":"This is a very intriquiing bit of 80's economic history, especially as a backdrop to the more recent financial crises.

The videos didn't help much either. The video for We Fenced Other Gardens With the Bones of Our Own is unintetionally funny. It does have a few creepy images that show potential, but ridiculous segements, like a choreographed dance with brooms, ruin the mood. The Sex Boy video is a fairly amusing collage of images, but it can be found on their website. The final video is just as boring as the POS song it is set to.Buy the album or the far superior Fins To Make Us More Fishlike EP instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garden Theme Nursery....snails! snails! snails!","review":"I was so tickled to find a bedding set that had SNAILS on it :) It fits perfect with my garden theme nursery.

All of these individuals seem very tough, daring the camera to keep photographing them.

Another great book from a photographer who is quite different than the others. Enjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lmplausible","review":"I do beleive that Miss Knowlton was abused by her father..but as for claims regarding Elizabeth Short, I just can not believe it. There is no evidence and the lengthy murder description that she 'witnessed' was excessive and wholly implausible. The book is heavy on the gore and not much on anything regarding evidence. I consider myself well read on the subject having develeoped a fascination for the case in my teens and just can not digest anything this book has to offer. Also the 'deformed/infantile genitalia' is a popular misconception/urban myth, and in fact she could (and according to Red Manley-mind you that is only his word) have intercourse, but could never give birth or have a proper period, but other than that everything was of the norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incest Case Study","review":"This is a disturbing book, in many ways.People who are interested in the corrosive, poisonous effects of incest on its victims will find this book interesting, as will mental health professionals, particularly those people on both sides of the contentious debate about the validity of recovered early childhood memories.Black Dahlia students, look elsewhere. This book is not about the crime in which you are interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"believable??","review":"As I read this story, and the author accused more and more people of sexually abusing her, I had a really hard time believing what she said. Most accounts of Beth Short have been very specific on one point; she was sexually immature, her genitals weren't fully developed. Now, because of this woman's book, we are supposed to believe that, not only was the Black Dahlia a promiscous whore, but that her father was also Beth Short's baby's father? There was no evidence mentioned in the autopsy report of her having recently been pregnant. I find Janice Knowlton's book very graphic, and maybe she did see her father murder someone, but she hasn't proved to me that the person he murdered was Beth Short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evidence? What evidence?","review":"Having just read this book, I, too, had to put it down from time to time, but that was because of the astronomical use of cliches! Did neither Ms. Knowlton nor Mr. Newton have enough writing talent to use their own words? Also, we have photographic evidence of Janice spending the summers from 1948-1950 on an island in Casco Bay, Maine. There is no evidence cited throughout the book, and the tales woven about what Georgie did with Beth's body are so fantastic they are hard to believe. Even a lot of the family information she has is in error, aside from using aliases. Janice, and her book, are simply unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I, too, wish I could give it 0 stars","review":"This book is not worth reading. I rarely make a statement such as that, as I am a rabid fan of the printed page, but this book is simply awful. I also agree that it has no place in the non-fiction section. Anyone who has done basic reading on the murder of Beth Short will realize that this story has no basis in fact. And I find it very objectionable that the author exploited poor Beth Short in this way. ...... This book.....is merely reprehensible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring lies","review":"Whew! Talk about making up stories of repressed memories!?!? I really lost it when she also got involved in a Satanic Cult that apparently murdered hundreds of babies and no evidence was ever found.

Don't waste your time or money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Dahlia killer?","review":"When I first started reading this book, I was under the impression it was something of a factual account. As I read more and more I was disappointed to see that it was pretty much 100% speculation. I found myself actually rolling my eyes at times.I also found the book to be rather crude and vulgar. Like in one scene where \\"Daddy\\" asks her if she likes ... while raping her. Is this really necessary? It also tried way too hard to convince it's readers of it's validity, almost demanding, which made me suspicious.Since reading this book, I have been reading a little more into the actual murder case on the Web and have noticed that almost everywhere I have looked (including these reviews), Janice Knowlton has been there and has put in her two cents. Is she a survivor healing by telling her story or a media hungry opportunist? Too bad \\"Daddy\\" didn't kill someone more famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Heart Belongs to Daddy","review":"Spurious, opportunistic, vulgar and poorly written, this book is one of the poorest purposes to which paper has ever been put. The reasoning is idiotic, the ties to fact fragile to non-existent and the obvious need of the author to attract attention -- any attention at any cost -- make this a nausating read. The Black Dahlia case, a classic unsolved murder which has gripped imaginations for over 50 years, has generated any number of fabulous speculations, but none so ill-conceived as this piece of pure trash. Spare yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but hardly believable.","review":"Although the book was fascinating and quite interesting, I found it very hard to believe. The book talks about one of the most horrendous, unsolved murders of the 20th century with graphic detail but I find it hard to believe that if indeed the author's father was the killer of Elizabeth Short, wouldn't it have made headlines that the killer had \\"finally\\" been identified? For that reason alone, I found the book to be a good piece of fiction, but hardly anything more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope you burn in Hell Mr. Knowlton","review":"I completely believe in this book. Repressed memories are real and this woman was very brave to write this book. She tells us what really happened and if the police aren't looking into her story then they are the fools.This book was well written and kept me reading. It has the suspence of fiction and the reality of non-fiction.I would recomend this book to anyone interested in true crime. Keep an open mind and you'll find that this book has a lot of good information."},{"rating":"1","title":"How'd this thing get published, anyway?","review":"I just lost all respect for this publisher. There is no, I repeat NO, evidence that the ramblings of this pitiful woman have ANY basis in fact. Even worse, it's poorly written! Clearly there are some disturbed individuals involved in the production of this book. I kept getting the distinct feeling that these authors enjoyed writing those torture and mutilation scenes just a little bit too much. I tried to sell my copy at a yard sale for a dime. There were no takers. I suggest you save your money. There are too many GOOD TRUE crime books available to waste your time and money on this pornographic fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing/Lousy Read","review":"I read this book on recommendation of another person, without checking out anything on it prior to purchase. I feel like I wasted my time and money. The book was a lousy, jumbled read. The ideas were haphazardly thrown together to outline a poorly scripted idea (the Dahlia) surrounding the memories of surviving sex-abuse victim. While I have no doubt that Ms. Knowlton endured the abuse described within, it lended little to the story of the Black Dahlia. Both stories leave too many unanswered questions for the reader. The Dahlia tale is confused and befuddled amid a graphic and disturbing tale of abuse. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star to Many","review":"This book really doesn't deserve any stars at all. It shouldn't be listed as non-fiction because everything in it is unbelievable and must fall under the category of fiction. Ms. Knowlton does not offer one shred of proof for any of her accusations. It is all totally unsubstansiated and seems to be the product of a very sick mind. I would not recommend this book to anyone, it is sick and violent, completely disgusting. One of the most repulsive and unsettling ideas is the \\"blame the victim\\" slant. It was bad enough that Elizabeth Short was murdered in such a horrific way but almost worse is the character assassination and the idea that she deserved to die that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"EMPTY AS A JUNK FOOD SANDWICH","review":"A BUNCH OF BALONEY.

As a writer, Newton has an agenda. He's going to twist facts and even write fiction to make what should be news stories fit into his model of the world. The publisher was sued for unsubstantiated comments he made in the first edition of this particular book. The writing is amaturish and the point of view so heavy handed you have to wonder who he's trying to convince, the reader or himself. In this instance Newton takes a deluded woman and exploits her delusion. After \\"Raising Hell,\\" and \\"Hunting Humans Parts I, and II\\" it comes as no surprise. Newton is a writer who never lets the facts stand in the way of $5.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME","review":"Ms. Knowltons book is about as challenging as (and believeable) as the \\"Hollywood Babylon\\" books. Her imagination is very vivid, and to my taste, quite twisted and sick.

I was very disappointed. The author tells of the horrible crimes she witnessed by her father, but never could they find any evidence to substantiate her claims.

I have to say that this book was a waste of my time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lurid, ghoulish nonsense.","review":"\\"Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer\\" by Janice Knowlton is, at best, a tenuous and unconvincing bit of pop pyschology mixed with tabloid sensationalism; at its worst, it is lurid, ghoulish nonsense that causes the reader to feel defiled and exploited for even taking time to read it. If this isn't pornography, then pornography does not exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly implausible!","review":"This is the kind of story that casts doubt on the concept of repressed memories due to abuse. The accused killer in this case toted a body, severed at the waist, around in a duffle bad for several days, removing it, raping it, and even throwing it into a swimming pool without losing any entrails. Further there was an accusation of religious sex abuse... pretty much the kind of stuff you would expect to see on Jerry Springer. Unlikely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly, ghoulish garbage","review":"This disturbing diatribe by an aspiring actress clearly indicates that she is credible as a victim of extreme child abuse. Her \\"memories\\" of the Black Dahlia murder, however, are highly dubious...if her case were as strong as she claims, she wouldn't be relegated to this kind of pulp work that is so over-the-top disgusting that it is impossible to read. I found myself having to skip portions of graphic torture too heinous to digest. I cannot imagine any psychological adviser supporting this kind of \\"purge\\" and it is best avoided by any reader. Hopefully the author will find some more productive way to exorcise her demons."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe she reviewed her OWN book!!","review":"When so many people only rate a one star, someone may get so curious and buy the book just to see how bad it is.

Never before have I read such a thoroughly useless and perverse book. Not perverse in the content, but perverse in the motives of the author. Janic Knowlton's book is a a sick and blatant attempt to attain her 15 minutes of fame. Let me tell you, this woman deserves nothing less than what she got (to be dismissed and attacked by critics). The entire book seems to be an \\"Ode to why we all feel sorry for poor, poor Janice.\\" I can understand that she was a victim of her father's abuses, but to use the name of a horribly murdered young woman (for whatever reason) is simply appalling. I simply cannot offer enough criticism for this book. The author(s) take circumstancial evidence and claim that they've found the end all be all of solutions to the murder of Beth Short."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book extremely disturbing.","review":"I believe Ms.Knowelton was abused but I don't be- lieve her father committed the murder of Elizabeth Short. She believes there was a police cover up, but why? Her father, George had no money or power to buy his freedom to continue to kill. I also felt that there was just way too much detail on her sexual abuse. The alleged mutilations of dead babies was just too much. Instead of giving evidence to support her story she just attempted to poke holes in all the other theories and evidence.

This poor woman needed to believe that the abuse she suffered had to be connected to a greater evil. It simply doesn't make sense in connection with the case.

Knowlton writes that Elizabeth Short (The Black Dahlia) died at the hands of her abusive father, George Knowlton. Some parts of the book are great, some are plodding, but overall, this is just fictional.

I usually will finish a book of this size in one day. It took me over a week to finish this story. It also appeared that Janice wanted to use catchy phrases,throughout the book, that just backfired. I do belive Janice had the most horrible of childhoods, and did truely belive her daddy WAS the black dahlia killer. I pray Janice finds the peace in death that she never had in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HODGE-PODGE OF MAKE-BELIEVE","review":"This book was a disappointment. I am a true crime reader and found this to be nothing more than self-indulgence on the part of the subject, Janice Knowlton, and plain bad writing by Michael Newton who usually writes factual, good bite-sized takes on crime and criminals. I was bored and irritated with this book and finally trashed it. I suppose there is value as far as Knowlton sharing her past abuses, if they actually happened (I am a female who experienced sexual abuse by a brother), but in this case who cares and where does it lead? The 'recovered memory' theory has been done to death and certainly doesn't work here. The reader is advised to check out the book by John Gilmore, entitled SEVERED, which so far appears to be the only authentic nonfiction account on the Black Dahlia murder case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful fantasies of a very mentally ill woman","review":"This is a worthless book as regards the Black Dahlia case. It could serve as an example of the damaging effects of \\"recovered memories\\", that is, encouraging confabulation in someone already mentally ill. The author eventually committed suicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read at your own discretion","review":"I picked up this book because I have been interested in \\"The Black Dahlia\\" murder for many years. I fully regret the decission. I had only stopped having nightmares about my stillborn baby a few months before reading this horrible book and afterwards the nightmares came back. Ms. Knowlton obviously had a horrid childhood, that I don't disbelieve but everything she had to say about Beth Short and the allegation that her father murdered her is don't believe at all. I hope she gets help, no one should write such disgusting things about people I doubt they even met, let alone the all too graphic details on how her father \\"got rid\\" of the dead babies. It should be obvious Ms. Short was not killed by a blow to the head, just look at the morgue shots, no damage to her head at all. Now Ms.Knowlton is claiming sexual abuse by Gene Autry, who's next? Is no one safe? I'm just waiting for an allegation against the president any day now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to be believed. Rubbish.","review":"Ms. Knowlton has a vivid imagination, and has unfortunately, and successfully, cashed in on this tragedy more than other would-be experts. It appears that she has made quite a story that would have been a great novel based on fact, but was unwisely marketed as non-fiction. I do not believe in repressed memory, even though I also come from an abusive background. Please leave poor Beth Short alone. After reading this atrocity Ms. Knowlton has devised, I have had enough. This murder will never be solved; all participants are dead or silent. How dare Ms. Knowlton attempt, years after the crime, to further ruin Beth's reputation. Whether or not she WAS a whore is immaterial to the entire crime. It's over. Let the ghosts rest - finally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Horrible book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. The book is written poorly and the content is questionable. I read alot of true crime and this is the only one I truly disliked. It may not even be true crime and maybe should be labeled a fiction book."},{"rating":"1","title":"preposterous and irresponsible","review":"\\"Daddy\\" is really two books: Newton's somewhat careful research (and very flawed interpretation) of printed accounts, newspaper clippings and the like, with some dubious interviews; and absurd assertions by Knowlton. Fortunately, \\"recovered memories\\" have been discredited for the most part in the last few years but the careful reader or researcher should look at this as nothing more than a curiosity if at all. It's nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read It Only As Entertainment","review":"I've read other E Short books. If it tells you anything, this woman also has ES as turning tricks with Marilyn Monroe. Ok, so the tether to reality is weak. If you get off on reading vulgar fantasies this book is for you, but it's probably mostly pure fiction, with a few facts thrown in to mess you up. However, the author will probably work the sympathy angle do get her 15 minutes. Was this on NPR?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pity that one-star-rating was the lowest I could choose","review":"Reading literally hundreds of books a year, many of those true crime, seldom has a book made me this angry. Knowlton is one sad woman, slandering people who can't defend themselves anymore, offering not one shred of evidence supporting her preposterous stories, apparently to get some attention she never had but obviously needs, no matter what. What is worse is that this book has the danger of making me disbelieve any stories of suppressed childhood memories of abuse etc., which is what I really don't want to happen. If you want to read about the Black Dahlia case, read Gilmore's book 'Severed'. If you want to learn about the lengths sad, unstable women will go to, read this one. But I really wouldn't recommend it. Being a woman myself it makes me really really angry that women like this Knowlton person make sure emancipation will still be a long long way off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this book about anyway?","review":"I couldn't even finish it. It's not as much about Beth Short as it is about the author. I find it interesting that it came out after the accused was dead and couldn't defend himself.

Hostetter brings out a full range of emotions in the reader. I truly felt for the characters, especially the protagonist, Ann Fay. I could identify so well with Ann's insecurities just as much as I celebrated her triumphs. The author uses metaphor like a master painter would wield the paintbrush.

I love his way of explaining Christianity, of how he came to Christ in his 30s, and of how he reveals the Christian faith in his Narnia books. I was aware that he'd also written a \\"Space Trilogy\\", but had never picked them up, as I have been more interested in his apologetics. I ran across \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" at the library while looking for an entirely different book, and was so intrigued by the cover art (a man and a beaver-like creature in a canoe) I had to give it a try. The story revolves around a man named Ransom taken hostage to Malacandra, later revealed as Mars, and the races of beings he finds there. The story was interesting, touching, and (for me) contained passaged that really made me think about mankind and our 'place' in the universe.

The story itself is simple, yet like most of C.S. Lewis' work, it is allegorical. For most of the book, he maintains the perfect balance between traditional storytelling and telling his message. The subjects he deals with just below the surface of the plotline are the true gems here.Questions arise: what value judgement are we making when we believe the human race is the only one that should be entitled to the entire universe? Lewis, like Tolkien, was influenced greatly by WWII and it shows here. He questions the absurdity of armed conflict and analyzes it down to the simplest of levels, to the way a creature on Mars would view it. Although some may find the pacing a bit slow, I found it like savoring a fine wine- no reason to rush, and every reason to try to discern the subtleties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggled to get through it!","review":"I'm not an avid Sci-Fi reader but came with high expectations, CS Lewis being the writer of the Narnia series, which I read as a child, many, many years ago.I didn't enjoy this novel, with the exception, of Lewis' wonderful descriptive language. In particular, the way he describes the beauty of Malacandra is breathtaking.I thought I was reading something akin to the Planet of the Apes, but without the sense of foreboding that one feels when you watched the TV series version of the aforementioned. I was so tempted to put the novel down, but have a personal policy not to do that, and figured as it was only 150+ pages I'd grin and bear it.Yes, there is a message there about good vs evil and God, but I don't think it was that inspiring or significant.I'm sure my conclusions are heavily influenced by the fact that I don't typically read such novels.

I love sci-fi, and figured it was worth a try because I recognized the author. The story was excellent! After reading it, I found the rest of the series online. The second book in the series was great too, and the third was ok. I'd definately recommend the first two books of the series. However, reader be warned... there are hints of religion included in this series. So if you're looking for an exclusive sci-fi story, this one goes a step further. It's a great story regardless, and focuses on space travel, social interactions with aliens, and even a love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy","review":"Like trying to read stereo instructions.

The book imagines a Universe with intelligent life on planets other than Earth, where Earthly humans are the only fallen (sinful) creatures. Three travelers from Earth (Dr. Ransom, Dr. Weston and Dr. Devine ) visit one of these planets without sin, and the book explores the differences between the created before and after the fall. Is Lewis attempting to ascertain what the Creator had in mind for His creation? Maybe. Is he trying to portray what heaven may hold in the afterlife? Possibly. Regardless, the book is my favorite of the trilogy for its nice pace, rich characters and exploration into the mind of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"Unfortunately, I didn't find this very good.

I get that this film was supposed to be coming of age, sophisticated, and meaningful, but honestly, I just found it creepy.

The movie version is much shorter with less actual music.Rubberneckin'. Who doesn't like Elvis?

Otherwise, the battery loses cells and will not take a charge. This wasn't clear when I bought it. Although I charged it before storing over the winter (like it says on the actual battery), it was shot this spring when we went to charge it again.

The windshield cracked clean off. The seat adjusters lost their screws. And a bunch of other stuff.

It still looks brand new as far as color and wear but the parts are just not cutting it. It is an adorable ride-on that is for sure, but what good is looks if it's not of good quality? This is the first review I've written so didn't mean to get carried away but my recommendation is that if it's not Power Wheels brand, don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AVOID peg perego! Buy Power Wheels Brand!","review":"We aquired a power wheels ninja jeep from a neighbor(their daughter outgrew it) and it has been awesome! It's been through 3 kids and still going strong after many years. We thought we'd buy a new one for our youngest son, and he picked this John Deere jeep out at the store. We've never tried the peg perego brand before, but bought it anyway. We've only had it for about 2 weeks and things are falling off, gears don't work right, tailgate is sagging. Thank goodness we can still bring it back to the store and exchange it for a power wheels brand. We'll stick to what we know. AVOID PEG PEREGO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dangerous","review":"My daughter who is three and a half was riding in the passenger seat when the child driving abruptly turned and accelerated at the same time. My daughter fell out of the gater, no safety straps included in this like the jeep or trucks available. She has multiple abrasions on her face and knees. She cut the front of her lip and was therefore bleeding profusely. She is petrified to ride in the gator now and she is my daredevil. They need to install safety straps, slow it down, it is faster than the truck we have I don't care what the box says!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Ride-On's We Have Bought","review":"If you are concerned about this Ride On I say Don't be. We have got this for our son's second birthday and he loved it and so do we. He rides this everywhere in the grass and we took it to a dirt track, he has never had any problems with this at all. It is well worth the money, and it's tough my son has had a few bumps and no damage done. We have bought many Ride On's we have 5 children and we buy each of them one for there birthday and this was one of the best ones yet! Now the only problem is it's time to buy another for our son and have to find one that is just as good :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy the John Deere Gator Ride-on! ...","review":".... You cannot recharge the battery without having to dismantle the vehicle and my children would require it to be charged everyother day. So unless you have a lot of time on your hands I do not reccommend buying this vehicle. Also, the back drop gate is made very flimsey and after a couple of uses will not shut. I have another power Jeep and it can easily be recharged by opening the hood. This appears to be a design flaw!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointed","review":"We purchased two gators for my sons for christmas. One of them ran about three weeks before the gears broke and it would only go in reverse. Then the next day, the other one did the same thing. Luckily it was within the stores 90 day return policy so they both went right back. We were very reluctant to buy a peg-perego product because we purchased a gaucho grande two years ago and have had nothing but problems with it (the gears). But we were assured that was the exception and not the rule(by peg-perego customer service and toys-r-us sales person) Well with problems with all three and the later two only within a month of use I hardly think it is a coincedence.Also peg-perego didn't want to fix the problem after the warranty period even though it was the same peice breaking (over and over) while it was under warranty. My best advice better to be safe than sorry....stay away from peg-perego."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly what you'd expect from John Deere","review":"My son loves the look of this vehicle. The idea of having an area in back to put stuff in is great. One problem, the weight is not distributed right, so if you go up hills, even small ones,which it says it will do, your tires spin. It needs to be filled with heavy rocks in order to work. Also, the quality is not what you'd expect from the name John Deere, not even an hour after we had it out, a screw came loose just from the normal jarring of driving around. If we had a choice again, we would not purchase this vehicle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Toy EVER!!","review":"OH MY GOSH!!! This is the best money we have ever spent on a toy. We gave this to our 3 year old for his birthday and he has not stopped driving. He loves the different speeds and the trailer to \\"haul stuff\\". The look on his face when he is driving around the yard is priceless. I recommend this toy to anyone thinking of buying a battery powered vehicle for their child. The quality is unbeatable. It is larger than most battery operated vehicles, therefore giving more room for \\"passengers\\". It also seems a little safer to me because of the size. My only other recommendation for anyone thinking of buying this toy is to BUY AN EXTRA BATTERY!!! I am going today to buy another so that we do not have to wait for it to charge if we forget to take it out the evening before. Again, this is the best toy we have ever purchased for our son. I am becoming a HUGE fan of Peg Perego (we have two other peg perego vehicles)."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY SAFE, FUN TOY","review":"My son drives his truck every day. He follows our real John Deere tractor around and loves to pick up the toys from the yard and put them in the bed of the truck. To those who have written reviews about children falling out - they must be too young for this. Any child smart enough to sit still when told is more than safe in this. My son (4) was told that if he didn't follow the safety rules - no driving. It hasn't been a problem. HE LOVES THIS TOY. It was well worth the money. I'd recommend it to anyone with a yard and a kid who loves the outdoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good....not very durable","review":"We chose the John Deere Gator because it sure looked better than the Power Wheels Jeep. We had the Gator 1 week and parts began to fall off and it quit working in 2nd speed. Not happy at all with this product. Should have gone with the Power Wheels. Big lesson learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid little machine","review":"I got this for my son 1 year ago when he was 4. He LOVES it. It's a great product and theres no comparison to the power wheels jeep we have. It has bigger motors(2), bigger battery, and is just engineered to a much higher standard. Just last weekend my son was hauling a 13 year old around the yard in it! We've used it to haul gravel, etc. It's been a solid little machine.I have read the odd review where people complained of battery life: this is not a reflection of the product - one MUST follow proper charging/recharging procedures. These same people probably had probelms with battery life in their cordless and mobile phones :) We get several hours of off road use out 1 charge. I'm a bit of a hobbyist (electric RC monster trucks, electric go-karts, etc), and I've learned that the \\"hotter\\" the set-up (like the gator is vs the power wheel), the less forgiving battery care becomes. Follow the gators guidelines and you should have no problems with battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"replacement tires very expensive","review":"I bought this a year ago for my son. He absolutly loves it.However!!! Do not buy this unless you are prepared to replacethe tires frequently with normal street/driveway use. Peg Perego will replace the tires at no charge ONE time during the warranty period. After that, YOU PAY DEARLY. A set of fronttires with postage will run you $45, a set of four will run you $85. Unbelievable!!! I cannot comprehend how they cannot come up with a better tire design. The problem is that the front tires toe in and wear really fast on the inside of the tire eventually creating holes in the tires. The tread is gone in about two weeks. This will probably end up in a future garage sale and we will probably buy something else with solid tires."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids loved it!","review":"Despite some reviews to the contrary, my kids (who are not real easy on their toys) have really enjoyed the Gator. We've had it almost three years, and it's still going strong. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son doesn't want to part with his Great Green machine","review":"I bought this 3 years ago for my then 4-yr old daughter and it is now being used by my 3-year old son. This gator is amazing and I have never had any major trouble with it. The only thing I had to fix was some loose screws holding the bed together. The kids absolutely love it. It has 2 fwd speeds (can be locked at the lower speed until your child gets familiar with driving it) - the #2 speed @5MPH is a lot of fun for him. The neighbors' kids want to ride it since their Jeeps or whatever are comparatively slow. Need to charge a long time initially (overnight) but after that a good 2-4 hour charge gets it going for about 45 mins of continuous riding. Just remember to plug it in and keep the battery charged always - increases battery life - I haven't changed mine for 3+ years now. Excellent quality and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing we ever bought","review":"We bought this 2 years ago and our son, then 3 was very excited.

Although frequently criticised in Spanish literary cliques, the very particular sense of humour and recurring style of Marias is captivating. Having a kind of film noir story background, Marias creates a set of curiously charming characters that develop through a catching story line. Special mention to a superb scene that features the king of Spain, Juan Carlos I, unfortunately not at the reach of non-Spaniard readers. Do not miss it, especially if you can read the original Spanish prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sin soltarla hasta el final","review":"Novela a la que uno se prende sin soltar hasta llegar al final.

Since it is intended to be a book to be used as described it is incomplete as a functional analysis book. Now the mortal sin: the author presents spectral theory using projection operators.This is fine. However to neglect the conection with the continuos spectrum will surely repel the intended audience.

This crime was especially shocking because they were students at Yale, and Bonnie came from a upper-class family and a nice community. The crime was brutal, (he smashed her skull with a hammer) and in my opinion, Richard Herrin should have recieved life in prison for the murder. Because this was a \\"high society, high profile\\" case he got much less. A good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Up close and personal","review":"I've known Mr. Herrin since 1996 when he came to work for me soon after his release from prison.

The book is fascinating as is Richard's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what it says on the cover","review":"A down-to-earth book that does exactly what it says on the cover: it shows you how to take pictures of cars.

Detail shots? Check. Group shots? Check. Gadget shots? Check. People shots? Check. All the little secrets, all the cool tricks? Check.Cool cars?

I then realized I was looking for some grand revelation. I started over and found that there was a lot of cleaver and less obvious information. What I found of most value was advise on composition, \\"cars look lousy on grass, so aviod it\\", use unclucluttered and uninterrupted surfaces and back grounds for example. The use of thirds in combination with the above advice is shown well with pictures on page 30 and 42.

However, I don't like it at all. One reason is, admittedly, personal. It has rounded ends rather than being a perfect rectangle. Consequently, pieces of food get between it and the stove, next to which I put my cutting board. But, more importantly, it is very slippery due to its smooth finish. My knife slips and I have problems using my chef's knife to pick up pieces of, e.g., chopped garlic.

I found myself reading and re-reading not a few portions of the text to try to understand the terminology, but even with descriptive drawings I found it unintelligible on many points. The only way to understand what Tillyard describes would be to have an expert demonstrate on a real life specimen. I gave it a three stars for its wealth of information, but only that because it left me shaking my head and wanting to put the book down every time I dove into it to attempt another go of it.

Comes with a good travel case although it does not fit the cord which is needed to charge when on the road. Holds a pretty good charge, needed to charge it twice on a recent three week trip. Best electric shaver that I have used."},{"rating":"2","title":"never use a blade again","review":"I shaved with blades for as long as I can remember. I always had to go at least 3-4 days in between shaving if I could to avoid getting torn to shreds on my neck. I bought this razor 3 weeks ago, and have had the best shaves of my life each time I use it (every other day). It is perfect! Using Lectric Shave makes it even better. And I'll spend less on this unit and any replacement cleaners than I would replacement blades in a year.

This is the first time in 40 years I have submitted a written complaint about a product which I have purchased.I must say , however, that I am keenly disappointed with my Braun 8585.It does not provide me with a clean or a close shave.Its performance is only very marginally better than my Norelco which has languished in my top drawer for more than 20 years.I am wondering whether the liquid cleaning \\"device\\" of the Braun is not just a gimmick--- messy, cumbersome and quite expensive to use.I sincerely apolgise for these negative comments but trust nevertheless that you will find them helpful.Respectfully submitted, Eric Sorensen, Minneapolis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Close Enough","review":"This shaver cleans very easily, looks nice and keeps your sink clean. However, it just doesn't cut close enough for me, particularly on the throat area. I have never found an electric razor that even got anywhere near as close as a blade and this is no exception. I could get it pretty damn close on my face by repeatedly jamming the razor against my face, but it would take a long time to do this. As far as the hair on my throat, there was no way at all to cut that anywhere near as close as I would have wanted. This might be the best of the few electric shavers that I tried, but still disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as My 10 Year Old Remington","review":"I purchased the Braun several months ago and last weekend I packed my old Remington 3 head and went hunting.

(the cleaning solution I mean)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another favorable review","review":"I'll try not to be redundant, as most of all the glowing feedback on display I agree with 100%. I'll add that I have the enviable honor of having sensitive skin, along with bullet proof stubble. It's always been difficult to shave every day because of my beard being pretty thick. Since a close shave irritated my skin with most razers, I would have to wait 2 - 3 days for a close and comfortable shave. More than likely it's the newfangled foil, but I can shave every day now if I choose and not have irritated skin, and/or a 12 o'clock shadow. The cleaning system is also handy for those of you lazy like me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shaver","review":"This is my second Activator shaving system; I had one of the original models and it didn't survive a 1,000 mile move, so I purchased this one last year. I've tried many high end electric shavers over the years, and I've found that none of them work nearly as well as Braun shavers, and this one is no exception. The self cleaning system is really nice, and it does do a good job of cleaning the razor provided you use it daily. A refill lasts about a month for me, with daily use. You can buy 12-packs of the refills here on Amazon, so I only worry about it once a year. I find that I have to replace the foil and blade yearly as well... so in January I buy it all in one shot and forget about it until next year. I've been looking for an excuse to upgrade to one of the new models, but the thing works so well and hasn't had any issues, so I really can't find one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great razor","review":"Had one before which I dropped on a tile floor and could not repair.

Looked at the top of the line Panasonic, Norelco, and Braun. After much deliberating and review reading, I went with the Braun.The 8585 is mechanically very nice and the base/cleaning system works very well.This said, after 2.5 weeks of use with the shaver (the recommended 'break-in time'), I feel that results are spotty. Generally it takes some effort and time to get a truly even looking cut. Even at it's best, the appearance is generally that of a second day cut with a Mach 3.I haven't returned this yet, but I'm seriously considering it. $165.00 + the cleaner cartridges is very expensive for a device that doesn't provide an all-together great shave every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Better Experience","review":"This is my first electric shaver, so I can't say how it compares to others. However, I have to say that shaving as an experience is much better with the Braun Activator than with a traditional razor (I was using the Mach3). I'm just happy to be done with the mess of shaving cream and the cuts on my neck. There are still a few spots that don't get cut very close (particularly below/under the jaw) but I'm quite satisfied overall (especially since these spots were tough with the Mach3)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruan 8585","review":"Braun 8585 Activator Self-Cleaning Shaving SystemBought this Shaver for a Christmas Gift.My husband says:Best electric shaver he ever had better than Norelco or Remington has owned both.Comes with a nice travel case could be bit bigger.Gives a close and comfortable shave.Overall a great shaver.Braun 8585 Activator Self-Cleaning Shaving SystemI would recommend this shaver as a self purchase or gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Close, Clean Healthy Shave in Five Minutes","review":"I purchased this razor for my husband last year for Christmas.

Although he fought with me every step of the way, he finaly caved and tried it. After a few days he was hooked! He gets a super-close shave in half the time and the *huge* bonus, no more ingrown hairs. If you hae sensitive skin or know someone who does, this is the model for them. The self-cleaning option is wonderful and a big key to the success. I highly recommend this model, so much so, I picked one up for my father-in-law this Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Rocks","review":"I love this shaver. I get a great shave quickly and comfortably. For my face, Braun has the best blade technology of anyone. I was very skeptical about the self-cleaning aspect and, in fact, it is the reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5. I like the idea but I don't like the cleaning fluid they provide. I have no idea what it is made of (smells like a petroleum product) and I'm not keen on the idea of putting anything on my skin that I wouldn't put inside my body. After all, our skin is our largest organ and it does absorb. I also don't like the idea of throwing those cleaning cartridges in a landfill over and over again. So, I've decided to create my own cleaning fluid using all natural, organic ingredients and just refill the original cartridge when needed. Overall, I am happy with the razor and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Electric Shaver","review":"I bought this to replace my Remington Microscreen 2 and my Gilette Mach III.

I paid over $150.00 for this junker and Braun gives no way to contact them on their WEB site. Have 2 much older (non-cleaning) Braun shavers and both work just fine.

It's really not worth the $150 it's going for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent shaver","review":"I've been using my old Norelco shaver for the past 5 years. I didn't like it because my skin on my face would get irritated after every shave that I literally would go on for several days in between each shave. It also did not shave as close as I would like. To keep the blade decent, I had to clean it on regular basis and it too was a hassle. My wife just bought me the 8585 shaver for a Father's day gift. I was skeptical at first and the price was a bit higher than what I would like to spend. But after my first and second shave with it, the only word I can truly express is \\"WOW\\". This shaver is excellent. It shaved as close as a blade with no irritation. I read of some reviewers complaint of not able to get a close shave around the base of the neck area. I found that by merely turning the shaver to angle it, I was able to shave the base of the neck area just fine. The self cleaning system is great. I no longer have to worry about taking the shaver apart to clean it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shaver","review":"I have had it for a couple of weeks now. I have used Norelco and Remington shavers in the past as well as the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo. I can honestly say the shave is as close as a blade. However, there is no mess.

I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Electric Razor I've Ever Used","review":"Have always had trouble getting a really clean shave with electric razors - especially the neck - especially if I skip shaving for a day or two (which I sometimes do on weekends). With this razor, no problems at all, the shave is really superior. It catches hairs other electrics miss. The self cleaning thing is a little over the top for my taste. I'd prefer a less imposing stand with a smaller foodprint and more subtle lights, but hey, it works! Altogether a terrific upgrade on my old Braun, and in another universe compared to my (very) old Norelco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Cleaning System","review":"The razor isn't bad, but the cleaning system is a joke. Mine wouldn't release the razor & kept recleaning it. Plus, and I am surprised that this isn't mentioned in the other reviews that I read before getting the razor, the cleaning solution (which is an expensive, printer-ink type of gimmick) stinks like metal solvent. Bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome buy!","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my father in 2004 and it worked like a charm for 6 years without any problems at all! He loved it, and wants another one this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Cleaner Broke","review":"The shaver is fantastic, as most of the reviewers agree. However, after two months of gentle use, the cleaning stand stopped working. Braun is telling me to send it to a repair shop but, as luck would have it, I can't find my receipt so I can't get it repaired under warrantee. Even if I could find the receipt, I would have to send the stand in at my expense.I bought this shaver because I felt I would be buying quality. I am a product designer by profession and I feel that this product is not worth the money, especially in light of their repair policy. If they were to stand behind their products, I would be fine with this failure, but, as it stands, I regret buying this shaver and I doubt I will purchase anything else from Braun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the features but","review":"Love all the features but this shaver doesnt cut as close as I thought it would. I donot get a close shave. maybe the cutters are dull or something but my experience is not a positive one. On the other hand the self clean features and recharge stand are great. It really cleans the shaver well for a no maintenance shaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overengineering - Expensive and Lousy Shave!","review":"I agree with several reviewers that this cleaning unit is really a lot of hype and overengineering. At the time, I did not realize I would be buying replacement cartridges every 1-2 months. Cleaning shaver stubble from my rotary shavers for >10 years has never really been a big deal. We have far more unpleasurable waste that we deal with everyday. Hey, we're human!As far as the shaver, it cannot do a good job on the neck if you have a thick new beard every morning. I am of Italian descent so take that for \\"whaddits\\" worth. As a test, I used my very old Norelco rotary on half my face and it blew away the Braun in direct comparison. Maybe there are foil shavers out there that are equal to rotary shavers, but this one turned me off completely to foil shavers.P.S.- I personally felt this product needed to be bashed. I am even disappointed with Costco for carrying this product in their limited selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best shaver on the market!","review":"Razors will get you the closest shave available. But they constantly cut and make my face break out. . .plus the cost of replacing the blades is up there. About a year ago I tried a triple-foil shaver, which hurt my face more than razors do. So I returned that on the quality guarantee and purchsed a Braun 7526. This was the best electric shaver I'd ever used. It cut close and fast, and everytime I cleaned it, it was like starting with a brand new unit. I recently upgraded to the new 8585 - mainly to try the new foil design. This one is even better than the previous!Some of the differences are:* Feels lighter* With the new foil design, it glides over my face and requires far fewer passes to get the job done* The charger/cleaner base is half the size of the previous* Comes with a handy hard case - instead of the leather/material of the 7526I highly recommend this shaver!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed too many hairs","review":"I really wanted to like this razor. Nice engineering, a clean comfortable shave, not too loud. Unfortunately, it just missed too many little hairs. I don't think my beard is any thicker than normal, but some of the hairs can curl under a little especially on my neck. Despite the nifty screen design, the razor just couldn't pick them all up no matter how many times I went over the darn things.Anyway, my advice: If you've had good luck with other electric razors and can afford the price tag, go ahead and buy it, you probably won't be disappointed. However, if you've had trouble with other electrics missing individual hairs, then you may want to stick with a blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this from Amazon.","review":"I hated the product and amazon doesn't take it back as they say it contains alcohol and so it can't be shipped back to them.

This may or may not be true of past electric razors, but I'm hear to tell you this Braun Activator 8585 is one fantastic razor. Now I'm not going to say the shave is as close as my old Mach 3 is, but it is pretty darn close. I have found that my face is actually less irritated with the Braun than when shaving with a blade, all with out having to clean up the shaving gel and stubble from the bathroom sink. I can honestly say I will not be returning to a razor blade again. I am officially a Braun 8585 Activator man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I found the shaver to be overated. After years of using a Norelco triple header, I thought of trying a Braun and found it to be difficult to achieve a good shave. The Norelco was far superior.

Which is another expense, the cleaning fluid only lasts for about a month and needs to be replaced, even if not used, it evaporates. I would not recomend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun Activator, a poor quality razor","review":"Have owned a Braun Activator razor for less than 1 year, and have gone through 3 foils that have torn during normal use. You simply cannot replace just the foil, but you have to buy the entire shaving block along with the foil which gets expensive. During use, this razor did not give a close shave as advertised. I spent twice as much time shaving with the Braun than I did with my old Norelco just to get a half way decent shave. Nicks and cuts were commonplace which I found amazing with an electric shaver!

The only even slightly redeeming feature is Florian Bartholomäi in the lead role as Karsten.

I can't believe he'd ever have looked twice at a shallow jerk like Steven if he hadn't been the first man who ever paid attention to him.

The poems in this book all seem to have been written by a poet with a tin ear, with no regard for nuance or understatement. He hits the same notes repeatedly and uses the exact same style in every poem in the book, and seems desperate to be clever in a really transparent way. But it doesn't work. There is no variety of concerns, and a notable lack of elegance or even real meaning. This is apparently the product of an arrogant but misguided poet striving to be ambitious and different, but what we really have here is more of the status quo, rendered in a syrupy style that is sickening after a while. Maybe this is the stuff that sells.

Looking for some good emerging poets to add to your repertoire? There are lots of choices out there in poetryland, if you want great experimental verse that is bold and risk taking and changes your notion of what poetry is all about. This poet uses phrases that are downright embarrassing, so much so that you will find yourself suppresing giggles, and his so-called poetic language is contrived and strained for, not clever.

Also, it has been done much better by far more gifted poetic masters, young and old, so the humor/irony aspect can only go so far here.

I am on Lipitor and was warned that guggul, however effective it might be on its own, will at certain dosages reduce or negate the efficacy of the statin drugs.

This is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FISKARS 9668 STEEL SHOVEL","review":"Previous to purchasing this Fiskars shovel, I've never been particularly impressed by shovels or other garden tools. But this is absolutely THE BEST shovel I have ever used for general digging in the yard, transplanting shrubs, etc. The steel handle welded to a heavy blade makes it easy to slice through roots, dig under plants and pry them loose. Take note this is a heavyweight digging shovel.... It might not be comfortable when used for unloading or pitching dirt, sand, etc. No more broken fiberglass and wooden shovel handles for me!!!!! Amazon provided very quick FREE SHIPPING via UPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked good but kept arriving damaged.","review":"This shovel looked nice and the reviews were nice so I ordered. When it arrived the shovel blade had a box around it that seemed to have a hole at the end. This was put inside a much larger box. When I unwrapped the shovel I noticed the tip was damaged and looked like it had been smashed into some rocks before they sent it to me. I did an Amazon exchange and the second one arrived with just a smashed up box around the blade of the shovel. This one was even more damaged than the first shovel; this time the handle was all scratched and scuffed as well. I gave up and just returned the shovel and got my money back. I'll buy one from a local store instead since Amazon hasn't figured out how to ship them yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Best Shovel in the World\\" Indeed!","review":"I love this shovel. I have used (and broken) many shovels. This shovel is awesome. I have already used it to dig out a septic tank, bury a cat , remove two tree stumps, and fill in misc. holes in my yard. It bites into the dirt nicely, the stepping platform is great. The length is wonderful when the holes get a little deeper. Best of all, it doesn't even threaten to break when levering out stubborn objects. I whole-heartedly recommend this shovel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid shovel","review":"These shovels are solidly built but they are very heavy.

Live on a ranch and use my shovel almost everyday, irrigating, digging up brush, gardening, etc. Have to replace lesser shovels fairly often, this one is going to change that. Every farm and ranch should have at least one. Great workmanship, comfortable handle, step is man-sized, and no worry about breaking the handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only steel-handled long digging shovel out there","review":"On my 4th one of these in about 8 years. As one reviewer notes, they're not pry bars. I used them that way on tough roots and after a while predictably they cracked at a weak spot where the blade welds to the handle. Lowes replaced them no problem, but of course Lowes doesn't carry this shovel anymore. So it goes. But with the steel handle and sharpened blade this dude will work and work and work. If you can find it locally at Sears or HD you'd probably be better off, but regardless this is one bad-axe digger. Could probably shove it under a tire of a Smart car and use it as a jack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Lasting","review":"Solid steel construction makes it a bit heavier than other shovels, but this thing will last a lifetime.

The foot ledge is perfect for digging in stubborn soils."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Shovel","review":"This is a pretty sweet shovel. Basically built like a sturdy trenching shovel, only full sized. Steel handle makes it a little heavier when compared to a wooden handled one when comparing with one in each hand. I don't notice the weight when in use. The large step area makes digging barefoot possible, with semisoft or moist dirt. Handle was different than expected. It's described as a teardrop shape, but I disagree. When you're holding it in the traditional, digging and scooping, way I'd call it an upside down teardrop shape. It feels really good in the hand.Hope you get a chance to try one out someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shovel","review":"This shovel is heavy and works great for around the house chores.

The handle itself is pretty thick. The spade appears to be good. The weak point is where the spade connects to the handle. If you read other reviews, this is a problem for a few people. Regarding the scratches and messed up paint, I know the reason but my attempt to let people know why has been removed twice by the people at who are monitoring the comments. So unfortunately, I can't put the reason here. But I am returning the shovel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"First, i want to say this is first time I've written a negative review on Amazon. I'm very disapponted with this order. I wanted to call Amazon but couldn't locate a phone number. I ordered a fiskars shovel based on product reputation. The description states its 100% steel and the picture has the name fiskars on the handle. I received the shovel promptly;however, the product is not as described. The name Fiskars is not on the handle it's Bully Tools and it's fiberglass not steel. This is not what I ordered. This is total misreputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from Fiskars","review":"We have other Fiskars products...mostly scissors and loppers etc. Figured the shovel would be just as good. Not so!! We were digging out small roots and the handle just bent way back. Now it's only good for scooping up dog poop. Guarantee? Sure. But who saved the receipt? Now we're stuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best shovel ever","review":"I've gone through a number of shovels in the past 35 years and this one is the best. Most shovels last me about two years then the handle breaks. I had a Fiskars Long Handle Digging Shovel for 4 years before the handle finally bent from my trying to pry tree roots out of the ground. Other shovels would have broken long before this one did. So I sought a second one. BTW when I received the new shovel it had a toll free number for a life time replacement for any shovel that breaks. I called the number and they replaced my broken one for free. I now have two which is OK with me. Now I have one for home and one for work. Oh and I did win the war with the tree root before the shovel handle broke."},{"rating":"2","title":"I broke it. But they're honoring their lifetime warranty!","review":"After having broken maybe 6 wooden or fiberglass-handle shovels, I have acquired the \\"wisdom\\" that you get what you pay for. I admit, I used it to pry out a tree stump, so it's my fault, but this product first bent along the shaft, and then ultimately sheared and broke near the weld. That said, it has been the best shovel I've owned, and even if it didn't come with a warranty, I would probably go back and buy the same thing. Now for the amazing part...I called up their customer service, and within 3 minutes, they had my shipping information and told me they are sending me a brand new one! They didn't even want the old one back. Wow! I am now a huge fan of this brand and will be replacing my other tools with Fiskars, which all seem to be well-designed, built, and come with a lifetime warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to break the world's best shovel","review":"This shovel is a pleasure to use, and both the handle and the blade seem to be unbreakable. The weak point is the weld between them. There is a long weld between the very end of the handle and the curve of the blade, and a short weld between the handle and the step. The quality of this weld varies from shovel to shovel, and on mine, it was unusually small. After a couple years of heavy use, I was prying a piece of buried wood and it snapped. The shovel kept working fine for another two years, and then, when I was prying some roots, the long weld started to break. And yet, if I'm careful, the shovel still digs! If you want to pass this tool on to your grandchildren, my advice is to never pull UP on the handle while the blade is wedged under something."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must-Have\\" for the Serious Scrimshaw Collector!","review":"This is an easy-to-read and easy-to-reference book which lists many of the more common reproductions of outstanding scrimshaw work.

Greasy good luck, mates!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Emotional At Times !! ... But Awsome !!!","review":"I had to think for a few days before getting this one. Just becasuse im more of a romance comedy type of person. Usually watching anime's like this...that have a sad story too them...usually make me think of what could have been or something like that. (so yes i do get into it deeply). But after watching it, I was so glad I got to add it too my collection. And plus since I met one of the voice actors for one of the characters at animefest....I had a good reason too get her autograph on a picture of the character i had printed out on photocopy paper, (too make the pic look nicer) . But yes i recommend this too anyone who likes drama and pain big time. As in.... you like too see shows that will make you cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad At All......","review":"Well, what can a say? I wasn't expecting this series to impress me but I was really surprised with it. It's a really good story of friendship and growing up. The one thing I really liked was the way the hero is taken care of by a girl that has real feelings for him but really wants him to accept her for herself. He comes across as a guy who really doesn't know where he's going. His first \\"affair\\" is with a girlfriend of the girl who secretly likes him. (This girl has as crush on him.) His secret \\"lover\\" almost pushes him into the affair and he just \\"goes with the flow\\". What makes this interesting is you aren't told about her feelings until after his first girlfriend is in an accident and she does what's needed to jar him out of it. That's really the one thing that bugged me. You find yourself almost yelling at the screen for the guy to wake up. Anyway, this is a really good series and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"I must warn you this one is not for the weak of heart. Its just so sad that its one of the most beautiful masterpieces I have ever seen. If you want to see it just be prepared to cry a few times. In my 19 years I have never seen a pice of footage that made me cry. Some others have gotten close with that feeling of pain in my throat and made my eyes water, but this is the only film that has ever made me sniff and made tears roll down down my cheeks. So therefore I declare it one of the most beautiful works of art one can ever see. I would recommend watching the sub in said of the dub; because wile the sub is the literal word for word translation the dub has been edited form that to the point where it prevents the story from reaching its full impact. Also The japanese voice actors put much much more emotion into the film than the english actors did. So please see it, you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This anime was so retarded. A whole bunch of stuff was happening and he ended up with the blue haired girl!

I don't know what others are talking about when they say this anime series is GREAT because it's not and here's why:The BAD:The English voice over was horrible. The characters had little to no personality. The *atmosphere was boring/everything took place in the same three areas. If you are someone who likes there to be more to an anime series then just a storyline, then this series is DEF. not for you. And the COMEDY parts (which dragged on in each episode) were ridiculous/not funny at all. This made the series confusing because there were \\"comical\\" parts and then dramatic/serious parts and both didn't go well together (in THIS series). I didn't even connect at all to the \\"emotional\\" parts, and that is rare for me.The GOOD:The main theme song is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What a disappointment\\"","review":"My father bought this DVD and said that it is 75% commentary and critical review and only 25% music.While the person was talking, the music was playing in the background but you can hardly hear it.He really wanted to hear music and see a performance but got too much talking.

My advice dont bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste","review":"If there was a zero star review rating, this DVD would deserve it. I bought this because I wanted to see the \\"Dick Cavett Meets ABBA\\" videos. First, none of the videos are shown in their entirity.

Because most people don't know their actual first single \\"Makes no Diffrence\\", off of HHOP, \\"Fat Lip\\" was catchy, powerful, and, well, word spread of the geeky Canadians who know rock. Then In Too Deep came out, giving lots of girls a song to like, cause it's a LOT lighter....and...well, more POPPY, but there is an awesome guitar solo for the guys. Plus, other songs, (non-singles) like \\"Heart Attack\\"(my personal fav), all have diffrent feels to them. And let's not forget the 80's metal anthem at the end, \\"PAIN FOR PELASURE\\"! So, all in all, this CD kicks major ass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloned","review":"Dreadful. This band sounds exactly like Blink 182, the same manufactured sound in the processed vocals and riffs. Just think of the vocals of the guy in Blink 182's 'All the small things'.That vocal just hides the raw sound that im used to with punk, and the guy uses that same sound all way through the album.They shouldn't consider themselves a punk band - they're not raw, they're done already, they are clones and seem to have an idea that if they can clone another band's sound they'll piggyback onto it's success by using the same formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sum 41 is not Punk...It's JUNK","review":"The only reason why I gave this bad CD 2 stars is because Sum 41 play their own instruments, so I give them that much. The lyrics are so bad, espically in \\"Fat Lip\\" where is says that he doesn't want to become a victim of conformity, when the \\"Fat Lip\\" video (which is horrendus) plays on MTV, so the singer is a hyprocrite. If you are looking for a good punk band, try listening to New Found Glory, Godsmack, Alien Ant Farm, or even Blink 182's old school stuff. Just don't listen to All Junk...No Punk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost worse than you can imagine!","review":"I've hated this band since I first heard them, back when I thought they were just another annoying pop punk band. Then, I found out that in addition to that, they also rap. Okay, my appreciation drops a bit. Then, I find out that they have a sarcastic track slagging off 80's metal (back when metal was metal!). That was the straw that broke the camel's back. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst bands on the face of the planet. They take everything I hate about mainstream music, and combine it. And, they insult the music I love. It's like they're somehow making music for the sole purpose of making me angry. Listen up, Sum 41.

If you try to live your teenage life past your teenage years, you will face one failure after another and then become miserable and envious of other people's successes.

When people my age ask me today why I don't like Sum 41 I reply: \\"Because they're punk posers and do pop.\\" And their faces are so confused. It's because most people don't know what real punk is. Today the only \\"punk\\" music are posers like Sum 41 and Blink 182 that actually make pop music. When you think about it, there aren't even many BANDS today that you can consider ROCK.

Sum 41 sings to pleasant pop tunes that they like making fun of people, they don't want to wake up, they have no motivation, and they are mad at their parents for making them do homework.This is good music for all the early teenagers who are in \\"rebellion\\" against their parents...Furthermore this album is about 40 minutes long.....all the songs sound the same and the longest song is 3:02 minutes and there is nary a guitar solo in the entire Cd. Oh Well....I'm sure that they will fade into obscurity within the decade.Anyways...I'm not a complete pop-punk hater...the self titled Blink 182 album wasn't that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"feh","review":"formulaic inane drivel, yet another step in the wrong direction for the music world. i hear groups like this on \\"rock shows\\" on mtv or the radio. this is as far from rock as you can get without being celine dion. its punk. its not even good punk like punk used to be. its bad punk/rap that pains me to hear so very very many groups doing the same thing. its apparently the only thing that people can register as rock. if you want hard, go listen to some system of a down. they can actually write music as well, as opposed to this garbage. im moving to sweden, they still play music."},{"rating":"1","title":"getting old","review":"I think this young group is not reaching their full potential.

Their 2001 hit cd \\"All Killer No Filler\\" is all about getting into trouble, being an outcast, breaking up, and the definiton of growing up. This cd had a lot of sucsessful hits including \\"Fat Lip\\" \\"In too deep\\" \\"Motivation\\" and \\"Summer\\" which hit the charts in high places. Deryck , Jay , Steve , and Dave make up this unbelievable band, they got the bad boy but fun attitude thing going. This cd is no doubt the best cd i own.

Anyway you should buy this album if you like good music. FYI: pop people DON'T play their own instruments. This album has many ggod songs on it. I personally like Heart Attack, and Pain for Pleasure.

This is harmless, imitation rebellion of little consequence. If they like it, fine.Still, you wonder what a bunch of Canadian kids could possibilly have to say about California punk. (About as much as Vanilla Ice had to say about rap, I imagine). The band needs to get their own life, instead of trying to borrow someone else's and sell it.There's nothing wrong with asking yourself \\"Where did I go wrong?\\" when you hear it coming from you offspring's headphones. But hang in there. In a couple of months, he and every other kid with this one will be tryng to sell it back at the used CD section (to raise enough dough for the inevitable \\"Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hits\\" disc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This [is not good]","review":"I have kept hearing people saying this is a hard rock alblum. Well, this alblum [is not good]. Sum 41 are only posers, they wouldn't know what music is if it someone showed it to them in the dictionary. All the songs can be considered whiney. It seems that this is just like all the \\"rock music\\" that plays on MTV, its just a bunch of guys with hair that doesn't look like its been washed in a week, pissing and moaning about whatever comes to their minds.

Since when is it in style to be immature? The only good song on this album is Never Wake Up because there's less than a minute of torture. Plus, i wouldn't be so frustrated if thier fans would admit that Sum 41 is pop. Also, the cover is the stupidest cover i have ever seen. Enough of the hardcore crap. Saying that you are lazy ( MOTIVATION IS SUCH AN AGGRAVATION) does not make you rebellious in any way. Neither is saying that you enjoy amking fun of people ( CAUSE WE LIKE HAVING FUN AT OTHER PEOPLES EXPENSES) make you seem angry with the constraints of society. By the way, don't accuse of not hearing the CD. I own the monstrocity.

Their first effort, Half Hour Of Power, was good, but mediocre at the same time. When they recorded that album, they got together in the studio and played every song they knew. They were still learning how to play their instruments. All Killer No Filler shows how much they have progressed since then.The melodies on this album are sweet. They hook you by the ear and reel you in. With often comical lyrics, it is some great listening.One standout, of course, is Fat Lip. I am sure you have all heard it on the radio and know how good it is. It shows the versatility of the band. They turn to a sort of rapcore/hip-hoppin' melody. It is so sick!I also want to point out Never Wake Up. It is 3 minutes of hook-laden, melodically soaring music.Seriously check this album out. You will not, I repeat, will not regret it! Sick tunes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not At All Like Fat Lip","review":"For those of you who heard Fat Lip on the radio and decided to go out and buy this, like I did, think again. This CD sounds nothing like the energetic, awesomeness of Fat Lip. It sounds like some of the songs on Enema of The State by Blink 182 that I don't like to listen to. Do yourself a favor and just download the mp3 of Fat Lip and burn it onto a mix, because this CD isn't worth the $14 that I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great listen","review":"I purchased this CD yesterday, and listened to it right away. I loved every single song, except for the last one, \\"Pain for Pleasure.\\" I also didn't really like \\"Introduction to Destruction.\\" And, although I liked \\"Crazy Amanda Bunkface,\\" if you listen to it carefully, you'll see that it sounds a lot like \\"Fat Lip\\" in the bass part and some of the lyrics, too. And, of course, my favorite songs off the album are \\"Fat Lip\\" and \\"In Too Deep,\\" but I also really liked \\"Nothing on My Back,\\" \\"Rhythms,\\" \\"Motivation,\\" \\"Handle This,\\" and \\"Heart Attack.\\" The reason I gave it 4 stars, though, is because the songs are quite repetitive, and that can get annoying, but this is an excellent CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"but here's my reason why.....","review":"Look. It's ok if you're into pop-punk like blink-182,NFG,saves the day and the like,but it's not at all original.

Some beastie style raps are found,but it's too late: The disc suffers from the usual 3-chords,song structures and pointless lyrics. I'm sure the guys are cool in general,but this isn't a good CD.

WRONG, this album almost beat Blink 182. And I'm probably only saying this because I'm Blink 182 fanatic. Finally a cd not to carelessly loud and rythemless or too gay and poppy like Simple Plan.

Every song in it has it's good parts but not one thing won't make you wanna dance. The songs are mostly about how they want their life to end up and whats wrong with it now.

Almost EVERY single song on this debut cd kicks butt and are as good if not better than Fat Lip. When I heard that song, I though, Oh that's cool.

Blink 182 seemed to have started this purely pop-punk genre, now what you guys want to listen to is your business, but if you want real punk try one of the older bands that actually started it Like The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, The Dead Kennedys, or the Clash. Or if you want something more modern try AFI, The Living End, or The Offspring. I am personally a big Offspring fan and while I will admist they have drifted towards a more pop like flavor they still retain the same great punk attitude that these new bands so sorely lack.

If you like it, simply download it. Don't, and I repeat DON'T buy it. The rest of the CD is [junk]. Pure 100% Dog [poo]. It's not even punk music! They're a Canadien-Wannabe-blink-182 band which is sad because blink-182 isn't even that good.

Like everyone else, I was instantly hooked to \\"FAT LIP,\\" with it's references to mullets, Judas Priest and El Camino's. The rest of the album, however is a little different.

Sum41 seems to not only understand how to make a catchy pop punk song, but also how to merge that style with the harsher elements of radio unfriendly punk and add a touch of Beasty Boy's style rap and some 80's Anthrax/Megadeath style metal.This combo of styles makes for a mixed but enjoyable album, sometimes sounding safely like Blink182's radio friendly second album and other times wandering over into the realm of the more punk MxPx and NOFX.

They are only mad because bands like Blink 182 and Weezer actually have talent and they can play their frickin instruments with skill and chords other then power chords. Bands like the Ramones and Misfits only play a monotonous sound of screaming and yelling about absolute nonsense while Sum 41 has a point in their music. It is great music and definatly worth the money you might pay. Do not listen to angry \\"punk rockers\\" because they do not know what real music is.

The songs i mentioned above are good, because they have some good lyrics and a good sound, but there is alot of repeition of badness on the cd. There's a track that is practically the same as \\"Fat Lip\\", change a couple words and some chords. I think it's track 10, and this song is only better than the rest of the (stuff) on the cd.

I'm a big fan of Duke, and particularly of his T-Bone stylings (as I play that way myself), so this album was a no-brainer. The album is superbly recorded and engineered. Duke is the master of that big arch-top guitar tone that is so definitive of the T-Bone sound. His vocals are strong, and the band is the best in the known blues world.

Don Patterson is the organist on \\"Low Flame.\\" He also appears on \\"Soul Classics\\" along with Jack McDuff and others. This is jazz with a lot of funky soul in it, not funky soul with a lot of jazz in it. And Stitt is in great form. The other half of the picture, the one without the grits and gravy, can be found on the \\"Endgame Brilliance\\" compilation on 32Jazz, with Sonny in a straight-ahead setting with Barry Harris on piano.

The songs, It seemed were a bunch of random notes with Harmonies taken by several of his earlier songs thrown in. Many songs sounded like his other works with different verses and very slight changes to the chorus. There were really no new Ideas here.

Instead the main character is her husband/fiancee. This work by \\"Futurian Society\\" author James Blish suffers not for the passing years in terms of hard science; the technology is kept generalized and deliberatly vauge. So it reads as well today as when it was published. Its most delightful and disappointing fact is that the villian is more three dimensional then the two other main characters. And that is saying something in a novel meant to show the evils of prejudice by pitting normal(evil) humans against genetically manipulated(good) eight foot giants.

His single, Yeah!!, a collaboration with Ludacris isn't really a all out song that stands out to me. Although the song does have some great beats.

Then when 2Pac went to jail after Biggie didn't tell him about the NY shooting, Biggie just tried to give the shoutouts on the radio, and take his position.MTV will never tell this story, as they want to portray 2Pac as the bad buy, and Puffy & Big as the best ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"B.I.G.","review":"Biggie is terrible and he has never had a good album.

This was the worst album since Ready to Die and that wasn't a bad album.This album to me was just a filler of a legacy of one of the best rappers of the game. Biggie didn't need this album. It's been 6 years and I am still on the Life After Death CD. That is the best double disc Cd I have ever heard.With that said if you are looking a a leagcy cd from Biggie....this isn't it.

Puff CANNOT rap, Kim is too full of herself, and that \\"Notorious\\" is so wack, AND the remix. This album would make BIG turn over in his grave.

He does\`nt play any instruments he can\`t dance or Rap but he is very good at management. He took Biggie\`s hardcore beats and replaced them with poor poppy comercial beats making the album very intensivly boring and leaving a sour taste in the mouth.

Since biggie tragically past away in March of 1997 I think we should remember him the way he left out. This new album has lyrics that he did between 1993-1996. Most of the stuff he is talking about on the new album wasn't what he was about on his second album. For instance in one song he talks about pushing an Acura, Biggie was rolling in Bentley's, and Hummers before his death! Let's not reverse his status. I spoke to Marvin Gayes widow about this album and she said that Puffy should not have released it. Puffy's entire kingdom is falling down.

Tribe WAS one of my favorite groups. But his departure from his own unique and original style is just now pathetic. In my mind, he has turned into Puff Daddy. And for those of you who like Puff Daddy, you need to enlighten yourselves in REAL Hip-Hop. Listen to people like KRS-One, The Pharcyde, Hieroglyphics, De La Soul, Common, Digable Planets, and many others. Q-tip is nothing more than a sell-out! It is hard to even listen to him on Tribe albums. Do yourself the favor and don't buy this. Invest your money in artists who respect Hip-Hop for its truest values, not to those who are only concerned with making money.

Their beats were unique and their lyrics were meaningful. Once Q-Tip went solo, I expected him to continue along his path of rightousness. He even changed his name to Kaamal Fareed in a committment to his new faith. Instead it appears that he has been seduced by fast money and faster females. This cd is for people who are attracted by superficial things not spiritual essence. The beats are simple and lyrics are garbage. The last thing Americans, especially black children, need to see is another money-hungry entertainer grinding on mindless sex-objects.

QTip tried to go commercial and pop on this album and i think he let a lot of his fans down. Only songs i liked on the album is Higher, Breathe And Stop, Vivrant Thing(this was already on the Violator compilation so it shouldn't have been on Amplified album). End Of Time song with rock group Korn would've been better if Korn wasn't on the song. I liked the beat and the lyrics on End Of Time but QTip should've rapped more on the song and left Korn off the song. I also like the bonus hidden track Do It, Be It, See It. I'm so glad his 2nd solo unreleased album Kamaal The Abstract never came out because from the reviews i read about it, i read that he sang on all of the 9 songs on the album LOL.

This CD is a must for all the ATCQ fans that were there from the beginning. Any one that really loves hip hop must have this CD.

For the last ten years or so he has been producing music totally dissimilar to this album, and I'm still trying to figure out where he went wrong.

I am going to be even brutal and speculate he is making music JUST for the money now, and trying to produce the next new \\"party\\" song.

It seemed that in his zeal for greatness he forgot what got him to this point. Tip compromises intelligent beats and thoughtful lyrics in order to go main stream and receive an abundance of radio play. Prior to this release, Q-Tip was my favorite emcee, but his latest album crushed all of my expectations and led me to the conclusion that Tip will never again reach a level of hip-hop like that in \\"The Low End Theory\\", or \\"Peoples' Instinctive Travels and Paths of Rhythm\\". I would have to say that Q-Tip has ended his dynasty as a leading underground hip-hop artist for the lights and glamour of television. I was reassured of my feelings when the better half of \\"A Tribe Called Quest\\", Phife Dogg, released his solo album which surpassed my expectations while remaining underground. \\"Amplified\\" might be abundant in popular sound, but as a hip-hop record, it falls short of the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Quest for the Abstract","review":"This album is a long journey to find the old Q-Tip, the Abstract. After listening to this cd for a couple of times I could only find two tracks that pleased the music lover in me. I think it is very sad and dissapointing to hear this album, after listening to the Tribe Called Quest for a period of years. I know we all like to show off our jewlery and the money stash, but to go from true hip hop to Crystal drinking and trying to be The artist formerly known as Prince, is just too much and very, very sad.

Some of the best tracks are \\"Go Hard,\\" with it's awesome beat and descriptions of regional hip hop sounds, and \\"N.T.,\\" featuring Busta Rhymes with a creative rag time feel to it. Also, unlike most rappers that are coming out now, Q-Tip can come up with tight songs without having to threaten everyone in the room! I would have given him a five star rating, if only he had a couple more songs on the album, but all in all, I would definitely recommend getting this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could of been better!","review":"Oh no, Q-Tip... what have you done?

You know who you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems most 'Tip fans wanted more of the same....","review":"Q-Tip's 'Amplified' is at first listen, a cut-up funk party album. Tracks like 'Vivrant Thing', 'Breath and Stop' and exudes a funkiness which remains consistent throughout the whole album. Most of the production is handled by Jay Dee (otherwise known as Jay Dilla responsible for one half of Jaylib) and his magic touch is definitely appreciated by this listener. Production aside, Q-tip's vocals are smooth and he retains all the charm from his A Tribe Called Quest days. Don't buy this album thinking 'A Tribe Called Quest Solo Version', 'coz it ain't. It's Q-tip just doing his thing, and damn does he do it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"QTIP - AMPLIFIED","review":"I bought this cd on the strength of the singles 'Breathe & Stop' & 'Vivrant Thing' which was a big mistake, 'cos i was very dissappointed with this cd!

There is nothing worse than watching a legendary MC fall on his face, and \\"Amplified\\" gives you the chance 13 times over. If you are a Tribe fan, save and wait for Phife - he's still keeping it real.

WAT HAPPENED! There was a q-tip 10 years ago that would neva think of goin mainstream. His rhymes came straight from the heart and neva did wat the the others were doin. Thats wat made him a special MC. This new Q-tip is confused. Maybe its because of the break-up. Maybe its beacuse he went bankrupt and needed money. Or maybe he got hit in the head cant remember a damn thing from the past. I dont know but im sittin here listening to LOW END THEORY and wonderin wat happened. I give props to phife though but he is a little confused to. But i still love you q-tip and still will support you but on the next album think do it for the questers not the non questers.

The DIY section was interesting and gave me ideas to work off of for myself.I myself have only been vegan for a little less than a year and I'm still a \\"newbie\\".

They came highly recommended, but I found them to be too simple, and almost insulting. I mean, does a person really need a burrito recipe, or a fruit smoothie recipe?Plus, many of these recipes were contributed by fans, and since I got iffy results from them (and have friends who got the same iffy results), it makes me wonder if they were even kitchen tested before being considered for the book.Unrelated to the recipes----I would have preferred if investments had been made in a few really nice, color photographs of the FINISHED DISHES, rather than multiple, black & white photos of the author. Is it a cookbook, or a personal photo album?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"I am a fan of the previous two cookbooks in this series, but this one doesn't have much new to offer. Many of the recipes are from other people and there seems to be a lot of typos, which makes me doubt that all of the recipes were tested. Also the author's photo is on almost every page. Shouldn't the photos be of the food? Or how about no photos at all? It's distracting and self-absorbed. The index, as in the previous two Sarah Kramer vegan cookbooks, is virtually useless. There are no footers on the pages, so you have to page to a section's start page to know where you are in the book. There are some good recipes but I don't think I will buy Kramer's inevitable sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically a compilation of recipes from other people","review":"I was really excited to get this cookbook, but I was disappointed after looking through it. It has some good recipes (the banana bars are the best), but I think the author actually only provided a few of them.

I recommend 'Vegan With a Vengeance' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get over yourself","review":"The lack of editing in this book is painful.

I loved the previous two books (the first one particuarly) but this one has so many pics that make me cringe and a lot of the recipes are almost identical to ones in previous books. Also there seems to be lots of versions of different things so you might have 3 potato salads recipes for example. I've tried a few recipes from this and they have been lacking on the taste side. Also its true too many are from other people.Go out and buy how it all vegan instead (if you don't have it already).Edited to add: not as bad I thought i've since tried the borscht and the lentil and quinoa stew and they both rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to Veganism!","review":"This was the first book I bought when I stepped into Veganland along with two other cheaper more compact books. While it took about an hour to decide on the other two books, this one jumped out at me from the get-go and introduced me to a new world where becoming vegan wasn't all hard work and having to justify my beliefs and choices.This book, to me, is showing that it can be fun to be vegan. The recipes were more varied than I ever realised when I was a lactovegetarian and as soon as I got home from the bookstore I sifted through the pages with post-its in hand dazzled by all the recipes I wanted to try.So far I have tried a few of the veggie recipes and a muffin recipe and all were top-notch.

This in my opinion is their heaviest and more raw sounding album. Tracks like \\"Just Let me Rot\\" and \\"For God your soul For Me your Flesh\\" show us how brutal and raw this band can be. The vocals are simply brutal, its a cross between Chris Barnes low Devastating cries and a drunk guy vomiting his guts out. This album is essential if you are a serious Death Metal fan and you want to hear other, less well known Death metal bands. This is a good place to start and then of course the classic \\"Been caught Buttering\\" where you can hear for yourself how amazingly brutal they can sound without all the flash and hoopla that other death metal bands put into their music. Great album, get it, oh and by the way, have a vomitting bag next to you, the vocals are pretty disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sort of a fogotten...Band.","review":"Pungent stench is one of those deathmetal bands that some foget and others didn't care about but i for one have always been a fan of their work. Don't try to compare legends like death or morbid angel with ps but do realize that their music is plain brutal and spychotic deathmetal and its not suppost to be fancy like others but it is suppost sound the way it sounds...Apreciate it!

Give this one a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Of The Big City Police Thrillers","review":"The bad news here is that the author died while working on this book and it was skillfully completed by Christopher Newman. Nevertheless it snaps and crackles with the dialogue and insider information that only Caunitz (a 30-year cop) could provide. You can read all of the police novels you want but you will NEVER find an author that gives you as much of the inside scoop on police work, language, and character. His plots are fascinating, his characters different yet utterly believable, and his mastery of giving a lot of information in a few words is unmatched. Caunitz was, quite simply, the best of them all at this kind of a novel. Rest In Peace, William J. Caunitz...I'll be re-reading your books from time to time until (hopefully) we meet in the beyond."},{"rating":"2","title":"CC01","review":"Chains of Command was my first book that I read by William J. Caunitz and I could not put it down. I loved it from the begining to the end and could not point out a boring part of the book or a dry part. Caunitz escribed Lt. Matthew Stuart to be a real charmed police officer who allowed me to feel how Matt was feeling and to see what Matt was seeing, as if you were actually there with the lieutenant. I really loved the book and would suggest it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery/police novel. Matt Stuart was a real good guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"half good","review":"I really like cop novels and authors like Ed Dee and John Mackie. Understood Caunitz to beof this standard. Seems Caunitz died while this novel was not finished. This novel is halfgood, the first half.

All of the personality is lost amid this confusing drugfiasco until we give up - exhausted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I was expecting","review":"I had mixed results on previous books with this author. I absolutely loved Pigtown and One Police Plaza but could not even finish Exceptional Clearance. I had purchased this book, Chains of Command, before I had read some of the reviews here--and before I realized that he died halfway through writing it. I probably would have passed. But since I had the book I finally decided to read it and I found it a crisp entertaining read. I could not detect where the authors changed and so kudos to the guy who finished it...nice job. After I finished it I kept it for a re-read in ten or fifteen years. I guess that is how I gauge a books value to me--do I want to keep it and possibly re-read it? I kept it, and I recommend it, especially if you liked some of his other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the NYPD?","review":"In my humbler opinion, this book is a piece of garbage, finished by another writer because the publisher was sure that he could palm it off on the public. A First Deputy Commissioner in line for the top job and who is a woman? And is not Irish? And has a publicized love affair with a lieutenant? And her mafia-connection background was never checked out? Come on! Get real! And then she drives off all over the place in her own car, without an escort? These things do not happen in the real life of the NYPD. Besides, that constant cop talk - whether true or invented - really gets on your nerves and surely is overdone. Forget about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be called \\"everybody dies\\"","review":"I must agree with Ikvley from CT. There are too many unbelievable plot elements.

This book, the very bed rock of Romantic thought, is (in my opinion) the root of many of our modern problems because it begins unraveling of the basic thesis of the Enlightenment: cultivate reason and be wholey guided by it. That being said a person cannot fully understand the Romantics, and by extension our own society, without first reading and understanding Rousseau. The veneration of nature, the noble savage, all of the things that the Romantics aspired to or believed in has its seed in this book, so if you are a romantic or if you just want to understand more about this philosophical era, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ummm...","review":"\\"Rousseau is not one of the world's most famous political and social commentators...\\"?!?!?!?!?!?C'mon, New Jersey -- I think a bit more respect is due to the man who brought you the Social Contract...Anyway, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"read if you have too much time on hand","review":"I found this book extremely boring.

Great write and great resource for any office!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Stuff","review":"This is a very strong record by any standards. The Fall have been a prolific, innovative band for a long time and hereon they use some of the same bag of tricks they've used in previous eras (overlapping vocals and words, unapologetically minimal keyboard, primitive rhythms, Mark Smith's wonderfully atonal vocal style) to impressive effect.Not every track on here is great, but a number of them are. The music bears some resemblance to the type of \\"garage\\" or \\"grunge\\" that was in vogue in the 90's, but it is better than most of that, and the sound here is largely perfect, full of energy but clean. I think the committed Fall fan will enjoy this, and the rock listener who's never heard of The Fall will enjoy it at least as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Album","review":"I give this 5 stars for substance; not too many rockers are quoting the Society of the Spectacle by the Situationist International (Guy DeBord) but Mark E. Smith is not below that, and it's a great adventure to contemplate what other references are mumbled and shouted...to which we've yet to gain exposure.Good beats and sage wit; I suspect sometimes that the Fall is just a red herring for a school of philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the band by which all others must be judged","review":"Their strongest album in years. Smith's ability to maintain \\"the Fall sound\\" despite notoriously persistent change-over in band personnel is unparalleled in the history of recorded music (with the possible exception of Anton Webern). More importantly, he seems here to've reined in his consumption of alcohol, such that his voice rings out as commandingly as in days of old.

I read it during my first pregnancy and it took me awhile to figure out why I hated it so much. The authors seem to have such a problem with large women. There are so many seemingly innocent, but really snide and insulting comments about weight and diet. Their emphasis on the Best Odds Diet is absurd and the Diet isn't that great either. It seems very old fashioned. Also in general the authors don't seem to have much scientific backing for many of their statements about all topics. Also, their know-it-all condescending tone is really a turn off after a few chapters. I actually refer to the authors as \\"those skinny b*****s and the book as \\"the skinny b*****s' book\\"I think What to Expect the First Year is even worst. There is just no proof or justification for most of the statements they make. And their know it all attitude is even more obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one...","review":"I bought this book when I found out that I was pregnant because all of my friends swore by it.

I guess that this is the perfect book for the pregnant hypocondriac, but not for me. I would not recommend this book to any normal, healthy mom to be. Your money is much better spent on the Dr. Sears books.

I must say how banal and condescending I thought the tone of the book was. I found that the tone of the book and the quality of the writing bordered on the insulting. It's like a pregancy guide written for the absoloute lowest common denominator...as if no one reading the book would have finished the seventh grade. Bleck! Honestly, the writers put forth information as if everyone picking up this book hasn't bothered to pick up a pamphlet in their doctor's office and has never ever bothered to crack open another book. Furthermore, their nutrition and recipie section is completely out of whack. Let's jut say every other publication that I read during my preganacy was more helpful and better written than this one.

This book will help you be a good patient, like there is something wrong with you and only the expert doctor can fix you. Save your money, save your birth, save your baby. Buy something like Henci Goer's \\"The Thinking Woman's Guide to A Better Birth\\" and find out what you really should expect while you're expecting!

Let's face it, pregnancy is a sign of overall health and should be treated as such. Ban the scary texts! If I have a specific risk, the multitude of tests I undergo at the doc's should reveal it. Otherwise, the female body is evolved to birth. It is our most biologically important function & we are well equipped to take on the task.Since I received 3 of these as gifts, I read through a copy and found contradictions in information from one page to another. Sorry I don't remember specifics since I've had two boys since then, but it made the info appear so untrustworthy that I threw them all in the recycle instead of giving them to the next mom as I do with everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Basic","review":"The books cover the basics of what happens when you are expecting a baby. It doesn't teach you more than what your mother could tell you during a coffee break. It's really a waste of time unless you don't have a mother or other previously pregnant friend to talk to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book","review":"I bought this during my first pregnancy and really regretted it! It has a thoroughly negative outlook on pregnancy and birth (i.e. what 'could' go wrong)This book gave me the feeling I would have lots of (unneccesary) interventions- IV, episiotomy, epidural,etc. in birth.This is the perfect hypochondriac's directory --you think you have all the ailments described in the book after reading about all the very commonplace symptoms fo pregnany. This book doesn't begin to address natural childbirth or complementary healthcare. Buy \\"Gentle Birth Choices\\" by Barbara Harper and \\"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding\\" by LLL and anything by Sheila Kitzinger for a much more postive view of pregnancy and birth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Closis ...","review":"I also believe that \\"Girlfriends guide\\" and \\"Babytales\\" as well as the \\" The Baby book\\" are better choices. Who do they think they are talking to their readers like we are stupid. Not to mention most of us are scared Our first time around and \\"what to expect when expecting\\" does everything in its power to make us feel worst. What I'm expecting when I'm expecting is not to buy or recieve this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very depressing.","review":"Heaven forbid that a woman actually enjoys her pregnancy. The women who wrote this book presented the information in an \\"alarmist\\" format--not very pleasing. Only use this book as a reference guide.

There are far better books, look around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Attachment or Contimuum parenting families!!","review":"This book is for conventional parents - parents who think artificial feeding and breastfeeding are one in the same, who think extended breastfeeding is distasteful and a minipulation of a mother by her nursling, and parents who believe it is OK to let a baby cry herself to sleep in an isolated crib down the hall. These authors actually state (in so many words) that breastmilk is basically useless after one year, and that sleeping with your infant in a family bed is not desirable. If you want a better guide for instinctual parenting from the heart, read \\"The Continuum Concept\\" by Jan Leidloff, or \\"Attachment Parenting\\" by Katie Allison Granju."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending","review":"I was told this was THE book to get if you were expecting. I'm only 6 weeks along and already have grown very tired of this book and it's condescending tone. There is some useful information and that is why I gave it 2 stars, but nothing you couldn't find in a much better book (I prefer the Mayo Clinic book) or somewhere online. I have had some morning sickness, but my biggest problem has been terrible heartburn. I referenced this book to see if there were any suggestions for heartburn, and it basically told me that the heartburn was all my fault for overindulging in fried and fatty foods. Yeah, right! At this point the only thing I can keep down is oatmeal and plain toast. Since when are those overindulgences?! The Mayo Clinic book on the other hand, explains that heartburn is a very common side effect due to hormones and gives sound advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to be miserable all nine months? Buy this book!","review":"This has got to be one of the most miserable and depressing books out there! Don't believe me? Before you buy it, read a few pages on the beginning of each month. It gives you a huge list miseries you should expect for that month. Yeah, women do go through alot durring pregnancy but had I not read it on my fourth month, I wouldn't of even noticed some of the symptoms because I was focused more on the wonder inside of me rather than the constipation, hemmroids, swollen feet, veins, vomiting, irrability, mood swings, lack of concentration and the other horrible things this book tells you to expect. If you look up the word \\"expect\\" it the dictionary, it says: to rely on or look forward in recieving. Who looks forward to 9 months of misery?! I would recommend this book to young girls to scare them out of getting pregnant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the first time mom","review":"My mom bought this book for me when she found out I was pregnant and I love it. It's set up in an easy-to-read, month-by-month format. \\"What to expect...\\" covers a lot of the questions \\"moms-to-be\\" have to ask. I'd recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pessamists Beware","review":"I agree with Ron's posting that this book, while informative, definately supports the phrase \\"a little knowledge is a dangerous thing\\". To be honest I found \\"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\" much more supportive of my actual experience.This book is a good resource if used in conjunction with OB/GYN visits, to stimulate conversation and assist in asking questions that you may not think to ask. However, if you are even slightly given to assuming the worst case, I would steer clear and enjoy your pregnancy as it unfolds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good pregnancy resource.","review":"I bought this book, assuming it was the authority on pregnancy since it's so well-known. I was extremely disappointed. I found the author's style to be condescending, and her perspectives are outdated. More importantly, the format of the book (organized according to stage of pregnancy) assumes every reader will experience a particular symptom or concern at the \\"textbook\\" moment. I encourage you to save your money and buy \\"The Mother of All Pregnancy Books\\" instead. That has been my real pregnancy resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why doesn't everyone love this book???","review":"I know this book is the most famous pregnancy book, yet most people seem to not like it for some reason.This was my favorite book, and there was NOTHING I experienced during pregnancy that this book didn't address. Other books were good, but didn't even mention some issues/symptoms, etc. This book is written in an interesting Q&A; format and calms you about anything you can imagine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected while expecting!","review":"As a first time parent I was looking for something informative and to help me understand what my body was going through. As this book has lots of information, I felt that it did not give me all of the information I needed and expected. I guess it was the format of the book that I did not like. I was looking for a book that gave me more information on the development of the baby etc. This book I felt focused on the negative issues.....things that could go wrong. In short it wasn't what I expected while I was expecting....So I found other resourses that gave me the information I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a guilt trip!","review":"Unless you are willing to follow the very strict diet and exercise guidelines in this book, you shouldn't buy it. Even if you are willing to follow it, the advice is so unrealistic that most women who are pregnant will not be able to follow it because they will just feel too lousy. It really will just make you feel guilty and frustrated, which pregnant women really don't need. The medical information is very general, and was of little help to me during my pregnancy. Anything that I really wanted information on, I had to look up on the Internet. The only really valuable part of the book is the information on fetal development each month, and some of the information on how chemicals and certain foods affect the baby, which you could probably find on-line too. \\"What to Expect the First Year\\" is similarly strict and frustrating, and in some ways even insulting as to the advice it gives. Fortunately, I received both books as gifts and didn't waste my own money on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic","review":"After hearing so much about this book, I was so excited to receive it as a gift when I found out I was pregnant. But the content is very weak, and the \\"Question & Answer\\" format condescending and annoying. I found \\"The Unofficial Guide ...\\" and \\"Advice from a Pregnant OB\\" much more intelligent reading. I would not even recommend this as a backup book, except for someone who wants some very light reading, and doesn\`t like an academic, purer approach and will appreciate the Q&As.I was very surprised that this is \\"the bible\\" for pregnancies -- it really makes you wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible book","review":"I read this book during my first pregnancy and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone -- I have a hard time believing it makes the bestseller list. There are three basic problems with this book. First, it promotes a philosophy that you are actively in control of the outcome of the pregnancy, as if pregnancy complications can be eliminated by being a control freak during pregnancy. Second, rather than being informative or reassuring it sent me to my doctor TWICE for no good reason, after reading the Q&A section for the month. Finally the diet recommend is much stricter than required for any normal pregnancy...no doubt if you can follow it you will be healthier, but pregnancy is a time of high stress and this book is only going to add to it. I would recommend \\"The Well Pregnancy Book\\" over \\"What to Expect\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the pregnancy Bible!","review":"During my pregnancy, this book helped me with every concern I could think of. I don't have the most attentive, hand-holding OB/GYN so this book is a lifesaver! It's a must for every pregnant woman. My husband reads this as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars! Terrible! Avoid this fascist book!","review":"You should only read/use this book if you are a masochist with no interest in food as pleasure, and if you are prepared for a lot of guilt. No other medical professionals that I know of would recommend such a strict and bizarre diet, and for women to give themselves over completely to their pregnancy with no concern for the rest of life. Many of the book's prescriptions seem bizarre and unsubstantiated. And, like the other books in this series, it's very hetero/marriage oriented, which always makes me want to puke, even though I'm straight and married. It felt arrogant and not at all inclusive or accepting or anything but their rigid paradigm."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"Should have called this book \\"Expecting the Worst\\". Where is the joy of pregnancy and childbirth? Having a baby is as safe as life gets, yet this book makes it seem as though pregnancy and birth are accidents waiting to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR $!","review":"This book has little information and is completely over- rated! This book is all hype. For a thorough and informative book check out Dr. William Sears' THE PREGNANCY BOOK. And THE BREASTFEEDING BOOK by Sears is also great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read something else, please!","review":"Where do you discuss the side of effects of epidurals and pain medication? Where do you discuss vaccines and potential side effects? This book cares more about vague generalizations about what labor is like than it does actual happenings.

I found it to be too harsh & unrealistic (how many women actually enjoy eating wheat germ?), and gives the impression that if you don't follow their instructions exactly, bad things will happen! Considering most of their instructions were off-base, I suppose most of us were asking for trouble with anything we did? If you want a realistic book, pick up Dr. Sears' \\"The Pregnancy Book\\" (no, I'm not a huge, rabid fan of Dr. Sears, but I do think the book is not a 'know-it-all' style of book!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very biased and basic info you can get at your monthly exams","review":"I found this book to cover most normal pregnancies, but I found myself constantly afraid of premature labor every other day with their \\"When to call your doctor\\" sections. They obviously are a pro-hospital birth book and I do not recall home birth being mentioned in a good light. And, if you aren't going to breastfeed, well then you may as well prepare for a sickly child according to their stance. I also found it a little old-fashioned since there are a lot of single mothers out there that this book constantly reminds them of their singularity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Easy Reading Book With Down To Earth Advice","review":"My title says it all. This is an easy reading book with excellent advice and information. My doctor, one of the top doctors in Manhattan recommended it so it can't be bad!

It provides clear information and good advice. I'm only 20 weeks but have used it as a reference for all of our questions thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too negative","review":"Definitely include this book in your pregnancy library, but read it with a grain of salt. It provides plenty of useful information, but it will also scare you out of your wits if you take it too seriously. For levity, read the Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy by Vicky Iovine. There are lots of other informative books that are more positive and respect your ability to think and make choices other than what the author thinks is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a worse case scenerio book for me","review":"This book always seemed to give the worst case scenerio about my questions about pregnancy. For example it said that I shouldn't go camping up in the mountains when my doctor said it was fine. It made me paranoid about how often my baby hiccuped and said that she could be strangling herself on her umbilical cord if she did it too often, when my doctor assured me hiccups are good and mean the baby is practicing breathing. There are many more examples, but it did not make me a relaxed pregnant woman about normal occurances during pregnancy. It is very clinical and not human enough for my taste. I much preferred \\"The Pregnancy Book\\" by Martha and Dr Sears to this one and if I had to recommend one pregnancy book (I ended up buying many)it would not be the \\"What to Expect\\" series. Save your money and your sanity and pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again","review":"When I was pregnant with my first child, I had this book, and I even had the follow-ups as my son grew. I have to say in hindsight, do NOT get this book. There are so many books that are tremendously good, more caring, and full of BETTER advice. The William and Martha Sears books for instance are wonderful. What to expect will leave you clueless when you're facing important decisions, and often more anxious than you need to be. The section on breastfeeding is particularly bad, and will have you wondering which end is up, and weaning your baby far sooner than recommended. Instead, try something by Katherine Dettwyler on breastfeeding, or the Sears Complete Pregnancy Book. You'll be much happier and better informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to it's reputation","review":"I rushed out and bought this book the day I found out I was pregnant because it has a good reputation. Once I got it home and started into it, I found it to be uninteresting and not a good preparation for the coming months. The authors focused way too much on diet- which during your first trimester when morning sickness runs rampant, diet advice is not what you need. Also, there was a lot of \\"what if this happens..\\" and moms-to-be do not need more things to worry about. There are far better books out there for pregnant women who don't want to worry about everything for 9 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this book","review":"This book is preachy and filled with biased notions of what women should do during pregnancy and childbirth. It's condescending.A much better book is Henci Goer's The Thinking Woman's Guide to Better Birth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it used","review":"or see if you can get someone to give you a copy if you feel the need to keep this \\"pregnancy bible\\" close at hand.The month-by-month format is helpful (then again, your experiences may vary somewhat).However, like many readers here, what really annoys me about this book is the tone in which it is written -- like all pregnant women are morons who jettisoned their sense of humor the minute the test came back positive.And the nutrition section is kind of a joke. I went from four months of morning sickness straight into persistent heartburn, so I made food choices based on what (1) didn't make me gag or (2) didn't keep me up all night belching. (Sometimes it was grapefruit, sometimes it was potato chips.)Relax a little bit -- constantly worrying about your weight or if you stood downwind from a car with a bad exhaust system isn't good for the baby either."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"I don't understand why this book is so popular. I found the health and well-being information lacking. There is also an abundance of \\"scary\\" information each month - \\"things you should worry about\\" that frankly, dont apply to 95% of us and I just don't need to know. I found the Pregnancy book by Dr. Sears MUCH better - more informative, more helpful, and more realistic. Of course, I also loved the Girlfriend's Guide - it's great for a laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly simplistic yet alarmist","review":"After going through two years of infertility, I was so excited to settle down with this book and learn all about \\"What to expect\\". This book was a waste of time and money, especially in the first trimester when everything changes so quickly that you can't possibly expect to cover issues on a monthly basis. Also, even though I found it alarmist (Uhoh! I looked at a muffin! My baby will be born with two heads!), I also thought that it didn't cover some very basic information. For example, nowhere in the book does it indicate that symptoms will come and go, and that this is normal. Instead, it says that if your symptoms disappear you are likely having a miscarriage and should call your doctor. That's baloney. In the end, I realized I could find all of the information I wanted simply by doing a simple online search. I will never recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"can i give it zero stars?","review":"Amazon won't allow zero stars it turns out, but that is what this book deserves.When your midwife tells you to throw the book out, then you know it's a bad book. I won't even give it away. This and its companion of what to eat when expecting need to be gotten rid of. This book is a large volume of anxiety and unless you want to be freaked out during your pregnancy, avoid it like the plague. I have no idea how it gets re-published, why it is even in print to begin with. The woman is no authority but acts like she is some sort of expert with a preachy tone and inaccurate information.Please, do yourself and your loved ones, and your future baby a favor and read anything written by Dr. Sears. Even Jill Iovine's Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy is way better and entertaining too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much information","review":"This is my first pregnancy at 36 years old. A friend of mine let me borrow this book after I'd already read a whole bunch of Your Pregnancy Week by Week. I like that one much better. I found it an easier read. What to Expect When You're Expecting, is good but the picture of the pregnant lady on the front of this version is scary. This is the one I was lent. She looks tired and sad. I hate that! It make me feel like I will be tired and sad if I read it. I guess they thought she looked peaceful, but I think she is sorry and sad. Too much information for me. I guess I'd already found so much on the Internet and from reading the Week by Week book that I felt like I was having to read too many things that didn't pertain to me. It's organized that way to include all possibilities within each week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to educated mothers-to-be","review":"A couple people (new parents) actually recommended this book when I found out I was pregnant, but thankfully, it was a waste of my time. Unless you know NOTHING about pregnancy and common-sense nutrition, this book will only list 50,000 questions and outdated answers in a weird format instead of actually teaching you anything.Also avoid this book if you plan on doing a natural home birth.I will be so happy when this is no longer considered the Be All End All Pregnancy Handbook.I recommend, instead, The Whole Pregnancy Handbook : An Obstetrician's Guide to Integrating Conventional and Alternative Medicine Before, During, and After Pregnancy by Joel Evans and Robin Aronson; and Special Delivery by Rahima Baldwin, if you're considering home birth."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book depressed me","review":"I am a pediatrician and expecting my 2nd child. The diet advice in this book is so preachy. When you're sick and or in the throes of a craving the last thing you worry about is sticking to a rigid diet. This book actually made me feel depressed because I ate some McDonald's this morning. If I didn't know better because I am a physician, I would be very fearful that I am harming my baby (which I am NOT). In the edition I have, the one before this one, they actually recommend that a husband signal to his wife if she orders something \\"unhealthy\\" in a restaurant. I would hit my husband with a fork if he did such a thing! (not really, but he would regret it.) I sincerely hope they removed this advice from the current addition. The Girlfriend's guide by Vicki Iovine gave me a good laugh and made me feel a lot better about my dietary indiscretions.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily Upsetting!","review":"I found this book to be full of impossible and sometimes ridiculous standards that no normal woman could meet. It also has far too much negative and scary information that was just plain upsetting. After three months of anxiety about my pregnancy I mentioned to my doctor how troubling the information in this book was to me. She (also pregnant) agreed completely and added that no doctor in their large practice felt it was a good reference for pregnancy. She advised me to get rid of it, which I did as soon as I got home. I never thought I would destroy a book, but I gained much relief as each page of \\"What To Expect While You're Expecting\\" curled into flames! Don't read this book if you have even the slightest anxiety about your pregnancy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"My pregnancy started out a little bumpy, so needless to say I was always worried that something would go wrong. This book did nothing to calm my fears, it only exacerbated them. It made me feel like I could do nothing right, especially my diet. Just about everything I was eating was a \\"no no\\" according to this book, but then to others my diet was fine. I have heard this book called \\"What to FEAR when you're expecting\\" and I could'nt agree with that title more. I now have a wonderful happy 2 year old and I wish I had enjoyed my pregnancy more. There has got to be a better book out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not perfect","review":"I liked the book in general, it provides good information and i consider it as a reference for the new mom but not the only reference ofcourse, It describes all pregnancy stages and weeks in details and even describes and discusses main pregnancy risks and problems in details, so as new mother you can have very good expectation about you may feel or face in the comming weeks and discuss the labour in details which is sometimes good to know what you may experience. In addition to that the book may help you also after the delivery especailly for the first month after delivery. It was not my only reference during my pregnancy but it was one of the best ones. I recommend the book alos for the father to be to help him better understands the feelings and the fears his wife could have during pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"What To Expext When You're Expecting","review":"I bought this for my daughter and she was thrilled! I heard on Dr. Phil's show that this is the new 'Bible' for pregnant women so I had to buy it. She is reading it as her pregnancy progresses. She says it goes into more detail on all subjects that other books she bought just mention lightly and go on to something else. She loves the depth of coverage on different aspects of pregnancy, what to expect, what is normal/abnormal.

The book is complete and thorough and covers almost every topic I've needed during my first pregnancy. You need to have a good attitude througout your pregnancy: Do not let things you read/hear about make you terrified that the same will happen to you. If you have a healthy mindset, What to Expect is an excellent source of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't find it negative or scary...","review":"I recieved this book as a gift from my mother in-law because I am expecting my first child. Some other reviewers have stated that they found it negative, and that all the information is meant to scare you. Well I did not find that to be the case. I agree that it does describe a lot of different and sometimes very rare pregnancy complications, most of which no one will experience. However, I took that as comforting to know that if I did have any of the weird symtoms that it was probably normal, and NOT a reason to think something was wrong. (I was having nosebleeds every morning but the book said that it is very common) It is a little simplistic though. I would prefer something that came from more of a medical perspective.

However, it's good when you feel a pain, or have a rash, or anything else that makes you panic, because you can easily find your symptom, and see the benign problems that could be causing it. However, it also mentions several terrifying conditions that have that symptom, so be sure to keep in mind that it mentions many incredibly rare diseases."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Guide To Birth Ever Written","review":"This book should be burned and never reprinted. If you ever get this for a shower present, gracefully accept and then burn it! The info in this book tries to undermine the natural ability of women to give birth and plays into the fear factor of first time moms. It doesn't even begin to address the rising c-section rate and how each intervention brings on a higher risk of fetal death and c-section. Not to mention drug use! It tells you that you can't have drugs during pregnancy, but have a back cocktail while in labor to drug not only you but your baby. If you are not scared of your body and you believe in it's strength and power to not only grow your baby inside you but birth it as well, then don't even touch this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I read this book and found it mediocre at best. I don't even have any kids and I already knew everything in it. It covers basics that I consider to be common sense. I could have just talked with any mother (or a decent doctor) for half an hour to cover everything in the book, it's practically useless unless you are absolutely clueless and don't know anyone who has had a child that you can talk with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor information source, aweful format and writing.","review":"I bought this book for my then-expecting wife about two years ago. At first, I thought the book was \\"OK.\\" But as time passed and I perused through it, I realized that most of the information is in \\"bits\\" with little substance and the depth is lacking. It looks more like a compilation of obstetricians' scientific journal articles than a real guide for pregnancy. Then there's the seeming condescending and feel-good voice of the authors. One thing is trying to be sensitive to the expectant mother another is to patronize her. I have no idea how has this book become so well known, but I really discourage anyone from spending their money in this primer. I highly suggest getting a different book. A real book, not this patchwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"pregnant are not perfect","review":"It seems as if the author expects every pregnant woman to abide by strict standards in order to have a healthy baby. Yes, if a woman is carrying a baby, she should be extra careful, but this is ridiculous. Women have odd cravings sometimes, and sometimes, they can only keep down certain foods, even if those foods are not completely healthy. This book made me very stressed out while I was pregnant. She made me feel as if I was going to have a deformed child if I did not adhere to a strict diet. But, thank you, my son was perfectly healthy, and my diet was less than perfect. If you must get this book, buy it used or borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible!","review":"It is insulting to any woman with the ability to think for herself. Between the patronizing 'doctor knows best' tone and the advice that you should measure your thighs when you find out you're pregnant so you can make sure they don't expand - it's ridiculous. It hardly addresses any other birthing options, aside from medicated hospital births. Anything outside of the norm is regarded as dangerous to the mother and the baby.This is a horribly disgusting book that does nothing more than scare or guilt a newly expectant mother into submission."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst pregnancy prep book","review":"I am a doula and I always get worried when someone tells me they are reading this book. It makes you afraid of being pregnant. The diet they ask you to follow is nearly impossible. I think this book makes you fearful and guilty. I highly recommend Dr. Sears' books on pregnancy and childbirth"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will make you a nervous wreck!","review":"When I got pregnant, my husband's cousin gave us this book and said, \\"take everything in it with a grain of salt\\". She was right. After reading through the first two chapters, I put the book away and only read the developmental milestones each month. This book is packed with \\"things that may go wrong\\", that you spend the duration between OBGYN visits wondering, \\"could this/that be wrong with my baby?\\". If you buy this book, please follow our cousin's advice and take the information with a grain of salt-but have your OBGYN's number handy, just in case."},{"rating":"1","title":"expect the worst","review":"This book focuses on basic info, which may be helpful if you are completely clueless about pregnancy, and then focuses on all the probelms that might occur at each stage.The author is also opinionated and critical of diets. Her healthy pregnancy diet recomendations would make almost any woman (pregnant or not) toss the book across the room. I think the title is so catchy and that is why it sells so well. There are many other books which are more informative and more positive as well.I personally liked, \\"Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Newborn, Revised and Updated : The Complete Guide\\" by Penny Simkin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wretched book","review":"This book does little but defend the medical community in the United States, and scare the living _______ out of expecting mothers. It leaves out very important information about how labor and delivery work physically, thus its explanations of why things are done--like encouraging women to lie on their backs during delivery--are utterly incomplete. They say it's easier for the doctors, failing to mention that it also literally impedes pelvic and tailbone movement, narrowing the the birth canal and making delivery harder. Very incomplete, very medical-oriented, and full of what to be afraid of, rather than what to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing!","review":"The month by month format of this book is of no help. My OB (as most do) calculates by weeks. Also, they start their OB visits at month 1-I did not see my OB until week 9 which is pretty normal-so which OB visit applys when?This book assumes you have a perfect body and perfect pregnancy: it does not have a basis in reality for most women.Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Resource, But EXTREMELY Flawed","review":"Pregnancy and Birth are completely natural. This book treats you like a patient instead of a woman. While this book mentions most everything that can cause concern in pregnancy, and has symptoms that you can check out, its advice is not very practical or in-depth. It is convenient to refer to for complications and other side effects of pregnancy.The Diet is a joke. The section on morning sickness is a joke. The information on giving birth is sketchy at best. This book is slanted for those who give the responsibility of their care completely into the hands of the doctors instead of for those who want to research everything and find a doctor or midwife who suits them.I shudder at all the reviews that call this the Pregnancy Bible. There are many better books out there that encourage you to be a full participant in your pregnancy care and that describe labor fully so that it is no longer frightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, but not reassuring","review":"Although I found this book to be helpful when looking for information about something, I did not find the tone of the book reassuring. Much of it is written in question and answer format, and the majority of the questions have the tone of a mother who is worrying. This format sends the message that panic and constant worry are appropriate responses to pregnancy. Even though worry is certainly a part of being pregnant, I felt that the presuppositon of worry often exacerbated my own worries and was leading me in the direction of worrying excessively - which is easy enough to do in the first place. I give it two stars because it is informative, but would recommend looking for a book with a more reassuring tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect too much","review":"The book is well structured but the information concentrates too much on the mother eating habits. I had the impression I was reading a book about diet. It lacks information about the baby, that's what the pregnancy is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book disgusts me.","review":"Do NOT buy this book. Here is a choice examples of advice in this stupid book: on \\"eating well\\" - you may occasionally treat yourself to a plain bagel, but everything else you eat must be much more unreasonably disgusting. Puh-leez. This book will list all the things that could go wrong at every stage of pregnancy, all the harm you are doing to your fetus every time you twitch a muscle, and much of it is highly unreasonable and overblown. If you want to stay up all night worrying that your baby will be deformed because of something that you did, go ahead and read it. But I would suggest: INSTEAD of this book, consult your doctor about any medical concerns, buy Dr. Spock's books, and buy the Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy (and to surviving the first year, and to toddlers, etc) by vicki iovine. You will get better-founded medical information and vicki iovine is also highly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!!!","review":"These people are obsesessed with detailed descriptions and pictures of problems that no one can predict, prevent, or correct (especially downs syndrome). It is extremely frightning and doesn't even give good descriptions of normal ups and downs of pregnancy. I threw mine in the trash when I was about 4 months along and found \\"Spiritual Midwifery.\\" It was MUCH better!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scare-mongering tract","review":"This book takes all the joy out of pregnancy and puts all the terror in it. It harps on all the things that can possibly go wrong with your developing fetus and makes you cringe with terror at leaving home even. A much better book, is \\"Your Pregnancy Week by Week\\" by Da Capo books. It shows how the fetus is developing each week (size of a garbanzo, ears forming..ej) with illustrations, as well as a week-by-week summary of what's happening to the mother's body. My husband and I relished reading it each Saturday morning in bed, it became a pleasant ritual as we became accustomed to the idea of our growing child. And it makes pregnancy fun, not dreadful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool drawing, decent reference","review":"Honestly my favorite part of the book is the drawing of the pregnant lady. It's cool to compare the changes in your body!It's also a decent reference tool but not readable month to month. Some articles don't even relate to the month you are in! (?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: this book will make you paranoid & scared","review":"This book has not been very helpful to me at all... in fact, it made me very paranoid and scared to death of everything!!! I understand the importance of being well-educated in order to have the best possible pregnancy and birth, but instead of being re-assuring and helpful it only made me worry... about everything!! Being pregnant is stressful enough and I felt this book only made things worse. It made me feel that my baby was surely going to be born with some disease or birth-defect of some kind or another (which is no laughing matter), and my husband finally had to take it away from me (thank God!). I recommend only reading this book if you want to be a paranoid freak during these 9 looong months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and helpful","review":"A friend lent me this book when I became pregnant, and it ended up being one of the two that I read the most. I loved the month-by-month guide of what to expect. I thought it was practical and realistic. I didn't follow every suggestion (including diet) but found it vert helpful regardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book I'd recommend to friends.","review":"This book so put me off to pregnancy advice books that I've never attempted to read another. This book is preachy, extremist, alarmist, and way too rigid. It made me feel that if my pregnancy didn't progress exactly to their timeline than I was doing something wrong and harming my baby. The first chapters are especially irritating when talking about morning sickness and the Best_Odds diet. Basically with it telling me that whether I am sick or not I should be eating square meals. With me, that just wasn't going to happen and my baby is healthly, strong, and alert. My advice is find a good, experienced doctor that you feel comfortable with because they are going to give you the best advice that is suited to you and your specific needs. If you want a book to reference, I recommend a more medical oriented one like the Mayo Clinic book than an advice book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can go wrong when you're expecting...","review":"Hate is a very strong word, but wow, my wife and I really hated this book. In fact, it breaks what should be the first rule of pregnancy and child rearing books -- do no harm. What to expect, in almost every situation, will give you the disaster scenario of what could be wrong. Cramps? The baby could be kicking or you could have a massive hemorrhage! Feet swelling? Could be normal pregnancy symptoms or you could have blood clots! Seriously, the book drove my wife and I crazy during our first pregnancy. Indeed, it's the only book I've thrown away in recent memory.Pregnancy books should be calming and fun, not scary. We enjoyed the Girl Friends Guide, which was better written, more accessible, and less likely to lead to panic in the middle of the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many Better Books Available","review":"Books I recommend instead:The Mother of All Pregnancy Books by Ann Douglas (a great general guide)The Pregnancy Book by William Sears, MD (more of a natural approach)The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth by Henci Goer (discusses/explains your options for labor/delivery)I didn't get too far with this book. I like to research and make informed decisions about issues that affect my child and me. I felt that this book talks down to expectant mothers. Not to mention it gives you all these \\"worst case scenarios\\" to worry about. For example, I looked up an issue about using electric blankets. It listed all these things that could go wrong, and then they say, but if you already did that don't worry about it now the baby is probably fine. NOT helpful. BTW, I asked my dr and she said the electric blanket was fine to use.Get another pregnancy book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to Fear When You're Expecting","review":"This is positively the worst pregnancy book out there. It is condescending and alarmist about every single aspect of pregnancy, without seriously dealing with many of the common ailments (nausea, for instance). The \\"best odds\\" diet is unrealistic and unpalatable for most women with morning sickness.Every single person I know who has read this book has been made more nervous, not less, by reading it. Pregnant women would do better listening to their mother's old wives tales than reading \\"What to Expect\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of misinformation!","review":"This book is like a mixed bag of jellybeans, heavily weighted toward your least favorite flavor. Every now and then there is something good, but generally it is not enjoyable. Yes, it's nice to read that nosebleeds are normal, but more often I felt the expectations on the mother were unrealistic. Worst of all is the medical misinformation!Several times during my pregnancy I raised concerns with my doctor based on something in \\"What to Expect...\\" Every time the book was wrong! I had worried needlessly. There are better books out there for your medical information, and the Girlfriend's Guide for the practical (and funny) advice on hair and husbands. Don't rely on \\"What to Expect when You're Expecting.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Infantilizing Pregnant Women","review":"Pregnancy is a healthy, normal state but you wouldn't know it to read this book. It presents the things that can go wrong in pregnancy as if they were frequent occurances, and it presents obstetric interventions and practices as if they were always necessary and beneficial. It consecends to and infantilizes the pregnant women. It's tone is, basically, \\"be a good girl do whatever the doctor says.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronizing","review":"I bought this and What To Eat When You're Expecting and found both to be patronizing, simplistic and narrow-minded. No woman could eat that way--at least not any normal woman with a normal life. I ended up feeling guilty and inadequate. I stopped consulting these books, started consulting other, less dogmatic, more sympathetic books, and had a beautiful, healthy baby, born at home in 2 hours. No thanks to their cutesy drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"What to EAT when you're expecting\\"!","review":"This book is so diet-obsessed it is ridiculous. I realize it's important to eat well when you're pregnant, but the authors really do get carried away, making it sound as if eating a hot fudge sundae will irreparably damage your unborn child. There is a lot of helpful information in this book, but it seems like not a page goes by without yet another reference to their totally unrealistic \\"Best Odds\\" diet. I wanted information about pregnancy, not preaching about what I eat."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time mom, steer clear","review":"Okay, I think this book is very informative, but Ron Sullivan (his review) is VERY right. This book made me very nervous about every little ache and pain. It seems like they put in every worst-case scenario possible and when you are a first time mom and you read this, of course you are going to panick. When I get pregnant again, I will not be reading this book, it's way too stressful. I'm sure there are many other informative books out there that don't stress you out as much. Oh, and my husband also wanted to burn the book-he was tired of hearing me get worried every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly negative preparation for childbirth","review":"Zero stars....Good grief!! Childbirth is a normal, natural event. It doesn't have to be a medical emergency---as this book would have you believe. If this is what most pregnant moms are reading---no wonder the c-section rate is as high as it is. All these poor women are taught to expect the worst and then head to all the medical intervention like sheep. A better book by far is HypnoBirthing which teaches you how to approach birth with knowledge, confidence and trust in your own body. Sheesh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Your Baby","review":"I was luckily informed of the true nature of this book before I perused it, so thankfully I had other resources to turn to. In the previous era when doctors did all sorts of unnecessary and torturous things to unsuspecting moms-to-be, this might have been a helpful book.I highly recommend ANY book by Dr. Sears and his wife in lieu of this one as they present options for moms-to-be and solutions to their pregnancy complaints rather than dire consequences. \\"What to Expect\\" is NOT a reassuring book and most of what a hormonal pregnant woman needs is reassurance. And if all you need is some light-hearted assurance that you're not alone in your suffering, try Vicki Iovine's \\"Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\". It's filled with a wealth of experience and valuable information without the scary terminology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this old-school pregnancy primer","review":"This book was one of the many enthusiastic purchases I made in the delighted first days of pregnancy. I knew the book was famous; now I know it to be infamous among parents and doctors alike. At my first OB visit, the nurse gave me an info sheet on recommended pregnancy books; in bold at the bottom it said, \\"We do NOT recommend 'What to Expect'\\". This was confirmation on the conclusion I had already come to. The book is archaic, both in style and content. The organization is horrendous, and information on frightful contra-indications, etc is strewn throughout. A wonderful alternative is the \\"The Pregnancy Bible: Your Complete Guide to Pregnancy and Early Parenthood\\". The organization is much better and it features beautiful photos of mom and baby. \\"Scary stuff\\" is centralized in the back portion of the book, more as a reference than scare tactic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devious deceptful dishonest","review":"When I bought the book it said it was a Revised Edition, that is dishonest, it should say something like used or something to let people know it is a second hand book, I thought it was a newer version, that's why I've sent an email to my friends and placed on my facebook about the terrible service you provided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book because I wanted as much information as possible for my first pregnancy. The layout made it difficult to quickly find information and the writing of the book is horrible. All the cutesy analogies and comments were annoying and unnecessary.I was surprised to hear others comment that they found the book to have too much information that they found scary. Since I was looking for as much information as possible, I didn't mind that they covered every possibility since I knew that was what they were doing. I wanted to know about all the scenarios, good or bad, so I could be knowledgeable about my body's signals.Like I mentioned before, the book is very poorly organized and very very poorly written. An example of the poorly organized aspect of the book is that they talk about the importance of exercise along with diagrams of suggested exercises that are good for you quite late into the book when an exercise regimen can and should be followed in the first trimester."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite what other reviewers say....","review":"I really like this book! It's very informative and I've used it as a resource book as well as have read each chapter as I go through the pregnancy. I don't think it provides too much information...that depends on how much info the person wants and I like to have as much info as possible. I didn't find it scary or bossy or anything like that. It's a very honest, truthful account of being pregnant. I would definitely tell friends and family to read it as well as other books and information sources to obtain a good idea of what you're going through. This book has stood the test of time and revisions and has shown to outlast many other pregnancy books. My mother read this book when she was pregnant with me! I suggest buying the book and making up your own mind on what you think of it. I think alot of the other reviewers are being a bit too hard and need to lighten up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather misleading...","review":"I found that even though this book is well organized and is easy to read, it does not provide risks, side affects, and natural alternatives for many medical procedures presented. It encourages kind of a wait and see attitude in terms of preparing for labor and birth instead of really providing the information in a factual way so that women and think about and make the best informed decisions regarding procedures and meds. I found that to be somewhat irresponsible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pregnancy Bible","review":"This book had every piece of information I needed when I was pregnant. It identified growth stages of the fetus by chapter so that I always knew how my baby was evolving that month. I didn't read the diet thing. My pregancy diet strategy: eat what I wanted. It was the only time in my life I was allowed to do that. So I put on a little weight. I lost it later. No biggie.Anyway, this book helped a lot when I was worried about things going on with my body. Toward the end of my pregnancy, I read and re-read the delivery chapter, and felt prepared. If you want tried and true advice and reliable medical information, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money(more info on FREE websites)","review":"The free book the doctor gave me at my first appointment gave me more useful information than this book(and all the baby websites have more info as well). I didn't see the point in separating each month out. The what to expect this month were basically the same every month. There were questions and answers that should be organized by category not month. I did not read the entire book because I got bored with it but I do not remember any section on single mothers. Some of us are single not by choice and don't like reading about husbands and wives all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"The basic information and the organization of this book is OK, but it encourages too much pampering. Like other reviewers, I found it annoying and patronizing. Seems to cater mostly to stay at home suburban moms and moms-to-be, but I have a full time job/career and live in the city. The book needs to get real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but a handy reference.","review":"Like any book, you must sift through things you agree with and things you don't. Filled with great bits of information for pregnancy, month by month - both typical and unusual. Easy to read and handy to reference. A bit biased on some things, so don't let this be your only pregnancy book. A few others to pick up now: Baby Bargains, Baby Signs, and The No-Cry Sleep Solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, it is ok","review":"This book scratches the surface of what is is like to experience pregnancy.....keep looking"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good overall knowledge; explains changes your body goes thru","review":"What to expect while you're expecting is a good, well rounded reference guide for the expectant mother. This book can be very reassuring for the first time mother who is not familiar with all the changes her body may be going through. It is also a very helpful reference if you suspect that something may be seriously wrong with you. Of course, the authors suggest seeing a physician immediately if something should go wrong- and this book is not intended to take the place of adequate medical care. The only thing this book really lacks is an adequate description of what the actual birth experience is like; for this I recommend, The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy (Iovine, 1995). This book is user friendly, and provides vicarious details of countless other women and their birth experiences. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book some minor problems","review":"This is indeed a great book that I think every expecting women should have. It can answer all my questons and concern.Some minor problems: the author says if air gets into your v...it will enter your bloodstream and make you sick, even die. I cannot understand how that happens so I asked my OB, and my OB agreed with me that no way this can happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting","review":"This was my BIBLE for my pregnancy. Everytime I had a question about something I just used the book for reference. This book follows your pregnancy month by month, and answers common questions that go along with the big event. Well laid out and organized, I recommend this book to every woman expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was my bible during my first pregnancy","review":"I bought this book because a friend of mine had it when she had her kids. I figured I would get it and some of the stuff in it might be helpful. Everything was totally on track.. If I had questions, i didn't bother with asking other people, I went to my book first. My husband and I are working on baby # 2 and to better prepare our son for this blessed event, we ordered 2 books jsut for him from the same authors, \\"what to expect when your mommy's having a baby\\" and \\"what to expect when the new baby comes home\\". I recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book can be your best friend","review":"This book has an answer for ALL of your pregancy questions. I had a bit of bleeding during the first three months of my pregnancy and this book was the only one that explained why (and that 20% of women DO in fact bleed a bit during the first trimester). All other books pretty much prepared me for a miscarriage. Don't wait to give this book as a shower gift, get it as soon as the doctor says \\"Yes, you're going to have a baby!\\" It'll be your most calming friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic information, but some bias by the authors","review":"This book certainly gives a lot of information, but it is biased against certain professionals. For instance, laboratory professionals are portrayed as mistake-makers (these are the people that do all your blood tests, etc.) The laboratory professionals I know are people with graduate degrees. I notice that 2 of the authors are nurses- they never once say that the nursing profession makes mistakes.I also agree with another reviewer that it has an alarmist attitude and the authors definately have their own ideas of what is right and wrong to do during a pregnancy. You'd think that drinking a soda or getting your hair highlighted is tantamount to shooting heroin in their eyes! Lighten up- pregnancy lasts 9 months, what's wrong with a glass of wine once in a while?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are Better Books Out There","review":"When I found out that I was expecting, this is the first book that I purchased. I didn't really like the book - the information seems a bit dated (like the information on exercise). I treated the book more like a reference book and used it to look up things like swollen ankles and feet or safe medications to take. Of all the books I purchased, I liked Your Pregnancy Week by Week by Glade B. Curtis and Judith Schuler. That book was a bit more informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one, 0 stars","review":"The writers of this book are very incredibly bossy and theysometimes don't seem to know what they are talking about. I found this book very frustrating. Their attitude is disturbing enough for me to give a negative review. Don't bother with this book. To give you an idea even the woman on the cover looksreally bummed out; probably from reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common Sense 101","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of information in this book. The majority of it is common sense and I have only been able to refer to it a few times. When I purchased this book, I also bought \\"The Expectant Father,\\" (Brott/Ash) and found it to be much more useful. My spouse and I have even argued over who got to read it when because it is so interesting. Plus, I prefer the layout much more than the question-answer layout of \\"What to Expect...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"guilt trip extraordinare","review":"i felt like i was repeatedly being bashed over the head: \\"you are a rotten mother and the baby hasn't even been born yet!\\" i'm working hard to be a good mother and i don't need a lot of guilt for being less than perfect. i was extremely disapointed with this book. try your pregnancy week by week for info on the baby and the girlfriend's guide for useful, REAL info on what's happening to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it unless you really enjoy paranoia","review":"I found the tone of this book condescending and sanctimonious, and the recommendations overly paranoid, as if they are afraid someone might sue them. Frequently they state that there is \\"no known risk\\" to something but then tell you not to do it anyway. That's my choice, a book should just tell me the risks or lack thereof! I have found much more balanced, sane advice in the book my OB gave me (some offical pub of the OB-GYN association). Also think they should reference weeks pregnant vs. months as no doc I know refers to months. The food info is highly paranoid. You can eat a very healthy diet and still allow yourself a treat now and then, all without putting your baby at risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is your first baby throw this book in the bin","review":"Having read all the reviews on this book and many others I purchased 4 books. I read this one first and wish I hadn't read it at all. This is my first baby so I wanted to learn as much as possible. However this book has done nothing but scare me to death about the months ahead. It concentrates on everything that can go wrong or already has gone wrong in a previous pregnancy and what to expect next. Yes I want to know what's in store but this book is not encouraging in the slightest. If you do actually have problems it is probably very informative. First chance I get I am selling this to the secondhand book store. I would not recommend any first timers to read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A scary and unhelpful read","review":"I'm actually throwing this book away. I'm not even pregnant yet, just trying, and I already feel like I've screwed up my pregnancy. I have been advocating a more natural birth for myself, without doctors and IVs and the typical interventions, and this book has made me feel that unless I consent to invasive procedures, receiving pain medications, allowing my labor to be measured by everyone else's standards, or being cut wide open, that I will have somehow \\"let down the team\\", or will bring on the horrible situations outlined in the book that can go wrong as a result.I'm going to try Dr. Sears' book; it has been highly recommended for women like me who want to try for a natural birth if it's possible. I don't want to feel guilty or worried to death about my choice, and that's exactly how this book made me feel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbed-down and erroneous","review":"I honestly don't know how this book got so popular, as a labor doula, I can honestly say that Naomi Wolfe and others are right about this book. IT's alarmist and condescending and woefully incomplete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick! This book will give any expectant mom nightmares....","review":"I HATE this book. I rushed out to buy it when my husband and I were trying for #1 (who is now 21 months old). It is practically militant in its views about diet- in what universe is a bagel a once-a-week treat?? This book did not help me at all. Its tone is condescending, its answers pat, and basically, while reading it I felt like there was no way I could ever be a good mom. I know it's the one everyone buys, but I think it's just because they don't know better. Even my OB said she doesn't recommend it to patients because it freaks too many of them out!We're expecting #2 now, and I got this book out again, but as you can see I'm back on Amazon looking for a better book this time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too helpful.....","review":"This book is mostly other peoples questions and simple answers to them. It may be somewhat helpful to a first time mother with no experience but definitely not helpful to a second time Mom or someone more experienced looking for deeper answers to not so common questions. This book also says practically nothing about the growing baby inside you, the thing that interests me the most!"},{"rating":"1","title":"highly overrated--THE BIRTH BOOK By Dr.Sears is MUCH better!","review":"This book is highly overrated. I was very disappointed---it seems to need updating in many areas. If you are wanting info on natural childbirth stay far away from this book--it approaches pregnancy and birth from a very \\"medical\\" viewpoint.Dr. Sears books....like The Birth Book is SOOO much better---It is more up to date and very unbiased."},{"rating":"1","title":"leave this one in the store","review":"With the benefit of hindsight, this was by far the worst book that my wife and I read before our triplets were born. I recommend if you want to know everything that might go wrong and need a reason(s) to visit the doctor for mood altering perscriptions. Honestly, this book was a waste of space. We actually threw it out. One star is way to many."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to expect from a dated attitude","review":"This book is terrible. Alarmist and very \\"doctor knows best\\" and treats moms-to-be as if they can't think for themselves. Completely ignores hollistic and natural pregnancy approaches; has only 2 paragraphs on home birth in all 600 pages. Very much a \\"pat on the shoulder\\" attitude like you'd get from the architypical elderly male OB. Still assumes you're going to give birth in a hospital, on your back. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to get Paranoid when you are expecting","review":"This book is over the limit.

She makes it sound as though it is a crime to indulge once in a while on pizzas and a dessert.

The main thrust of this book is that almost anything can happen in a pregnancy, but it's nothing to cause worry....\\"i have morning sickness,\\" \\" i don't have morning sickness\\" blah blah blah. I would have liked to find out what was going on with my baby, how big is it, does it have fingers yet? This book made me feel like I was gearing up for nine months of medical maladies, not a wonderful blessing. Focus on the baby, or at least mention it please!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too preachy","review":"Although this book contains a lot of information, much of it is delivered in a preachy, finger-pointing, and condescending way. I'm a perfectionist and want to be the best mom I can be, but there is no way I could do everything this book suggested. And by the time I finished reading the different concerns/complications of every possible problem that could arise, I was nearly panicked. It was overwhelming for me, being a first-time mom, and already worried about everything anyway... It just didn't seem to be based in reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the most UNHELPFUL pregnancy book around","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It is not even written by a doctor, nor is the information that accurate! It will make you INSANE during pregnancy. The advice is stringent and makes you feel as if you cannot even take a sip of water out of the faucet without thinking of all the harmful effects it will do to your baby! STay away from this book!!! There are sooo many better ones out there"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad idea","review":"this book will make you worry, consider every worst case scenario possible (in the middle of the night). it's demeaning, and i wish i never bought it. big, big mistake. go with the pregnancy book by sears instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this book!","review":"This is a book that tells you evetything that can go wrong in your pregnancy. I found it to be filled with many questions that just indice fear. I asked my doctor and he said it is the worst pregnancy book ever written. He said \\"Pregnancy Weekly\\" is much better and I found it to be so helpful and informative,unlike this book. I know it is incredibly popular, but it scared me half to death with all of its do's and don'ts. I say get another book. This one is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Unreadable, Definitly Unbearable","review":"Be afraid, be very afraid, seems to be the purpose of this book. Be afraid of birth, be afraid of your body and be afraid to be fat. This book will prepare you only to be a frightened, demure, good little patient, with a medicalized birth full of procedures and a subsequent \\"emergency\\" C-section. This technocratic freebie is astonishingly outdated and promotes very unhealthy weight management that may CAUSE complications! This book tears down women's confidence in themselves and their ability to give birth with a condescending tone and a bias that states: DOCTOR=GOD. I received much more useful birthing information from books such as \\"Husband Coached Childbirth\\" by Robert A. Bradley MD, \\"Choosing Waterbirth\\" by Lakshmi Bertram and \\"Primal Mothering in a Modern World\\" by Hygeia Halfmoon Phd. Your pregnancy/birth will be as beautiful or as miserable as YOU believe it will be. Trust your body and your baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Away From This Book!","review":"This is one of the worst books for pregnant women. It is scary and will provoke anxiety. Try to read something a little more kind - like The Pregnancy Book by Dr. William Sears. Get good solid information without a lot of bad advice. Become the expert on your pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not what I needed during my first pregnancy","review":"I'm not going to say that this is a bad book ,because it's not. I personally found it to negetive and scary. Instead of helping me it made me insecure. I'm sure that there are people who swear by this book (as seen in some of the reviews) and some condemn this book (as seen in other reviews)I personally agree with the two woman that recommended \\"Babytales\\" by M.S. Woodson and \\"The Girl friends guid to pregnancy\\" by Vicki Iovine. I also agree with the person who said t's not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why So Negative?","review":"I do not understand why this series is so popular - is it the good title or just that they have been around some time? My wife and I went out and got an arm full of books and this was one of them. The positive side is that it did seam to provide some good information in a reference method. It also gave us a general idea on what was going on and some of the things to look for. What we did not like is it seams that this book should have come with an overbearing adult wagging her finger at you. I don't think we needed or cared for the tone the book had about the authors militant views on what not to do - is drinking 1 coke really going to be that bad? It is almost like the authors wanted to scare you silly for nine months. Overall an overview, but if you are aggravated by being talked down to then I would look someplace else."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to WORRY about when you're expecting...","review":"This book is more of a hindrance than a help. After reading the first section, and perusing the rest, I had become convinced that I was about to miscarry, I had resurected adolescent food/body image issues, and I worried myself into bed for three days. I found the advise to fathers-to-be regarding how to help keep their partners attractive/slim (!) during pregnancy particularly offensive. Pregnancy is a beautiful thing that women have been doing successfully for many thousands of years. Throw this book away and call your mom instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else!!!","review":"This book was horrible. All it did was scare the crap out of me whenever I read it. Common problems such as spotting and cramping were never mentioned rather they were said to be signs of a miscarraige. Plus it only gave you info by the month. I wanted to read about my baby's progress every week, not month. It is time for this book to be retired. Please don't waste your money on this book. Buy another!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best selling, but not the best information!","review":"I was snaked in by the label that told me this book is the \\"Bestselling Book on Pregnancy.\\" I quickly found out that doesn't mean it has the best information. The information is presented in a way that is very much in favor of \\"whatever your doctor says is right,\\" and does not at all encourage intelligent, well-informed women to make their own decisions. The information is scanty on many subjects, and the part on diet makes you feel as though you're causing a birth defect every time you give into a craving. I'd recommend any of Dr. Sears' book over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow -incredibly condescending!","review":"This book was SO preachy and condescending I could hardly stand to read it. Save your money and get the Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"More fuel for the fire . . .","review":"This book did more to stress me out during my pregnancy than anything else I experienced in those nine months. Yes, it's true that some women do experience rare conditions explained in this book, but most women won't, and throwing every possible complication into a book on general pregnancies probably needlessly frightens many of women. Our babies don't need that added stress! My certified nurse midwife laughed out loud when I asked her if I should avoid deli meats and goat cheese (as advised in 'What to Expect'), telling me that I'd be better off not reading it, and our doula told me she wished she could burn every copy she came across. And the way the authors gloss over c-sections really gets my goat. It's *major* surgery, one with many, many more risks for both mothers and babies, not something to be taken lightly. I'd recommend books like Henci Goer's \\"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book to be completely useless","review":"This book was given to me by someone as a gift. I found it to be no help at all. Often, it didn't address any of the questions I did have and was packed with a lot of information that I felt was pretty much common sense. I also found it odd that certain areas had a lot of information and other areas had relatively little or nothing. For example it had roughly three pages on the ill-effects of smoking but only about one page combined on alcohol and narcotics. Honestly, I would find a different resource for my questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Book","review":"This is a terrible book. Buy one of the many other books that provide helpful information. This book is competely unrealistic--like telling you that every time you put something in your mouth as a pregnant women you should think about whether it is the best possible nutrition for your baby. Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"written by dummies","review":"My favorite part of this useless book falls under the header 'Underwater Births'-'...Most physicians and hospitals feel that the risk of the fetus drowning, though probably remote, is still too great to make the procedure an acceptable one.' Did the authors, physicians, and hospitals overlook the fact that a fetus exists in amniotic FLUID for nine months prior to birth???"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad business","review":"Never received the product. Don't advertise what u don't have or if u are out of town......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best seller for good reason","review":"The book is very interestingI bought it for me gf who is expecting and she gave me some things to read and found myself reading it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Jenny McCarthy's book was better...","review":"Almost in to my 6th month of my first pregnancy and I can't give you one single thing that this book has done for me yet! If you are the atypical pregnancy with barely any pregnancy symptoms, this book definitely has nothing for you. (However for some people, who may have no medical background at all, it can be somewhat helpful on the tests that will be done and what they are for.) I was more interested in the \\"how the baby is growing\\" subject... which is not even addressed in this book. Also this book has alot of Q&A which are useless questions in most cases, and some of them make you wonder? But honestly the internet and your friends/family can give you better advice. Personally I think it is a waste of money, unless you get a free copy from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but there are better","review":"It has the basics, but is a bit old fashioned and seems to be getting outdated. Very dry reading without much in the way of detailed medical explanations either. Recommend The Mother of All Pregnancy Books for more heartfelt explanations of what you and your other may be going through, and the Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy for more detailed medical descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for typical pregnancy","review":"This book did not list the not so common things that could happen during pregnancy and post partum. I don't feel the diet guidelines were realistic and the question and answer format was more specific then general. I would have preferred more thorough descriptions. I do not plan to use this book for my second pregnancy. I would look into the more modern books that cover more symptoms and accurately describe post partum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Information!","review":"My husband asked me to stop reading this book because it was freaking me out! Even as I sit in front of my computer to type this I worry about the poison spewing from my video display monitor (yes, there's an entire section that talks about how miscarriages have never been linked to monitors, but you should still worry about it). Maybe I'll try reading it again during my second pregnancy. But, I have enough on my mind with this being my first that this book doesn't have to add to any of my worries."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Scary Book","review":"PLease, please heed everyone else's advice and look into other books--there are so many other great ones out there! Thsi book is enough to panic any newly pregnant woman--I read it shortly after finding out I was pregnant and it scared me horribly--my two close friends who are also pregnant/new mothers and I refer to it as \\"the Scary book.\\" Anyway, I met with a prenatal consultant at my hospital who said she absolutely does not recommed this book and cannot understand why it continues to sell so well-- call your doctor or prenatal support at your hospital and ask for recommedations. I love the Girlfriends Guide and even Pregnancy for dummies! My husband also really likes the Expectant Father book. Anyway, good luck to everyone and healthy pregnancies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What to expect doesn't meet expectations","review":"Where did all the inane questions come from? The question and answer format certainly did not answer questions I have, and many were somewhat redundant. Although this is an updated edition, it falls short of meeting the needs of expectant mothers in 2002. Read on further through the list of excellent pregnancy books for one that will give more encouraging information for today."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would never recommend this to new expectant moms!","review":"I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews out there when I say \\"don't buy this book\\"! First, I do not like the question/answer format - it is not helpful, and sometimes a question might occur outside of the month it's lumped into. Second, I was unable to find a lot of answers to my questions, but I could find them on the internet relatively easily. Third, why on earth is this book considered a \\"must have\\" for the expectant mom? It's more of a nutrition book than anything, and if I were to follow the \\"best odds diet\\" I'd be eating all the time and worried about everything I put in my mouth. I will never recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The UNthinking woman's guide...","review":"This is a good book for women who do not wish to do anything more in pregnancy than let their OBs order them around. A far better choice for moms-to- be is Henci Goer's \\"The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth.\\" I might add that it has an average customer rating of 5 stars, versus 3 for \\"What to expect...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What to expect if you believe everything doctor says","review":"The title is unfortunately very accurate, and that is the problem. Comes up short on all counts when compared to 'Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn: the complete guide', by Keppler, Simkin and Whalley. The cover of WTEWYE shows the pregnant woman sitting passively in a rocker. In PC&N she is standing on her own two feet, seeking out information as an active participant, and preparing herself for what she WANTS, not just what she can expect. WTEWYE has an undeservedly enthusiastic following, and is part of the problem in the American way of birth, rather than part of the solution. Don't do your pregnant friends a disservice. Get them a book that respects their ability to make their own choices. This is not the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Buying this for Pregnant Women Already!","review":"Wish I could give it 0 stars! This book is so full of worst case scenarios, that it will drive a pregnant woman insane!I read through parts of a friend's copy of this book before I got pregnant, and thought \\"Now THAT's a great form of birth control!\\" Then when I did get pregnant, I got two copies as gifts... UGH! 99% of the things described in this book don't happen to every woman while pregnant. It's NOT normal to be constipated for nine months straight!This worst-case scenario pregnancy guide is more like a worst-ever pregnancy gift. Save the woman some headaches!

It's a sure fire way to freak a woman out during a normal time in her life.PLEASE Stop Buying this for Pregnant Women Already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book!","review":"Look for something that celebrates the joy, miracles and excitement of pregnancy. This book has one page each month on what is happening with baby and mom, then page after page of maladies and potential complications which it titles, \\"What you may be concerned about.\\" It should be titled, \\"What you have never heard of until you read this book, and is so rare that it probably won't happen to you, but you can now be scared about.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"PICK ANOTHER BOOK","review":"If you are pregnant and looking for a good reference there are so many other books out there that won't have you questioning your every move.

I returned it the next day; after reading a few pages I became worried that what I was carrying was not an embryo but a dead blob of cells. There are plenty of supportive and informative books that don't dwell on every possible thing that can go wrong. Choose them, and don't be suckered into buying this one just because everyone else does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who decided this was the ultimate pregnancy guide?","review":"And where are they so I can smack them?This book is a piece of garbage that is organized in a horrible fashion, has lots of fluff information, is preachy and condescending, and even SCARY at times. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.Apparently everyone at baby showers, all your friends and relatives (who haven't been pregnant recently), and everyone you pass on the street THINKS you need to have this book. But that means they clearly haven't had to use it! Warn your friends and family not to waste their money!A catchy title does not a helpful book make!If you are so unfortunate as to receive a copy of this book for free, DISCARD IT IMMEDIATELY without reading. You will feel worse about yourself and the pregnancy for having cracked it open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure why everyone gets this book","review":"I am really not sure why this is such a popular book. All it did was scare me. They do have some great infomation, but I found that many of our questions were unanswered. Also, a bunch of the sections refer readers to the authors' other books rather than giving a good answer in the book I already owned - the book should be more self contained, not an ad for the authors' other works. I pretty much stopped reading this book by my fifth month after a friend gave me her pregnancy book. I found it much less scary, more complete and better organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's time to move beyond this book!","review":"The only reason this book has sold so many copies is that most OBGYN offices give it away. This book is a study in how not to have a natural, joyous pregnancy and birth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending and Patronizing","review":"I believe that healthy food is good. I eat a very healthy diet. However, the authors are condescending and patronizing towards expectant mothers. They act as if we are nutritional idiots who never heard of whole wheat bread before. And if you smoke a cigarette, drink a glass of wine or a cup of coffee or fail to breastfeed, you are a murderer. Period. Truly makes me wonder how my generation ever made it into the world healthy with mothers who drank martinis, smoked, and had white bread toast for breakfast. Good advice but don't take it too literally or you'll have a miserable, guilt ridden pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"As a first time mom I found this book informative and helpful. This book does list a lot of the things that could go wrong but I don't see a problem with that. You should want to know the symptoms in case something does happen, better than not knowing when something is going wrong. Nothing in the book bothered me to read about, actually it put my mind at ease about a few things I was experiencing and I enjoyed being able to see what I could be feeling from month to month and how the baby was growing. I couldn't stick to the diet they recommended but I was never worried about that as long as my weight was under control. Unless your a paranoid, pessimistic person I think this is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Women","review":"My husband wans't very interested in this particular book because he said \\"he already knew everything he needs to know\\". I think I should have bought a more fairytale type book as I think it makes him nervous to hear about anything that can go wrong with his first baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Beginners","review":"This is a great all-around baby book for first-time Moms and Dads, from month-by-month developmental charts to when to call the doctor and when to relax and wait. Best alternatives are Sears and Leach, or you can pick from conservative to liberal books on child behavior or books on Dads or single parenting. My favorite recent book on parenting is \\"I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,\\" by Bruce Stockler, which captures the incredible chaos, joy, anxiety and humor in being a parent--and making priorities. Also loved Annie Lamott's \\"Operating Instructions\\" (although some women I know object to her bizarre background.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip The Diet Section","review":"Very useful resource for me as a first time mother, however the diet section is unrealistic and not nutritionally sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate, waste of money","review":"This book is an inaccurate, misleading load of garbage. The authors gloss over c-sections as a \\"minor\\" procedure, when in reality, c-sections result in 4 TIMES MORE maternal deaths than vaginal births. \\"What To Expect\\" makes bettter burning material than reading material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Upset!!","review":"I was given this book with my first baby , however it has sections on loss but yet it doesnt really help, i have buried my first two children and it did nothing ot help me. It also doesnt help with how to deal with the NICU staff or how to deal with them or what expect at lest when you walk into a NICU. The section they have on Incompent Cervix is useless! I went to the book again when i was told that is what i have and it did NOTHING to help or reinsure me that i could have a child. It is nothing for the high risk !! i think it is a same you could be in trouble and refer to the book and you get so much nothing out of it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for 1st pregnancy","review":"I used this book when I was pregnant. It helped answer a lot of my questions and was a great resource. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is pregnant. I learned a lot from this book and it helped to let me know when I needed to call the Dr. or when things were normal. Great resource. I wouldn't be pregnant without it.

Yes, me, a man. But my wife was expecting and there were times that I had to figure out what in the heck was going on. So, I read. For this, the book was really helpful.

Every single question I had about weird things happening with my body, emotional issues or questions about the stages of growth of the fetus were answered in this book. I found that the clarity and amount of information provided allowed me to be more peaceful during my pregnancy. Instead of calling my OB all the time, I was able to refer to the book and relax.Some of the reviewers indicate that this book has made them more anxious. In my own experience, this book has made me much more serene. If being prepared and informed helps you be more relaxed, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expect To Learn and Grow","review":"I get so tired of people saying dumb things about this book. Very few books will have everything that you need. Surely you know this by now? This is a book that will teach a lot in a lot time or a little in a little time. This means, read a section and then let it sink in before you go on to get the maxium benefit. It will be around forever and I am very happy that it will be a treasure for ever more. There are certainly other books that will fill in other gaps for different areas in your life with your family: Gentle Baby Care, by an author who has been around, Elizabeth Pantley, and for when the baby goes into toddler hood and preschool stages, Mommy-CEO, revised edition, by Jodie Lynn.

Buy at your own risk..."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible--would never recommend this book","review":"I would have given this book 0 stars if that was an option. This book is definately one of the worst books on the market. It does not prepare the reader for labor and delivery at all. After reading this book (several times), and thinking I was prepared for labor--I found myself having an unnecessary c-section under general anesthetic (when all I wanted was a natural birth). I wish this book would have spoken more about the risks of pitocen, epidurals, internal fetal monitering, etc...and the plusses of natural births with a midwife at home or in a birthing center."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best read with discern","review":"There is some information in this book that is useful- especially if you're new to the whole pregnancy & birth thing. My advice is to read \\"Husband-Coached Childbirth\\", \\"Natural Childbirth The Bradley Way\\", \\"The Baby Book\\", & \\"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding\\" THEN read this book. You'll find you'll mentally discard 95% of it. Content that will either make you laugh, or genuinlly make you angry. But either way you'll feel great concern for those women who consider this book the end all be all of pregnancy advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere if you're into thinking for yourself...","review":"This book clearly illustrates the total authority the general public gives medical doctors, and the lack of power people perceive they have in making decisions about their health care. Instead of telling you about options you have in regards to tests (which you might not really need, or want) and how you should be progressing, it reads as an alarmist list of directions on how to be pregnant and submit to your doctor without question. Scary stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too good because of format","review":"The format of the book is by the month. However, my doctor and all other literature refer to the week from the date of last period. I have absolutely no idea where in the book to refer to in order to guage development of baby or my own progress ! I dont recommend the book unless the format is changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the Negative Reviews","review":"The readers who give this book negative reviews are taking themselves, their pregnancies or at least this book too seriously. This book is very comprehensive, and no one woman could or would find every passage in this book relevant. But it's great as a REFERENCE precisely because it is so comprehensive.So, ladies, don't get scared that everything discussed in this book will happen to you. Skip the parts that are not applicable to you. But use it if you're having symptoms or need guidelines. That's what it's great for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP READING THIS AND BUY THE PREGNANCY BOOK BY DR. SEARS","review":"The best advice I ever received from my midwife was to stop reading What To Expect and go buy The Pregnancy Book by Dr. Sears. All I gleaned from What To Expect was that there were a whole host of possibly bad things that could happen throughout the pregnancy. We don't need to read all that negative stuff when we are starting the journey of a lifetime. The Dr. Sears books are all wonderful, giving you practical advice and information about development (and yes, it covers the possibly bad stuff too, just not in an alarmist way). What To Expect is negative and alarmist, while The Pregnancy Book is possitive and affirming. After all, pregnancy is a time to celebrate our bodies and the baby growing inside! So go buy The Pregnancy Book, put your feet up, read and relax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away , the cover should have a warning!","review":"I have had this book for the 8 months and feel now that the girl on the front should have warned me to stay away. She looks positivly miserable and most of the book is the same. Very dry in it's contents. This is not the book to read if you have any sense of humor about your pregnancy or want to get the real scoop! Do yourself a favor, Go for Pregnancy for Dummies or the Girlfriends Guide, they are much better reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was very informative for me as a first mom & it answered all my questions","review":"This book was great! The reviews about it making people freak out or worry too much. Not me. It just depends upon the person I think.

This book will go on explaining very rare things! that chances are, you will NEVER need to know about.Also, your imagination gets very active while pregnant (hormonal) and having all this negative information can trigger night terrors, and night mares.... talking by experience.My doctor forbid me from reading it any more.There are other books that will provide detail information about your current stages (and websites) without having to read through everything bad that can happen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"incites anxiety and needless fear","review":"I did NOT like this book, it doesn't seem to help at all and is very preachy. I am healthy and am doing everything right in pregnancy, but this book makes me doubt myself. A good pregnancy book should not incite anxieties and false fears. PLUS, there is minimal info on morning sickness, which is my worst problem. Very disappointing. The diet section is just ridiculous - I am a very healthy eater who eats organic foods as much as possible but this book still made me feel like a junk-food hog (and I am NOT). I would only recommend this book for women with little-to-no prior knowledge of pregnancy, because it does have most of the basic clinical information. Women who are already educated about pregnancy basics would benefit more by reading other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"This book is the most over rated book out there. This is my first pregnancy and I have *tons* of questions, especially in my first trimester. This book answered NONE of them. Simple questions like, I'm spotting is that commom (yes).

I love The Mother of all Pregnancy Books and Merriam (sp) Stoppard's The Complete Guide to Pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror Show","review":"In my case, the idea of pregnancy was a little scary at first, so I bought this book in order to be as well informed as I could... the results were: a whole week crying in desperation and fear that all those awful things could happen to me at once, and the urge to burn the book in the fireplace at the first opportunity.Another thing that gave me shivers was the authors' obsession with the nearly demonic effects of eating refined sugar. It seems that all problems in pregnancy are caused by sugar... It's amazing to think how millions of women throughout the decades have had so many kids and are still alive, in spite of their sinful sugar consumption.Luckily, I have understanding people around me who eased off my mind from the horrors of pregnancy. Now I am prepared to enjoy every stage of this awesome part of my life. With another book, of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one","review":"I really hated this book. The authors are very condescending and make you feel bad at every page turn. I think that most of the information in the book is correct but they way that they deliver it is uncalled for. Who needs to be belittled and berated when pregnancy is supposed to be a happy time. Instead I would recommend:Pregnancy Childbirth and the Newborn : The Complete Guide By: Penny SimkinIt is much better written and enjoyable to read. It also helped quell my fears of labor and childbirth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pregnancy must-have","review":"This is a great book, but you must remember that it is just a reference guide and should not be taken as gospel. Every woman and every pregnancy is different. Use it as a guide, it will help you through every step of your pregnancy, but don't get upset or scared if thing don't match up perfectly. I read every segment over and over again and drove myself nuts at first, but then I relaxed and enjoyed the pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Provincial and outdated","review":"After recently finding out that I was pregnant, I purchased this book as I figured it was the \\"bible of pregnancy\\". What I found instead was an outdated and superficial overview of pregnancy. On a basic level, the authors continually refer to one's husband, which I find so outdated in 2002 when one may have a same sex partner, or no partner at all. While this seemingly superficial complaint is obviously not a reason to buy the book, I do find that it encapsulates the sophomoric and provincial ways of the author. If I could return the book, I would have. Instead I put it out with the recycling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhh..a little too much information?","review":"As grandma says, \\"Read it and you'll begin to believe it\\" If you're expecting stay away from this book, especially a first pregnancy. It's info. overload & most situations will not pertain to you! I still have the helpful (skinny) booklet on pregnancy my insurance company sent to me years ago--the first time I was expecting. It gives you the basics w/ some encouraging words as well. A good dr. who is caring, reassuring...is the best advice source!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read any book but this","review":"This is absolutely, no holds barred, the worst pregnancy book available. Avoid it all costs. Not only is much of the information inaccurate the writing and organization are terrible, the author is condescending and pedantic. It's words and advice are geared toward making expectant moms feel frightened, stupid, and unable to make their own choices. It also offers tips that put the mother in danger . Avoid this book. Instead pick up A Good Birth, A Safe Birth. It is much better, very empowering, and provides more accurate information."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to be AFRAID of...","review":"Here's what the one star is for: I liked tracking my baby's development month by month. It was nice to know what was growing, what was new, what she could do each month. Other than that, it was useless. The worst thing about this book is that it tells the reader that they cannot trust their own intuition but instead to take their physician's word as gospel. Instead of providing calm advice about things that might be going on of concern during a woman's pregnancy, it tells you to run to your doctor. The message this book sends it that everything is something to worry about and women shouldn't be trusted to know their bodies well enough to have an opinion. Ladies, DON'T READ THIS BOOK! Get Ina May's Guide to Childbirth for a far more realistic book that looks out for the woman rather than the medical industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book very condescending","review":"Every pregnancy is different, including how much weight a woman puts on. There are so many variables, and yet the authors of this book again and again generalize and imply that any woman who puts on more weight than THEY recommend has been sitting around snacking on bon-bons and watching television. What about a woman who is simply too sick to get out of bed with her pregnancy? I found myself increasingly frustrated and insulted by the constant, smug rehashing of this issue.My ob-gyn and perinatal care coordinator both pooh-poohed this one, too, specifically because of these broad generalizations."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't helpful.","review":"I bought this, right after I found out I was pregnant. I'm not in the medical field and thought it would be helpful.I did like the beginning of each chapter of \\"what to expect this month\\". Other then that it didn't address much of anything that helped me. I found all the information I used online or from other women. I felt the information in this book was stuff you hear anyway from other women, or in your classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like new","review":"The book was in excellent condition as if it was new. I had this book with my first child and now I've reordered it for a relative and she is very pleased with the book. I believe every mother should read this book it gives you various views on your pregnancy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This book was not only scary to read, it took the joy and excitement and miracle out of having a baby. Yes, it has lot's of information, about things you'll most likely never need to know about (unless you read this book). I found it depressing and frightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed with this book....","review":"What to expect does have a lot of information regarding child and mother to be development, but there is also a lot of information in there which talks about the problems that can occur during pregnancy. While the risks and potential problems are important to be aware of, there is a way in which the risks and problems can be discussed realistically without causing fear. After getting anxious about all of the potential complications, I put the book down and only read the sections which didn't loosely or incompletely discuss what can go wrong during pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too negative","review":"I have to weigh in with the folks who said it was much too negative. I totally agree. I am in my 4th month of an easy pregnancy (knock wood) but in month one I was wondering if I had an eptopic pregnancy and kept looking to see if I was miscarrying. I get very tired of opening this book and seeing \\"I'm very worried about...\\" or \\"Am I normal if I have...\\" It gets old and depressing very fast. I am treating my pregnancy like a healthy, normal female activity and am enjoying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this ever get to be called the pregnancy bible?","review":"I am a first-time mom and eagerly bought this book. I think it is way too basic, fear-mongering and just plain boring. My other major complaint is that she continually uses the word \\"husband\\" and \\"father\\". Not all of us out there fit into these categories - other books out there talk about raising a child alone and/or use the word \\"partner\\". This book is just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading - do not recommend!","review":"As a childbirth educator, I found that even though this book is well organized and is easy to read, it does not provide risks, side affects, and natural alternatives for many medical procedures presented. It encourages kind of a wait and see attitude in terms of preparing for labor and birth instead of really providing the information in a factual way so that women and think about and make the best informed decisions regarding procedures and meds. I found that to be quite irresponsible. I think this may be one of the reasons we have a 25% ceserean rate in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Pregnancy Book Ever","review":"Worst. Book. Ever. That's really all that needs to be said. Very preachy and makes you worry about everything. Try Sheila Kitzinger's Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth, Ina May's Guide to Childbirth, Spiritual Midwifery by Ina May Gaskin, Gentle Birth Choices by Barbara Harper, or anything else with a positive upbeat tone. What to Expect When You're Expecting was recommended to me during my first pregnancy and it made me worry endlessly. It focuses on negativity and all of the things that could go wrong and speaks very little about the joys and natural wonder of pregnancy and childbirth. Thankfully at some point between my first and second pregnancies, the book got wet and grew mold so I threw it where it belonged all along - in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"The helpful guide to pregnancy","review":"I do absolutely reccommend this book. I found it very helpful. However it does not take the place of a real life childbirth class which I believe is absolutely essential for all new mothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Help","review":"My midwife has this book & she lends it to her \\"patients\\". My girlfriend first had & thought it was a great help. Currently I have it (only 7 weeks to go). I find it a great guide & like the way it is set out - month by month or use the cross reference. I don't know some reviews are so negative. I didn't find it full of diets, neither did it make me a hypochondriac. Both my friend and I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to worry about....!","review":"I read \\"What to Expect\\" quite a bit in my first few months. It was a useful guide to answer questions between doctor's visits. However, I picked it up again recently, in my eighth month, and was astounded by how negative it sounded. Its focus on \\"Concerns you may have\\" really began to scare me, as it made me worry about things I hadn't thought to worry about! It is not helpful to dwell so much about what might theoretically, rarely go wrong. I also found that the Best Odds Diet was totally annoying and unrealistic. For a more positive, comprehensive book, try \\"The Baby Book\\" by Bill and Martha Sears."},{"rating":"1","title":"No help at all!","review":"My OB actually GAVE me this book on my first visit. It's horrible. I never was quite sure how they divided up there months(which weeks were which months- every book does it differently). Plus, it didn't seem like they actually had information corresponding to the correct month in that particular chapter. Not to mention that it never talked about anything except what could go wrong. Oh, and the \\"Best Odds Diet\\"- are you kidding me! I AM NOT a bad mother just because I ate a candy bar or a piece of cake! This book was made me feel horrible about myself, and I was constantly worried. \\"The Pregnancy Book\\" by Sears was much more reassuring,uplifting, and answered many many more questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder there's a backlash against this book","review":"It's no wonder so many people are getting fed up with this book. I can't believe how obnoxious the authors can be at times. Here's a direct quote: \\"Before you close your mouth on a forkful of food, consider: 'Is this the best bite I can give my baby?' If it will benefit your baby, chew away. If it'll only benefit your sweet tooth or appease your appetite, put your fork down.'\\" Why is this book a bestseller?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scares the bejeebers out of you. Skip it.","review":"If you're in your first pregnancy and looking for a good reference guide, skip this book. This was one of several books we purchased and every time we'd look up some perfectly normal symptom during our first pregnancy, we'd get alarmed by its dire predictions of dead babies, brain damaged babies, \\"see your doctor IMMEDIATELY\\" warnings. If we didn't have other references, we'd be seriously stressed out about a perfectly normal, healthy first pregnancy. The information is generally accurate, if a bit over-reactive and designed to keep you on the phone with your doctor 24 hours a day. After the first couple of months, it was put on the bookshelf and never opened again.Save your money. We strongly preferred \\"The Pregnancy Book\\" by Dr. Sears. ISBN 0316779199. And all of the other books in that series after you have your healthy baby. Buy it on amazon and save yourself unneeded stress that accompanies any of the books in the \\"What to expect...\\" series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Primer to Parenthood","review":"There are more than 1000 titles in Amazon under parenthood, and I feel this is the best-written, most helpful guide to the beginner parent. Every Mom and Dad will have a few key chapters they return to over and over, and large portions of the book they ignore. Here are two more books you can't live without--first, the funniest and most insightful book ever written about parenting, \\"I SLEEP AT RED LIGHTS: A TRUE STORY OF LIFE AFTER TRIPLETS,\\" by Bruce Stockler, a really amazing and unique book about how parenthood changes your life forever; and Operating Instructions, by Annie LaMott, the first and best-written of the parenting memoirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"patronizing AND terrifying","review":"This is one of the few books I've ever read that made me want to throw it across the room. If you are pregnant and looking to be both patronized and terrified, this is the book for you. The \\"Best Odds\\" diet is the most absurd: be prepared to feel guilty if you don't follow it, or to gain 50 lbs. if you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak book","review":"This book didn't have the information I was looking for. I wanted to know more about what was going on with the baby develpmentally. I wanted specific information about teratogens, not just advice to avoid all drugs. I had a very difficult pregnancy--seven months of nausea--and the frequent admonitions of the author about diet were just too much. The tone and repetition of the book made it seem like it was written for a slow child. Looking for a great book that respects the intelligence of the reader? Get 1000 Questions About Your Pregnancy by Jeffrey Thurston."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this book keep on selling?","review":"It is entirely beyond me how this book has become a classic. We were out with several other expectant couples the other night when this volume came up during our (no surprise here) book-and-baby-oriented discussion.In short, our collective reading seems to be that this book seem to 1) pander to your basest fears and anxieties; 2) assumes that the reader is gushingly thinking about baby all of the time; and 3) society is stuck somewhere in the 1950s in terms of relationships and marriage. We all just wanted sound advice and science, not fear mongering, emotional mush, or strange relationship advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too clinical. Not enough emotional content.","review":"I bought this book because it is one of the best selling pregnancy books in the nation. Unfortunately I didn't read a sample passage before purchasing. I was sorely disappointed with the content and writing style (and later my RN and other pregnant women told me they had made the same mistake and disliked the book too). This book gives a long list of potential symptoms a pregnant woman can feel during each month of pregnancy. It does not address the emotional aspect of pregnancy (just some bullet points on what you may be feeling). We have since read other books that we enjoyed much more. My husband is enjoying \\"Mack Daddy: Mastering Fatherhood Without Losing Your Style, Your Cool, or Your Mind\\" by Larry Bleidner. While I'm enjoying \\"A Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy by Vicki Iovine.\\" And together we are reading \\"The Baby Book\\" by William and Martha Sears -- a book that focuses on parenthood (i.e. what to do after the baby comes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad, Bad Book","review":"I am greatly relieved to find that others found WTEWYE as awful as my entire birth group and I did. When the subject of what pregnancy books people were reading was raised, each woman present had either borrowed or had been given WTEWYE and had completely detested it: the condescending tone, the stuffy, doctor-centered attitude, the fascination with medical technology, the fear-based anecdotes and time-consuming, energy-sapping, unnecessary recommendations and advice. I gave this book one star only because the form required me to fill in the field, and I do so under protest.Luckily, there are many other interesting books on the market. Among my favorites for bringing up baby are the books by Penelope Leach. Her writing and attitude is loving and sensible and reassuring to first time parents who need to learn to trust themselves and to take the time to fall in love with their kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Views pregnancy as a disease","review":"If you are ultra paranoid, this is the book to buy. If you want a relaxed, healthy, worry-free pregnancy, avoid this book like the plague. This book does not discuss pregnancy in general, it does not prepare you for birth, it does not prepare you for motherhood, and it certainly does not discuss the mental and spiritual side of being pregnant, it only focuses on the medical stuff.It is basically a guide to all possible pregnancy symptoms and complications and it does not even illustrate in detail what to do to avoid complications. It only tells you what is normal and what is not. Mostly it focuses on telling you what is normal to experience in various stages of pregnancy. Everything in this book is something your doctor or midwife will explain to you, in more detail than this book does."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst pregnancy book ever written!","review":"If you plan on being nerotic and scared out of your mind your whole pregnancy then this is the book for you! I cringe when a mom to be tells me they are or have read this book. There are a dozen or so other books out there that are more beneficial to a mom/parents to be to read ( Anything by Aviva Romm). If you wind up with a copy use it for kindling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called the Pregnancy Diet Book","review":"I found this book offensive. It seemed to be almost entirely devoted to diet and how NOT TO GET FAT DURING PREGNANCY. Oh please, make the preaching stop. I finally had to put it down. I can't recommend it. The other information in the book is given in Q & A form which I found unhelpful. If you happen to have the same question or a similar concern as someone who contributed to the book has then you'll get an answer. But you have to wade through the muck to get there.I give it a big thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good information, but a little scary","review":"I read this book as soon as I found out I was pregnant, and was sure that every little thing was something going drastically wrong. I tried to follow their diet plan, but it was impossible, plus making sure I got all the things that were just CRITICAL to baby's healthy development - I gained 11 pounds the first month! The best advice I got was just use common sense about eating, and ask your friends who've had kids, your mom or your OB/GYN about everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way TOO much lecturing.","review":"I bought several pregnancy books when I first found I was pregnant not including this one. My doctor highly recomended this book so I added it to my collection and I hate this book. Even though it does have a lot of good information it is very condescending. Whenever I looked up any topic I felt like I was being lectured. To me it seemed to be negative overall. I would highly recomend the book \\"The Mother of All Pregnancy Books\\" over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems Old","review":"The cover looks old, the pictures are pretty lame. The information seems accurate, but the presentation is poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to Expect when your a Wussy Parent","review":"This whole series of books, we got for free from my wife's OBGYN. A shame the books weren't made out of different paper, they would have made great kindling.If you ain't a red meat eating, flag waving, butt spanking, gun loving American, then yea I suppose you'd like this book.Would you like Tofu with that order?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A surrogate mother","review":"When I was pregnant in 1990, I had no family near me and no friends who were pregnant or had kids. Also, there was no Internet. As a result, this book was like my stand-in mother and I am forever grateful for it. I still recommend it to all pregnant women, although the edition I had is likely an earlier edition than the current one. I just felt prompted to write this review to counterbalance some of the negative comments by other reviewers -- although we are all certainly entitled to our individual opinions, I wanted to share how meaningful and relevant this book was for me as a clueless and very young expectant mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible support for the most natural activity in the world","review":"This book can deeply damage the most wonderful experience of a lifetime. It is written with no thought to empowering woman at this important time but instead is directed to the pregnant woman who views her condition as an illness to be cured by doctors. The section on diet suggests you have all day to run around preparing the perfect healthy meal. If you are a working mother, much of the advice will cause anxiety because you can't follow it (i.e. take several days off to recover from jetlag). The content of this book will make pregnancy seem like the most devastating moment of your life. Throw it away and buy anything by Dr. and Martha Sears instead. They assume pregnant woman are capable healthy adults and natural mothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"laughable","review":"As a student studying child development under a multitude of child developmentalists, this book is a one word joke. Not one of my professors respect this book, as it is ancient, written for mothers from the 1960's. After during a presentation on this book last semester, we got into a detailed discussion on the limited choices this fear mongering books offers. Do yourself a favor, save yourself from the extra stress (very bad for a baby) and do some more research. Don't reach for the old standby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read only if you really are perfect","review":"This book drove me nuts. It is one huge condescending guilt trip. You are smart enough to know that you need to eat well and take care of yourself.I followed the diet, ended up with gestational diabetes at 11 weeks, and spent the next two years losing the water I gained from the ill-advised diet. The diet did not give me diabetes. But there should be more discussion and forgiveness of other health factors that may alter the diet and other recommendations. My doctor put me on a diet very different from this book's recommended diet, and I felt like I was cheating my child because I could not eat the \\"perfect\\" diet.I strongly recommend Vicki Iovine's The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should only be used as fire kindling...","review":"This is the WORST book out there on childbirth. I bought this book with my first baby as it was highly recommended to me by my OB, and no wonder?! It teaches you how to be a completely passive patient with little or no information on side effects of medications and procedures done in the hospital. Don't waste your money, do an internet search on what you want to find out. I would recommend instead The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth. The only plus side to this book is how it tells you month by month what your baby looks like, but again you can find that on the internet. This book makes you a good patient for the OB and not an active informed birther. Women do not NEED episiotomies, IVs, External Fetal Monitors, Epidurals etc. like this book makes it seem to birth safely. Please don't waste your money on this. Inform and empower yourself, be strong enough to be a bad patient and instead an awesome mom and terrific birther!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The image on the cover says it all","review":"Take a look at the coverart and you'll get an accurate feel for the book. The woman looks completely miserable and worried. Exactly how you'll feel when your through reading the book. The condescending attitude of the author and anxiety-producing information in the book is enough to make any mother-to-be feel like she is an inadequate \\"little woman\\". Also, the cover art is so outdated...looks like all pregnant women should look frumpy and wear clothes from 20 years ago. The message -- you are not strong and confident. And forget sexy. The quilted background and rocking chair top it all off. Pregnant women, stay home and sew, but only after you are done cooking and cleaning for your \\"husband.\\" If you don't have a \\"husband\\", for shame! The cover art of the book is a big clue that the book is outdated and better suited to the 1980s.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible--vague and too wordy.","review":"This is a terrible book. My informal survey of friends shows that women scientists and engineers tend to hate this book. It's wordy, it's filled with obvious common sense suggestions, and it lacks precise information. This book insulted my intelligence and wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother's appearance given precedence over baby","review":"Good only if you're more interested in getting your figure back after the birth than in actually enjoying your pregnancy and then loving your baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Must-Have","review":"I am expecting my first baby at the age of 43. Well-meaning friends insisted from the beginning that I MUST have \\"What To Expect\\"--\\"It's the Bible.\\" \\"It answers all your questions.\\" Even my doctor's office gives out copies.I have found the book less than helpful. I want to know much more about my baby's development and much less about me. I need to know when my child develops toes. I want to know what he/she hears and sees in there. I don't need to know about hair dyes or diets that I will never follow.I also need a lighter approach than is found in \\"What To Expect.\\" The writing style strikes me as chilly and clinical. This is a joyous and often very humorous life experience. Novice moms-to-be need a laugh along with the facts.In short, \\"What To Expect\\" has answered very few of my questions. It's decent reference for the bookshelf, but not my Bible, by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too medical, not very emotional","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. This is my first pregnancy and it's not just another flu season for me. I take this event as an emotional one, and I want a guide that approaches it the same way. This book focused so much on what could go wrong with the baby and not at all on how I am feeling. My husband had to put it down after 50 pages of the terrifying diseases our child could have. And yet, when I needed information on HG (a very serious condition that lands pregnant women in the emergency room because of extreme morning sickness) there was no mention of it. All I got to explain and comfort me on the 25lbs I lost from 2 months of vomiting is a tiny paragraph saying it was \\"normal\\" and \\"EATING 6 meals a day\\" would help!...like \\"eating\\" is an option !!I am sure it is a helpful reference book on my ob's shelf, but there is better guides out there for pregnant women. I am having a baby not battling cancer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Living Life through a Plastic Bubble......","review":"I'll be honest, I really don't like this book! When I was pregnant with my first child, it was, as a previous reveiwer put it, my \\"bible\\". Now, having gone through pregnancy and being pregnant with my second child, I find the book rather depressing! Pregnancy is suppose to be a time of joy, getting familiar with the changes in you body and the life that is growing inside you, etc. Instead of listing all the things a pregnant woman has to look forward to, this book is filled with a lot of \\"No!\\" and \\"Don't\\".I recommend instead reading the Sears Family Library's book on pregnancy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money. Makes you paranoid and fearful of every ache","review":"This book will make the first time parents contantly checking and rechecking symptoms of every cold, over-examining ever ache and pain. Perfect for hypocondriacs (sp?). This book has no real useful information, just symptoms of the 1 in a million problems. If you want a great pregnancy book try Pregnancy Week-by-Week by MacDougal. It's doesn't have that 'better than you' attitude and the weekly updates, rather than monthly are far more satisfying. I would avoid this book if I were you. I bought it because it is 'THE pregnancy book' that everyone has but it really is a waste of money. Don't even bother with \\"What to eat...\\" either. Anyone who tells a pregnant woman to stay away from ANY sugar or chocolate is a sadist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my life....","review":"I can credit this book with actually saving my life. I understand how the \\"What could go wrong\\" section could scare you if you are having a normal pregnancy. I had a placental abruption at 28 weeks, and though I was very asymptomatic, the book encourages you to call your doctor if you even THINK something might be wrong. I did, and I had to have an emergency c-section. For a first time mom, the experience was very scary, but if I hadn't had a book that looked at what may go wrong in 1% of pregnancies, I would have died. It's definately not the be-all and end-all of pregnancy books, but I found it to be very informative and helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE- If I could rate less than 1 star, I would","review":"This is the worst pregnancy book out there. The information is presented with a lot of gloom and doom; it would make any expectant mother think that she is not doing a good job if she's not following every piece of advice in the book.I don't understand why this book is so prevalent as a gift at baby showers--maybe because it is inexpensive and has a catchy title.As far as trouble shooting or dealing with any kind of problems that arise, the book doesn't deal with them well. And this book is TERRIBLE for anyone that is hoping to breastfeed.I would NOT buy this book if it were the last thing on the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colossal Waste of Time","review":"As soon as I found out I was pregnant I ordered this book from Amazon. I'll admit, I fell for the hype. Apparently this is \\"The book to get when you're pregnant\\". Boy,what a waste. I really don't see why it is so insanely popular! If you need a book to tell you to run to your doctor every time you have a question or concern then this book is for you. If you want to be patronized page after page then this book is for you. Overall I think this book is written for people who are a) easily influenced, b) believe everything the read and c) are susceptible to scare tactics. If you are the kind of person who is willing to think for yourself and make informed decisions, I would go elsewhere. Try www.babycenter.com for good information and unbiased answers to your questions, and read \\"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\" for those little extras no one else tells you as well as some much needed comic relief!p.s. congrats on your pregnancy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference!","review":"My wife was about 3 months pregnant when someone gave us this book as a gift. What a great book to give someone!We were able to read about what was going on with our baby, 1 month at a time.

Try \\"The Birth Book\\" By Sears and Sears instead!","review":"While this book provides much information about medicalized prenatal care and hospital labor and birth, it is as biased as it comes. I disliked the unsubstantiated anti-midwife stance, and the way the author presented the list of prenatal tests as inevitable and unquestionable. The discussions about the safety and accurace of these tests were incomplete and biased. I also found it absurd to include a chapter about possible complications and tell women not to read it. I also disliked the question-answer format.

Gave lots of good anwers to common pregnancy complaints.. however organization wasnt the best, but it was still a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for new Moms","review":"I borrowed this book from my cousin and at first I didn't like it because it tells you everything, from the good to the bad. I just decided not to scare myself with the bad things that could go wrong with the prenancy unless I had questions about them. Otherwise the information was very helpful!! I have to give to book back because she is expecting again and I am going to go out and buy my own. Definatly a must for new moms!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too scary... Who needs this much paranoia?","review":"I did read this cover to cover for both of my pregnancies because friends told me to. I was lucky to be a calm expectant mother, and to have an excellent OB who spent time with me, and answered my every concern. After he asked me what I was reading, and I replied, he said,\\"Toss that book in the garbage!\\" Who needs to be in such a constant state of anxiety? Certainly not a pregnant mom. Go for the Good Housekeeping Illustrated Guide to Pregnancy. Also check out 125 Things You Must Know About Being Pregnant, by Nina Landi. Totally sweet, cute, and not one second of alarm. Good luck with your pregnancies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only okay--don't use as your only resource!","review":"I was not very pleased with this book at all. I found the organization and structure to be not very good. For example, I'm in my second month, but I had to search all over the book for answers to questions I had about things I'm experiencing now! Also, the Best Odds diet is not only restrictive (at best), it's also unrealistic. Do you consider a bagel made with refined flour a once-a-week treat? Moreover, the childbirth section is painfully lacking in thorough information. While this book does contain useful information, don't make it your only resource. For a wonderfully thorough, detailed, and well-written resource, I really recommend \\"With You and Your Baby All the Way,\\" by Jerri Colonero."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRISIS! SCARY!","review":"Everything seems to be a scare tactic. Very little is put in perspective for the (sometimes emotional) expectant mother. This book was given away by the hospital, so we're glad we didn't waste $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out there...","review":"I didn't care for this book - even though it seems that some love it. I felt like there was a lot of focus on \\"bad\\" things that could happen. It just made me worry more, which isn't good."},{"rating":"1","title":"major lack of organization","review":"This is almost meant to be read as a story, which isn't what I was looking for. The bulk of the book pretends to be organized by the various time segments of your pregnancy. (Month 1, Month 2) But only the first page or two of the chapter discusses the changes you and the baby are going through at that time. Instead each chapter has a random mix of Q and A's that you would have at any point in the pregnancy. I just didn't follow it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly medical, stress-inducing book","review":"My sister in law insisted I borrow this book from her claiming that it was the \\"best pregnancy book ever\\". What I found was a lot of fear mongering that treated pregnancy more like a terminal illness than the joyful occasion it really is. I literally couldn't force myself to read very much of it, and the parts I did read made me feel like every little bit of queasiness was a miscarriage waiting to happen or if I ate a bite of ice cream my baby would come out sick. If you are looking for a guide to pregnancy with a bit of heart, I suggest Dr. Sears' The Pregnancy Book; if you are looking for a nutrition guide that is easy to follow and well researched, I recommend Barbara Luke's Program your Baby's Health: The Pregnancy Diet for your Child's Lifelong Well-being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, If you don't mind being a little nervous!","review":"This book is informative, however on several occasions I used it as a research tool before calling my doctor with my concerns, and it only made me reach for the phone even faster. It does not explain that many things that you think are strange during pregancy are actually VERY NORMAL!!!! I also do not like the set up of this book. It works on calendar months instead of by weeks of pregnancy that my doctor uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy and Condescending","review":"This book is unfortunately considered the pregnancy bible of the moment. It is preachy, condescending, and treats women like they can't think for themselves. The diet recommendations are a bit absurd, and not practical in any way.I would recommend Girlfriend's Guide to Prenancy well above this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute, outdated garbage","review":"They issued a new edition with the same old outdated information. Save your money - these authors aren't selling you this \\"book\\" to give you good information: they are selling it to make themselves money because they know it's a popular book. If you care about your pregnancy even one inch and are PROUD to be pregnant, then get another book like \\"Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn\\" (most recent edition) by Penny Simkin, Ann Keppler and Janet Whalley. PCN will give you a fuller picture, be respectful of your intelligence, and assume that you want to be informed about what is happening, instead of the constant whining that accompanies WTEWYE. \\"The Pregnancy Book\\" by Sears is also a good read.There's a reason that this book is in every thrift store and recycle bin - it's garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw it in the recycling bin!","review":"I read many books during my pregnancy and this one was my least favorite. I detest the question/answer format and their tone. Who are the writers anyway? Do they have a degree or anything?many of the information given is inaccurate when compared to the scientific research out there...but the reader wouldn't know...they don't tell us where they get their facts from!Get \\"The Pregnancy Book\\" by Dr Sears instead, and if you already have this one-throw it in the recycling bin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself the anxiety","review":"I won't recommend this book. The authors spend too much time listing things that have not been shown to impact a pregnancy and labeling them as \\"BAD\\". I spent my pregnancy worrying about things that in retrospect were silly (is decaf green tea really going to give me a mutated baby). It had a tendency to suggest the worst was going to happen - I didn't even finish it. I usually love to read about what is going on and find out what to expect. I even read sections of an embryology textbook. But I had my husband read the section on delivery and births, because I knew reading it myself would make things worse not better. While the other books in this series are extremely helpful, this title is not - DON'T GET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a great book to read if you like to be frightned","review":"I am a mother of six children, I read this book with baby number three. I was scared out of my wits. I didn't need the hassle. I think that educating your self about chidbirth is a good thing, but, it gets to the point in this book that you are afraid of EVERYTHING. I was worried about every test I didn't have, I was worried about every test I DID have. I think this book should have focused on basic need to know details, especially for first time mothers who really worry to begin with. There is such a thing as too much info to take in and digest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some substantive information, a lot of scare tactics.","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I found it to be extremely patronizing and absolutely humorless. I want specific information about the baby's development on a week-to-week basis, and this book barely describes fetal development. The diet it recommends is a joke. The cover is offensive- that woman looks like she's been drugged. Pregnancy is a healthy, normal developmental state, not a disease. As a pregnant woman, I want lots of information about every aspect of pregnancy. I can make my own decisions and judgements, with the aid of my doctor. I don't need a book to tell me what to do, I need a book to educate me. I wish this book weren't the top seller- I hope women are finding other books that provide more useful, positive information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for first-time or uninformed moms","review":"It's very helpful for a first-time mom to be. I appreciate all of the information and all of the questions it has me asking myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect much~","review":"This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and \\"Childbirth Without Fear.\\" Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore. I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.Make it the joyful event you deserve!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This book is quite high-level and gets into very little detail. The Q&A format is not my favourite and I found the style a bit patronizing. It is also a U.S. book and doesn't provide any information on Canada-specific options. The Mother of All Pregnancy Books is a better resource and I recommend it for anyone seeking this \\"overview\\" kind of literature. Unlike \\"What to Expect,\\" it is Canadian, and a more detailed book that covers an equal or greater breadth of topics. It is also less focused on the negative, though it covers issues and fears in detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"If what you're expecting is to complain. . . .","review":"This book was really a list of pregnant women complaining about their symptoms, or the ones their friend had and they didn't. There are a lot of complaints about the way the body changes (Yes, you are going to lose your waist and, yes, you are going to gain weight). These things are obvious and not worth the plethora of pages dedicated to selfish complaining. I purchased the book, brought it home, and returned it two hours later. There wasn't anything informative or helpful. I would recommend to anyone who wants real information to purchase The Pregnancy Book: A Month by Month Guide by William M. Sears and Martha Sears (who are a pediatrician and a nurse, respectively)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It also made me feel stupid and minimized my problems","review":"I had a VERY difficult pregnancy, and the information in this book really minimized the problems I was having. It made me feel stupid, like a whiner, and not take my symptoms seriously enough, and feel guilty for being such a wimp. I ended up in the the hospital with some very scary complications. Very few people sail through their pregnancies like the book describes, and as most OB's will also minimize your discomforts, you really need to stand up for yourself and get a support group (like Babycenter.com) where you can talk to other women and figure out what to demand that your doctor do for you. I think that if I had not read this book, I would have taken my symptoms more seriously and not tried to ignore them for so long."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to freak out about when you're expecting","review":"My mom gave me this when I first got pregnant, and I dutifully read it every month for the first half of my pregnancy.Not too surprisingly, I felt worried about all the tests and complications described, guilty because I didn't manage to follow their diet perfectly, and found myself anxiously awaiting the onset of the pregnancy side effects described. I also thought the tone was pretty patronizing.I stopped reading it about 3-4 months ago and since then have felt great, have a healthy pregnancy and much less anxiety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this book if you want to feel miserable","review":"I started reading this book when I still suffered from slight morning sickness, but now, almost halfway my pregnancy, reading this book still makes me fel sick. I think the emphasis on weight gain and food issues is very annoying. I appreciate some advice, but there is a limit. This books makes me feel guilty every time I eat a cookie or some ice cream.Also, I will decide if I want to spend a fortune on maternity clothes or not. Maybe I have a fortune to spend?Moreover, I believe that many complications mentioned in hte normal month to month chapters are so exotic, they should be in a seperate section named 'very rare complications and problems'.I say no to this book, being pregnant is worrysome enough without this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype about? It's just good marketing","review":"So many people recommended this book to me, not to mention the television coverage and the best-sellers listing. I definietly would not recommend this book. Compared to my doctor's advice and other pregnancy books, I found this one very alarmist in tone. Also, while it looks like it is organized by month, you soon realize that information is spread out all over the place in a confusing and limiting question and answer format. Try \\"Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn\\" by Penny Simkin instead - much better. That's the book my OB recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book and resource","review":"This book is awesome and answers alot of questions one may have during their pregnancy. It covers everything. I am very pleased with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to Avoid","review":"This book actually says that it is okay to imbibe while pregnant. I showed my midwife and she was livid."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to Expect when You're Miscarrying","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!The author's approach of instilling fear in the reader in the early chapters of the book (which happened to be the early stages of my pregnancy) is, in my opinion, unhealthy. For the first several weeks of my pregnancy I thought I was going to lose my baby as a result of reading this book. When I went to my doctor practically in tears thinking something had to be wrong, she suggested I throw the book away. Several other patients had the same fears as a result of this title.As far as being a resource, I found nothing useful in this book that wasn't in free published material given to me at the doctors office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best book!","review":"I purchased this book because I thought it was \\"THE BOOK\\" on pregnancy. After reading the first chapter I put the book under my bed. As a first time expecting mother, I don't won't to be frighten at the fact that I \\"did color my hair\\" before I found out I was pregnant. And I don't want to worry for the entire pregnancy if I harmed my baby. I don't want to think that every normal pain I feel like stretching, is cause for concern. Don't waste your money, buy another book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should be Expect the Worst When You are Expecting!!!","review":"This was by far the worst book I read when pregnant. The last thing anyone needs when expecting their first child is a 624 page detailed list of anything and everything that could ever go wrong during a pregnancy. I found myslef being paranoid all the time. I finally threw the blasted thing away and began to feel much much better both physically and emotionally.I liked Pregnancy Week-by-Week because it described how the baby was growing and developing weekly. That was very interesting. My husband read a chapter to me every Sunday night. I also enjoyed HypnoBirthing: A Celebration of Life. I did Hypnobirthing with the birth of my second child. It was AMAZING. No drugs, completely relaxed and a totally different experience than the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a bible","review":"This book gave only a minimum amount of information and I was very disappointed after hearing how great this book was supposed to be. This is my first pregnancy and I've found only a few useful items in this book. Other books that give way more detail are 'The Pregnancy Journal - A Day to Day Guide' and 'Your Pregnancy - Week by Week'. These books gave details of exactly what was going on inside with the baby and with my body. What to Expect is too vague and extremely outdated - especially that horrible picture on the cover - could they make pregnancy look any uglier and 1950's??"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Absolute Best Book","review":"I used this book with both of my children, there is a 13 year gap between them. It was extremly helpful the first time and it was even more so the second time. The format is great, the information is plentiful. I saw that some reviewers said it was idealistic, there is nothing wrong with helping a woman have the best possible pregnancy. Each woman should take from it what is good for her and leave what is not. No one book is going to be specific to Mary, Jane or Sue, but this books covers so much that each of these women will be able to gain a great deal of information about their preganancy. Please enjoy it, I did, twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a REAL book","review":"Unfortunately, this book is appropriately named - it indeed trains you on \\"what to expect\\" - instead of teaching you how to expect better! I never recommend this book to participants in my childbirth class. Dr. Sears has great books and so does Sheila Kitzinger and Penny Simkin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it would be.","review":"The book is a little informative but, unrealistic, not my type of book. I don't recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you know NOTHING about pregnancy","review":"I'm a first time Mom-to-be, and I must admit, the hype surrounding this book pushed me to purchase it, but I was somewhat disappointed. It's not the sort of book that held my attention, only because a lot of the information is oversimplified. If you have a simple a question about something and you need a general answer, this book is OK. But the format of question - answer, question - answer, just wasn't appealing at all. It's written in a boring and condescending tone. The month-by-month guide is misleading as well. There's great information, but not well organized in each month.If you don't know very much about your body or what pregnancy is about, then this may be an informative book for you to read. Otherwise, it's not as essential as everyone makes it out to be. Save your money. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for pregnancy","review":"I originally bought this book for my 1st pregnancy & it was a great guide month to month. I bought it again for my 3rd pregnancy & I still liked it for refresher info. I recomend this book if you are in your 1st pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I read the reviews before I bought this book","review":"Being a first time mother, I practically grabbed this book off the shelf, when I first saw it. I should have known better and did some reviewing here. I would not recommend this book to anyone at all. It's so frighteningly STRICT! I think I would have failed in most aspects...and it was difficult to refer to. It's now used as a paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and Unorganized","review":"This book is not one I would ever recommend for someone to buy. The whole book is a book of questions and answers, which makes it very hard to find information. And the authors deal with topics in later months that can occur a lot earlier! And the questions aren't even ones that apply to a lot of people. For example, most of Chapter 3 deals with alcohol, smoking and drug use during pregnancy. It even has someone asking a question about occasional cocaine use!!!! Since books are usually arranged by topics of most importance, I certainly hope that the 3rd most important topic on my mind during my pregnancy wouldn't be occasional cocaine use!!! I wish I could take this book back!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy other books to accompany this one.","review":"It might be the first book you buy, but it shouldn'tbe the only book you acquire; I agree with those whofind it filled with \\"gloom-and-doom\\". For instance,\\"What To Expect\\" tells you how to cheat on their\\"Best-Odds Diet\\" - you *can* eat sweets, but onlyif they're low fat and good for you! Also, yoursymptoms' timeline may not mimic the timelinein the text (or for that matter in anyone's text,)so following the \\"What to Expect\\"'s tenets religiouslycould cause you a great deal of anxiety if,say, you experience fatigue during your wholepregnancy instead of feeling a renewed senseof energy in the fourth or fifth month.Try Vicki Iovine's \\"The Girlfriends' Guideto Pregnancy\\" for the sense of \\"everyone'sdifferent, but you'll most likely do okay\\"that's missing in \\"What to Expect\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Answers some questions, but leaves alot to be desired.","review":"Though this book is given to pregnant women by many doctors andinsurance companies, it is not a comprehensive guide to pregnancyand childbirth. The format is easy to read, and gives you thebasics for what is happening each month. From talking to manypregnant women, I've heard that this book only begins to answertheir many questions, and I felt the same way. If you have atextbook pregnancy, and believe that doctors are gods,then this is the only book for you. Otherwise, read it yes, butmake sure you are reading other books too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure this is THE BEST reference out there...","review":"This is my first pregnancy and the repeated contradictions in this book left me more confused and with more questions then answers.

Wait, bad idea...she would likely read this propaganda, be so terrified of the beautiful natural experience she is about to go through that she would hate and fear pregnancy. I can't understand why this is the difinitive book to buy when you're pregnant. It is even printed poorly on pulp-ey looking paper with no color.

I stopped reading it very early on... talk about a dooms-day book! That book was filled with negative situations, instructed you to follow crazy diets (which makes you feel bad for NOT following them), and, again, I didn't think that a monthly update of what's going on was nearly often enough. It was good as a reference occasionally (when I needed to look something up), but didn't really have any information that I couldn't have gotten on a reputable medical website or by a quick call to my doctor.Like others have said, I TOTALLY do NOT understand why this book is known as the book that every pregnant woman should have! It will drive you crazy! Instead of continuing with this book, I bought \\"Your Pregnancy Week-By-Week\\" and LOVED it!

However, if you are plaqued by morning sickness as I have been for 6 months, you can't follow any diet. While I do refer to this book, I roll my eyes at other parts. I would like to see one medical study that backs up the authors' claims that if you gain weight on healthy food you will have a big healthy baby, but if you gain weight on other food you will have a small baby.

There were several times reading the book, that a symptom that is very normal, appeared horrific and I was forced to call my doctor to question what I was feeling.

It can make you a paranoid pregnant woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had expected,","review":"this book oversimplified our wondrous experience. It is also extremely conservative in its views, makes a future mother feel strange if she is not experiencing any of the topics discussed.

The last straw for me was when they suggested that I bring my own wheat roll to business luncheons so I wouldn't eat the white ones.The other thing that bugs me is that they really insult my intelligence. Telling me that its ok to shave my legs! The phrase \\"consult your practitioner\\" must be in there about a thousand times.Also, knowing how common miscarriages are, I found it peculiar that they did not address m/cs in the first \\"What you may be concerned about\\" section.Everyone tells you to get this book, but I think it is highly overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least helpful of pregnancy books I've read!","review":"I found this book to be short on really useful information. The \\"expectations\\" for each month were nearly identical and the tone often depressing. After reading this book you will wonder why it is you wanted to be pregnant in the first place.If you want a thorough and helpful book on pregnancy, with discussions on possible complications without raising undue alarm, with answers to all of the 1,000 questions every pregnant woman has, then buy \\"Your Pregnancy Week by Week.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It has the basics, but....","review":"While this book gives good information about, say, the sizeof the fetus and some possible symptoms of pregnancy(as well as what they might mean), it had a really narrow approach to pregnancy and some unlikely solutions to problems. For example, in the chapter on colds and flu during pregnancy, one recommended remedy was hot diluted orange juice. If you're not throwing up from morning sickness or the flu, hot diluted orange juice will definitely upset your stomach! I also disliked the \\"Do it our way or no way\\" attitude. Overall, I'd say this book created almost as much anxiety in me as it relieved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting.","review":"This book was just given to me by a friend. It's my second pregnancy book and I was so excited to have a new one to read, I just ran home and started right away. Man was I disappointed. I feel judged by this book. It makes me more paranoid than anything and I'm pretty much bored out of my mind. This all from someone who usually loves to absorb anything pregnancy related, even before becoming pregnant. I've tried to give it more than one chance and was even told by my Doctor to stop reading it since I'm losing sleep over it. The only good thing about this book is the amount of information. So if you enjoy a dry, boring, judgemental read, then I recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try other books","review":"Everyone I know recommends this book ... probably because it has been around the longest and people didn't bother researching other books.

I'll eat whatever doesn't make me gag, thank you very much.) How about a little support and reassurance during a scary time? Jeez. Nope, this book is going right back to the bookstore.

Well size isn't everything, especially not in this case.It is important to keep a healthy diet during pregnancy, but the diet this book suggests is insane. No one could follow it. Half a bagel as a treat? Vegetarian sushi is only okay as long as you opt for low sodium soy sauce? If I had miscarried, and my only source of information was this book, I would have assumed my miscarrige was caused by some trivial dietary mistake, and never have forgiven myself.The diet isn't the only thing about this book that is ridiculous, for one, the book suggests that if you are in active labor you should pass the time by cooking casseroles for your mate. Suuure....I'll get right on that..maybe I should carry a mop into the kitchen with me so I can mop my amniotic fluid off the floor while I'm cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Time Fathers don't buy this Book for the Mother","review":"This book plain makes your parinoid. What you don't know will not hurt you. This book is down right terrifying. I am not sure why its on every women's to read list when they are expecting. Nothing like giving a moody women a book with a list of everything that could possibly go wrong. There is such a slim chance that anything will go wrong that its not worth the high blood pressure. Find a good doctor and ask questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"pregnancy diet is too complicated","review":"I bought this book because my husband use to work at a bookstore and he had told me this was a best seller. Now I wish I did more research. This book is very informative in a month by month of your pregnancy in a FAQ format. Although, I didn't really care for this format. It feels disorganized to me, and I don't really care for the text book approach. As a first time mother, I like to hear about other mothers and their experience. But you will not get that here. This book is informative rather than encouraging or supportive as the other books. I would also have enjoyed more pictures. My biggest problem with this book was the diet they suggested you follow. It was too detailed and complicated. Too difficult to follow, especially for someone who never thought twice to what she ate before she became pregnant. I found the pamphlet that the doctor gave to me much more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is informative and for first timers","review":"I had read many pregnancy books before and I found WTEWYE to be the best as it deals with almost every aspect of pregnancy that I went through. I miscarried several times before and this book helped me to think positive and taught me to take better care of myself. I referred to it through out my pregnancy and also after delivery. It prepared me mentally and physically to go through labor pain and gave us (husband and wife) some insights on our baby's monthly physical development in the womb. I like the way the chapters are arranged; which are according to months and not topics. The dos and don'ts during pregnancy and the kinds of food to avoid while breastfeeding are the best parts of the book. I would definitely recommend this book to any parents-to-be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alarmist - Don't read it if you're already worried about everything!","review":"I don't understand why this book is so ubiquitous as a pregnancy guide; I found it alarmist, more likely to scare a newly pregnant woman than anything. Let's face it; a lot of guidelines for pregnancy self-care are common-sensical and already well known. I also bought \\"Your Pregnancy Week-by-Week and found a MUCH more pleasant and informative read. I'm ready to burn this book and will never recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I was expecting... but in a good way","review":"After reading some of these reviews, I wasn't sure if this book was right for me, expecting my first child. Would it be too scary? Well, someone was kind enough to surprise me with this book as a gift, so I didn't have to make the decision to buy it. I was pleasantly surprised! Yes, there is a section called \\"Of Special Concern,\\" because let's face it, there are complications associated with pregnancy. But it's good to be apprised of these things. Overall, I found this book to be very practical and informative. And, believe it or not, comforting. I am 8 weeks along and will be referencing this book throughout my pregnancy and beyond, as there is a post-partum section also. I only wish the book was broken down by week instead of month.Don't let negative reviews keep you from at least taking a look at the book yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too preachy","review":"While probably containing valid and scientifically correct information, I doubt that even 5% of pregnant women are able to follow the suggestions in this book.

Also I mistrust any pregnancy publication that does not adequately prepare you for the pain of childbirth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agony","review":"Guys - if someone told you to buy this in order to be a supportive husband, then, like me, you'll do it regardless of this review. Yes, it contains useful information about pregnancy, but if you are like me then picking it up will be more labor than delivery of your child. The authors' problem is trying to cover every conceivable ache and pain associated with pregnancy, and there are ALOT, and provide a technical explanation while dumbing it down so the average kindergartener would not get overwhelmed reading it. There are much better books on the market; save your cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful when you are Expecting!","review":"I thought it was a very precise and informative book from what you were going to go through the first month and the natal development that went along with that month.

The only good thing I can say about this book is, that my birth after reading it made me open my eyes. I learned nothing about birth from this book, in fact it's lack of information set the stage for a tramatic and horrid birth because of my lack of understanding and knowledge of labor and birth.For my second pregnancy I read only books that informed me about birth such as Dr. Sears' books and others that had real information in them.Pass this book up and read ones that will help you have a happy and memorable pregnancy and birth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect to feel GUILTY if you read this book","review":"Although this book is somewhat informative, for the first four months of my pregnancy I felt like a failure! My husband hid this book from me because I constantly worried about miscarriage, diet, etc. I am a very healthy woman who has gained \\"more than my share\\". I think the diet advice and weight restrictions are totally ridiculous and unrealistic and I would not recommend this patronizing excuse for a pregnancy guide to anyone who is having a baby. This book has sent me in tears more than once to my OB/GYN because as a normal, working, first-time expectant mother I simply cannot live up to these rigid guidelines. Only when I stopped reading \\"What to expect...\\" did I feel more relaxed and confident in my role as an expectant mother, and I stopped obsessing over my baby's well-being. My advice? Trash it and get Dr. Miriam Stoppard's \\"Conception, Pregnancy, and Childbirth\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is a big disappointment. It reads like it was written by editors for a teen magazine. Its endless use of acronyms, abbreviations and euphemisms are terribly annoying. The information in the book is geared more towards women interested in a more modern approach to childbirth as opposed to those looking for a natural alternative. There are some bits of useful information, but most of it can be found on the author's website. Why buy the book when you can access the same information for free?"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"this book is excellent even for those of us who are still just thinking about having a baby its really informative and really helpful.

Excellent book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What To Expect When You're Expecting","review":"Shame on anyone, especially doctors, who recommend this book to pregnant women! I wish I could give this book a Zero rating. The book starts off with a description of a handful of the more horrible conditions with which your baby could be born, and a note that there is nothing you can do to prevent any of them. This information left me frightened and anxious for the duration of my pregnancy. If you're looking for a book like this, look elsewhere. I can't imagine this book would be a comfort to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared me away from pregnancy","review":"I bought this book when one of my friends became pregnant and, after reading it, I told my husband there was no way I was ever going to be pregnant. The demands that this book puts upon a pregnant woman are unbearable, and the guilt that is not-so-subtly applied if you don't follow the rules in the book is immense. After reading many other books (that were happier, and much truer to life, like, believe it or not, \\"Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\") and feeling better prepared for what it was like for \\"real\\" people, we did decide we were prepared to have a baby. While I was pregnant, I used the \\"What to Expect\\" book when I wanted to look up something specifically, but I refused to use it as any sort of a holistic guide and would really not recommend it at all. If you are looking for a much more empowering alternative, you should really consider \\"The Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth\\" by Sheila Kitzinger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, but a Lousy Bedside Manner","review":"Probably no other pregnancy book gives the reader more information. But there's probably no other pregnancy book with such a condescending attitude toward the parent. \\"What to Expect\\" assumes that no pregnant woman has anything better to do than serve as a baby factory, and the authors practically ignore fathers completely.If you want to have a healthy baby and you also want to get through pregnancy with your self-esteem intact, go to another pregnancy book for everyday matters and read \\"What to Expect\\" only when you need in-depth information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, considering the hype","review":"As all women are instructed to do, the momen I found out I was pregnant I invested in this book. After reading it and a few others, I just don't understand why it is considered such a valuable resource -- I understand that when it first came out, the concept was revolutionary, but since then much more informative, better laid-out books have been written -- most notably, Pregnancy for Dummies, which we find invaluable due to the brilliant indexing of information that allows you to find what you want when you need it, as opposed to forcing to you try and guess what trimester to skim under. I'd love to return the book, but made the mistake of writing in it. What a comparative waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it with a grain of salt","review":"When I first picked up this book, back in December, 2000, I was so upset by the content that I threw it across the room, vowing never to pick it up again. Since that time, however, my perspective has changed. Within every dark cloud there is a glimmer of light; similarly, within What To Epect When You Are Expecting there are useful pieces of information. The \\"Best-Odds\\" diet, for instance, is useful, with certain modifications, while the reference section towards the back is helpful.Be sure, however, to stay away from the section on all that can go wrong.

Let me get this straight -- after labor starts, but before I go to the hospital, I'm supposed to pass the time by *preparing food for other people*?Yeah, right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be retitled to","review":"What To Expect When You Are A Lamb Being Led To Slaughter. Basically prepares you to have the most medical intervention available, without questioning anything. Allows you to be abused by doctor and hospital because 'that's what you can expect'.

Fine if you are a sheep, but if you are a thinking woman who wants to know ALL her options and have a satisfying birth experience, I recomment 'The Thinking Woman's Guide to Better Birth' by Henci Goer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way over-rated, written by the pregnancy police","review":"My biggest objection to the book is focus on food. Even when you try to look up a complaint (such as diarrea, migraines, etc), they give a one sentence, not very helpful answer, then 3 sentences on how eating the best-odds diet could prevent this (Hint: it can't).They were so fixated on the food/diet aspect that after reading it, and referring to it, I am left with the feeling that a Snickers Bar is the moral equivilant of beer, a slice of Chocolate cake with frosting is a pack of cigarettes, and by eating a Big Mac, Large Fries and Coke, I might as well be shooting heroin.What's lacking in the month-by-month description good information as to what is developing during that period in the baby. What organs are happening? What are the KEY NUTRIENTS that are necessary for that time horizon?A much better book is the weekly calender that really talks about what's happening to you and the fetus, including real pictures, not pencil sketches."},{"rating":"1","title":"condescending, scary, and a waste of money","review":"Just want to cast my vote against this one because I'd love to help someone choose a better book. Don't know why this book is so popular; the whole tone of the book is alarmist and preachy. (Heaven forbid you eat something other than whole-grain) The Dr. Sears book is MUCH better for giving you the information you need to make your own choices and for treating you like an intelligent person!That said, I did like the \\"what to expect\\" organizer which is a collection of handy charts and calendars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tone of this book puts me off.","review":"I agree with many of the other people who have reviewed this book.

It unfortunately was not accurate and had too many unrealistic suggestions. If you need a great selection of pregnancy/childcare books, I highly recommend all the books by William and Martha Sears. The books by Iovine are also a great addition to balance out the Sears books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for most of us","review":"This book may be worthwhile if you need to read up on pregancy in the question-answer format.It seems to be the most popular book amongst pregnant women I know, but I hated it, except for pointers on the post- partum period, which I did not see in nay other book. The book is preachy irritating and seems to talk down to the reader. There were some sections that I reread for laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aren't women making their own choices these days?","review":"This book's information was really outdated. You can tell it was written long ago, before women really had much of a say in things. If you go by everything the book says, the next nine months will be miserable. You will basically shut up, listen to your doctor and accept his word as law. You will never eat what you crave, and you will never be an active participant in your own baby's birth. This is good for general information, but if you really want to make informed decisions, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraging and Useless","review":"Why is this book consodered to be the \\"Bible\\" for pregnancy??? As soon as I found out I was pregnant I went out and bought this book, only to find out that it has very little information that I actually need to know, and talks almost nothing about the baby. Yes, I want to feed myself (and therefore the baby) the best possible choices, but the horrible preachy overtones of this book allow for no slack. Am I really a horrible mother since I want regular ice cream once in a while instead of low-fat ice milk or yogart?The question and answer format is useless as well. Most of the questions that I did have were not in the book, and the few that were answered did not give complete answers, so I had to consult another pregnancy book or my doctor anyway.

However, it could create a huge number of guilty/neurotic/paranoid moms to be with all of the restrictions on diet that it includes. \\"The pregnancy diet\\" sounds great, but how many servings of orange vs green vegetables do I really need to eat every day, let alone avoiding anything smoked/salted/processed... great if you are already a health nut and eat organic food, but for the rest of the planet, let's get a little more practical! The reality is that babies are the world's best parasites and will take what they need from their \\"host\\" - which is why malnourished heroin addicted moms can still give birth to 8lb babies!I say it is a good resource, but don't live by it alone or you will go mad!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Will Make You Unnecessarily PARANOID!!!","review":"I hated this book, I felt it was very misleading.

I also could not eat half the food they insist you eat if I were carrying the McCaughey Septuplets - and whoever dubbed the diet the \\"Best Chance\\" diet ignores the fact that millions of women eat a lot less, in different proportions, and have perfectly healthy babies. WHO decided that this was the \\"Best Chance\\"? And if it's so great, how oh how has the human race managed to get this far without its superior wisdom?The best books if you don't want to be addressed as an idiot are still Our Bodies, Our Selves and Sheila Kitzinger's Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth.

The books is organized into corny \\"Q & A\\" format, with many of the questions being overly specific or non-applicable to all pregnancies. There is not much scientific fact or research in this book, but rather reads as if your grandma's book group is telling you about pregnancy.

I feel like the book talks down to me. My biggest complaint: Pregnancy is a time of ambivalence as well as excitement, and this book downplays and dismisses the incredibly mixed feelings I'm experiencing. I've felt guilty about these feelings and this book made them worse. Come to find out, from talking to others, that I'm normal and most women have ambivalence!

In my opinion, there was some good info, but the tone of the book overall was way too self-righteous, especially regarding the off-the-planet diet info. Get the Mayo Clinic's excellent book for medical info (also has part of the book devoted to the baby's first year), and Vicki Iovine's \\"Girlfriend's Guide\\" for laughs.

Too bad, because there are much better \\"pregnancy-survival\\" books out there.I found that very little of what this book said actually applied to me. It is written from a very paranoid standpoint, and it seems to focus on everything that can go wrong during a pregnancy. I found that it made me more depressed and fearful, so I quit reading it during my fifth month.A much better book is \\"Natural Pregnancy\\" by Aviva Jill Romm.

I believe in eating a balanced diet, but can't imagine finding the time and energy to follow the recommended diet. And a piece of cake once a month as a treat? Let's get real, even pre-pregnancy diet allows for more realism than that.Other than diet, the information is okay, but the Q&A don't always appear during the right secion as different people experience different symptoms at different times.I much prefer the \\"Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby.\\" It's friendlier, easier to use and far less preachy.

Although it contains good information, there are plenty of other books that do as well. I find the tone of the book a bit condescending. Reading this book, you'd think having a few potato chips would mean you're baby will be obese and you will have stretch marks and varicose veins, yet if you eat perfectly, everything will go perfectly. I exercies regularly and eat healthfully, yet I still find the tone offensive. I felt this book would leave most mothers paranoid about every little thing. Also, I wasn't that happy with the layout and how info is organized. I am much, much happier with the Mayo Clinic guide. The Mother of All Pregnancy Books is good, too--just as much info, but more realistic.

The second one lasted until about a week after New Year, then the same thing happened. When I was a kid, we had a top (by a different manufacturer) that lasted forever.

I would advise anyone who wants to read Dr. Faustus to look elsewhere. I'm convinced that the 1604 version is on the whole a corrupt and truncated version of the play, but if you prefer it you might look into the Folger Library edition. If on the other hand you would rather read the play more or less as I think Marlowe wrote it, try the Signet edition edited by Sylvan Barnet.The other plays present no major textual problems (except for The Massacre at Paris, which is pretty hopeless) and this is a fine place to meet them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad for Marlowe","review":"I'm mad for Marlowe, Christopher Marlowe, that is!I liked the library book so much that I decided to own a copy for myself.To my surprise and delight, Amazon had the very same book, so I bought it.And it came in a reasonable amount of time (just under a week).I have ordered from Amazon before, and will do so again, as I need to,and have the funds.

Smith is inspired. I've liked him since before I was a Christian and liked contemporary Christian music! He crafts such glorious pop songs that lift you up and encourage you (whether you are a Christian or not). This album is probably my favorite overall of his oeuvre. \\"Hey You It's Me\\" is sunny pop perfection - it makes me want to ride in my car with the windows down, smiling up into the sky. \\"Reach Out to Me\\" is a driving, heartfelt track that I really *feel*! \\"I Still Have the Dream,\\" which is receiving play on Christian radio now, is so good that I was glad I already owned the album - I would have had to go buy it otherwise! It makes you want to just get up and dance. And the title track... breathtaking. It is so powerful, it brings tears to my eyes every time. \\"I Will Be Your Friend\\" is another great best friend anthem. Every song on this album is excellent, but I don't have the space to go one by one! Just go for it and buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definite Must Have","review":"I have had this CD for almost a year now, and have still not tired of listening to it. Smitty hits pretty well every emotion known to us with the Celtic inspired \\"Rince De\\" to open the album, to the sad, yet inspiring \\"This Is Your Time\\", to the fun filled \\"Worth It All\\", to songs for his daughters.

The title cut brings chills of challenge up your spine. \\"I Will Be Your Friend\\" was another hit. \\"Hey You, It's Me\\" had great lyrics to it as well. The only fault I could find with the album in itself is that Smith's musical background in most of the songs sounded too much like some of his older stuff. \\"Worth It All\\" and \\"I Will Carry You\\" are two examples. Other than that, if you favor contemporary Christian music, I think you'll love \\"This is Your Time.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael did good!","review":"Not his best album in my opinion (but I like his love ballads more so then his other stuff) Which is why I rated it a four and not a five. The almost...salsa urban feel on the second or third track kinda threw me, and some of his lyrics seemed a little more shallow then in previous albums.Theres a good 4 or 5 songs on here that I love to death. The rest well...maybe if I need to get happy. Buy this cd if your a hardcore fan.

The mix of instruments he uses here, keyboards and guitars, show that he is a top tier talent across every strand of music there is -- rock, jazz, whatever. The songs themselves are good -- I don't find myself skipping songs on here, which is unusual. If you are looking for a truly uplifting spiritual experience, this probably isn't the Smitty CD you want. Change Your World (his absolute best), and somewhat, Live the Life fall into that category better.

The music styles are just not consistent with the music in the last album, and if that is what you were looking for, like I was, you are in for a big disappointment. Plus, so many of the songs are about people rather than God; when I purchase a christian cd, I want to hear lyrics about God and Jesus, not wives, daughters, etc. Don't get me wrong, a tribute on an album is touching, but more than one is monotonous. Out of 13 tracks, only 3 or 4 of them match the calibur of the songs in \\"Live the Life\\".

I bought this album the first day it came out and I haven't stopped listening to it since. It seems that MWS reinvents his style with every album he does. In some respects, \\"This Is Your Time\\" is very different sounding from \\"Live the Life\\", his previous hit album. Electric guitar-rock feel is a lot more prevalent in the songs here. The title track is by far the most poignant. And songs such as \\"Anna\\", \\"She Walks With Me\\", \\"I Will Be Your Friend\\", \\"I Will Carry You\\", and \\"Hey You It's Me\\" all add to this album tremendously. \\"Everybody Free\\" and \\"Still Have the Dream\\" are also great songs. Is it as good as \\"Live the Life\\"? No. But we have to wonder if anything Smitty does can ever top that album.

In addition to this, unlike other oxford books of .... this volume does not give background information about authors, their times, why they wrote, etc.... which I find to be one of the most valuable aspect of an anthology.In short, it is good, but not great.

O'Connor's stories expose the complexities and frailties of being human, and you'll be struck by their profundity, a profundity that I find sorely missing in modern short stories (I've been reading the fiction issue of \\"The New Yorker\\"). But perhaps what I love most about O'Connor is her sense of humor. One of her most anthologized stories, \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find,\\" is as funny as it is dark (I'm thinking of the scene when \\"a horrible thought\\" occurs to the grandmother in the car). O'Connor is simply one of the best short story writers of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Writer that Nails the Problems of Social Perspectives","review":"I love Flannery O'Connor. I first came across her writing by chance and after my first reading I was enthralled by her witty observations and her ability to cut to the chase and eliminate pleasantries and polite discourse. Francis conjures up a familiar world of sidelined characters whose meek corner of the universe becomes the centrifugal force that catapults her characters into the realm of universals. At first I believed her writing to be humorous yet sardonic ; now I believe her literary genius is mysteriously mundane and it challenges my cynicism of everything I thought I knew about human nature. This book has it all - no stone has been left unturned in her moral universe of southern lifestyles , attitudes and priorities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this for a Lit. class....","review":"...and I love it!

Please, buy her work and read it. But do NOT buy this book.Whoever compiled this has a love for Flannery that I can appreciate, but the book itself is horrible. It's full of typographical errors; it doesn't get the name of one her novels right half the time (it's Wise Blood, not \\"The Wise Blood\\"); it seems self-published, judging by the back cover blurb and the fact it's published through CreateSpace.

I know this may seem odd to have O'Connor, the genius of revealing the inner workings of the human, beside Gaiman, but if you read Gaiman the connections are there. I'm all about getting readers from different disciplines and genres to connect with other fields. O'Connor's work, as most know, is as perceptive as it gets. Reading her work is a pure revelation, an ongoing epihpany as to what makes humans human (especially the southern religious human). Read, re-read and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"storytelling at its very best","review":"I never get tired of reading O'Connor. Vivid, wry, tragic and shocking, these stories are keenly observed revelations of human foibles and spiritual failure. O'Connor, a devout Christian, was especially good at evoking simultaneous cruelty and comedy, e.g.,when the Misfit in \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find,\\" looks at the dead body of the manipulative grandmother and says, \\"She would have been a good woman if there had been someone to shoot her every day of her life.\\" In the hands of a lesser writer, O'Connor's sort of violence might have come across as heavy-handed and contrived, rather than thought-provoking. Too bad she had to leave us so soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap And Great","review":"Although the book isn't made in the most sturdy fashion, it does have most all of Flannery O'Connor's short stories. She's one of America's finest short story writers, by far. A great story write in general, really. However, her short stories are were she shined brightest. All fans of the southern gothic style MUST have this book in their collection. The stories are smart, captivating, imaginative and fun. The price is so low that you really can't go wrong here."},{"rating":"2","title":"timeless and relevant","review":"No matter how often I read one of Ms. O'Connor's works I'm reminding that while some things in the south have changed, many others have remained the same. While written decades ago, these stories could have very well taken place in what we now call the New South. All that is needed is the token transplant from the North to add an additional dynamic.For Southern Gothic, no one can beat Flanner O'Connor and the way she weaves the human fabric into the soils of society. This collection is worth a read at least once a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent as long as you don't read more than one at a time","review":"I highly suggest that if you wish to enjoy this woman's stories you follow the advice of an earlier review. Read them one at a time. If you don't you'll figure out the same thing I did, it's really basically one story about a woman who screws up everything for her family over and over again with the names changed.Whether it's the dead daughter in \\"The Artificial Nigger,\\" the too astute grandmother in \\"A Good Man\\" or the embarrassingly incompetent farm women, or the despicable mothers and their even more flat and dreary college educated children, Flannery can't seem to do anything other than recycle herself and the people that annoyed her into the same drek over and over.

I thought it would be a great idea to purchase this book as a little prize for the trip.I read a couple of the short stories and found them to be a bit disturbing. Not at all what I expected. I do not need to have a \\"happy ever after\\" ending to stories but I read as an escape into anothter world. I did not enjoy visiting the world through Flannery O'Connor's eyes. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strategic technology alliance: no borders to technology","review":"This book takes a detailed look at the development of Flat Panel Displays and the enormously complex and expensive developments (in science, technology, manufacturing and manufacturing equipment) needed for them. Based on extensive field interviews in the US and Japan, the authors show that no company could have developed the technologies required alone. Instead, a collaborative community of practice of suppliers, manufacturers, scientists, and users had to coalesce, and did, in Japan. Nevertheless, some US firms were critical players: those that collaborated and participated in Japan. This book forces us to rethink simple-minded notions of how and where technology can develop, with profound implications for managing strategy, making trade policy, and understanding increasingly complex high tech strategy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not predict shifts in industry","review":"This book is written in a scholarly style, and is rather laborious reading.

Dated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Backward looking","review":"This book gives a good overview of the Flat Panel sector; it may provide a good academic case study. However, as a manager, I was also looking for advice that I could apply now. This sector has been characterized by intense competition and turbulence, especially as regards international competition.

He stays true to the sport and never strays too far from it (or its many characters). With great books, readers say they never want to see the characters potrayed in the movie because it will never live up to the image/character they've envisioned.

The first hardcover book I purchased for paperback reprint was Rick Telander's \\"Heaven Is a Playground.\\" I was taken by Rick's story-telling abilities, his eloquence and his love for the ghetto kids who saw basketball as their only ticket out. This was something more than a sports book. This was a book about an inner city world I knew little about, a world that Rick had experienced first hand. It was also a book I had to publish at Ace/Tempo. I am proud that I did, and I am happy to see that the book has been brought back into print after all these years.

I ordered this from Amazon, using part of a gift certificate which had been given to me by my daughter and paid over US $10.00 for it. Perhaps I should have read the description of it and the dimensions of the book more carefully but, as I thoroughly enjoyed reading Marilyn Schwartz' A Southern Belle's Primer, I thought that this would be in the same vein.

Having everyone in the worlds memories erased and no one knows what happened, but everyone has clued inside of their minds. It reminds me a little of the movie DARK CITY. It had a nice twist on the Giant Robot anime, instead focusing on the characters and story. The story was great, you couldn't stop watching. All the twists and turns along the way in search of the what happened forty years ago. The story and characters were the best part of the show. The music was great, the animation was pretty good, and the action was good. The ending was great, but I still have no idea what really was going on. That's why I wish Cartoon Network had agreed to a season 3. I guess it just wasn't popular in both Japan and the USA.Overall I think BIG O is under appreciated by most anime fans.

And no, I'm not one of those people that would consider that a good thing.

It would sometimes stall and I would have to reset the player by turning it off and unplugging it. Finally, after 5 months of infrequent use and perfect care, it refused to play any sort of disc whatsoever and gave me HO2 errors.

They said the laser is probably misaligned from a drop or putting something hot on the unit (neither happened). They said we could send the unit (at our cost) to them and they would charge us for parts and for labor OR we could purchase a new player for $100. Since we'd only had the player for nine months and had treated it wonderfully, neither choice seemed acceptable. We are not satisfied with the way Panasonic handled this case.

This is my first DVD player. Earlier I used to have a VCD player. Compared with that, this box is good one. Amazing audio quality.But, I am struck with the video quality. The movie is sluggish. Is it due to the step-down transformer I am using to bring the voltage from 240 to 110? Infact, I got a US model to use in India.

The power will stay on as long as I don't insert a disc, but as soon as I open the door, load one in the tray, press the open/close button, and watch the tray slide closed, it shuts off within three seconds.Quick searches on the web (and of other reviews at Amazon) show this to be a very common problem. Apparently there is even a more common HOX (X=2-7) error that affects many others' players, although we did not experience that with our particular unit.My own limited research shows many Panasonic models are affected by these problems, so to be safe, I plan on seeking another brand as a replacement.

One feature I like, but didn't think I would, is the zoom, which increases the size of the picture without a loss of clarity, which is a boon on a tiny set.

If you are simply interested in this field - find a copy of Carl Wicklands \\"30 Years Among the Dead\\" - it's a lot more convincing.

It seemed to address a specific problem I was researching from a novel point of view. However, my dissapointment upon obtaining it and reading it was extreme. Even after redefining possession in this rather politically correct view of 'spirit attachment', the author fails to offer more than bone or two toward the how's and why's. Fully 85 percent of the book are recountings of seemingly effortless 'healings'. Dr. Ireland-Frey lays the probable cause of everything from mood swings to cancer to Multiple Personality Disorder to some level of 'spirit obsession'. If you are looking for a book to aid you in seeking to understand why certain things might occur, this is not your book. If, however, you want a book full of happy endings, and not a hair mussed in achieving them, indeed \\"Freeing the Captives\\" might be exactly what you are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"The author does a splendid job of describing various forms of \\"attachment\\" with accompanying case histories. It is a most thought provoking book, and I would recommend that everyone read it.

Salman seemed disinterested and detached from the role of a blow-hot/blow-cold husband to Karina Kapoors' vapid acting as an abandoned wife. Sohail was irritating and his acting was wetter than Jacques Cousteau's wetsuit in a poor attempt to inject some inane comedy into the movie.

You will only find this film funny for about five minutes. After that, you will be wondering what dolt thought that this would make a good movie. It is only about 90 minutes, but it is so bad that it seems like days when the movie is finally over. I remember reading an interview with Jackie Chan where he commented that this was the worst film that he had ever made, and if you make the mistake of watching it I think you will agree. It is based off of an anime series by the same title. The anime is better, and would rate about 2 1/2 stars. The film fails to capture even the average quilty of the anime. If you enjoy watching bad movies for laughs, I would strongly recommend that you avoid this one.

Nor would any Kung Fu movie fans. There are a few scenes which are very memorable, ie- Bruce Lee Move theatre, Streetfighter, and a pretty cool end fight scene. This is one silly film, maybe even a bit stupid and weird at times. My two friends hated this movie alot, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. Jackie Chan has done better, no doubt, and this is not for first timers. Its an attempt at creating the world of Anime in a non-animation setting. I appreciate what its trying to do, and it had alot of funny gags that you would find normally in an anime. (FOr example guy characters always are hungry and girl chasing)The fight scenes are goofy, but as always jackie makes them interesting, especially the end fight. This is not for everyone, but its cool to see an Anime come to life like this.HardCore Jackie Chan fans need only apply."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointed Jackie Chan fan.","review":"This may have been one of those movies Jackie did as a favor to a friend. If so, it must have been a REALLY good friend. This has to be by far the worst Jackie Chan movie since the 1970's. It is silly, sophomoric, and moronic. Jackie does almost none of the of the great stunt work he is famous for. Instead, he just clowns around mugging for the camera like it's some sort of home movie for his friends. And it is not even his voice in the soundtrack.As a matter of fact, the only laughs I had during this movie were the poorly done English subtitles: \\"Out of bullets! What a miser!\\"I was expecting something really good after reading these other reviews. To each his own, I suppose. My first Jackie Chan movies were the Police Story series. If you are looking for another one of those, this is not it!This movie makes me wonder why great films like \\"Police Story\\" are not out on DVD and most of Jackies worst films are.

And a disgrace for the original City Hunter. Jackie Chan as Saeba Ryo?! Puh-lease!The attempts at manga/anime humor fall on barren ground and turn the movie into an even more of a farce as it already is.I wouldn't recomend this movie not even to my worst enemy and I agree with the reviewer who said 'when you die and go to Hell, Satan makes you watch this movie'.

By example, while fighting at the game room, he turns into characthers of the \\"Street fighter\\" video game, turning even into Chun Li (with make up, dress and everything) and making some of the moves as in the videogame.It is uncomfortable to enjoy the movie when it turns so stupid.

Brilliant. It's a very, very cynical show (and if you're looking for a satiric explanation of the mess we're in today, the book of this show is not a bad place to look). Bernstein's music has its moments -- \\"Walk Away,\\" is always mentioned as the show's best ballad, and it is quite haunting, but on the whole it sounds like music orchestrated for 100 kazoos, and that deserved such orchestration. Worst of all are the performances: all three leads sing very crassly, Marlyn Mason particularly limning what appears to be an extremely unpleasant character.

I tried to find sth good on those 2 cd's - i found only 2 tracks worth listening: Nightcrawlers - Push The Feeling On (Rosabel Club Anthem) on CD1 and Origene - Sanctuary (Moran/Rigg Remix) on CD2.

It's all non-stop.

With other rock acts releasing their live albums recently (most notably, Guns n' Roses and Metallica), it comes at no surprise to see one by Motley Crue. This album captures the raw essence of Motley Crue as a live band and will please those like me who has never had the chance to watch the band live. Classics like Looks That Kill, Dr. Feelgood, Shout at the Devil, Live Wire and Home Sweet Home are all here. Some have criticized the sound and mixing on this album as being poorly done. But personally, I feel that a live album should not be over-produced. My only complain is that there are not enough songs here from the 'Theatre of Pain' and 'Girls, Girls, Girls' albums. I am not too sure but from what I have heard, the Crue never played any songs from their recent album 'Generation Swine' during their tour. I am quite curious about how songs like 'Afraid' and 'Glitter' will sound live."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Essence\\" of the Crue...","review":"This is the best live album ever...period.

I at first thought that maybe it was some earlier recordings back in the day. No such luck this was some recent stuff. I was so disapointed with this album I wanted to toss it out the window, then I thought that wouldn't be very fair either somebody might find it and think they scored then they would have to suffer.

There's a reason this two CD set is so cheap. The songs are poor, the drumming is weak (why is Tommy Lee considered such a great drummer?) and Vince Neil's vocals are just horrible. Neil definitely has one of the weakest \\"heavy metal\\" voices I've ever heard.

If this is the best the Crue can do, it's little wonder they left a live album until now. The production on this is woeful. Granted some of the stuff was recorded in the early 80s when they were first starting out, but one would expect that the material recorded later would be of better quality. Vince just can't cut it live. He can't keep up with the pace of the songs and ends up just making noises that follow the tunes. The guitar is up and down and the bass is almost non-existant. This had the potential to be huge. They have had a long career and an enormous back catalogue to choose from, as evidenced by the track selection, but poor quality has let it down. There are better Hard Rock live albums out there. Only for the die hard Crue fan. One star for a live album, finally. And one for the Track listing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooooooring","review":"Loved the movie, but this novelization adds nothing new and really lacks the charm that the actors bring to the dialogue. In fact, it's an almost word-for-word adaptation. Go buy the movie instead. It's a much better value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"An unusual novelization of a film after its theatrical release, that also happens to be written by its director/writer. By telling the story of the movie from the point of view of one of its characters -- who knows about the movie, its script, and various other background materials -- The Last Days of Disco, with Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards actually improves upon what was an excellent, enjoyable film to begin with. But don't be concerned that this is some trite post-modern, deconstructionist gobbledygook, because Stillman is just as talented a novelist as he is a filmmaker, and he allows the wonderful, affecting story about a group of young people finding their way in the world hold center stage. Set against his marvelous descriptions of New York City at night, and its early 1980s club scene, along with the great dialogue Stillman's films are known for, Stillman's novelization of his own film succeeds greatly on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable; Goes beyond the film","review":"For those of you who've seen the film, this story is told in the first person by Jimmy Steinway (MacKenzie Astin's character in the movie), as his character is hired by Castle Rock to tell the story of the events told in the movie. It goes beyond the film somewhat and takes us up to the characters lives today. Typical Stillman. If you like Whit Stillman's films, this book is one you can carry with you at all times. Some of the scenes from the Club don't translate very well to the book, but that's actually a plus, because the film is NOT about disco or the club per se. (Hence the bad reviews from people who mistakenly thought just because the film took place at a club, that it was a ripoff of \\"54\\".) Those themes are methaphorical and the book helps bring everything into perspective. I probably wouldn't want to read the book without seeing the film first. And if you see the film, you also need to see \\"Metropolitan\\" and \\"Barcelona,\\" for it to all make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only they would last.","review":"I love these barely there pantyhose.

Miles O'Keefe is incredibly sexy and charming as John Smith. Seeing him scantily clad is nearly reason enough to buy this. Sandrine Holt is a youthful, energetic Pocahontas, both innocent and beautiful. She is different from her tribe and her fascination with John Smith is understandable.

I am a die hard gorehound and after reading many online reviews I thought I was gonna be in gore heaven (or hell,giving what this film deals with), but alas it just didn't deliver enough for me, the make up effects were good not great, there was some attention to detail missing and there were really only two gory scenes in the film, they kept going back repeatedly to show the same scene over and over, I would have liked to have seen more different scenes of bloody violence...all in all at the end I just sat for minute and thought \\"that's it\\", I don't see what all the hoopla is about this film. In my opinion, if you want alot of gore like me check out the older films of Olaf Ettinbach, he delivers plenty of the gory goods on a low budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've ever seen.","review":"I've seen a lot of gore/horror/depraved movies, and this is by far the worst.

This was a confusing and disappointed book, told by an author I truly admire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out--full of mistakes","review":"In the section of this book mentioning the English mystic Anna Kingsford (1846-1888), many mistakes are made.The author says Anna's father was of French descent: no, it was Italian descent.Anna's father died in 1865, not 1867, and she died in 1888 not 1885 as stated.Her collaborator, Edward Maitland did not call her a \\"blonde goddess\\", he said she had flowing golden hair, the envy of a goddess.Anna did not dominate or boss Edward Maitland, as stated by the author, who also gets page references wrong.My information comes from\\"The Life of Anna Kingsford\\" by Maitland, a source misquoted by Washington.I havn't the inclination to investigate further errors in this book, which must be many judging from the eight pages I investigated.The author sensationalizes much of his subject matter, to the detriment of objectivity.If you read this book, take care."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought scholarship meant impartiality?","review":"Any attempt to write a book looking at history in a different way is good. I wish he had spent more time trying to present facts instead of injecting his own opinion. In the end he just sounded fanatical. (shrug) I guess we all have to make a living somehow."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"the writing was dry and boring and i bought this to learn about Blavatsky and he only gave a brief introduction to her in the first couple of chapters and then meandered on and on about the history of how the the theosophical club came about and all the people involved in it. The title should have reflected the focus of the book which is not on blavatsky but on theosophists historically in general"},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, your anti New Age bias is showing...","review":"its the age of pathography, or the tearing apart biographical writing that uses pretentitious deep scholarship and wild pamphleteering exquisitely sewn together. Its funny however that most of the attacks are against the New Age movements. What about the Christian fundamentalists? Are they less ridiculous or dangerous? Why bother about the largely forgotten Blavatsky when the real taking over of America is being brewed by bible belt looneys? A book like this looks like a real diversion tactic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Known Facts","review":"Not only was the Thoesophical Society all this and more, but the group has ties to the Nazi party, or rather, antisemitism in Germany pre-holocaust. Few realize it was the Theosophical publishing houses which printed many of the antisemitic tracts which so influenced the people, and Hitler, who was converted to antisemitism through a tract. For some details on this The Printing Press as an Agent of Change, by Elisabeth Eisenstein.This book is excellent, invaluable. When people realize all of the pies the Theosophical Society has it's fingers in, though, there will be more weeping than laughing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Biased!","review":"This book is about political infighting between early members of the Theosophical Society, its offshoots and similar groups. It bearly discusses the philosophies these various people espoused. I am neither a theosophist nor an anti-theosophist, but had heard of the people discussed in the book and was interested in learning more. I didn't learn what I wanted to know, though: What were these people's philosophies? How did they develop their teachings and how did one system compare to another? I guess Mr. Washington would perhaps call his book an expose. But I don't understand why an author who seems to sneer at these theories would even want to write a book tearing down other people's beliefs and religions. What happened to live and let live?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Madame Blavatsky's Baboon","review":"The problem with this book is that the author did not know the people he is writing about. Peter Washington simply read a stack of books by other authors and combined them into single manuscript. What you get from this effort is not new, not particularly insightful, and likely to be highly unreliable in terms of accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"contemptuous","review":"I'm no follower of the people this book is about, but I wouldn't have picked it up unless I thought I'd get some reasonable objective information from it. Washington has the most contemptuous tone imaginable, often labeling the subjects of his books as pederasts and such. Makes me wonder what his real reason was for writing the book; I didn't get through very much of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second rate at best","review":"This is a People magazine type approach to the biographical history of some of the key players in modern western esotericim. Unfortunately, the author never rises above the level of gossip informed by a palpable contempt for his subjects.Sadly, the author isn't even a good writer. He has as his subjects the most eccentric and quirky individuals imaginable. Yet the book is really quite dull. It takes considerable commitment to trudge through the 400 pages of text.Besides a lack of sympathy for his subjects, it is also clear that the author's knowledge of theosophy, anthroposophy, the work of Gurdjieff and his progeny is entirely superficial. The author's intepretations and insights range from banal cliches to ill informed whoppers.No one who actually knows anything about this subject will find this book to be satisfactory. Those who don't know much will gain little from this book except some background information."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK FUKK..THIS IS BACK!!!","review":"YES FIENDZZ...THIS IS BACK IN PRINT!!!!Maybe the best death metal album ever made, it is scarey to even think about this album that is how bad a$$ it is!!If you wanna see if you can handle something which only a few can take..then this is the cd for you!!If played very loud..you will be visited by the J.B.I. or yer local police riot team!! if this was played at max capacity by nasa or something like that..we would no longer have a solar system!!Try and open yer mind and buy this DISC!!! JUST HIDEOUS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandatory Album!","review":"LAEFS is a MUST for any and every death metal fan! The primitive and brutal approach used here is unique, one of the few classics of the early 90's death metal era!!! highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ideal \\"self-study\\" book for undergrads","review":"The book does a poor job at laying out the basics for the reader. In the first chapter only 2 pages out of 33 are dedicated to describing the theory, the rest of the chapter consists of word problems. Some of those word problems go beyond the scope of the theory outlined for you, to which I thought was not only unfair but a bit intimidating to the curious math student. Sadly, the majority of this book follows the same routine.From this layout it was clear that this book wasn't written with the complete novice in mind. The Discrete Math [also a Schaum's outline] book I bought alongside this one happens to cover the same topics and does a much better job at explaining the basics with reasonable problems to practice from.As I said before, I can't recommend this book to anyone who is looking to break way into Combinatorics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vcr/dvd desk","review":"I didn't have any problem with this product. The setup is easy. It has all relevant input/outputs (although I used it only to connect both vcr and dvd to the TV). DVD has progressive scan and DTS. You can use it as a cd payer and it also can play MP3 CDs (although I didn't try it yet). My only complaint is related to the remote. I use it as universal remote (it was easy - my tv is also Panasonic) and it's very easy by mistake to do something, for example, with VCR when you really working with TV. Happened to me already quite a few times. But all in all, this shortcoming is not enough not to recommend this unit as simple and reliable vcr/dvd combo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible remote","review":"I have a degree in Computer Science from U.C. Berkeley, so I'm not usually intimidated by technology. But this remote is just impossible. Lots of tiny, identical buttons with microscopic labels. You can only use the remote using reading glasses in a strong light. Many of the controls are non-intuitive even when you find the right buttons. The manual is strikingly unhelpful; one of the worst I've seen.I actually bought a universal remote but this deck wouldn't respond to it at all.(Rant: user interface design is a well-understood discipline, so why is it that user interfaces seem to be getting worse rather than better?) Anyway, I returned it and got a JVC XVC33U, which is much easier to use and has a vastly better manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE LASER","review":"THIS UNIT WORKED GREAT FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR, THEN THE DVD LASER JUST WENT. THE THING PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE 50 HRS OF PLAY TIME ON IT AND HAS BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE OF. PANASONIC BASICALLY SAYS \\"TOUGH S...\\", THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED. THIS IS B.S. AS THE UNIT IS ONLY A LITTLE OVER A YEAR OLD. I WILL NEVER BY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM PANASONIC. I NOW HAVE A $170.00 PEICE OF JUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Player does not work","review":"I bought this DVD combo because wanted to have 1 device that will play my old VHS tapes and didn't wanted a new device just for DVD's.It turn out that I might need to buy separate devices since this is my second combo unit (different brand) and in both cases the DVD player was faulty.Had to give them 2 stars since the VHS player does work.Great unit if you can get the DVD player to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Played OK until it broke","review":"This was an OK model until the VCR part stopped working a little after a year. I made the mistake of taking it to a Panasonic authorized repair shop where they charged me almost as much as I paid in the first place to fix it. It also took them about 2 months to fix. The sad thing is that within 6 months later it had the same problem.Since all of the combo players available anymore appear to be pieces of crap made over in Asia I bought a Sony from a retailer that offers an extended warrantee. I figure the extra cost is less then the cost of a repair or a new one, and I will be very surprised if it still works in three years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I had the first one for about 2 weeks and the VHS part broke. I received a replacement and the same thing happened. In about 2 weeks the VHS part broke again with the same problem. The tape doesn't go in all the way and it eats the tape. I called Panasonic regarding fixing it. They were terrible. I closest repair center was over an hour away and if I were to ship it, I would have to pay for shipping both ways. They were not apologetic about it either. It should not break in 2 weeks! Nonetheless 2 of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HO2 Error strikes again","review":"I have had this DVD player for almost 18 months. After 1 month I got an H02 error, Called Panasonic for help and got the worst customer service I have ever experienced, all they would provide is the address to authorized service centers. Sent it in and got it repaired under warranty (about 3 weeks to get it back). Now after a year the H02 error strikes again, no longer under warranty I am going to junk it. Look at other reviews (epinions, etc..) This H02 error is all over, I will never buy another Panasonic product. If not for the errors the product worked fine and would appear to be a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never","review":"Nick Carter's \\"Now or Never\\" is a great album. I think he will definately go far in his solo career. Backstreet Boys helped make him known all over the world, and I think this is just the beginning for him. I have waited so long for this to come out. I am a huge Nick Carter fan and I hope there are many more! I am made fun of alot since I am 21 and am crazy about a Backstreet Boy. But I don't care because my opinion is all that matters.I can really relate to many of the songs on \\"Now or Never\\". It makes me think of all the good and the bad experiences I have gone through. He has such a wonderful voice, too. I just keep playing the cd over and over. I think it is great for anyone and any age. I highly recommend it. Go buy Nick Carter's \\"Now or Never\\" TODAY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Album","review":"This new solo album, was an impressive debut of Nick Carter's solo career. The 12 songs on the cd, show what has been really inside of him since the beginning. The songs of the album are quite different, although not too far off, from a Backstreet Boys song. It has more of a rock feel, with catchy rhythms and original tunes. Songs like \\"Do I Have To Cry For You\\", which was written by Nick Carter, are nice slow songs which are sure to make you smile. These songs are very impressive and have definitely shown Carter's creative side, as well as some really good singing. This album is a must-buy, so don't wait any longer! Nick Carter has outdone himself on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter NOW not Never!","review":"I have to say that this CD of his is superb!!! With it's style of 80's rock, it's so him! It expresses who he really is and us as fans like to see stars as they truly are. Many of his songs remind me of the famous music artists such as Bryan Adams and Bon Jovi. It's really not like pop which most people think it will be because he's a Backstreet Boy. I really recommend this CD, so if you haven't bought it yet then buy it now because I can tell you this CD is well worth your money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album Since Black and Blue","review":"I'm a huge Backstreet Boys fan, probably one of the biggest, and Nick Carter's album is just as good as the whole group's albums. From the 1st moment I heard 'Help Me,' I knew this album would be nothing like anything I've ever heard before. Every song is different as Nick explores basically every style of music ever created. With the slow ballads of 'Do I Have to Cry For You' and 'Heart Without a Home,' the mid-tempos sounds of 'My Confession' and 'I Got You,' and the upbeat sounds of 'I Stand for You' and 'Is it Saturday Yet,' who wouldn't love this album? Nick shows his awesome writing skills on everything he wrote and there is no doubt that with or without the Backstreet Boys, Nick's not going anywhere!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never","review":"Well I must say that getting Now or Never was a feat in itself (in other words, don't let mom go shopping for you) but when I popped it into the CD player, I was mesmorized. \\"Do I Have to Cry For You\\" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. As I listened to (and read--courtesy of the lyrics pages) the words, I thought to myself, \\"Wow, this is a ballad you could picture someone like Bon Jovi singing.\\"Aside from the amazing ballads, more fast-paced songs like \\"I Stand for You\\" and \\"Girls in the USA\\" also added to the pop/rock quality of the CD. I'd definatly reccomend getting this album, you won't be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"~*dont have it? GO GET IT!*~","review":"From hearing all the opinion of fans and non-fans of Nick Carter about his upcoming album have been good and not so good. After hearing the album I had proved myself correct and Nick himself proved himself that its an awesome CD. The songs are songs you can sing and dance along to and the words are so touching. Believe it or not, Nick wrote the songs, and he also plays the guitar in some of the songs. This CD reflects him and what he has gone through. If your a Backstreet-Boys fan you will definitely love this. I recommend this for teenagers who love pop/rock, you wont regret this CD. There isnt any chance that you will dislike this CD. So if you dont have it yet, rush out the store and buy yourself a copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST AMAZING!","review":"I have been a fan of the backstreet boys since I was 14 years old...I'm now 21 and I bought Nick's album pretty much as a obligation because I still like the boys. What I didn't expect was an absolutely amazing album with tracks that you just can't get out of your head...and I'm not even a rock music fan! Plus the album isn't totally rock music. You will love it trust me..go and get it!..Oh ya the DVD is really good too, so if you wanna get the DVD you have to hurry becasue it isn't gonna be in all the CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter is breaking off the pop edge..and it is amazing!","review":"Whether you are a Backstreet Boy's fan or not, you will appreciate Nick's debut album. He is trying to break off of the pop edge to more of a rock groove which you can totally tell from this album. This album has a lot of depth with many different genres of music being represented. He has many Bon Jovi like songs on this album which are amazing as well as the beautiful ballads that show off his very talented voice. This album is something you do not want to miss out on, even if you've never heard of Nick Carter. It is also not an album you will ever regret buying. I have already played mine to death and it just came out yesterday. It is a very addicting album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter's Now or Never Soars","review":"Nick Carter steps out of the band and into the spotlight as a solo artist with his debut album \\"Now or Never.\\" Nick displays great talent on this album and demonstrates his individuality as an artist. This album has it all, from rocking tunes to ballads, with the fun tune \\"Is It Saturday Yet?\\" thrown in for good measure. Nick proves himself the be a force to be reckoned with on this album. His smooth voice makes the album pleasing to the ear. I'm sure this album is the first of many to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter breaks free from BSB with smashing solo album!","review":"Backstreet's baby brother, Nick Carter, has proved to his fans and the world that he can rock out as a solo artist. His first solo effort, Now or Never, has 12 original songs that clearly shows that Carter is ready to break out of his shell. On the first track, \\"Help Me\\", is a catchy tune that talks about a guy needing help with his way through life with lines like, \\"Help me/ Figure out the difference/ Between right and wrong/ Weak and strong...\\" The tender ballad \\"Do I Have To Cry For You\\", has Carter on a more sensitive, Bryan Adams-type love song and is perfect for anyone going through any type of romantic issues. Although most of Now or Never has more of the 80's pop/rock vibe, it boldly states that an artist that has been with a group for ten years can finally journey out on his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter, Artist of the \\"Millennium\\"","review":"Nick's album, \\"Now or Never\\", is the dream longtime fans have been waiting for!! This rock-influenced album, jam-packed with vocals that rival Bon Jovi's and amazing guitar riffs, is essentially Nick in his element. From his debut single, \\"Help Me\\", to the heartfelt ballad \\"Heart Without a Home\\", Nick proves his vocals can handle more than just pop. While showing that his rock influence fits seamlessly into the music, Nick's voice exudes emotion unseen in most musicians his age.Nick also dispels the belief that he's not just a singer; in fact, he co-wrote five tracks on the album. His collaborations with other musicians and writers show the range of his skills as a songwriter and the growth of his emerging talent and style...."},{"rating":"2","title":"best album of the year","review":"This album was incredible!! the music, the pictures, the lyrics, you name it. nick really outdid himself on this album and showed off his real talent and i commend him for it. anyone who likes any type of music should buy it because its garunteed youll find at least one song if not the whole album that youll fall in love with and listen to over and over and over again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Nick's first solo cd is just good.
