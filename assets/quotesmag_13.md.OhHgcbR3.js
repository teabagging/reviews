I was disappointed. Now, don't get me wrong, the album has some good songs on it, but it doesn't match up at all to any more recent albums they've done. It has a very, very strong early 90's rock sound and is produced poorly so it sounds very cheezy at times. However, some of the genius songwriting comes through it all at times, such as \\"By Myself\\". I would suggest only buying this album if you're a diehard fan and really just need the album to be complete, or if the album is on sale for like 5 dollars or less (I got a tape of it for 3 dollars). If you want to start listening to PfR and are looking for a good \\"first album\\", try out \\"Them\\" and then \\"Disappear\\". \\"Them\\" is better when it comes to the music but \\"Disappear\\" is produced alot better (like a million times better), although both are alot better and more mature than \\"Goldie's Last Day\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why spend $1.97 on a cheap gun when . . .","review":"you can spend a little more on one (or two) of these?I had purchased a cheap caulking gun because it was \\"cheap\\" and I didn't think that it would make a difference.

There is also some great rock tracks from Ash, Feeder, Manic Street Preachers and Depeche Mode but the rest of the CD tends to be filled with some minor hits and other not so great songs.

Actually, the book doesn't know what it is.

The final 2 chapters were very choppy. I was able to buy FINAL DESTINY the Director's Cut and it was a bit better.

The first episode on the disc was a cleverly disguised clip show episode,which I managed to overlook since I just wanted to get to the final battle, leaving the 3 episodes left to tie everything up, however the last episode was a huge dissappointment. The battle was ended and everything, but it felt as though no one learned anything in the end, especially Shin who spent the whole 50 episodes incredibly deluded. Not only that but we don't get to see the aftermath of battle, tie that in with Cagali only getting a few seconds of screen time in the entirety of the final volume with no speaking lines, and I'll tell you it was an awful way to end a series.

Neither plot devices nor character development is well constructed. And worst of all, Episode 50 had NO CLOSURE. To get the real ending, one has to get the extended FINAL PLUS episode, slated for release in March.To add insult to injury, Bandai screwed up Disc 12. All you get is a \\"Oh, we're sorry\\". I was well informed on the recall issue, but other unsuspecting buyers went to the store for exchange 2 to 3 times. What about the hassle caused, Bandai?

I'm happy say this is standout, not only from a visual perspective, but from a functional one as well. This is forged, not stamped. I have found that any stamped knife I buy no matter the cutting capability-I simply do not like because of the way it feels in my hand.

Most of us aren't yet settled into our careers and our friends have moved all over the place to pursue careers, grad school...etc.It's hard to just \\"love yourself and your life while you wait for Mr. Right\\" while your life is so full of uncertainties.

Even though they are mercifully short (Hand is 67mins and Tomb is 60mins) they have few redeeming qualities. The acting is at times rather wooden and in the case of the Mummys hand two of the heros are vaguely reminisent of Abbott and Costello. Whether this was intended I very much doubt.The Mummy itself is a pretty clever makeup creation (no CGI remember) and there are one or two moments in both films where the closeups of the mummys face must have been pretty scary back in the 1940's. However any tension created is soon lost because the films are largely confined to one or two sets and the plots are pretty contrived and disbelief settles in quite quickly when you realise that the Mummy can only walk at 1.5 miles an hour. Naturally the characters in the film don't seem to grasp this important fact!See the Boris Karloff original, which is one of the great Universal horror films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mummy's Hand Review","review":"Wallace Ford ruins this movie.

In Uncivil Seasons he takes a simple murder in Hillston, NC, and uses it to trigger a thoughtful and purposeful journey into the lives and souls of a cross section of the folks in this Peidmont town. Humorous with an effortless command of dialogue and language, if Uncivil Seasons is your first Malone book you'll be speedtyping through this website to find the rest. Unfortunately he hasn't had anything new published years (that I'm aware of). Perhaps biding his time as head writer on \\"One Life To Live,\\" (as the inside cover indicates) until this country comes to it's senses and covets stories by authors like Malone instead of stories by White House interns. He's good enough to make you start watching soaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat combo of mystery and Southern mood","review":"Michael Malone has written a wonderfully atmospheric mystery. The Southern locale and characters are vivid and fascinating, including the alcoholic hero whose point of view, wit and eloquence are very appealing. There are really two leads, both policemen, and their differences add even more to the book, including the surprising denoument. (The next book in the series is narrated by the other policeman so there is a different point of view.) Complex plot and a killer whom I hadn't identified, which is always a good thing.A very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"His best book by far.

Justin, the thoroughly unlikeable hero is arrogant sees faults in everyone but himself and blames others for all his faults, is so inconsistently drawn you really can't figure him out and the villains aren't even worth getting upset about. The dialogue is really stilted, Cuddy calling Justin \\"General Lee\\" passes for witty repartee. And the \\"love\\" interests -- are just not believable The men are two dimensional, the women are truly uni-dimensional how could the men be interested and how could the women be interested in the men.From the reviews I read before I read the book, I expected much better.

And those were comedies, this is supposed to be taken more seriously.Also the hopping zombie and the hopping vampire are really different. The hopping vampire is what you get when the hopping zombie gets out of control. At least I guess that's the way it works. They also dress differently and have different abilities and weaknesses.The hop scoffers seemed to like the movie, so I'm not sure what the problem is.Me, I thought it was a little silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZOMBIES INTO VAMPIRES???","review":"I don't know if this tale is based of Chinese folklore or if they just screwed up trying to copy American horror film. Zombies can become vampires if they eat enough human flesh. You can recover from a zombie bite, but will turn into a vampire if bitten. The zombies are waxed cover so there is no decay. And rather than drag a leg behind them, they bounce up and down as if they are on a pogo stick. The vampire engages the vampire hunters with typical anti-gravity martial art moves.There are 4 guys, their master and a girl and none of it is good. The translation was hip. Now the idea this is \\"destined to become a martial arts/horror classic\\" has somehow slipped under the radar for 10 years.No nudity, sex, or swearing.

I wouldn't mind the illogical premise ( anyone who dies is a potential zombie<!?> which over time would transform into a vampire ), as long as it delivers on the action-- but unfortunatly, it exuberates an already silly plot, which in itself is jarring and lacking in direction. The narrative doesn't have the same charming aimlessness of say, Time & Tide, and features truly corny comic moments. The action is standard wire-fu, and it's compentantly done, though there's really nothing that stands out here. The monsters look like crap ( no, really ), and move like they've been out in the sun too long.

It jumps back and forth between the war between humans and vampires and the race for the gold. And what do they mean by VAMPIRES? The monsters don't even look like blood suckers.

That said, I am on my 4th tea maker since December. The first 3 worked wonderfully for weeks then the basket would not sink at the right time or at all. This time, the tea maker just stopped dispensing. Customer service is great, friendly and helpful, but I'm sure that I will need replacements past the 1-year warranty.

The Tea pot and the serving tray and cups are very well thought out and sit very well in our modern kitchen. Friends and family are very impressed with it's simple technology and impressive results. The only improvement I would recommend to the designers is to add either small caps or a separate lid to the Tea Pot to keep the tea warmer longer.

Not with this machine ... you not only have to re-heat the tea in the microwave, but also dump the tea bags/loose tea back into the cup to steep more so what's the point? How could anyone be enjoying a cup of tea that tastes like slightly off cool water? For all the fancy packaging and thought that went into the sleek design, you'd think someone would have thought to put a heater in the thing and perhaps a thermal pot or something to at least keep it luke warm if you by chance use the bagged option which does warm a bit.

I'm looking now at the Breville One-Touch. With perfect hindsight I realize now I should have spent the extra $80 on a device with no negative reviews either on Amazon or the general internet.

The first problem is that it will realistically only make one cup of tea at a time. The two cups it says on it are really small, 6-8 oz. cups. If you want a mug, it only makes 1 cup. It doesn't keep the tea warm, either. If you don't pour your tea right away, it sits in the cold ceramic pot and gets cold very quickly. The ceramic pot drips. You will have to wipe the table every time. Then it leaves a couple of tablespoons of your tea in the container unless you tip it toward the valve as it dumps into the pot after steeping. Recently, it has begun leaking under the heating mechanism and the ceramic plate under the whole machine fills up with tea. I use this in an office and I don't like having to clean up after it all the time.

White teas become horribly bitter if over brewed.I have tried all of the tea type settings and the loose versus bag setting and all perform well.

Despite this minor hitch, the album is quite good. It meanders along at just the right pace, and there are enough extra bonuses here and there such as some production assistance from Jon Tye (Twisted Science), trumpet and flute on various other tracks. The first song may be misleading with its wistful vocals, as the rest of the album is more easygoing and instrumental.

Now Cady is out of prison and OUT FOR JUSTICE. It's some of Robert De Niro's best work! Nick Nolte does a great job as the lawyer, Sam Bowden, who did Cady wrong.The Jessica Lange character, with her sniping remarks, does not really work that well.This movie contains one of the best scenes in motion-picture history: The confrontation outside the restaurant between Max Cady and Kersek (played by Joe Don Baker).

The scene is slowed down, given morbid music, and depicts patriotic icons with bland expressions, going through the motions while an unenthusiastic crowd masks a black-and-white cancer. It also chooses to make Bob DeNiro a really dangerous Christian who quotes Scripture, speaks in tongues and preaches while he commits his acts of violence. Outside of one episode of \\"The X Files\\" in which a sect of Hasidic Jews included some ghost-Jew character who kills in the name of same ancient Hebrew tenet, I cannot recall seeing openly Jewish killers on screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad Max...","review":"Though I still prefer the original version, I do like Scorsese's re-make almost as much. It's a decent update w/ some added violence, sadism, and perversion to make Max Cady (Robert De Niro) all the more detestable. He is truly human slime. We can fear and hate him without guilt! Nick Nolte (The Deep) plays attorney Sam Bowden as a flawed man w/ a few problems of his own. Jessica Lange is Bowden's redhot wife, and Juliette Lewis (Kalifornia, Natural Born Killers) is their incredibly innocent daughter, Danny. It's also fun to see Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, and Martin Balsam (all from the first version) in cameo roles. Plus, we get Joe Don Baker (Walking Tall) as the ill-fated P.I.! This is De Niro's movie all the way. His Max Cady dominates every scene w/ malice, menace, and apalling arrogance. Great stuff w/ some nice surprises..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spectacular remake","review":"Robert DeNiro is great as Max Cady. He is a great villian. His performance was over the top.

A morality play about a psycho (played by Robert De Niro) who wants to get revenge over an attourney (Nick Nolte), this movie is derivative and tremendously by-the-numbers. Disappointing, really, given that the director and actors deserved better than a poor script with a very flawed execution. The final half hour on the boat is particularly bad and insulting, delivering an unconvincing resolution. Anyway, \\"Cape Fear\\" has one remarkable scene, where De Niro and Juliette Lewis have a weird moment of seduction.

Not only because it's graphically violent, but also it's horribly acted by most of its cast. I've never been a big Robert DeNiro fan, because he seems to play the same type of character in almost every movie he's in: the brutal, foul-mouthed tough guy who beats people up every chance he gets. In \\"Cape Fear\\", he plays that exact character, only this time it's in a slasher film rather than a drama. Juliette Lewis also overacts as the teenage daughter and Nick Nolte fares no better.

As Jack Cady DeNiro gives one of his most bizarre performances, as he portrays a man who is both resourceful and obsessed with revenge.The family played by Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis are a bit dysfunctional and Cady zeros in on their weaknesses and vulnerabilities like a bird of prey. All of the cast members are extraordinarily good in their respective roles.The direction of Martin Scorcese creates a building tension from the opening shots through the final scene.I deduct 1 star for the ending which goes a bit over the top and might have benefited from some additional editing but all in all this is a great horror tale of revenge by a psychopathic killer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the Top","review":"Sam Cady (Robert de Niro) has just been released from prison, and wants revenge on Sam Bowdon (Nick Nolte), the prosecutor who withheld evidence and sent him up.

Robert de Niro is so convincing as the sadistic con that I could hardly watch him.

I could have done without this.Even though I like Robert DeNiro, he was not able to carry out the role of Max Cady in the terrifying manner that Robert Mitchum did.The only good thing about this movie is that three of the original stars of 1962, Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam made cameo appearances in this movie.

It plays music and vibrates and it can run through batteries pretty quick if it's used a lot.My son didn't use this seat for more than 4 months though. He moved around too much and he was figuring out how to wiggle out of the harness. As he got to 9 months he was only using it as something to climb up on to get to higher things. It really is wonderful for newborns, but don't get it at a long term chair that will last through the first year.

I used this when I started feeding her solids since I didn't have a high chair, and she seemed able to swallow easily and her head was supported so it was easy for me to feed her without her bobbing around.

The pins, made out of cheap stamped metal, are folded to create a spring. The problem is that these pins break very easily along the crease where they are folded, and once they break, the base can collapse. One day while my two month old son was in the bouncer, one of the tubes slipped out of the mount (two pins were broken) and the bouncer lurched forward. Luckily I was close by and held on to the seat, preventing my son from falling out. The manual said to call Kids II, the maker of the chair, for customer service. I called, left a message and received no reply. I called Boppy's customer service several times and each time left a message and, again, no reply. I emailed customer service at Boppy and once again received no response."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bouncer","review":"I love this bouncer! I used to have one made by Fisher Price with massage and vibration that we loved, but this one is even better.One thing to point out... perhaps those people saying it does not bounce or you have to do it manually do not understand that bouncers only bounce when the infant kicks. If they are putting a newborn in it and expecting it to magically start moving, of course that is not going to happen. That is not a flaw in the item, that is just how bouncers work.

She also seems quite content to hang out in this chair if we have to do some things around the house. We also bring it outside if we're taking a break and reading, etc. The only thing that would make it better is that I wish it would come apart for easier travel.

It's so soft, the toys are especially cute and well made, and it's very springy.Someone posted an adorable customer photo that shows the boppy insert as green, I just wanted to note that it wasn't, or at least, ours wasn't, so I'm not sure if that's just from the initial model or if they changed their's out?The cloth is exceedingly cuddly. My husband noted that it's definitely not very portable, which is true. It's more of a stationary piece of furniture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"My son loves this chair!

It was a $16 well spent. The instructions are not very clear, but I knew how to use it from having watched others before. You push the wire through the pipes until you can go no more. Sometimes you encounter a bend in the pipes and the auger will not go further, so you stop there and spin the drum until you feel the wire slip further in. When you think you have caught something, pull the wire back (sounds sort of like fishing). It may take a few tries if the clog is way in the pipes, but with 25 feet to work with, you should be able to get the clog out in minutes. Don't forget to clean, dry and oil wire before storing it back into the drum. Easy enough for any handy woman with manicured nails like me to handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get job done due to drain cover","review":"It seems like it could get job done, but I could not get it down the drain due to the drain design/cover.

It took a little longer for me-- like half an hour and four or five inserts/ retractions and some elbow grease but it finally broke thru and bingo-- I solved the drain problem that had been rendering my bathroom sink unusable for the past three months.

It was completely useless and I struggled with it for 30 minutes with no results. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me!","review":"I actually bought this because my vacuum's hose was horribly clogged with a TON of carpet fuzz. (So much carpet fuzz that nothing was making it's way into the vacuum's canister).Anyway, I received the auger in good condition. It was wrapped in a million layers of bubble wrap. The directions confused me at first, but I figured it out. I thought that turning the knob would push the metal cord out, but that's not how it's designed. You have to manually pull out the cord and push it into the drain. The spinning handle on the back is the spin the metal cord in order to push it into the clog and grab it.After a few fishing expeditions into my vacuum's hose, I was able to pull out all the backed up carpet fuzz, and now I can vacuum again! (Lesson be learned though: beware of cheap carpet)I'll be keeping this nifty tool for any future drain clogs, or vacuum hose clogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Did what I needed it to do. Moved into a new house 8 months ago and about every month my bath tub drain would drain so slow (craw) that I needed to use some drain-o. The drain-o would do the job but within about 10 days I would always notice it was draining slower. Decided that I had something blocking the path that the drain-o wasn't getting. Used this product about a month and a half ago and my drain is still draining great. It was hard to work the turns in the drain (for that reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5). But it got the clog and my drain, drains like it should and has stayed that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, non ergonomic","review":"Have had this snake for years.

No book will GET you a job and hers has no magical formulas but it does have a plethora of wisdom and insights into the creative mind and spirit. The quotes that she has unearthed I found so heartening and true to my own feelings that I thought she had some keen ability untapped by more prosaic authors. However, I now believe she really did her homework from the perspective of a brillant pyschologist and she really knows the creative mindset.

Unfortunately, it was quite a disappointment. I took the quiz and it identified me as a type which I honestly don't agree with. Most of the recommended jobs were neither interesting nor creative. The rest were impossibly out of reach, such as symphony conductor or State Director of Natural Resources (I mean come on - there are only 50 in the nation and they are political appointees). The last straw was when it recommended my current position - a job in which I am slowly dying from lack of stimulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home at Last!","review":"I sort of \\"accidentally\\" found this book and feel like a whole new world has opened up.

I must start saying I really like Mariah, and I own 3 of her previous cds. With the perfect ballad \\"through the rain\\" Mariah promised us a new album like her old ones. But she came out with an album not very different from Glitter, with R&B songs, and rappers too. I must say I like one or two songs, but why can't Mariah go back to what she did in the past? This album won't be her comeback success everyone was waiting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her masterpiece, but a very good album","review":"The fundamental problem with this album is that though it IS a damn fine return to form for Mariah, that's just what it is - a return to the sound of \\"Daydream\\" and not a progression forward. Don't get me wrong, it's a GREAT piece of music, but I was hoping for something more innovative. That being said, it should also be made clear that it's not by any means a disappointment. I've played this album in its entirety a few times in the past week and I'm not tired of it. I guess what should be said is that \\"Charmbracelet\\" IS a Mariah album and NOT Mariah TRYING to be Mariah. THAT was the only thing I was afraid of happening. There aren't any really bad songs on this album, which is something that I thought I'd have to get used to after hearing certain tracks off \\"Rainbow\\". Most of them are relatively simple but not to a fault - actually, \\"Yours\\" and a few other songs sound pretty classic and almost timeless. Definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Comeback","review":"I had really lost touch with Mariah's works after Daydream. She seemed to take on a bit too much hip-hop influence and let it cramp her style. This album, while not denying the hip-hop side of things, definitely had Mariah running the show on all of the singles as well as many other songs. The only track which kept it from being a 5 star album was the final one, which in my honest opinion should have been aborted instead of going through production to land on this album rather than staying the B-side of a single. There is only so much variation on a song that can be called a remix and that track went way over the line. Had it had its own lyrics and message it could have been fine, but after hearing the \\"normal\\" version of Through the Rain most people would feel that this remix does not do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I personally think this cd is great.

Mariah's voice is absolutely beautiful. She's back and better than ever. Her cover of Def Leapord's \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\" is exceptionally well done. The rock inspired instrumentals and her sultry voice meld together to produce a beautiful sound. There are also some very cute, catchy up-tempos as well. \\"The One\\" is very catchy with a memorable chorus that makes you want to get up and dance. \\"Oh Boy (I Need You)\\" borrows a hook from Cameron's \\"Boy\\" and even features the rapper in a part of the song. The \\"Through The Rain Remix\\" is one of her best remixes yet. It features Joe and kelly Price. It's almost to the point of sickeningly catchy, almost similar to her '95 offerings. \\"My Saving Grace\\" is worth a mention. With its gosphel sound and beautiful melody it's easily a Carey classic. Charmbracelet has it all; from fun up-tempos to rock/ballads to RnB and even gosphel Mariah's done it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah is Back- and she is better than ever","review":"If you like the Mariah of the early 90's then this album is for you. I personally do not feel that anything Mariah has ever done has been a flop, but bad luck and publicity hurt her last album sales. \\"My Saving Grace\\" is one of the most inspirational songs I have ever heard. The album as a whole provides hope and lets the fans feel as if we are listeneing to an autobiography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet deal!","review":"I never was a fan of Ms. Carey, but I bought this CD and was surprised.

Her first single, Through The Rain, could not even reach TOP40,and that is the best track in the album. Too Sad.), the rest is a series of boring, irritating R&B+HIP HOP hybrids.Some say her previous flop, Glitter, was the worst album.

I didn't like this album too much either. But in regards to what u said between her and Madonna,Whatever. I like Madonna, she is talented, and top trend setter, but as an artisr, not any better than Mariah. Mariah has always produced her music ever since her first album, Mariah Carey. Madonna has just been out longer than she has. It doesn't mean she has always been ahead. That's in your head. Don't try to put that on everyone. While the first couple of albums she did from her label Maverick, they have only gone platinum in the US, while Mariah's Music box and DayDream have been selling 20 million records world wide, 10 million in the US.

People may think that Glitter was her worst, but I don't think they have seen worst yet compared to this album. At least Glitter was more fun to listen to. It got me on my feet, but this album did not. I like the theme, but the songs could have been better.

Tracks 2 through 14 each have the same musical undertones, the raspy, whispery voice and a synthesized version of Mariah's voice.

I was extremely dissapointed especially with \\"Bringin on the Heartbreak\\". I expected an awesome, powerful re-make, but it's nothing but whispering.

Her first and second album, her voice had a lot more power.

Thank goodnes for Deborah Cox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah's voice is as amazing as always","review":"I feel that Mariah Carey's Charmbracelet expresses true emotion, as well as showcases true vocal talent. She still managed to keep true to herself (as well as her die-hard fans) while recording this new album. She includes a wide variety of styles of music that may appeal to anyone, being a fan or not. The first song \\"Through the Rain\\" is a fabulous introduction. It is a beautiful and timeless ballad that reveals sentimental emotions while successfully conquering trials and tribulations. For her hip/hop & R&B fans out there, songs like \\"You Got Me\\", and \\"Irresistible\\" prove to be satisfying. All in all, Charmbracelet made me smile, sing, and dance.

The sound is so much better on the Cd than on the previews. :-) With songs such as 'I Only Wanted, My Saving Grace, Bringin On The Heartbreak, The One, and Yours,' Mariah returns more mature than ever not trying to project an image of pity and remorse; but one of perserverance and will. Artistically Mariah has a song for all of her fans. R&B; fans can be assured that songs such as 'Boy (I Need You), You Got Me, Irresistible,' will get you grooving! For the jazz fan, there's 'Subtle Invitation.' Lastly, the lasting impression from Charmbracelet is the way that Mariah used her 5-octave voice to full use. If Mariah ever did know what her salvation was, it has to be her voice and tremendous songwriting ability.Mariah continues to amaze fans such as myself.The music speaks for itself"},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 ALBUM","review":"The album is simply AMAZING!

Her lyrical talent along with musically has really shown through this album with her R&B roots or as some of the people have said this album to be \\"vintage Mariah.\\" \\"Clown\\" is a tasteful way of hitting a certain someone where it really hurts. \\"My Saving Grace\\" the more soulful/church sound on the album is a beautiful mix of grace and inspiration. \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\" a cover of Def Leppard, is probably one of the best covers done by a solo artist and also my favorite song on this album. \\"Boy, I Need You\\" is a fun frisky up temo song with a use of different musical sounds. \\"Yours\\" reminds me of the song \\"Fourth Of July\\" off of her Butterfly album. Then there is the first singal \\"Through The Rain\\" full of rich lyrical use! The list goes on with praise. I have noitced how much she has grown more musically and spiritually as an artist and as a human being. I can't wait to see what else she brings to her music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's no Butterfly or Daydream... but still pretty good.","review":"I am a very big Mariah fan.. so naturally I've been anticipating this album since I heard she was recording. I wish we could give half stars, because I would rate this album 3 and a half. I'm very annoyed with Mariah's breathy vocals, but the lyrics and the music are on point. Clown is just awesome and hilarious. My Saving Grace and Bringing on the Heartbreak are... just beautiful. Boy and The One are amazing. If she would sing like everyone knows she can, this album would definitely be my favorite. She needs to learn how to balance out a perfect mixture of belting and whispering. The closest she's ever gotten is Butterfly. That album is still number one in my book. But cop Charmbracelet. I'm naturally hard on Mariah because I'm a fan and I expect so much from her. Someone not so hard core would def love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah Carey Is Back!","review":"This new album \\"Charmbracelet\\" Mariah shows that she can still sing. Mariah bounces back from her last album/soundtrack \\"Glitter\\" with great ballads \\"I Only Wanted\\", \\"My Saving Grace\\" and the smash hit single \\"Through The Rain\\". But if you want to shake it a little more to the music you can go for \\"Boy\\" and \\"The One\\". Mariah shows skills on this album. She sings a song for her late father in \\"Sunflowers For Alfred Roy\\". This song is one of the best songs on the album. Mariah is still the best and her voice is better than ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Mariah","review":"The last couple of years for Mariah have been difficult, but if this is any indication of what is possible with a little suffering and upset, then I'll take it. Mariah has proven she has staying power. So many individuals were quick to count her out, but once again this album proves that she has fantastic staying power. We all make mistakes in our personal choices, but this album proves Mariah is quick to bounce back from the pitfalls of success. This is one of the best albums from Mariah it is cohesive, her vocals on the album aren't over done, and she uses what God gave her, a distinctive voice. Mariah is destined for a few more #1 hits, before any one can claims she is wash up. My favorite tracks are \\"My Saving Grace\\" (a powerful gospel ballad) \\"I Only Wanted\\" (a beautiful guitar string ballad)to \\"Yours\\" and \\"The One\\" (catchy r&b and soul) This is a must have for any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah is Back...and in BIG WAY!","review":"Be prepared to be 'Charmed' all over again by the biggest selling female artist of all time. Mariah's new album \\"Charmbraclet\\" is her most mature collection up to date. Her love for R&B is very apparent here. The songs flow together like silk sewn together with masterful precision. I highly reccommed that everyone buy this album and she what a true singer/songwriter is capable of. A few of the highlights are Mariah's cover of \\"Bringin' On The Heartache\\", originally done by Def Leppard, \\"The One\\", \\"Boy(You Got Me)\\", and \\"Subtle Invitation\\"...but please realize that every song is equally as good. MARIAH IS BACK! Get this album and you will not be disspointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow Mariah has put out another outstanding album","review":"I have heard all the songs on the album and Through the rain may not have worked but the rest of the album was really good lots and lots of hook in the music there a are a few rappers not like Glitter and Rainbow where the rappers dominate her songs this album has a mixture between old and recent Mariah she sings beautifully If you where a fan of Butterfly,Daydream and Music Box this album is a mixture between all of them.So I'm definetly buying it i'm hooked It's her best since Butterfly no RAINBOW OR GLITTER STYLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"The girl has talent. She starting to go back to her roots ,which is a good thing. I definitely recommend buying this cd if you are a fan!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost there","review":"Mariah Carey fans rejoice! She's back and almost in tip top form. This is a nice CD but truthfully only two songs on it have a shot at serious radio play. Hopefully someone is working on the remixes right now. There is too much whispering and holding back on the album, Mariah only cuts loose with that incredible range on two songs. I wanted yell \\"Sing Mariah!\\" I wish she'd leave the moaning and almost talking to less talented singers who have do that to sell a song. The bottom line with Charmbracelet is it's a tentative, careful release that sounds like she's not quite sure of herself yet. I'm not giving up on Ms. Carrey though. Perhaps with the success of this CD she'll be her old self again on the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected at all!","review":"The titles sounded pretty interesting and me being a big Mariah fan, I choose to buy the cd. I have been a big fan of hers for quite some time. But with this cd, I was not impressed. I don't like how she trys to be r&b and rap. She can't cut it well. I think her older albums are better. Rainbow is still better than this cd. I heard this was a good cd. Most of her songs in here has a little bit of rap in it. The noise of rappers covering her own voice isn't cool at all. Some of the lines the rappers make in the beginning and in the song sound terrible and make no sense. That fast talk whispering noise doesn't sound too attractive either. As a fan I still would say her older music was where she has impressed and gave me the approval of my taste of her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I was really looking forward to her new album, but was very disappointed. In general, the songs were OK, but none really stood out to me. It just seemed like all the songs sounded the same and you couldn't tell which one started and which one ended. I can't figure out what style or direction she was trying to go for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good artist; bad record","review":"Fans of \\"Mariah: The Early Years\\" should take caution before buying this CD: you will be sorely disappointed. Critics have reported that she returns to form on this album, but I certainly don't hear it. Sensational media drama aside, this woman has an AMAZING voice -- so it perplexes me that she and her producers fail to put it to good use. She seems to whisper a good portion of her vocals, and the majority of cuts are geared toward a rap-oriented audience. (This latter part is perhaps the most unfortunate blow to this long-time Mariah fan.) There are about five (out of 15!) songs that I would listen to again, the best of which is \\"My Saving Grace.\\" Is that worth the money I handed over to give her a chance to recapture my interest? Not in my eyes. What I see instead is a great artist struggling to come back out on top by trying to please too many audiences. In the end, I don't think she'll end up pleasing anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"This album does not even deserve a single star. It is awful. The only good song is \\"Through The Rain\\". I would suggest you buy the single and not waste your money on this piece of garbage. Go buy the Greatest Hits album if you want something good from Mariah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tight Music, Mediocre Vocals","review":"Mariah Carey's \\"comeback\\" is the same recycled material all over again. That's not a bad thing- if only her voice was the same. Listening to her sing about rainbows, butterflies and charmbracelets might not be so bad if she still had her amazing voice from the early 90s. Unfortunately, she can't even sing a full song without going into this pathetic airy and breathy voice. The most annoying part is her alternating from strong, beliting voice to airy voice every other line of the same song!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Comeback","review":"What a great comeback cd! Mariah is one of my favorite singers of all time, but the Glitter soundtrack was very disappointing. I mean there were like 3 songs on the whole cd that I liked. This cd picks up where Rainbow left off. My favorite songs are \\"The One\\", \\"Clown\\", \\"My Saving Grace\\", and \\"Bringing on the Heartbreak\\". To be honest I like all of the songs, I was surprised that she picked the most boring song off the cd \\"Through the Rain\\" as her first release. I like the song, but it is quite a bore. I mean this cd plays like a story, like Mariah's previous cds. There is a some sampling, some rap, some ballads, and some fun songs. That is why she is so talented because she can do all of those songs so well. I think her fans will be very pleased with this cd, and I think this one will be playing in the car for a hot minute. Best of luck Mariah, and once again thanks for not making the fans wait every 4 years for another cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start","review":"This album may not be as good as Mariah's previous products, like 'Music Box' and 'Daydream', but without doubt this is a very good start after her troubled year. Listening to the songs like 'Through the Rain' ,'Irresistible' and 'Bringin on the heartbreak', we can feel her diligence ,and we'll know why can she become an incomparable diva in early years.I believe she'll be able to make even better music after she has settled down in the new recording company, & gained enough supports from her fans around the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"what?","review":"I struggled with what I should rate this album. On one hand, the ballads are amazing, as Mariah always delivers on them. But, on the other hand, we have horrible songs with the likes of Cam'Ron & Jay Z. I have nothing against fusion songs. But daamit if you're going to mix Hip-Hop with R&B at least do it right! \\"Boy\\" is horrible. But, the one with Jay-Z & Freeway might be even worse. \\"Irrestiable\\" with West Side Connection, is only saved by the sample. But, thankfully she has good slow songs here, and some good up tempo songs, where it's just her. This is a very emotion album, Mariah proved she still has it in her. And I know, while I hate the rap songs on here, a lot of people love them. Personally, I love hip-hop, but Mariah doesn't need it to get over. She's already the biggest female artist of all times. The tribute to her father is really beautiful. And her remake of Def Lepards \\"Bringing On The Heartbreak\\" is really smooth err... different."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU GO GIRL !","review":"Welcome back Mariah ! Wonderful Comeback ! This album reminds me of her in 1990 with \\"Vision of Love\\". You go girl! You did it from the heart. This album has meaning. Mariah, at her best once again!Excellent Work.Congratulations!Highly recomend buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I just wanted to say that I think Mariah Carey's album Charmbracelet, is one of the best albums she has put out in a long time. I enjoy listening to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely BEAUTIFUL!","review":"I've been a Mariah fan ever since I first heard her sing Vision of Love. The new cd Charmbracelet includes some of the best songs she's ever recorded. This cd is like a blend of her Daydream and Butterfly projects. Very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah at her best","review":"I don't think Mariah is appreciated enough for her song writing skills. She is truly one of the best artists of our time. I think her breakdown may have hurt her sales which is a shame because this is her best CD yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's classy again watch out","review":"Mariah always made music like this the deal with her last 3 cd's was that she started selling ... and having a bunch of rappers come in and spit some sorry verses here she goes back to basics."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT album!","review":"I have been a fan of Mariah Carey's since the first cd, and this is some of her best work to date. This cd was both encouraging and thought provoking for me, she shows her feelings but she doesn't wallow in negativity, but shows that you can get through it and come back stronger than ever. This cd chronicles everything she has been through in the past year(s) and she has never sounded better. Some of the tracks that stood out for me are:Through The Rain- Beautiful and expresses strength.Subtle Invitation- Jazzy and smooth and coolBringin on the Heartbreak- her slant on it is awesome and she really sounds like she is feeling this song. I play it over and over because the emotions expressed are so raw.I hope this review helps, I recommend this cd highly, it is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS SO GOOD","review":"hello,if you guys are afraid to buy this album i think you should mariah has did it again w/ this awsome cd it is hot hot hot hot hot. ignore anything that people have told you about this album i think it is mariahs greatest work ever its got a lot of RB in it and some balladsi like it a lot it is greatgood job mariah carey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Unique","review":"Charmbraclet is very unique in its own way. First of all, it may not be her best album, but every song is a song that you can like on some level. There is no song that you cannot at least like a little. Actually, I take that back a little bit, one song is kind of annoying and that is \\"You Got Me\\".The best track on this album is You Had Your Chance, a song never released as a single.Tracks like Through The Rain, Bringing on The Heartbreak and I Only Wanted show her vocal strength while songs like Lullaby and Subtle Invitation show that she can cool down and sing smooth whispery R&B.Buy this album, you won't regret it.Also check out Michael Jackson's Number Ones.Warning: Do Not Buy Janet Jackson's Damita Jo and Justin Timberlake's Justified"},{"rating":"1","title":"blah...","review":"This is OK. Nothing spectacular...I see no \\"come-back.\\" But I see a transformation...to blandness. This bores me. I can't stand the breathiness. Mariah has one of the most beautifully toned voices in the biz...I wish she would use it!!! I'll just keep waiting I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start to a new beginning...","review":"Mariah Carey's Charmbracelet is an album I never expected the diva to create 10 years ago. It is with this album that she sheds away her pop sound, but showcases a raw talent that very few have. The difference between this album and her previous work is that the instrumentation, vocal arrangement, and lyrics are raw and passionate. Her voice is much different in this album. She generally uses a softer tone. I definitely recommend this album. It is an album that is completely opposite to what is on the radio. If you enjoy an album with real music that has an rnb sound to it, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing","review":"charm bracelet had such a brilliant album concept and the tracks were so beautifully done, mostly ballads, some r&b/hip hop ballads(you have to hear them to get it) and several hip hop collaborations that could have been left off. I just love how mariah sings and raps at the same time in several songs on this CD. I think this CD is her most personal one to date and she seemed to be dealing with depression at the time, this album is very uplifting to say the least and can inspire many to keep on going. Along with this CD, I would also recommend janet's velvet rope"},{"rating":"2","title":"...Through The Rain...","review":"Oh my! What the BEST CD she ever made! I have love her hottest music everytime her cd's made each year except 1996 that haven't made because of her vacation break that time. I have loved her in every way and all the music. The very first CD i got of her is \\"Emotions\\" and I have bought her CD's each week tried to get the whole set of her CD's which I finally got ALL of her cd's. 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.

All her music is the same and this album tells a lot about her but she needs to stop making all her songs sound the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmbracelet is one of Mariah's best efforts EVER!!","review":"Mariah is in fine voice, you won't believe the heights her voice reaches on this CD, especially on tracks 1, 2, 3, 8 and 13. Absolutely amazing! Mariah carefully combines all sorts of music; from pop ballads to smooth rnb to gospel to hip hop. There's everything for everyone. I didn't like Glitter that much because Mariah let the rappers overtake the whole record but now there are only 2-3 collabs! Through The Rain is my favorite song on this album, followed by Mariah's cover of Bringin On The Heartbreak. My Saving Grace is also a standout! I love this CD!!!Everyone should have it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fairly average","review":"while there are some moments here&Her Voice sounds Good the Material overall is like a Carry Over from what She has been doing over the last few years.I'm still waiting for that Most Have Album from her.thus far She is more of a Really Good Singles Artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHARMED BY HER SPELL","review":"Now I'm really agree whit all her fans...Her voice is like mermaid voice...I love \\"Trought the Rain\\" \\"Boy\\" \\"Bringing out the hearthbreak\\" \\"Yours\\" \\"and my favourite personal \\" You Had your chance\\"...After try to skip all her previous cds, I had to buy it this one...And i'm glad cause is really a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmed","review":"Mariah Carey is the most talented singer. She is one of the most successful women in the music business. She is also one of the most hardworking artist. She Put alot of effort into this Album and you can hear it. In her first single \\" Through the rain\\" she sounds much like the rain. Just close your eyes and you'll be able to hear everything she's thinking when she's singing. But it does sound as if shes holding back her vocals a little bit. But no matter, it's still one of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard. Bringin' On The Heartache is really beautiful. She sounds just wonderful. Her vocals are strong. Her more up beat songs are mediocre compared to all the ballads on here. Shes Amazing. Just try this album out. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star comeback","review":"Mariah Carey's new album is amazing. She proves her amazing vocal ability in the fifteen track album Charmbracelet. Throughout the album she keeps up her diva title by hitting those high notes she is famous for and also mellowing it down with some hot tracks. Perhaps the best track on her album, I only wanted, shows a side that most have not seen yet. You can compare it to tracks like Crybaby and My All, but it shows a different maturity, a growth. Songs like Through the Rain and The one take the Mariah fans back to the days of her beginning albums. There are no horrible songs on her album. Some nice upbeat funky songs that show that she is no ordinary \\"pop star\\". Mariah has a gift that nobody else has. She is the number one female recording artist ever! This album definitely qualifies for a comeback!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a Charm!","review":"I was completely blown away by this album, it is wonderful! If you thought \\"Through the Rain\\" was alright (or even if you didn't) all of the other songs on the album supersede that one.

You go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i think this album is great","review":"i love charmbraclet it is one of my favorite mariah carey albums. once again mariah has put together a beautiful album my favorite songs are boy,my saving grace,through the rain and clown etc. i recommend anyone who loves mariah carey's music to buy the album you wont be sorry.chas"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Mariah's Best","review":"Mariah Carey has a beautiful voice, which is why she doesn't need all these rappers on her albums... \\"Through The Rain\\" is a beautiful song and sounds like a Mariah classic, then she releases \\"Boy (I Need You)\\" (w/ Cam'ron) as a single...

This was the album after her so-called breakdown and the music here is mostly filler, the songs are just messy and uninspiring. I used to love Mariah's albums but this one is her second worst after the horrific Rainbow. The only song with spunk and a sense of humor is the Eminem diss track, Clown. Bringin' on the Heartache is a so-so cover and Through the Rain is a complete snooze fest. I hate her r & b style songs, wish she would go back to her pop roots, this is one album to dispose of."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it's her worst","review":"I really love most of her other work, but these songs just seem to run together and sound the same.

As an editor, he should know better!Charmbracelet is mediocre, at best! I honestly expected a more stripped down version of Mariah. What she has done on Charmbracelet is similar to what she did on \\"Rainbow\\", but with MORE drama.Mariah's voice is so GREAT I don't think she even realizes it. Her voice and her lyrics with very little, if any, instrumental accompaniment is all Mariah really needs! Her vocal power cannot and should not be confined to the COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION displayed on \\"Charmbracelet\\".Definately NOT vintage Mariah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"D-I-S-A-P-P-O-I-N-T-I-N-G","review":"I have been a huge Mariah fan, but what happens ???After the flop of \\"Glitter\\", I thought she would innovate with her new album.

Lo's 'This is me...then'","review":"I saw Mariah's interviews on MTV and 20/20 or Dateline or something and heard tracks from her new disk. I've never really been into Mariah Carey before I bought this CD. While it does have it's sad, woe is me ballads, it balances them out with some upbeat ones that salvage the entire CD. I really like tracks 1, 2, and 7. Is seven about Eminem or something? Song 15 is the worst. It's not really even a re-mix, it's just a sped-up version of the original. but I'd reccommend you borrow it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not cut it","review":"A talent as Mariah - wasted on this CD and how sad is that.I used to love her music so much up to Butterfly. Even on Rainbow there are songs that I love such as Heartbreaker regular and rap version. Also - Cry Baby and many more. But this one was total disappointment. The one song I like truly is \\"Bringing on the heartbreak\\" and that is not even her song though she does a fantastic job. Mariah is such a wonderful talent and I hate to hear her wasting in music like this after her first albums. She surely changed in music style and I much preferred the pop/rock style. Perhaps this is because I do not get into R+B a lot - that is something that I cannot help! If you love R+B - this is the CD for you. If you love Mariah's old stuff - get ready for disappointments. :-(In any case, Mariah does not need a \\"come-back\\", she will always be a great musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im feelin her album..","review":"Not much to say,but I think her album is good.Here is how I view her songs:Through The Rain: 4 1/2 starsBoy: 4 1/2 starsThe One: 5 starsYours: 5 starsYou Got Me: 5 starsI Only Wanted: 3 starsClown: 5 starsMy Saving Grace: 5 starsYou Had Your Chance: 3 starsLullaby: 4 1/2 starsIrresistible: 3 starsSubtle Invitation: 3 starsBringin On the Heartbreak: 5 starsSunflowers for Alfred Roy: 4 1/2 starsThrough The Rain(remix): 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comeback for Mariah","review":"I don't know what words i can really say about the album but it is great.

I have not really been a big fan of hers in the past but she has turned me into a huge fan with this current CD. She really hits the mark with power ballads like \\"My saving Grace\\" and \\"I only wanted\\". She also did a great remake of one of my favorites \\"Bringin on the heartbreak\\" , Beautifully done. There are some great smooth R&B type tracks as well. All in all, Charmbracelet has something for everyone and is well worth every penny for so many great future hits!! Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting back to the roots","review":"I highly recommend the Charmbracelet CD.

She has some of her greatest songs ever on this CD such as \\"Yours\\", \\"My Saving Grace\\" and \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\". The CD does lack a song that has the possibility for a massive commercial success like her previous songs \\"Heartbreaker\\" on her Rainbow CD and \\"Honey\\" on Butterfly. It is not a classic CD that later generations will extol, but it is one of her best. It is much better than Glitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD so far","review":"Mariah has done it again. This CD features 15 catchy songs (i like everyone of them) that mix hip hop with r&b. Her vocal skills are more impressive and evident here than the other CD's that she had done before. I cannot stop playing it. When I first got the Cd, I listened to all the tracks and I was surprised because there's usually a few tracks that i do not like. But upon hearing Charmbracelet for the first time, it was wonderful. Mariah's skills have grown and they shine brillantly on Charmbracelet. This is how music should be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"mariah is simply amazing","review":"What a comeback! I have absolutely loved Mariah since Vision of Love, and unlike many people, I still loved her last year when many people turned on her. Nobody can even come close to singing as amazingly as Mariah!

Keep on singing Mariah!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah ... we have a problem ...","review":"I don't know about you, but when I first listened to \\"Through the Rain\\" I desperately wanted to give Mariah an oxygen mask. The poor thing just kept on making those horrible noises with her throat and she seemed to be exhaling with extreme difficulty.But then, after a couple of minutes, she must have coughed something out because she could yell once again.Seriously, I know people get old and voices mature with age, but finding the appropriate tune to fit current vocal capabilities is not that difficult. Take Whitney Houston and her latest work ...Bad move, old girl!

I am so sick of hearing her switch voices in the lead vocals of every song on this album.You should buy this album because:1) You're a fan trying to support her through a tough time2) You like listening to moaning and groaning noises"},{"rating":"1","title":"she cant be considered as a real singer","review":"i dont like this album because its boring and not very good. she shouldnt sing anymore cuz she sucks at it.why dont she act instead. wait, hole up, she cant act either. lolDONT FORGET THE FLOP THAT GLITTER WAS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful CD","review":"Mariah Carey's Charmbracelet is an excellent album. I bought the album because I am a LONG-term Mariah Carey fan. Don't let the negative reviews of this CD affect you-most people write them without even having bought the album, just to make others not buy it! Here are my ratings for the songs:Through The Rain- an excellent song, especially the end when she belts it out!The One-A great song, since Mariah's singing fast in it.Yours-Very beautifulYou Got Me-Should be released as a single, becuase I think it would be a huge hit at radio, especially since it's with Jay ZI Only Wanted-Sounds like 'My All'Bringing on the Heartbreak-Beautiful ballad; but the radio version is more powerful"},{"rating":"2","title":"mariah the best","review":"Mariah has had a troubled year in 2001, but she pulled through wonderfully and it shows in her new cd, Charmbracelet. What I love most about it is that it is diverse and very inspirational. Just like her emotions cd with the song \\"make it happen\\" she has the song \\"Through the rain\\" on Charmbraclet which inspires kids who admire her, such as myself, not to give up and beilve in yourself no matter what. Not alot of artists have that. You listen to music today and you hear ppl singing about sex, drugs, and love that failed. Not that mariah doesnt sing about love that failed or not that nobody's singing inspirational songs, look at destiny's child \\" indepent women\\", it's just there's less of it today. The cd is very postive. It is a big difference from Glitter. I liked Glitter, but this is much, much better. I'd recommened it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Album","review":"Mariah is back on top from with this, her latest studio album 'Charmbracelet'. The songs are well-written and inspiring, and the hip-hop tunes go from strength to strength. Mariah has also experimented further with rock and jazz on this album with 'Subtle Invitation' and the Def Leppard cover 'Bringin' On The Heartbreak'. The voice is smooth and warm, and the album flows well, almost telling a story. This is a wonderful album for any record collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW---What more can you say???","review":"This album is great. This really showcases the talent of Mariah Carey....Emotional ballads demo. her magnificent octives' and hip-hop/pop songs are great...this is one of the best albums I've ever listened to...Has a new, fresh sound that we need in the music business today. One word to describe this cd is compelling, amoung other things.. If you don't own this cd already, you need to stop wasting time and buy it, its great...Thanx"},{"rating":"2","title":"This new album is AWESOME!!!","review":"Man oh man...Mariah is back in true form with this album! What can I say? The cuts on Charmbracelet are honestly some of the best work she's done since Butterfly! I wasn't particularly pleased with Glitter...but when I heard Charmbracelet, I was Blown away at the quality of work Mariah has put into this album. Much of the songs reminded me of the Daydream/Butterfly album's...and this is a very good thing! So what are ya'll waiting for? Go buy Charmbracelet RIGHT NOW...you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good work","review":"it is a really good cd that you can just jam to in your car with your friends and the song \\"through the rain is a song that lifted me up and make me realize that i can be strong in anything that i do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"After that whole break down thing and the terrible movie, Glitter, I think Mariah has produced a CD worth listening to. The songs are pretty good and her voice makes the music worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Ok I will be honest and say I have only heard 2 songs on TV. Both songs made me cry and songs dont usually do that unless they really speak to my heart. I have been a fan of Mariah since I was 11 years old and listening to her always made me feel better because it seemed like she always had a song that related to how I was feeling. I was a bit well disappointed with her last few projects but I feel that just those 2 songs I listened to more than makes up for it. I mean everyone has thier ups and downs. Mariah has definately made a great comeback with her beautiful voice and is a musical inspiration to me also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep On Going Girl!!!!","review":"Wow! Since I listenned to Mariah for the very first time a long time ago, I got caught by the magic this woman can relay with her magical voice, since that moment I've been her fan. Her carrer has been like a dream with highs and lows. This album is really touching and emotional, her voice feels like new and fresh and she demostrates once again that she is the one and only Mariah Carey. Keep on going girl!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Making It Through The Rain","review":"Mariah Carey's \\"Charmbracelet\\" is a great cd! There is something for everyone from Pop, R&B, Hip-Hop, to even Gospel. Standout tracks include \\"Boy\\" an upbeat track featuring rapper Cam'ron, \\"Yours\\" a mid-tempo love song, and a somewhat angry Mariah on \\"Clown\\". This is Mariah's best cd since her \\"Butterfly\\" release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely better than rumor says it is","review":"Detractors made Charmbracelet sound like one of the most disappointing albums in history, but Mariah Carey (in my opinion) glows here despite her critics. Her voice is in top shape--so what if she gets breathy at times? Even breathy she delivers some of the best vocals by any female artist out there. Despite reviewers, I think \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\" is one of the best songs, though a cover, on the CD; the ending high part is magnificently executed. The record has its low moments, but at its lowest the songs are decent, just not memorable. Mariah Carey is one of the greatest singers in history, and definitely (in my opinion) one of the top female vocalists, and shows her brilliant singing abilities here. Surprisingly better than expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I really like this CD. i can't say every song is so awesome. But there are about 5 to 6 really classic and great songs, the rest are not too bad, not too good either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on track","review":"I really enjoyed this CD. As a long-time fan of Mariah Carey, I was truly disappointed in Glitter (the soundtrack). This CD shows she's headed back in the right direction which is great, her voice deserves better than her previous work. Some favorites are \\"The One\\" (wore this Jermaine Dupri jam out), \\"Clown\\" (which I've read is a dig at Eminen), \\"Lullaby,\\" \\"Irresistable,\\" and \\"Through The Rain\\" (the remix version with Joe and Kelly Price)."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"This is a weak comeback. MC does not break new ground and it is just an OK album. The problem with being OK is that OK is barely enough to get by, especially since MC is trying to come back from a fatigue, as she likes to call it, or as her critics say \\"nervous breakdown.\\" She should have waited longer to work on it to make it better. Circulating it around her critics and then going back to the drawing board would have done it and then releasing it to the public would have been one way to get it right. MC said on Larry King Live that she doesn't know whether she has really been in love. Well, doesn't that say something? If she has never been in love, how can she write a decent song? Getting older she must be a bit cynical. sure, she is romantic -- she has to be, in order to write songs like this, but given that she has never been in love what does she know? She is committed to her work but the lack of sincerity in her product shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"love this cd it has over great 15 songs with rap/r n b/ soul/ pophip-pop/ this cd rocks shes back in better this cd is worth the money plus she looks hot in this cd her 3 singels are included on this cd in it has the lyrics what more can u aks 4 just shut up in buy the cd now"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her Weakest Album to Date!","review":"It is a shame to see her throw away her trademark sound & gravity-defining vocals for tracks that sound like J-Lo cast-offs and that annoying wispher. I would like it if she stops trying to keep up with the \\"Ashanti/B2K\\" crowd. I gave this cd two stars because of the decent song \\"My Saving Grace\\" & \\"Throught the Rain\\". Although \\"Throught the Rain\\" is a weak attempt to recreate the magic and power she showed on her earlier single such as \\"Vision of Love\\" & \\"I Can't Live if Living Is Without You\\". She had power & control over her voice but her voice is shot & has very little depth. The people that like this cd most is people into Hip-Hop..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Great Album","review":"Mariah has showed Once again that anything is possible. This cd show cases Mariah's great ability to make another hit. The album includes an uplifting ballad like Through The Rain. Uptempo songs like Clown and sad songs like Sunflowers For Alfred Roy. In the past year Mariah has been in the news for negitive things but she is finally in the news about positvie things. I recommend this CD to everyone out there. She's not like those stars who think they have to dress sleezy, like Christnia Aguliera or Britney Spears to get attention. Her music is what gets the attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah can make it \\"Through The Rain\\"","review":"I am so glad to finally see Mariah back in the music world. Mariah Carey is one of the most talented R&B artists ever in the new R&B world. Although Mariah did try a successful comeback in 2001 with the album \\"Glitter\\", truth is \\"Glitter\\" was one of the most awful selling albums of 2001. Mariah's true comeback is the better selling \\"Charmbraclet\\". Mariah's first single \\"Through The Rain\\" proves to all those haters that Mariah's been \\"Through The Rain\\" and can surely make it back out."},{"rating":"2","title":"an inspirational work of art","review":"Mariah's Charmbracelet is one of her best albums yet! It is filled with emotion and inspiration as Mariah shares her inner soul with her fans through her unbelievable and irreplaceable talent. She is by the far the most inspirational and meaningful artist around. If you are looking to hear great talent and feel music, then buy Mariah's cd. Unlike other albums by artists like NSYNC and Britney Spears, you'll get music that is powerful and that allows a listener to relate."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gal","review":"This CD is worth the hype. I bought it the day it was released, and it has gotten me through more than just the rain. It has helped realize how unique a writing style she has.Since her first single hit stores I bought it. Since than every CD has impressed me even Glitter (if you want to know just read my review) but this CD is just one great song after another. She talks about what she has gone through and you sympathize with her. I'm not a hip-hop fan but she has me grooving to it all. Boy (I need You), Clown, The One, Irresistable, when I hear them all I wanna do is dance.Every so often Ms. Carey puts out a cover of a song that is unreal (I'll be There, Without You, Open Arms etc.) Bringin on a Heartbreak is so fresh and different from Def Leppard's version that you'd think she wrote it herself.I have one thing to say to Mariah and all you hardcore Mariah fans like myself 2 thumbs UP!!!!

You thought you'll get songs more of like \\"Through The Rain\\" but then when you get this album, all you'll get are faceless hip hop collaborations with different rappers about to lose their sanity! I'll give one star for my favorite \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\". It still shows that Carey can still carry a tune, get edgy and certainly shows a different side of her.

This was in the middle of her serious break-down and I understand what she was going through. She tells us fans how she is meant to feel, and she gets the point accross, but is it meant to be heartfelt, emotional and sympathetic? On my dead body. If you want a personal effort, turn to Madonna's Like A Prayer or Lindsay Lohan's A Little More Personal (RAW) (seriously, it's good!!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm......","review":"i think mariah had some good songs on this cd but nothing like the outstanding recovery album we were all expecting..her backups sing too much and her airy breathy voice gets very annoying.

Go BACK TO UR ROOTS mariah and just sing! not so much fluff around ur voice.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak album...sadly there's no \\"Wow\\" left :(","review":"I've been a huge fan of Mariah Carey since her Vision of Love release in 1989. Although she may never be able to recreate the pure vocal power of that album, she certainly can work on her material and singing techniques.The material on Charmbracelet is pretty poor and sounds more like material that would be on a newcomer's debut album. Sadly, she \\"breath-sings\\" her way through 95% of the album and fails to engage the full power of voice.Don't get me wrong - this review is OF THE ALBUM, not Mariah herself. I still think she is a fabulous entertainer, but how many more breathy \\"do do do do doot doot doos\\" can someone take? Come on Mariah...release a full vocal power album and \\"Wow\\" us once again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MARIAH?","review":"Guys, this is a horrible album. Exactly the same in sound and rhyme as her previous two. That is not the mark of a top pop diva.

This CD is by far at the bottom of the list. I just felt like she was lacking emotion and heart. Maybe this was made when she was going through tough times or something?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An anti-climax","review":"This LP, although overtly anticipated by me, just does not deliver. With the exclusions of \\"Through The Rain\\", \\"Boy (I Need You)\\" and \\"Bringing On The Heartache\\", this album lacks the POP PUNCH of Mariah's latest releases. The near to silent vocals on this album do not compare with Mariah's ability. An ability that she has shown with great force in the past.I adore Mariah, I could hug her now, but I must not allow such a flat album to go without the proper critique. In trying to gain street credit, Mariah has become Jennifer Lopez's prodigy. I'm terribly dissapointed with this project. Having loved \\"Glitter\\", and the single \\"Loverboy\\", I would suggest the latter, as opposed to this LP. The rap has to go, Mariah's vocal should be the focal point of all tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Great Album! Thanks Mariah!","review":"I was pretty excited to get this cd the other day (2 days after it's release) and as soon as i got in the car I poped that cd right in and did the usual cd scan first before listening to all the songs entirely. All the songs are pretty good but 4 stood out right away and i can't stop listening to them. I'm sure most of you who have the cd love obviously \\"through the rain\\", \\"The one\\", \\"I only wanted\\", and \\"Bringin on the heartbreak\\" They are extremely good songs. Bringin on the heartbreak was especially good and i was sceptical at first about how she would go about the song, but it was excellent and I love it. \\"I only wanted\\" is a great ballad and i currently can't stop playing that one. Overall the cd is great and I reccomend that if you were thinking about buying the album, What are you waiting for???? And if you were not thinking about buying the album, What are you thinkging??? GO BUY IT NOW! Thanks MARIAH! YOUR THE BEST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The point is to read the numbers","review":"The product as pictured shows an excellent contrast between the blue background and the black numbers.

I like the fighting scenes even though they're short. It might be because I'm not a hard cored gamer. However, the frustrating control makes this game boring after 2 missions. For example, while I was in a car form, I could not reverse! I had to transform into the robot to go backward. While fighting, a lot of times I moved the Wii remote as instructed by the manual but I got no response!After playing it for 45 minutes, I gave up.

Does this make Chick a poor piano player? I guess not. The story really is that Hiromi is different. May we like it or not, she is different. Jamal and Anthony Jackson both seem to agree that indeed, she is a phenomenon, and YES, SHE CAN PLAY THE PIANO!!! Whatever her style of music might be called, yes, she really IS astonishing.Another Mind is the work of a 23 year old prodigee who has so much to offer....I'm alerady looking forward to her 2nd CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"soulless","review":"Hiromi's playing sounds like jazz but doesn't feel like one. She thinks she plays jazz but she can't fool seasoned jazz listeners. Virtuoso technique is not enough, not even a prerequisite. To hear how robotic she sounds compare her with true masters like Michel Camilo or Chucho Valdes, let alone all the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repeat Play","review":"After hearing some about her (temple radio, jazzreview), I saw Hiromi live in Philly at the Museum of Art. The venue had so much reverb and background noise that the piano was lost to the echoes of the drums and overwhelming bass. But, her energy was palpable. Sometime, later, I picked up 'Another Mind' and was really blown away. Fantastic energy is maintained throughout a versatile set of track choices.I look forward to her second album coming out, I think she said May 2004(?). Be sure to check out her website hiromimusic.com for tour dates and new album info. and some sample tracks.I think the jazz controversy stuff is pretty lame. Hiromi is the most accessible 'jazz' I've listened to in a long time. I think she's definitely a potential future jazz giant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, Canaduh! What a land of plenty...!!","review":"Sure, maybe Neil Young and Joni Mitchell aren't on here, but the host of other artists more than make up for it. Pop-folkie Bruce Cockburn and fiddler Natalie McMaster are probably the biggest name artists on this set, but the real gems come from other, lesser well-known musicians, ranging from the late trad folk legend Stan Rogers to numerous Francophone folkies, kookie Inuit throat singers, Native American (aka: \\"First Nation\\") songsmiths, and citified bluegrassers such as the Billy Hill Band. Canada's own status as a North American melting pot is confirmed in this far-reaching, eye-opening set. Plenty of surprises and delights.

You have to depress the setting button on the side of the case with a paper clip or pen point, then keep the setting button depressed while rotating the dials to your new combination.

I love that it lets you know what disc's are empty and have a disc in them. It's super quiet. This was by far the best price I had found too. All the other places such as Target, and Best Buy sold it for another 30 bucks or more. This is a great buy for your money on a multi-disc DVD/CD player! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"I've been using an F87S since last spring for multi-disc DVD sets. It works great with everything that I've played, and it handles JPG CDs better than my more expensive single disc player. I just don't see any difference between its video output and other higher-priced players I've owned.The only thing missing is a TOSlink/Optical audio output, which is pretty standard these days. It has the Coaxial digital output, but that forced me to reconfigure my system as my receiver only had one Coaxial input that would work with a DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woa...","review":"This is one of the best deals on the DVD player market. First rate sound, video, and features with a bargain price. I own a Go Video D2730 networked DVD player also and I thoght it is a decent one. Bought this one just for some dialog enhancement. Never imagined this Panasonic one makes so much difference in sound and video quality. One of my best buys ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst","review":"I have bought this unit through Panasonic web site for $107 Dec. 1, 2004 for my son as Christmas gift. He didn't use it until Jan 2005. It's DOA (dead on arrival). I call Panasonic help line to get a replacement. ButI was told it has passed 30 days and I have to send to local dealer to repair. The local dealer charges Panosonic $120 to get part replaced. It works couple months. Now the disk tray won't open. Once it opens, it won't close. And the tray keeps spinning. I think I will get Sony DVD player from local store. At least it's easy to replace the unit if anyting goes wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive-BUT YOU DONT GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!","review":"This DVD/CD/VCD changer is THE MOST expensive one we have ever had. But it is by far my least favorite. Stopped working after 2 months of ownership. We played a DVD then puff, that was the last one. Laser skating protector is also weak. The disc still skates. The player also had trouble playing burnt DVD's. What a piece of ####. please dont waste money."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Major Show-stopper: Amnesia","review":"I bought this to replace a cranky old Sony which refused to play DVD+R and had a hard time with mass copied DVDs. The Panasonic does okay with home burned DVDs, but chokes on marginal quality commercial DVDs. The showstopper: A lot of the time, I watch part of a DVD, then turn the unit off and return to finish later. This unit will not automatically remember where you were in the disc - you have to press a cleverly hidden button on the remote - and it's a button which no universal remote I have can duplicate. So the drill is to put down the universal remote, find the Panasonic remote, find the magic key, press it, then use the universal remote to power off the DVD/TV/audio system. If you don't hit the magic button, the DVD will play from the beginning. Pain in the butt."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO DVD-A MULTICHANNEL, otherwise beautiful performance","review":"The machine is well above average in terms of being an excellent progressive scan player. However, I received a slap in the face when I realized that my dream DVD-Audio player of over a year infact does not support DVD-A multichannel. This is mentioned only once in the manual as a miniscule note. I had been racking my brain trying to figure out why I could easily play DVD-A stereo, but not multichannel. I connected the unit via the \\"5.1\\" analog outs, which I now assume to be short for Dolby 5.1 only. If you own one of these, take some solace in knowing that your DVD-A multichannel discs are probably not poorly authored."},{"rating":"1","title":"craptastic","review":"within a week of using this piece of shiznit, the dvd door opened and then jammed and wouldn't close.

The carousel wouldn't make a complete rotation, so CDs and DVDs would get 'trapped' inside the unit. And occasionally, it would simply refuse to play a DVD altogether. Panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop, so maybe they can get it to function as it should. If you do purchase one, please read the warranty carefully; a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one. Panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones, under any circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective design","review":"I am just another sufferer of the Panasonic H07 error.

It worked right most of the time, but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button. I would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to \\"reset\\" and work correctly. It's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working.Bought it because it was cheap and I guess I got what I paid for. Fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic MP3 playback","review":"I purchased the Panasonic DVD-F87 player in part because the literature said it played MP3 files. Unfortunately, the player inserted an audible blip between many of the MP3 songs, so I returned it and got the Panasonic S47 model. It had the same problem. MP3 discs that played fine on several computer drives, a Sony DVD player and a Phillips portable CD player would hiccup between songs on the Panasonic. Panasonic denied they had a problem, and tried to blame it on Roxio's MP3-burning software, but one of Panasonic's authorized repair facilities told me that Panasonic's MP3 reader is buggy and that Panasonic has not provided a fix (as of September 2004). So, if MP3 playback is important to you, steer away from Panasonic players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performance, impressive array of features","review":"I have owned this unit for nearly three years, and have no complaints. The price is very low for such a well equipped player (you can even adjust brightness, contrast, etc, just as you would on your TV), the motor is fairly quiet, the zoom is INFINITELY adjustable (just select MANUAL zoom rather than automatic and you can move back and forth in tiny increments), setup is easy (once you become accustomed to the fact that the primary menu buttons are called DISPLAY and GROUP), DVD-Rs are supported, and all the outputs are in place for DVD-Audio discs and optional subwoofer. You can also enhance dialogue and the video signal on low quality recordings.I don't know what more one could expect at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be ready to throw it away in 6 months to 1 year.","review":"I have got this player and I have started getting H07 errors too as mentioned by others in their reviews.

It is nice to put in 5 DVD's and let it play. We do not watch TV, since we do not like 50% of our time being spent with someone trying to sell us something. So we can load a full days worth of movies and play them at the rate we chose."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, multifeatured product","review":"Reviews trashing this item appear to be the work of a few diehards that got burned at some point. This is a good machine that has so many bells and whistles they can't be listed here. Poor manual given the \\"bells etc\\" but you can get there.I got mine for CD play primarily. DVD is a freebie in my mind. I used the $30 discount for signing up for a Amazon credit card. A no-brainer at $80. total!Panasonic is a good brand, other reviewers (Consumers Reports for one) give it good marks. And, yes, it does play DVD+R discs although not listed on the box.Made in Singapore vs. China so, hopefully, it won't be a 6 month throwaway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Buy!","review":"I purchased this 5 disk changer when my old one went out.

I really like the characters and the drama between the two friends having to fight one another. The story behind Kira Yamato makes it more realistic that he can just jump in a pilot the Gundam without any military training. It is just like every other Gundam series but this is one I would watch over and over again.The bad part is that Bandai is a terrible company in my eys (at least with the manufacture of dvds). I've read so many reviews of various other anime series that have defective discs. So far disc 5 will only work in my computer and only the first 3 episodes work. Disc 2 and 4 only read a few episodes in all my dvd players and my computer. I have had no luck trying to contact Bandai for replacments by e-mail or phone. I would have rated this a 5 because the series is one the best animes i've ever seen but because of Bandai and it terrible customer service and product quality I gave it a low raiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Gundam entries.","review":"Gundam seed is one of the more modernized Gundam entries. The 2 previous shows, Gundam wing and 08th MS Team were pretty good. Gundam Wing had okay animation, but the voice cast was bad on the english dub. 08th MS Team has ok voice acting, but the animation was kind rough. Gundam Seed has neither of these problems. It has really good animation and pretty good voice acting. The soundtrack is also really well done. The story is also more interesting. There are some major plot twists and some great conflicts between the characters. It definitely deserves the 2 seasons that it ran. With lots of great characters, a pretty in depth plot and high quality production it's definitely my favorite Gundam since the original. You should give it a chance. I hope you like it as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Discs","review":"Ok seeing the reviews here I can see why so many people are upset about this DVD box set.

I made it to episode 9 before I was told unable to read disc.How is it you can sell a faulty disc and not think about reviewing this issue. Needless to say I am unable to return the faulty sets due to the fact I finally recieved them the SAME WEEK the return policy went up.

The tempo on this whole CD is *really slow* - it is draggy and depressing. Instead of upbeat and inspiring renditions of my favorite gospel songs, I got a too slow, morse recording.

I am very sad - such great artists, so much talent, but the songs just aren't very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"Great set of songs, poorly sung. Very slow. I wonder if the artists who sung on this CD want you to hear what they recorded? It certainly is not them at their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal Sequels","review":"Universal was the premier leader of horror until the end of the 50s. They created seveal horror classics that have stood the test of time. One of these was the Wolf Man, which spawned these two sequels with several others as well. As for Werewolf in London, the transformation scenes are cool, but on She Wolf we don't get to see the werewold makeup/ transformation. I thought both were worth a look, but I didn't get my money's worth- don't think it was worth what I paid for it, but not really bad movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is an Odd Pairing","review":"Unlike others in reviewing this strange pair of films, I liked She-Wolf of London better than Werewolf Of London. Both are Ok, neither are great but the story of the she-wolf engrossed me. It is not a monster movie but a murder mystery but I enjoyed all performances and June Lockhart was very engaging as the troubled young woman. Werewolf of London is truly a monster movie. A man is attacked by a werewolf in Tibet and then brings it home to his family. Werewolves in this movie always try to kill the people he loves best so he is very rough on his wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why?","review":"Why isn't this movie as \\"popular\\" as THE WOLF MAN? How did it happen? I mean, yes... obviously the werewolf in WEREWOLF OF LONDON isn't as cool as the full-on Lon Chaney wolf man. I get that. And I get all the iconic stuff we get from THE WOLF MAN that isn't present here. Okay. But I dig the Tibet stuff. I dig the whole \\"a werewolf instinctively seeks to kill that which it loves most\\" thing. And let's be honest: Warner Oland rocks (I remember as a kid thinking how cool it was that Charlie Chan was in a werewolf movie). In many ways, this is a more \\"mature\\" movie than THE WOLF MAN. It's not quite as \\"melodramatic\\" and (if viewed in it's proper context) it's certainly a little more \\"brutal\\".SHE-WOLF OF LONDON is a rather dull curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to howl about","review":"Werewolf of London/She-Wolf of London is a classic black and white duo. I'm a big fan of werewolf films so, it was nice to see where it all started. Werewolf of London was the better film. She-wolf was quite simply: a. too short, and b: not a monster movie.While I liked the feature, (Werewolf of London ), the film doesn't have much re-watch value. I mean, how many times can you watch the transformation scenes? Also, the 'hero' was rather unlikable. This film would be different if he cooperated with the other scientist and searched for a cure, instead of being a so selfishly boneheaded.I recommend these films for old monster movie buffs. But for me, I just forced myself to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Awakening","review":"I like any books by Cathrine Cookson (Merchant) She is a fabulous story teller.

Ladies and Gentlemen\\" seemed as a major departure for TRF music-wise, at least the song sounded like a TRF song.For me \\"TRY OR CRY\\" doesn't.It's definitely more adult contemporary and it sounds more like something that I would hear from Nakamori Akina not TRF.Not to say it's a bad song but it's so different from any TRF song that I heard.It just strays to far from what makes their music so energetic and beautiful.Despite it being different, on it's own, it's alright but for a TRF song, it felt out of place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic handles too soft for heavy use","review":"I've had both the standard and metric sets for over a year now.

My daughter, when she was 18, brought the book home from school, and she can't get enough of it or the series of books under the Daughter's of the Moon series.I wouldn't personally recommend the book for the younger teen audience, as it deals with some more grown up situations than a 13 or 14 year old may really understand, and with the fantasy elements and the supernatural aspects of the book, a slightly older audience would probably be better able to read the books for what they are.In all, the book has a great story, interesting characters, and seeing things from a point of view that is not what one would normally find in books of this nature really makes the book compelling.I would recommend it for the young adult crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Daughters of the Moon Book","review":"This book is yet another great one!

He knows that to be safe he can no longer see her and when a couple of old \\"friends\\" return to Stanton he realizes that their is a plot against the Daughters of the Moon that he must stop to save Serena. But will it work? What's more powerful? Stanton's love for Serena or his evil nature?I found this book to be an impressive edition to the series. Stanton has always been a mysterious charecter that I've been interested in and it's good to see his story for once. This was a very good book though not as good as the last one, and it has a shocker ending that will really surprise you! If you're a fan of this series I reccomend reading this book. It's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughters Of the Moon #5: The Sacrifice","review":"This is the second best book so far in the series. I think all of us ladies wish Stanton or someone like him were real, and willing to do anything for your safety and well-being. Oh well, a girl can dream can't she?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as it could be.","review":"I purchased the Sony ZSY3 cd boombox and was not at all impressed. The bass sounds \\"tinny\\" and over vibrates and sounds so unreal. Don't waste your money on this one. Overpriced and skimpy on features. You don't even get a cassette player on this one. It has a sleep timer function but no alarm function. No mp3 compatibility. The backlit lcd is so small. With each new model they bring out the lcd gets smaller and smaller. You are better off with last year's model CFD E95LIV. Now that one is a nice one for the price. Sony has discontinued that model but some merchants might still have stock on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For insight and clarity of focus: FIVE STARS!","review":"America has finally admitted its racism and in some corporate circles, a concerted attempt is being made to address it and reduce it as much as possible. Often racism is the result of ignorance and insensitivity. Integration is a Bitch is right on target in addressing racism with insight and humor! Every CEO or office manager with a culturally diverse staff should read this provocative book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very low budget","review":"I thought I would enjoy this film, because I have always like Brooke Adams. This movie was low budget and that really didn't hurt it until the end. They really should have shelled out a few bucks and at least provided some good effects during the last 20 minutes. What they has was just cheesy.The premise: a fertility clinic doctor is impregnating women with genetically altered semen in an attempt to create \\"super\\" humans. Bad part? The fetuses are prone to violence, starting with mom.I really can't recommend this at all. Very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me? This was LAME!!!","review":"I WANT MY 96 MINUTES BACK!!!! REALLY LAME HORROR FLICK!!I don't know what it is about the quality of horror in the early 90s...but this is a good example of how it can go terribly wrong. If this film had been made in 1981 or 1971..or heck, even 1961 it could have had a good kitch factor...instead it's an overly stylized attempt at what a good 80's Slasher actually is.The one star rating is for the casting of Lisa Kudrow (I think she's super cute as a brunette!)...and Comedian Kathy Griffin as a Lesbian Co-Mother-To-Be!!The remainder of the movie gets a BIG ZERO!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FULL OF ERRORS","review":"Unfortunately, this book is full of errors. I looked up the Biblical references, and 10% of them were wrong, in the sense that a scripture reference was given while quoting a passage from somewhere else in the Bible. I noted several instances of this. From an \\"author\\" who makes a business out of public domain books, a little more care should have been taken.Lumpkin inside the book does say that he has taken the translation of others and put them together for this book, but unfortunately the book's cover says, \\"A contemporary translation by Joseph Lumpkin.\\" This, in my view, leads one to believe that these translations were carried out by Lumpkin himself. Clearly that cannot be the case, for Lumpkin has noted otherwise inside the book, and Lumpkin is not an academic and has no knowledge of ancient Greek or Coptic. Instead, turn to Elaine Pagels or Bart Ehrman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Keyport Revisited","review":"Before my sister moved to this small town in Monmouth County, New Jersey, I had never heard of it while growing up in New York City. However, after discovering this book in a local bookstore, I discovered that this town was of some importance to many living in the metropolitan area due to its' seaside retreats, close proximity to Sandy Hook Beach, and the town's many Victorian homes. While Keyport won't stand out among other more popular suburban towns such as Asbury Park, its' charm remains intact. Reading this book gave me a little more background on the town's history and development, and it was interesting to see that many of the sites in the book still remain today.If you are a native of Monmouth County, or have a friend or relative who lives in the area, then this book will be a great inclusion into your library. The town's historical society as well as the author have done an excellent job covering the history of the town that time and modernism somewhat forgot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to, and description of hypnotic induction","review":"This is a transcript of a seminar, hence I won't give it a 10 definitely shows a lack of editorial work. That being said, this is an excellent book about hypnosis -- not really NLP. The induction techniques exposed as well as the beginning of a theory that sustain them, seem to be a great advancement over anything else that has been written on the topic of hypnotic induction. However, the credibility of the whole thing is set down by the frivolous assertions about the cure of myopia through hypnosis, for example"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about hypnosis for beginning NLP People!","review":"Own this book, forget this review.I enjoyed the distillation and concepts concerning hypnosis. Bandler and Grinder once again create something out of their experiences that will truly create deep thinking about hypnosis.It's a very good book concerning hypnosis and the patterns of linguistics. Life is grand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Voodoo Witch Doctor Kindergarten Hypnosis!","review":"I have been a professional psychologist and hypnotherapist for over thirty years. In my professional opinion, NLP as created by Grinder and Bandler, (which they learned from an M.D. psychiatrist named Milton Erickson) is the most misleading dis-empowering form of hypnotherapy ever created. You will not learn how to do hypnosis or hypnotherapy from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trance-Formations","review":"Highly recommended. A top-notch how-to book that makes learning hypnosis and hypnotherapy simple and enjoyable. If you are considering learning hypnotherapy, this book is a great place to start.

The book had an overall negative message."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are remotely considering breastfeeding, this is not the book for you.","review":"The first review sums up my reaction to the substance of the book: 10% substance, 90% fluff, difficult to tolerate jokey writing style. As a mother of two, I found myself wincing and groaning at every snide, snippy, depressing mention of breastfeeding. Gottman has a lot more useful, concrete information about saving your marriage, and \\"Confessions of a Naughty Mama\\" has a lot better approach to dealing with the loss of closeness in your relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong.","review":"Sadly, this is not a catalogue of methods of contraception or abortion clinics.It thereby misses out on vital first steps in the babyproofing of a marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"If everyone read this book, nobody would have children.","review":"This book is heavy on the \\"horror stories\\" but offers few solutions. The authors seem to delight in telling you how horrible your marriage will become. You have to slog through pages and pages of negative, bitter, depressing anecdotes from parents to get to the one paragraph at the end that says, \\"be appreciative, be affectionate, communicate, have sex.\\" See, I just saved you the time of reading the book.It would've been better if they had included more positive, helpful advice and solutions to marriage problems. Instead, they make all women seem like controlling, nagging harpies, and paint men as insensitive deadbeats who would rather do anything than take care of their children. You're left wondering if you should even have children, if this is the nightmare your life is going to be! I wasn't expecting (or wanting) them to sugarcoat it, but would a little encouragement and optimism wouldn't have hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trick is Going to be Getting Your Spouse To Read It!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A guide for new parents in how to better understand each other at this most stressful time in their marriage, \\"Babyproofing\\" is funny, witty, honest, and helpful. I found the authors' insights on the deep dark secrets of parents today to be absolutely true. A woman's and a man's perspectives ARE completely different. They both have completely different expectations. These differing points of view are a HUGE problem for our society and hence our marriages today. I applaud the authors (and their husbands) for being so honest and blatant in that assessment and offering some backround for those differing sentiments and some solutions. Some of the solutions, however, while hilarious, are a bit out of MY league, at least the five minute aspect of it. Check out page 142!

(i.e. he works, she stays at home). nearly all of the challenges that are highlighted in the book deal with issues like \\"he's working too late and is tired when he gets home\\" and \\"she's cleaning all day and needs a break when hubby gets home\\". it was not useful for us at all. we both work and try very hard to distribute professional and domestic duties equally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted to read!","review":"My husband and I are going to start trying to have a baby in the next month. You can ask your friends who are parents how baby is going to change your marriage, but you will rarely get an honest answer! Everyone just wants you to join the parenthood club. This book gave a great peek into the lives of parents and how things are going to change - exactly what I wanted to know! The authors are hilarious, and they offer good advice for handling married life with baby. The book emphasizes the mother's point of view (only natural since they are all women), but the authors do a good job capturing the father's side as well. I definitely recommend this book to anyone thinking about or going to have a baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"other side","review":"not fully done yet but doesn't talk about a man that does a lot around the house and with the kids, kinda a little bias. But that is the relationships they have to write about"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the early years","review":"This is a funny and easy to listen to book. It talks mostly about those early years and especially the first year. My kids are older though. The observations and advice seemed balanced and was pretty interesting. I definitley took away some possible solutions. Warning there is some adult language. I usually listen to Christian authors on the subject so I was surprised to hear all the curse words. There is still good info though."},{"rating":"2","title":"I get it! I get it! I get it!","review":"I'd read this to my wife and we'd laugh and think and talk. We have 4 year old twins and this book has helped me understand what happened to the last four years of our lives! No wonder we are so stressed and aggravated with each other, gads, our kids will be 5 soon and this book not only helped me understand myself so much what I've been doing wrong but what she has been going through and expecting from me. C'mon, women it would be so much easier if you just came out and told us but as this book tells us, women won't tell you they expect you to just get it. Okay, so I get it, I get it. Now about that 5-minute miracle."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite and terrible","review":"This is one of those cutesy, fluffy books that sets out to tell it like it is. Except, these three authors are telling it like it is in THEIR lives, as if it will translate to your life.Thank goodness, their experience is probably much less common than they think. These days, most women don't live and die for domestic chores, some of us don't nag, and some of our husbands actually do more than just grudgingly take out the trash (after reminded six times).The book is cheap and formulaic and really annoying. Save your money and just communicate with your husband (or wife) before during, and after the quarrels you will have (whether or not you read this time-waster). Learn from your OWN mistakes, not from reading these women blathering on about theirs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not relate... could not finish the book.","review":"I read this book when my son was 19 months old so maybe i wasn't feeling the adjustment i felt when he was just born. I know that a new baby can put a strain on a marriage especially due to lack of sleep ... but i couldn't relate to this book. My husband helped.. and continues to help.. so i just couldn't relate enough.

Maybe to people who can relate to this book it would be great! but not for me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great advice!","review":"This is an easy read, with some great advice for how to soften the impact of the \\"baby grenade\\" on the marriage. I'm not sure how well it will work, as we're still expecting, but even if I only use one or two suggestions to make our lives easier, it will be worth it. The one caveat about the book: it's written by three women, with a somewhat feminine perspective. They are trying to balance the views out, but I wished there was an equivalent book written by guys that my husband would be able to read ... and still get the same message out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Communication is key !","review":"Makes alot of sense and does not pinpoint at eithier sex.

During the first few pages I got to thinking it was really kind of whiney, just kind of a laundry list of problems, but I thought maybe as I went on they would slowly start recommending some solutions or encouraging advice. I understand parenthood is tough and a lot of the problems that were brought up seem very realistic and in fact likely to occur. However several chapters in I still felt like there was a lot of complaining and more specifically husband bashing. The women in this book make their husbands sound like idiots and all together useless, which I found disheartening and kind of rude. I would not recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD to listen to!","review":"After having 2 children in 3 years, any relationship can get a bit stressed. I really enjoyed the point of view this book was written from. They included many, many experiences I could relate to. At times, I also though that 'Gee, things aren't so bad!'.

I couldn't believe how much negativity was crammed between the covers! As a pregnant woman, I'm not asking for anything to be sugar coated for me. All I'm asking for is a little optimism! I certainly didn't find it in this book. I truly believe that if a person were to read this book before getting pregnant, they would have serious second thoughts about parenthood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I bought this book for my husband and I to read together before our son is born. We have put the book down because there is nothing positive about it. It is just telling the woes of 3 women and their \\"terrible\\" husbands.

I was really looking forward to reading it with my husband, but it is a one sided book written by three women complaining about their stereotypic husbands.

We are expecting our first child right now and I decided to put it away on the bookshelf and not read it because I was getting irritated too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book makes me not want to have kids...at all","review":"I honestly have started to reconsider having children. Based on what it sounds like in this book, it will be hell! I think I'll find something new to read- perhaps something more encouraging. I was looking for a little more balance in this book. It was a recommended read before having children, but steer clear if you don't have little ones yet! This book does not talk much about the upsides and definitely did not meet my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Couldn't Finish It","review":"I feel very offended for all men who are stereotyped in this book. This really is a man-bashing book. It claims to have the male and female sides of the issue, but often the man's point of view is belittled. My husband and I are thinking of having children soon, and I wanted a book that would help us maintain our close and loving relationship while raising a child. This book is NOT it. While there are some helpful tips (don't keep score, communicate) I feel like much of it is common sense, and didn't add what what I already knew. I would never have my husband read this book, for fear that he might think I feel as the authors do towards their husbands. Waste of money. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"why isn't this required reading?","review":"I wish this was required during childbirth preperation classes. This book is full of great recommendations, humor and validating stories. It's well written for both mom and dad to read and relate.

The book started comical and seemed to be a voice I could relate to.But then it just got tedious.And the women (2 who are stay at home moms) just seemed to have a lot of mixed messages and expecting the bare minimum from their PARTNERS.Don't get me started on their views on sex. It was pretty much a \\"grin and bear it\\" solution...what a win-win for the men. And that \\"5-minute solution\\" was frankly insulting.The fact this was written by women I would have expected something a little more sensitive and realistic.Overall this book was a huge disappointment that I am actually being vocal in recommending friends and fellow WORKING mothers DO NOT READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book!","review":"it's amazing to me that through all the pre-baby prep--the birthing classes, the baby showers, the brushing up on FMLA, the car-seat installation, no one mentions that it might make sense to figure out who is getting up at night with the new arrival (that is, deciding who is getting up BEFORE one of you is going crazy due to sleep-deprivation). babyproofing was--to me--like having an older sister give me a bit of perspective, & some good solutions..full of common-sense which, given above sleep-deprivation, i certainly lacked. good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Gift given to Bed Rest Pregnant Mom-to-Be","review":"The service was excellent.

The plot is about Ford who is investigating a murder when a series of events puts him under suspician of committing the crime himself. Worth watching once, only because of Harrison Ford.

With regard to the book, an Emory University committee found \\"serious failures of and carelessness in [Bellesiles's] gathering and presentation of archival records and the use of quantitative analysis,\\" \\"questions about his veracity with respect to his account of having consulted probate records in San Francisco County,\\" evidence of \\"falsification\\" concerning the construction of a vital table in his book, and breaches of the \\"standard of professional historical scholarship\\" in three areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically a howler","review":"Despite claiming extensive research, the content of this book bears little resemblance to the history of the era. He quotes out of context and ignores any evidence that doesn't support his notion that guns were not a part of everyday life in the eighteenth century. For example, Bellesiles sites the rarity of privately owned arms in Massachusetts ignoring the documented fact that, after the revolutionary war started, Massachusetts bought hundreds of arms from private citizens to arm the militia. This book is an example of revising history to suit one's one notions. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Attempt to Recreate History","review":"This book is an absolute piece of drivel. There is little redeeming value to it as a record of American history. It's only virtue lies in that one might understand how revisionist history has become such a part of our society. Bellesiles frequently cites sources that don't exist or don't corroborate what he says, or simply weaves tall tales much akin to Paul Bunyan (again, without the redeeming value.) If one chooses to read this fictional account of American history, it should be done so purely to see how one's point of view skews the facts.

The AP reports that the committee declared \\"Arming America\\" \\"does not meet the standards established\\" for the prize. On top of the ignominy (richly deserved), the committee wants Bellesiles to give them their $4,000 back.This should be the final proof -- if any more were necessary -- that this book isn't worth the effort required to carry it around, let alone read it.

How anyone, even the most ardent ant-gun activist, could consider this work to be anything other than a purely political piece of propaganda is amazing. How the publishers could have presented this book as non-fiction and how the media could have extolled its virtues really gives one pause. Such a blatant attempt to incorrectly rewrite American history in order to further the author's own political agenda with the full support of most of the major print journalists is a major abuse of the first amendment.Lastly, the author doesn't even tell a good story, even if it is fictional and he's used his non-artistic license to its fullest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate Episode in American Historical Interpretation","review":"Mr. Bellesiles work has been alternately praised and disdained by his fellow historians and the public at large.

For an enjoyable opposing view, I suggest one read Undaunted Courage by Ambrose who describes the use of firearms during the Lewis and Clark expedition. Or consider the writings of Jefferson, Hamilton, and other historical figures as another source.My overall impression is that the author's methods need to be questioned. There is too much conflicting information that we know to be accurate to declare this book a credible work. Who should we believe - Bellesiles or Thomas Jefferson and Meriwhether Lewis?

I researched the Mayflower ship records and I came up with an entirely different view of our American forefathers. They depended on the gun for food, defense, and entertainment. Paintings of the day show Americans with the weapons of the day in prominant views whether they are outdoors or indoors. The militias of the Revolutionary War were instumental in keeping the British Armies out of the South and it was the guns in the hands of the civilian population that sparked the Whisky Rebellion.

While he was correct that \\"sport hunting\\" didn't catch on until after 1840, most frontiersmen and families did utilize hunting as a means of supplying food for their table. His quotes of George Washington's complaint about SOME of the militia being poorly armed and trained when his letter complained of \\"the odd behavior of the few militia\\" from certain counties ignores the fact that Washington indeed found this odd!

The violence is graphic perhaps by necessity, given the subject matter, but it seems that the subject matter was chosen to showcase the violence for a target audience.

It's about a guy,David played by John Cusack who adopts a little boy named Dennis who truly believes he is from outerspace. This movie has some really funny parts. It's a truly heartwarming film. At first your not sure the adoption is going to work out and everything, but it does. Dennis has some really odd quirks, he is unlike any other child you have ever seen. When David first sees him he is sitting in a box and wont come out as he doesnt want to be exposed to the sun. This movie is a great film for families or adults alike. I think people of all ages would enjoy it. It's a film I will watch again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie with rare presentation of male role","review":"This movie has very unique in that the lead char is not some cartoon character as is common in most movies where the guy becomes a father figure such as those by the Rock or Whole Nine Yards. The kids pain is quite real but not in your face while the movie builds to a well reasoned and emotinally satisifying conclusion with breakthroughs for all the lad characaters. Great movie to watch when your tired of movies that center on people dying, heros that somehow avoid being hit by hours of machine buy spray, or trite \\"feel good movies\\" ending with the the guy on microphone at some public event professing his love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martian Schmartian","review":"I'm a John Cusack fan but don't normally like PG movies. Yet this movie grabs onto you from the beginning - thanks to Cusack's performance, and no thanks to Amanda Peet's - with a fine screen play and some great directing that follows a story of an adoption of a little boy who really thinks he's from Mars. The story ends dramatically and lets you wonder if the boy is indeed from outer space or not. I'd have rated this movie PG-13... I think some scenes could be disturbing to smaller children."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT story","review":"Be sure to watch the extras. I did not realize this was a TRUE story until then.Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"As human as it can be","review":"As good as it can get. This is a great movie, its a shame that it did not do well @ the box office. But this is a big company mistake, for just betting to high FX, Action movies.This is definately a movie that has much to learn from. It's fun, entertaining very touchy at times, but very well achieved storyline. Moreover, is not a tiresome movie, and it really gets your attention at all times.All actors acchieve their role perfectly and do some of the best performances ever seing.A must on you DVD shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"For every person who's not \\"Normal\\"","review":"I absolutely LOVE this movie. It's quirky, funny, dramatic, and emotional. Plus I enjoy the soundtrack and John Cusack. I could watch this over and over and every time I kick myself for never adopting a \\"martian child\\" of my own. The movie pulls me in and the characters are well-developed, making me root for them all. This isn't just a chick flick either -- my husband and I both love this story. (Maybe it's because the story explores the relationship between a man and a boy.) Unless you're 100% perfect and have no sense of humor or a heart, I think you'll love this movie too."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to see this","review":"This is the best film John Cusack has done in years, though I didn't find Joan so convincing. I also enjoyed the performances of Sophie Okonedo and Amanda Peet, who are both too cute for their own good. Bobby Coleman is an awesome child actor. What's even more cool to watch after the film is the real martian child, and his father the author. I was lucky to find the last copy of this at Blockbuster, it's a very touchy-feely type movie, about a sci-fi author adopting a troubled kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could watch this movie again and again!","review":"I read the book and loved it. Usually when I read the book first, the movie never lives up to the book, but this movie was different. The story was wonderful and very interesting and the acting was amazing. John Cusack just made a seemingly effortless performance and I enjoyed just watching him act. He is one of my new favorite actors! I will watch this movie again."},{"rating":"2","title":"KIDS","review":"JOHN CUSACK IS GETTING BETTER WITH AGEHE IS A TALENTED AND NATURAL ACTOR AND THE SUBJECT OF THE MOVIE IS INTERESTING"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally sappy, boring, predictable","review":"I watched this because I am a fan of John Cusak. In this film he does the best he can with a totally sappy predictable humdrum script. I was bored out of my mind. The film drags. The dialogue is totally predictable. The premise is silly and misleading. I have worked with special needs children and this movie gives the false impression that a little love conquers all. As such, the movie is misleading and does a disserive to needy children who need stable homes, loving parents, and a lot more than is not even hinted at in this film. I wasted 90 minutes watching this film. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickly sweet","review":"Sticky sweet story about a widower who adopts a kid that no one wants (and who thinks he's from Mars). If this wasn't John Cusack, I wouldn't have made it through the first 15 minutes without throwing up. By-the-book storytelling, cliches abounding, and sappy, happy ending. Cuscack is so watchable though that he can make even this dreck seem okay. This was the perfect airplane movie - it passed the time, but I'm glad I didn't watch it at home when I could be doing something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"Definately not what I was expecting. The child is not really from Mars. I couldn't even watch the whole movie, I really don't like it. It was a waste of money renting it. Oh, and I would like to meet the idiots that wrote the summary on the back of the box and in the info that it shows on Dish Network Pay-Per-View."},{"rating":"2","title":"If he is a Martian, so am I!","review":"A well written novel becomes a very good movie in which we get to know a very disturbed child.The adoptive parent is himself a very strange fellow.This is a good chick flick and very heart warmingand tear jerking. I think kids will like this movie as well, so it is a good family movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of this world","review":"My wife & I loved this little movie for it's important view of children and the value each one has. We are Sunday School teachers and this just totally charged us up on pouring our lives into these little people. Martian Child was a good reminder to never take children for granted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens Among Us","review":"I first watched this movie on tv and was inspired to own it. Great film. An unusual reminder that children are aliens too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Or, how not to fight a war.","review":"(The numerical rating above is a default settingwithin Amazon's format. This reviewer does notemploy numerical ratings.)General Warlimont was Jodl's Deputy Chief of Operationsand at the heart of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht(Supreme Command), from 1939 until he was injuredby Stauffenburg's bomb in 1944. He actually drafted most of the operationalplans emanating from OKW and therefore is uniquelyqualified to comment on the military dimension ofthat vast criminal enterprise that was the ThirdReich.With his cool professional's eye he assesses theleading figures of the OKW: the demonic Fuhrer, asfascinating and dangerous as a snake, the loyal,amoral Jodl, the execrable toady Keitel.Of particular interest to students of militaryhistory is Warlimont's exposition of Hitler's\\"generalship\\", which repeatedly revealed itsamateurish inadequacies in rash decision-makingand arrogant disregard of expert opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited Historical Interest","review":"The book is one of a large number written by German Officers after the war. All of these books were of some interest but had one fatal flaw. That was that the germans had little knowledge of what was happening in Russia and the dynamics of its defence. Most books from this time tend to have a common theme. Masses of Russians coming from every where and it was all Hitlers fault.The book has large slabs of Hitlers dialogue in it. This was fairly interesting. The inclusion of the dialogue was included to show his irrationality. The reality is somewhat different with Hitler appearing from time to time a bit obsessed but in general terms having an idea of what was happening and a quick mind for detail.The book fails at times trys to limit the armies responsability for a number of war crimes including he order to execute without trial Russian party officials. This part of the book lacks any conviction.The book is of some historic interest but scholarship has passed it by."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved the premise but the payoff failed","review":"I really wanted to like this video. However I fell asleep twice. I did go back and re-watch those areas but found very little.

Rent maybe, if you have insomnia, but... ."},{"rating":"1","title":"????","review":"WTF ? That's what you'll be asking yourself watching this movie, as in Why The F*** don't I turn this movie off. No story development, 3/4 of the time you have no idea of what or why things are happening, the other 1/4 you don't care. Stare at a blank TV screen for 90 minutes or so, it'll be better than watching this dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Across the line","review":"don't waste your money. the acting, the story, the whole movie sucked the movie doesn't deserve the time to type the review"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cast, but film miss the mark.","review":"This film had a lot of potential; the plot was jump started and became a moving target never making its point. The good cast held this film together and nice scenes in Mexico were good---but the film never seem completed to me. The script must of been chopped up from the original or something, in the end this film makes for a remake in the future with a top action director to get it going instead of wasting time with facial cream (a nice touch but overkill in film) and other useless scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jones the Human","review":"My prior knowledge of patriot John Paul Jones, and as the author makes clear, he was certainly that, had been limited to the kind of \\"pure hero\\" impression one might pick up in a junior high or high school history course (in my case that was about 40 years ago). Thomas, on the other hand, writes not only about Jones' patriotism and heroism, but about the warts, too, and paints a compelling picture of a tragic human being who clearly made a significant contribution in America's fight for independence. Beyond that, the book offers useful insights on the American Revolution generally and other important Revolutionary figures. I have not read other Jones biographies, so I cannot offer comparisons. That having been said, I recommend this book highly. It's well-researched and documented, yet a very quick read. It was hard to put down. Thomas' descriptions of sea battles made me feel like I was there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough of positive reviews","review":"Evan Thomas is so repetitive about John Paul Jones' character flaws that the book takes on a negative and depressing tone, particularly in the second part of the book. I do not mean to suggest that a biography need only be flattering. But if the author writes once that the subject matter is cantakerous and difficult - I understand. When the author repeats that 20 times - I get disgusted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Battle Wonder","review":"Mr. Thomas provided great in sight into his subject, John Paul Jones. However, instead of taking over 300 pages he should have submitted it to a weekly journal. Like Washington's revolutionary battlefield experience Mr. Jones, the myth, is greater than reality. It's sad to think the American Navy has given him such a predominant place in its archives. If you are struggling in trying to find a good biography I recommend McCullough's Adams or Truman or Brand's \\"The First American\\" on Franklin. Come on Evan pick a better subject for your next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page-turner","review":"This is a great biography of a tragic figure. Jones is depicted as a brilliant and brave seaman but also a victim of his own hubris and ambition. Thomas' account of Jones' life is what good biography ought to be -- honest, sober and balanced. It's neither adoring haigiography nor a hatchet job. This vivid biography also makes it clear how inept many of the American military commanders were during the revolution. If it weren't for the French, we'd all be eating steak and kidney pie right now and watching the BBC on the telly. This is an excellent piece of work. Buy it, read it and learn from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disconnected from the Revolution","review":"If based on Thomas' account, it's a wonder that the US Naval Academy found Jones worthy to take up space underneath the chapel. Thomas went to great pain to portray Jones as a tragic figure and not the brilliant patriot that he was. Descriptions of romantic interludes (again failed tragic relationships) took up more pages than did his epic battles. Book was a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"More historical revision","review":"Someone once said: \\" To destroy a nation, you first must destroy its heroes.\\"This revisonist version of the life of John Paul Jones appears to be written with that in mind. It's not the first time we've seen a revisionist historian attempt to destroy American heroes...it's occurred with Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Alexdander Hamilton and many others. Funny, however, they've not yet attempted to smear George Washington. I wonder when that will appear.Don't waste your time with this book and its effort to diminish the Father of the American Navy. There are plenty of good biograhphies of Jones (born John Paul) that recognize his shortcomings without attempting to tear him down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rousing, engaging, accurate portrayal","review":"Expertly narrated by Dan Cashman, John Paul Jones: Sailor, Hero, Father Of The American Navy by Evan Thomas is the complete and unabridged audiobook biography of America's hero from the Age of Sail. Intelligent, cunning, bold, and ruthless; he vowed to sail \\"in harm's way\\", to use his own words. Driven by dreams of personal glory rather than purely high-minded ideals, his contribution to America's foundations would continue to have repercussions up to the present day. A rousing, engaging, accurate portrayal that is as much a tale of high adventure as it is a critical examination of the all-too-human weaknesses and extraordinary strengths of a charismatic and courageous man. 12 CDs, 14 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Paul Jones: Sailor","review":"Good overall with enough detail but not so much detail as to become laborious to read.

Then, belatedly, retracing his comments in a half-hearted retraction. Thruout the book, one must read between the lines to discern the true man, rather than the pained juvenile described by the author. If Evan Thomas needs to write books, I hope he next chooses a fiction base, as his ability to communicate a true portrait of a lasting American Patriot is nonexistent. One wonders why he choose to attempt to lower a true Naval Hero in our eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Father of the US Navy...","review":"While an important Captain in the American Revolution, this guy left to Sail for the Russians...

I didn't even bother to listen to all of it, just what everyone said were the best songs. Frankly, all the songs sounded a lot alike to me, anyway, so I doubt I missed much.These guys apparently have no original ideas of their own, as they seem to copy from a plethora of other bands out there, most of whom were already named in other people's reviews. The guitar work is very power metal, the vocals are nothing special.The lyrics on the second half of the album are just plain awful. The lyrics on the first half of the album are all right, which is maybe the only redeeming quality in this band. Overall, a very sub-par band. I recommend downloading before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"cousins of bodom","review":"Yeah.. it sounds like bodom, but they are not copying them at all.

So now, I don't know if I'm getting four copies of the magazine, or if I paid more than full price for the mag.The customer service rep said if I get four copies, I can bundle them up and send them back to Amazon for a refund... but this is a gift.

My mom wonders how someone like Oprah can even be associated with such practices.You can contact Oprah subscriptions at 800-846-4020 apparently but they don't even put the phone number on the invoices and it took me much searching to find it online, no thanks to them.

She doesn't even look like her!\\" It's as if Oprah is telling all of us \\"See how I can look like?\\" Every month is just a new testimony from Oprah, that money does do wonders.On the top of that, Oprah's personal thoughts, things, favorites, ideas, even more pictures are all over the few pages that are not advertisement.I still gave it 2 stars because from time to time you can find a good article, but the bottom line is the question: Is this a magazine or a show off ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest and indifferent seller","review":"I subscribed to this for my wife who loves to read this magazine. its been a couple of months and 4 emails and we are yet to see the first issue.

First of all, why would you put out a magazine with yourself on the cover of every issue? Second of all, Oprah doesn't care about anyone, but herself. She does nothing but exploit people and their mishaps, sadness, and struggle in life to make herself rich. I thought it was absurd that she would talk down on a certain fashion store because they wouldn't let her in after hours. I thought Oprah came from poverty. She should remember where she came from and start practicing some REAL humanitarian work. Oprah is just another money hungry selfish person and I don't see why anyone likes her.

It is the best for the writing style, information covered and presented, pertinence and practicality (without being condescending, overly sweet or too vague).

There is a mysterious young man rooming with the Captain on an island that the childrens' grandfather will choose to let them live on for the summer. The grandfather knows about this mysterious guy but doesn't go check him out on his own. He relies instead on the opinion of Dr. Moore from the first book. And, weirdly, Dr. Moore chooses to keep this mysterious man's secret rather than let everyone know who in the heck is living on the island with a bunch of unchaperoned children. Kids probably won't pick up on this, but I found it wholly creepy that this guy was living under an assumed identity the whole time he pursues getting closer to the kids. In today's time of sexual predators on children, it is actually quite a troubling character. The whole time he lies about who he is as he gets closer and closer to the children. It is sort of a questionable storyline and character."},{"rating":"1","title":"not new and 6 weeks late...","review":"Book came 6 weeks late and was not in new condition as advertised.

Watch at your own RISK of wasting your time.","review":"The 1st half is decent as it explores what happens when long term relationships fail, such as marriages. It tells the truth that many relationships fail because men treat women as sexual objects. So during the second half I was expecting a lot of character growth in the woman's role, which there wasn't. She still ends up a sexual object, just more accepting of that fact.Once the painter with an annoying English accent comes into the picture the movie gets VERY annoying and lame. And if they had a real relationship in life it would definitely fail since he was a grand WUSSBAG! There was no emotional connection between the two characters, which is why it seems that the painter is also using her as a sexual object just as all the other men in her life. She just accepts her sexuality, but at the cost of not growing as a person mentally or spiritually.A movie that started out good but went horribly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jams","review":"Please note that this package have not yet been delivered, therefore I hate it!

Sorry, this one was neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feminist propaganda that goes nowhere","review":"Once again, too bad zero ratings aren't allowed.This movie is just another piece of feminist propaganda from the late 1970s that regurgitates the usual anti-male spiel and has nothing of any substance to offer. The fact that the \\"heroine\\" sort of wanders off the screen at the end is most telling. She has her \\"individuality\\" and that's about it. George Harrison's song \\"I Me Mine\\" should have been playing in the background at that point.Blecch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing on DVD","review":"I couldn't wait for this film to be digitized, and the print is just beautiful. You can see Clayburgh's freckles! Some of those classic shots of her face are even more amazing when you can see her clearly. And the views of the New York skyline are even lovelier when the lights don't look like one big blur. Both the sound and the color have been cleaned up and are excellent. My only wish for the 30th anniversary edition next year (marketing opportunity alert) would be additional supplementary material. Something with Bates before his death would be thrilling. However, this package does include a long commentary with both Jill and Mazursky--worth listening to if you're a fan of the movie, though Mazursky gets a bit repetitious and obvious at times. If you're a long-time New Yorker, the info about where various scenes were shot is quite interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unmarried woman","review":"I love this movie and I really like Jill Clayburgh. I could really identify with this movie in being a single woman and all that we go through. It is a jungle out there and weeding through it can be scary at times. I like this movie and it is for any woman that can identify with what it is like to be single, starting over, or just being a woman with needs. I would recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful Look At Divorce","review":"Since I've never been married I didn't think this film would have any interest to me. That said, having a number of close friends and associates who have gone through divorce I can appreciate director-writer Paul Mazursky's insightful account of the disintegration of a seemingly perfect marriage. It's all here: the shock, the depression, the ritual dating. Jill Clayburgh, in a definitely Oscar-worthy performance, captures all the stages of a person who feels a sense of impregnability only to watch their security collapse around them. My only knocks against the film is the tedious relationship Clayburgh has with the colorful artistic type played by Alan Bates and her annoyingly precocious daughter played by Lisa Lucas."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's no woman, that's my therapist...","review":"is one of the best lines from this film. Always wonder how I would react should I run into my therapist out and about. Good story, does every husband go thru this midlife crisis, tearing his wife's heart out for something \\"better\\"? Glad she was able to get back out there and get her life going again. Alan Bates' eyes say more than words would allow. An actor that speaks volumes with his eyes and touches your heart. Great performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mazursky At His Best","review":"Jill Clayburgh delivered the most memorable performance of her career as a divorced woman in this poignant 1978 drama from writer-director Paul Mazursky.At the beginning of the film, Jill is a reasonably happy wife and mother, married to successful stock broker Michael Murphy. However, her life is shattered when Murphy suddenly announces that he is in love with another woman and wants a divorce.Single again after seventeen years, Jill spends several weeks trying to redefine herself. She dates, engages in some one-night stands and, ultimately, meets artist Alan Bates with whom she falls in love. Now, she must decide whether to make another romantic commitment, or to enjoy her newly discovered feeling of independence.This is, arguably, Mazursky's finest work. He and Ms. Clayburgh supply audio commentary on the DVD.Michael B.

I wish I had only purchased this one DVD and saved my money on all the others. I love her attitude and you work hard. This DVD is designed so that you can make each workout your own by using segments from flats, intervals and hills. Choose which segments you want to use depending on your level. Or, just workout to the full workout for intervals, flats or hills. It is a smart format. Love, love, love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"When you are done with this workout your heart rate will be up and you will be soaked. Great work out. Makes me feel good! The sound on this video is too low for some reason. You really have to crank up the volume. I returned the 1st one and the second was the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Super Cycle","review":"Just received this DVD and like it much better than Mindy's Super Cycle video. There are three separate workouts: hills, intervals, and flats. You can also choose a combination of any two or to do all three. The main menu also allows you to choose just the warm up, the workout, or the stretch from any of the three but doesn't allow you to set up a combination and then run the program like some other exercise videos. So if you want to do a combo, you have to get on and off the bike to choose the next segment. Mindy has the decency to look like she's working hard too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Bad Music","review":"This video was pretty disappointing. The music is bad, the scenery is cheesey, and the ride overall is boring. It was tough to finish the first ride and I haven't watched it since; I'd rather direct my own ride with music that gets me pumped up! It is nice that you can mix and match rides, but it's very choppy and not well edited. Wouldn't recommend it, but I'm sure it works for some people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very annoying","review":"My husband and I bought this DVD and another one featuring Mylrea. The instructions are not clear when she says what to do next. She talks too much and music isn't very good. She has annoying movements with her arms.

Whats up with this? This should have cost [less] for how little effort went into these. And this is just a personal but I like the VHS packaging UNIVERSAL did before they when with the \\"movie poster\\" packaging. Maybe someday well be luckey enough to get a deffinitive collectors eddition box set with some super cool packaging. But as for these double features... the only benifit is the space youll save over VHS. therefore... ONE STAR."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Dud!","review":"I completely agree with the other reviewer who said this DVD edition of two super mummy movies is a real dud. There's nothing extra except for a criminally skimpy \\"production notes\\" and \\"cast\\" biographies. Even the $9.00 DVD's you find in the bargain basement barrel have more goodies than this pathetic issue of my two favorite horror flicks. I was going to buy the entire series of these new double-features but am now glad I only brought this one. SAve your money. Your old VSH tapes look better than this miserable DVD. And to think I've waited a whole year for this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting tired of Mummies","review":"They overdid the Mummy thing at Universal.

I had been sleeping with a small pillow between my legs since the surgery, but I thought this new pillow would be better and I could turn from side to side with a little more ease. My back actually did feel a little better for the week that I used it, but the rest of my body was in so much pain that I finally had to stop using it. It didn't fit between my knees since I sleep with them slightly bent, so I either had to sleep with it between my thighs or my calves and neither of these positions provided a good night's sleep. I tried it for a week and after waking up in so much pain, I decided to give it up. I've gone back to using my small throw pillow and it seems to be doing just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the idea but it is just too big","review":"I was really excited to get the pillow. I thought for sure the pillow would fit because I'm tall. I ordered it even though other reviews had indicated the pillow was just too big to fit comfortably for any extended period. But it really is massive and just too big to use comfortably. I took one of the pillows out and it felt so much better but now of course the case doesn't fit. Its a good idea, but the execution could use some more thought and testing before putting it on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leg Spacer Pillow","review":"The leg spacer pillow didn't work at all for me, I wished I hadn't bought it.

He said it is very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wide and NON-RETURNABLE","review":"The product arrived all right, but when folded in half to use as a knee pillow, it became immediately apparent that the pillow is too wide to fit comfortably between an average woman's knees without torquing hips and back. Also, the two sides do not lay flush together as shown in the photo. Only the cheap velcro bits hold it partially together.More distressing was discovering after the fact that I can't return this unused product. I finally found the seller's \\"no returns\\" policy buried in the AB page; it is NOT mentioned on the Amazon sell page, but it ought to be! This thing is brand new, but I got absolutely no response when I tried to contact AB's non-existent customer service. This is a classic case of \\"buyer beware\\"--I will avoid this seller in future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for us","review":"We bought two of these for our elderly moms who both have back and hip problems. One is a petite lady and the other is tall, medium frame. They both tried numerous times, but neither of them could use the wedge, leg & knee pillow. I think they were TOO thick when folded together to fit comfortably between their knees and help align their backs. This was not a good purchase for our needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three words: Love this Pillow!","review":"I ordered this pillow to help reduce the pain I get in my hips. I am a side-sleeper and most times I wake up with severe hip pain. I also, after having children, have vericose veins and often get terrible charley horses in my calves. I searched the internet for pillow that would help me out with both of my problems. This was the only one I found that assists with both! I love that, I saved alot of money buying one pillow instead of two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Akward fit, doesn't work","review":"This thing is nearly useless... it doesn't fit me or any of my family members (all of which have average builds) correctly.

Sometimes a year 2010 perspective hinders sympathetic reception of some of the behavior of featured participants, but on the whole, this is a good read of an essentially Victorian novel. I listened using the Kindle robot reader. I am accustomed to robot readers and am rapidly acclimating to Amazons, so my comments are not those of a novice listener. I found it easy and interesting listening; however, there are simple adjustments to the articulation possible which would measurably improve the verisimilitude of the voice. There are two voices, one each, male and female. I have used only the male, the female being less satisfactory because of losses in higher registers common with aging. It really makes little difference since I find the male voice when reading a woman's part sounds adequately female."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun while it lasted","review":"We got this water fall as a gift for my kids 2&4.

The ball filled with water, and won't work any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of JUNK!","review":"Don't waste your money, its not even worth it, dosent even work. Once the water is in the ball it is very hard to drain the water.

The 1st 2 days were fine, on the 3rd day it started filling up with water but the sprinklers still worked. On the 4th day the sprinklers stopped working so the only thing it did was fill up with water. Good idea but it needs to be way more durable to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"My son got this for his birthday, as we had put it on his amazon wish list. I should have read more reviews first! It was a ton of fun for the few minutes it worked, then the inside lining popped (same problem other customers mentioned) and the ball filled almost half way up with water before I figured out what the problem was.Little Tikes should recall this item, a ball who's lining pops and fills with water is not safe for kids... If the interior isn't as strong as it's supposed to be, how do we know the exterior is? What are they going to do if the exterior pops while the ball is filled with water? Sprinkler toys are fun, but exploding water balls are dangerous.Don't buy this item until Little Tikes fixes the defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might have been fun...","review":"This ball broke the very first time we used it, within a minute or so. The ball started filling up with water and there is no apparent way to fix it or empty the water out. What a bummer, and a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it filled with water & EXPLODED!","review":"The kids really had fun with this- twice. Then the interior filled with water where it wasn't supposed to be. We tried to drain it, and the damn thing EXPLODED like a water balloon! Watch out for this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"money pit","review":"Bought this for my son's 5th birthday party. It lasted 10 minutes then got hung up on a sprinkler head in the yard. The weight of the water inside this toy makes it heavy enough that anything it lands on becomes like a dagger. The three inch hole from the sprinkler head rendered this toy a complete waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted about 20 minutes.","review":"My 4-year-old daughter got this toy for her birthday, and we got it out for the first time on a nice hot day. It pumps up easily if you have an electric pump, and the hose attaches easily to the ball. My kids had a great time with it for about 20 minutes, at which point I heard it making some weird noises. About 5 minutes later, the water stopped coming out of the sprinkler holes and the inside of the ball (in the compartment that is supposed to hold air) filled up with water.Now the water trapped in there will not come out, and we scarcely got 20 minutes of fun out of this toy, before having to throw it in the trash.I would never recommend this product to anyone, especially after reading the other reviews that mention the exact same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I teach preschool children with special needs and bought this ball for our water play day. It was fun, for about 5 minutes. Then we noticed that the ball started to fill with water, and the sprinkler stopped working. We couldn't get the water to come out. So much for that. I spend lots of money each year on my students, and when I see something I like from a brand like LIttle Tykes, I assume its going to be good. Well, looks like I'm going to have to check reviews now, because Little Tykes is not the company I thought it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"God idea but didn't have good luck.","review":"I was hoping this was going to be a hit but the kids didn't care for it. Also it never moved around like it was supposed to. We ended up tossing it out.

Pretty much a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This item was purchased for my toddler but it's boring she would rather play with the garden sprinkler then play with the beach ball sprinkler then a month later my saint bernard tore a huge hole in it.It's not worth getting and is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with water... and have no idea how to get it out.","review":"I bought this sprinkler last year... and we got lots of great use out of it. It was very inexpensive so I hate to complain but today was the third time this year we used it. It is now filled with water about half way up. And I have no idea how to get it out! After reading other reviews, I see others have had the same problem. Looks like if I am able to get the water out (still not sure how to do that part) it seems like it will take a long time. Totally bummed since both my kids, 3 and 1, love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for short term","review":"Like everyone else has said this ball starts off great. I am on the 3rd use and the ball is already half full of water. No idea how to get it out. After seeing the rest of the reviews I see it's death is imminent. So if you paid $5 for this it's great....anymore than that and you have been ripped off.After trying again: if you open the part you blow air into and roll the ball so it's on the bottom the water will start to drip out. Squeeze it and it goes a bit faster. Maybe the ball got a reprieve after all. Not the big round plug, but the small one."},{"rating":"1","title":"sprinkler ball","review":"This is toy acumulates a lot of water inside and it is almost impossible take the water out.I am very desapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with water after ten minutes","review":"As others have said, but I just wanted to add my two cents, I got mine for $[...] at the grocery store and it was fun for about ten minutes until it filled with water.

It looks like a great idea! However, we hooked it up according to the directions and it didn't work at all. It filled with water right away and only a few small sprays of water came out. It didn't roll around and was just not fun at all for my kids (ages 7 and 4). After a frustrating 15 minutes, we hooked up the regular lawn sprinkler and the kids had a blast."},{"rating":"1","title":"BaD VerY Baddd!!!!","review":"I bought this ball this summer, I live in Orlando, fl, so you know it was hot. I bought it for my little daughter who was 28 months old at that time, but though she loves water, she hated this toy. THe ball was stady the whole time and when the water came out the holes it shooted without moving around. To make matters worse, I had just used it around 3 times for the most, and when I tried to use it again after being ignored for a while (this is now late summer not too long ago) the ball just broke from inside and it started to fill with water inside not the conducts to the sprinklers (it claims that you can use it as a ball or as a sprinkler). I had to trash it, it was not use not even if I just inflated it to be use as a ball because the air was leacking from some where. Bottom line, regular sprinklers are probably more fun, or some other toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very fun","review":"When you look at this it looks so fun, but think about it, it is attached to a heavy hose. It is basically a sprinkler shaped like a ball. My kids played with it for literally 5 minutes, and then we went and got one of those crazy sprinklers that sprays water everywhere. That was a lot more fun, and half the price.I will say that the ball was durable, and it would work as a great ball, but it is pretty pricey to not use it for its said purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will be fun once; then throw away","review":"If you get one that works, well and good. But it looks like about half of these are like the one we got: it quickly leaks water into the air chamber. As in, about twenty or thirty gallons. When that happens,the ball doesn't roll, and the only real way to get the water out is with a knife. Goodbye ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat summer toy","review":"We really like the sprinkler ball. The spray isn't too harsh and the kids all love to just run through the water really fast. The ball can move on its own a little if you put it on a slope and make sure you have extra hose slack. Great summer fun in this one, especially for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"We bought this sprinkler for a 4th of July party we were having. There were about 6 small children (ages 1-4) there. The toy did great at this party and every one loved it. However, a month later we decided to take it out again for our 15 month old to play in (since our pool had a leak). After about 10 minutes the ball started filling up with water and then quit spraying out altogether. It was great while it lasted but what a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take your money and just throw it away","review":"Because that is what you will be doing with this toy. We set it up for our 2 year old son. It worked at total of 10 minutes before the ball filled with water and we could no longer use it. Needless to say, our son was hysterical. Thanks Little Tikes for such a horrible product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest Design I've Ever Seen","review":"My son wanted and received this for his birthday. It was the worst design I've ever seen. The ball filled up with water within a few minutes of using it, which meant it couldn't be rolled around or played with as shown. To get the water out, it practically had to be \\"milked,\\" which took hours (seriously) and even then, not all of it came out, so it grew mold and mildew on the inside, which then blocked the sprinkler holes, preventing it from ever being used again. Ended up slashing it open to fit it in the trash can. Total Junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to love it but it kept filling up with water","review":"This was a gift for my son's 3rd Birthday. It looked so nice when we got it and the kids were so excited to play in it. I was disappointed, it only worked for a few minutes and then filled up with water and stopped spraying the water out. My husband emptied it which takes a long time to try to use it again. I would not recommend this sprinkler. They kids only got to play with it twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I was excited to try this and it was highly rated at the time I bought it, but it never worked. The whole ball just filled with water making it too heavy to do anything with it, and it didn't spray water at all. Boo..."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun","review":"I got this for my 2 year old for hot summer days. To say he loves it is an understatement. Every time we get this out all the neighbor kids flock to it. Then their moms ask where I got it so they could buy one. I have used this many hours and never had the trouble the other reviewers had. If this ball breaks I will have to buy another cause my son would be heartbroken. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Piece of Garbage - Bad Manufacturing","review":"It arrived brand new in its original packaging with two huge holes. Horrible.

Within 5 minutes of play something broke inside and the whole ball started filling with water. I thought it was going to burst! Then it was a fiasco trying to get all the water out. I had to open the air valve and put a stick in it to keep that valve open and squeeze down to let water come out of the water hole. I have since read other reviews that had the same problem. My kids didn't have enough time to see if they even liked the toy. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy....","review":"This toy broke after 5 minutes of use. The tube that sends water to the sprinkler detached and filled the ball with water. There is no way to empty the water out of the ball (except through the air valve)so this toy was ruined before my kids even got a chance to play with it. I also can't take it back to the store because I will have to cut it to get all of the water out of it. Don't waste your money - find another sprinkler that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ending Is Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed this book because I love any story that involves New Orleans. The characters were good and so was the story line. But where did the ending come from....OUT OF THIN AIR. I waited and waited for a good ending and was thoroughly disappointed. The author seemed to make up the ending just to get the book over with. Everything was settled in the last couple of pages. Don't pay full price...wait for the bargain bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some suspense but very disappointing ending","review":"I like Graham, although her yarns meander and wrap up too abruptly with new characters that appear on the last pages. My biggest gripe is her romances have no heat. There is zero chemistry between heroes and heroines because they are not drawn fully. Ultimately, there is little to hold the book together and remember after it's done. There are far superior romantic suspense writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably my favorite by Heather Graham","review":"This was the first book by Heather Graham that I picked up and read, and is still my favorite after reading several more.

However, Nikki du Monde fails to see it and just wants to know what to do to put the ghost of her newest employee where ever the departed are supposed to depart to. As it turns out, the young woman, Andy, was brutally murdered and it's up to Nikki and Brent Blackhawk to solve the case. Brent is able to communicate with the dead, and from all he's hearing, someone wants to make Nikki one of their number. To keep Nikki safe as well as bring peace to the restless spirits, the killer must be found and stopped.** While the dead were fairly interesting, it was hard to care about what the living characters were doing. The romance seemed a bit forced, and it would have been much more fascinating to see more of what Brent does than focus on Nikki. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"When they said used book they meant it. Not in any good condition I have received better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple book for those who enjoy easy reads","review":"This was an ok novel, I thought it would some how be deeper, and a quicker read, however it turned out to be little more then a sheet grabber. A term I use to refer to books that start out with a good idea but end up copying bad romance novels with cliched haunting stories. The writer does not try to grab the reader, instead it cuts from one scene to the next like a bad made for TV movie. I wish I could have stopped reading it, but I am one of the few who cannot stop reading a novel simply because I don't like it. If the story starts, I must know the ending, for this I pity myself. Simple book and possibly fun, for those who like the easy read, and occasionally steamy books... though not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"great color","review":"The watch itself is your average Seiko 5, the band is formed and the weight is light, but there is still something great about it.

You will too.This one is my Summer time watch. Light and cool to wear. I have had it for a year and a half and worn it almost every day of two summers and quite often in between. Very accurate.

I love the fact that I never have to go buy a battery and wait for someone to install it. It runs a little fast, so after a few days I have to turn it back a couple of minutes, but that's no big deal. I love the dial color, and its durability. Only problem would be that if you don't wear it for a day and a half, you have to reset the time.

And they really DO have awesome voices. Although this is the only CD I own by Dream Street, and I have not seen The Biggest Fan [yet], this is just the start of an obsession, I can tell.Okay, either you love Dream Street, or ya hate 'em, but everyone should give 'em a chance.Overall grade - A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hear it & you'll buy it","review":"This cd isn't worth $23 is it? no maybe $15 and also needs to give more information if it wants people to buy it at that high price kids like me can't afford that kind of money to loose on a cd unless we know it is really good.

If you want to keep this type of propaganda away from your children, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD DAUGHTER = BAD BOOK","review":"At first, I wanted to like Julie Hilden. Her mother was clearly unhinged and abusive, and I was able to follow Julie's actions -- leave, go away, get as far away from Mom as she could.However, the woman Julie turns into is no one to admire. She may be a rabid overachiever, but it's clear that she has limited social skills. Her interactions with friends and lovers are chilling -- she has no sense of remorse at all. She's amoral. I don't think she should have written this book; I think she should have gone into serious, intense therapy before she hurt someone else. It is hard to believe that we are supposed to admire this woman. She is not brave; she is damaged.Avoid this book at all costs. I would give it a negative star rating if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a bad daughter","review":"I purchased this book because I thought I would find solace in the story of another young girl who had a difficult time with her mother, and suffered throughout life with the emotions attached to that. Instead I found Ms. Hilden's style and attitude more akin to a law brief than a memoir of a painful time in her life. She is cold and emotionless and does not draw the reader into the story, except to dislike the daughter. Believe me, I wanted to like this book. I wanted to believe Ms. Hilden when she said her mother hurt her. I wanted to feel her justification for abandoning her mother as she lay dying, but the book simply did not do that. This woman may have every ivy league degree in the world and certainly sounds couragious in overcoming poverty, but it seems she either has never learned to feel emotion or never learned to put it on paper so the reader can feel it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninsightful and Self-Serving","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book because I, too, feel like a \\"bad daughter;\\" I feel that I didn't do enough to help my alcoholic mother. Also, like Ms. Hilden, I am an attorney. I found, however, that Ms. Hilden offered no insight into WHY she acted as she did--she simply used her feelings of unworthiness as an excuse to behave badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whining without insight","review":"This is a total turnoff. Yes, the author's situation was bleak. No, the author does not have to be a saint to be worth reading. But her whining, self-absorbed account of continuing destructive behavior lacks insight. The reader is left with an off-putting narrative that lacks resolution of any kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of time.","review":"At first, this seemed like a brave story, beautifully written -- but, as it went on, I realized that I actually despised the author. Not necessarily because of what she did (not) do about her mother, but because of her relationships with others, especially men. She seems like a nightmare friend, someone you would not want to talk to or know. Maybe she has talent, maybe she is an overachiever, but it seems to me that she needs some serious therapy, rather than a book contract."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite tedious","review":"The author comes across as almost completely unlikeable. Perhaps this is brave (I certainly wouldn't write a book that made me look this unsympathetic), but the author's complete self-absorbtion and ambition, at the apparent expense of maintaining any meaningful relationships, made me wince."},{"rating":"1","title":"she and her mother are a pair.","review":"yes, her mother was horrible -- but so is the author, who sounds like one of the most selfish people ever. the writing is very good, and it's thought-provoking, but you will close the book being glad you do not know julie hilden."},{"rating":"1","title":"no one in my book group like it","review":"My book group--a dozen or so educators--was unanimous in their decision--this was a bad book. No one was able to like or even empathize with the author. We had chosen this book with great enthusiasm after reading good reviews. We all donated them to the local library book sale without any desire to share the book with our mothers, daughters or anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much information","review":"Ms. Hilden writes this book to cure her own demons and appease her own guilt. She is brave to write it, but inconsiderate to the reader as some details go too far. While she titles the book 'the bad daughter' she never owns up to her own responsibility.I think she was a daughter who did the best she could. I wish she would write a sequel in which she forgives herself. This book made be glad I did not know the author. I hope writing is has helped her find solace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total turnoff","review":"This book is nothing but one long and tedious account of a self absorbed daughter of a difficult mother. It could have been an engrossing memoir if the author had shown any depth or insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books written","review":"Julie Hilden has written an amazing book, a book filled with depth and passion. She speaks about the difficult choices she had to face in dealing with the pressures of an incredibly painful family life, coupled with law school demands and those of simply growing up.The Bad Daughter is an honest book -- one that drives the reader to question his or her own character while reading the book, and to ask whether or not the feelings one has as the words pour across the page are derived from empathy, scorn, or a desire to hide one's own similarities to Ms. Hilden. It is written in such a beautiful style, with so many moving episodes, that it will stay with you, forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best memoir I have read in a long time.","review":"This memoir is so completely engrossing, I stayed up until 2 a.m. last night just because I had to know the ending. The surprise is, the last couple of pages left me sobbing so hard I couldn't sleep. It is a beautifully written account of the author's increasing emotional and physical distance from her mother as her mother descends into rage and abusiveness stemming, the author learns only too late, from early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The author's emotions seem so controlled through it all, even after she learns of the diagnosis and of its genetic implications, one might think her unfeeling. But her pain and the pathos are inescapable in a unnerving way. Unforgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only one I could put down","review":"I've read several of Christopher Moore's books and loved every one! This is the only one I could put down. Based on the reviews, maybe I should pick it up again, but so far it's blather. Two characters insulting one another...where's the humor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"this. book. sucks.","review":"I picked it up from the library thinking it would be a hilarious contrast and parody to the other dark and vampire books I have read recently. I laughed all the way through the first couple chapters (very short chapters). After a while (35 mins or less) the jokes get old. All the sex, blood, and cursing is not funny. The book is poorly written, especially for a comedy. I gave up half way through. You Suck is a cute idea that falls flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Suck","review":"A laugh out loud read! I loved it! But suggest one reads BLOODSUCKING FIENDS first, You Suck takes up where BSF leaves off. Chris Moore, I heart you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun start to a three book tale!","review":"If you haven't read \\"Bite Me\\" or \\"Bloodsucking Fiends\\" yet, that's great as the three books tell one long tale of the same characters. I read one of the others before I knew, but I still liked this a lot. The characters are introduced and the book itself can stand on it's own. If you like it though, know you can keep reading on with the novels. As always the characters are nutty and crazy, with few exceptions. It's set in San Francisco and the story revolves around the main characters who become part of the vampire world in one way or another. This isn't a boring vampire book - it's pure humor and adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even more painful to read than Twilight","review":"This was given to me as a gift, which was the only reason I finished it. It didn't take me long to realize this was a sequel to something as it was obvious I was missing some of the back story. Even so the whole book felt like a trip to the dentist. Without the Novacaine. The banter that was supposed to be funny made me want to stake them all myself. And there seemed to be no real plot to it. it kind of wandered aimlessly to an ending that might be a step above sparkly vampires, but even that's open for debate. The writing style came off like it was written by a teenage girl. It was a campy version of Twilight As if THAT series wasn't bad enough... camp doesn't help it. There is nothing here that would make me want to pick up something else by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many typos","review":"The only reason for the low rating is because there are a lot of typos in this e copy of the book.For example To night = tonight"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Suck, a love story","review":"Christopher Moore is a wonderful and witty writer. This is the second book in the series,\\" Best Fiends;a Love Story\\", being the first. I enjoyed this book, but,not as much as the first.However,I am looking forward to a third in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"I didn't know this was a book about vampires until I started reading it, or else I would not have started. It's a very good book, well written, great characters (especially Abby), fun to read, cohesive, and smart. The fact that it is about vampires is secondary to it's sheer entertainment value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another soon to be classic by Christopher Moore","review":"Great book. Very funny. This is your typical Christopher Moore book. Interesting characters, funny diologue & laugh out loud situations. This is a sequel to his third book \\"Bloodsucking Fiends\\". Chris does a good job at filling you in, but you might want to check the first one out before buying \\"You Suck\\". Although the first one is a very fun read, i believe this sequel is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE CAN BE A PAIN IN THE NECK..","review":"I've been a fan of Moore's for some time now. To keep from looking like a lunatic, I try not to read his books in public since his writing is laugh out loud hilarious.This \\"vampire love story\\" continues where his \\"Bloodsucking Fiends\\" left off and continues with further adventures of Jody, the red haired vampire and her 19 year old boyfriend, Tommy Flood. The common element in all of Moore's writing are elements of the supernatural with a humorous twist.If the world as it is bores you, and you day-dream about feeding that annoying co-worker to a monster....this book will tickle your fancy and take you on a power trip. Moore's motto seems to be, if you have that power........why not use it.Although not quite up to his previous works, this one is still better than 95% of the stuff that's out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Suck","review":"Very funny author and a very funny book. All his books are very funny. The author has a great sense of humor. He also writes about some pretty unusal subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book one in an amazing trilogy...","review":"I am floored by Moore's ability to get inside the heads of people from different ages, genders, and walks of life and make you believe that he is them. This book is one point-of-view of the story told in You Suck, Bite Me, and Bloodsucking Fiends. You get to meet all the characters in each book, then walk around inside their bodies in the books. THey are stand alone books that will leave your sides aching from laughter, and it can go on that much longer reading all three. I am starting to wish that all authors would employ that different book-different character-same events dynamic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite There","review":"The sequel to \\"Bloodsucking Fiends,\\" \\"You Suck\\" has none of the novelty - and very little of the charm - of the original book. While a lot of the same humor is present, the characters lack the development of the first novel, and the plot itself seems redundant. \\"You Suck\\" is an amusing read, but don't expect it to be as delightful as the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny","review":"This book isn't as funny as I was lead to believe. It did have its moments - most coming from the semi-minor character of Abby Normal. Her sarcastic and dramatic attitude is reminiscent of Ellen Page's Juno. I also thought there was a lot of build up for a not so big resolution of the problematic \\"father\\" vampire and the manipulative blue hooker."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book \\"sucks\\"","review":"I've been reading Moore since Practical Demonkeeping and have enjoyed his work for years. I came to him through Tom Robbins (like many of you, perhaps) and like Robbins, I have found Moore's rude wit, clever word play, black humor, and his subject matter highly entertaining.That said, however, this is a weak addition to his catalogue. I couldn't finish this book because I found his wit, word play, and humor here to be puerile, crass, and vulgar. This sequel to the fabulous Bloodsucking Fiends seems rushed, as if he put it on the market to satisfy the demand for it and the plot suffers for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Suck...didn't Suck","review":"I'm reviewing the audio CD of You Suck. The reader was excellent. The story was funny and interesting. And I loved the way he linked some of the characters and story lines from a previous book \\" A Dirty Job\\". My favorite character has to be Abby Normal. Maybe we will get a visit from her in a future book. I must say that I was sad when the book was over. I still wanted more of these characters and their stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher Moore Crazed!!","review":"If you've read his books, you know you can't get enough and you count the days for the next release. You Suck was a funny book that made me want to call in sick and read again once I was done, just in case I missed something. Abby is this fantastic character that you want him to write a complete book about, I guarantee it! And she's not even the main characters in the book. If you read Bloodsucking Fiends first, you would have some insight to You Suck, but you can read it on its own. Read them all, they are so worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"usually love his books","review":"first off let me just say that i love christopher moore's books. if you have not read anything else by him please do not start with this book. fluke, lamb, dirty job, any of those are a great place to start. You Suck was a bummer for me and did not live up to my expectations. I knew all of the characters before i read the story and i still just did not get into it. moore is usually so good with fast, snappy conversations that keep me interested. Plus i just did not laugh out loud while reading this one. this book does not suck, but definitely is not a good representation of what this author is capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"still the best","review":"christopher moore does it again! he blends a great story line with the greatest form of sarcasm, humor and wit i have yet to encounter. i would have to say, he is by far my favorite fiction writer. all of his books deliver that special blend of laugh out loud, that can easily embrrass you on the train ride to work! thank you mr moore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Low","review":"I read Dirty Job and finished it but didn't like it at all. My wife recently bought two more of Moore's books (thankfully at a bargain bin) without knowing how I felt about the author. I tried this one and it is worse than Dirty Job, it makes Dirty Job look like 1976 Woody Allen. In this book a bunch of slacker vampires and a bunch of slacker vampire hunters wander around not doing much of anything. It goes on and on. The reader yearns for something new and different like a plot or interesting characters. I gave up less than half way through and it is in my DNA to finish all books I start. Anybody want to buy the author's Sequined Nun book cheap? It's unread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"What a horrible story, are you kidding me? This isn't literature, it's far from it. It's so painful to read, this is my first time reading this author's work. It makes me not even want to try and pick up anything else he wrote. God. I mean I give him credibility for anything else if it was good, but this was horrible..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Suck...Does","review":"Sorry, Christopher Moore fans, but this book not only sucks, it blows. The characters are lifeless [:)] and the humor is lacking. Please don't let this be the first Moore book you read! Start with something earlier - and much funnier - like \\"Lust Lizard.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It actually does suck","review":"Let me begin by saying that I am a dedicated Christopher Moore fan. I read \\"Island Of The Sequined Love Nun\\" and I was hooked. I then proceeded to read everything he had written prior to that novel and then read everything he has produced since. I have never been disappointed-he has always been exceptionally creative and humorous-until now. This book is so far below what he is capable of writing that I had a difficult time coming to grips with the fact that he actually wrote it. There are far too many underdeveloped characters that we don't care about and there really is no storyline to speak of. Abby Normal is the only reason I gave it even one star-she is very funny. Save your valuable time and money and buy anything else he has written. And Chris, don't do anything like this again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Suck","review":"You will enjoy this book more if you read it in the order it was written. Seems to be a new one coming soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fangtastic!","review":"This is my first book by this author and it was hilarious. This guy is out there but he can write an entertaining story. Not much else to say, it's fun, fast, and literally laugh out loud funny. I will be reading more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good book","review":"If you liked Blood Sucking Fiends, you'll probably like this book, too. I actually think Jodi's character is more interesting in this one, though the story takes a bit longer to get moving. But yes, it's funny. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I didn't like the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining to read, but the first is still my favorite","review":"This book reminded me a LOT of the movie, \\"Back to the Future\\". My analogy here is that the first installment in the series was amazing (\\"Bloodsucking Fiends\\"/\\"Back to the Future\\"). Although it was exciting to discover that a sequel was coming out when you didn't expect one, reading/watching it when it did was somewhat disappointing. The first one was so good, it could exist on a stand-alone basis and no sequel was necessary. But now that it has one, you have to read/watch the third, or you're left hanging, wondering what the fate will be of the main characters.I love Moore's books, but wish he had just left these characters be. Still, I recommend it if for no other reason than the ability to read Moore's writing again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life on the Lower East Side: Photographs by Rebecca Lepkoff, 1937-1950","review":"This is a book of photographs one feels truthfully captures the atmosphere, the way of life, experienced by the people living on the Lower East Side during this period of time. The text is a bit difficult to read as it is not a very dark print but all in all the book is worthwhile for just the photographs alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for the lads","review":"This book has made the rounds of all our friends, crisscrossing the globe in the process -and for good reason, it's hilarious! A friend was given an early copy on a plane somewhere between Japan and Ireland during the last World Cup. Back in the US, my Irish husband (a once-bartender at McDaid's), laughed so hard tears rolled down his cheeks. Not wanting to miss out, I grabbed the book as soon as he put it down, then promptly ordered 5 copies for friends.There is definitley some Dublin slang in this book, and being American, I had to ask translations for a few of the words - but that's part of the fun. The characters are vivid, and anyone who's worked in IT or for a big consulting firm can relate to the main character. It's a quick, funny read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential!","review":"One of the funniest books on the planet.Read it in a single sitting and laughed out loud for the duration. I'll never look at my bath in the same way again.Very resilient indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"reviewer dissagreement","review":"On a personal note I would like to disagree with the comments of the reviewer named \\"Col\\". I found myself in the position that I couldn't foresee an ending, which would warrant the quality of the rest of the book. I became more and more nervous toward the ending that as another reviewer quoted a \\"Hollywood\\" style ending would emerge. It didn't!!! Martin executed a move, which Steven King would have been proud of (in his day). The ending truly complemented the excellent picture painted in the proceeding pages.On a professional note to Col if you review books on Amazon or any other review site. You should remain vague about plots and storylines..."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOWOWOW!","review":"From the start I was hooked and then as all her other books I could not put this one down either....Makes you wonder and realize what really goes on in psychiatric homes. Cried and smiled all in the same read and that's what is important when you read a book, at least in my eye's......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"Many books fade from memory over time. \\"Me & Emma\\" is one that will not. From the opening paragraph the storytelling is so strong and you care so much about what is going to happen to the characters that you can't put the book down. Some people don't like reading stories told in the first person. This one couldn't be told any other way. The world - good, bad, or indifferent - through 8-year old Carrie's eyes is a place we all need to know about. I hesitated to begin reading a book with domestic and child abuse themes, but I am glad I read it. It has changed the way I look at the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"I bought this for two reasons: I'd read reviews about it and people seemed to be raving over it and because there was a 3 for 2 offer at WHSmiths and I needed to pick the 3rd book.God, it's terrible. I'm not from the States so I can't really say about the dialogue, but come on. How ridiculous. The plot is basically surreal and I don't know any 8 year olds that are as articulate as Carrie.It's totally unbelieable. I wouldn't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"The pace is slow, the voice only half convincing. I literally knew the \\"twist\\" within twenty pages.Skip this. Read ELLEN FOSTER by Kaye Gibbons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Horrible. Relentlessly grim. But worst of all? The big plot twist is so thoroughly foreshadowed that in the middle of chapter one I already knew it what it was. I then had to wade through 299 pages of improbable events and lurid detail of the torture of a child, only to find out that the ending was exactly what I knew it would be, only without a glimmer of hope to make the preceding pages worthwhile. Why would anyone want to write something like this? The mind boggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly","review":"I found this book to be utterly depressing. I read the entire book just see if Carrie would actually overcome such devastation. I am sure there are those that have survived this type of sexual and physical abuse and that is a horrifying thought. I was not prepared to read about this throughout the entire book. I couldn't read it at night because my blood pressure would go so high I couldn't go to sleep. If you are looking for triumph of the worst of odds--this is not the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste-it was almost insulting!","review":"What a disappointment. This book was ridiculous, but unfortunately not to the point of making me laugh. The \\"voice\\" of the character Carrie was such a caricature of what someone with little imagination and maybe no experience down South might use-lots of \\"ain'ts, cain'ts, reckons.\\" The plot was what made me pick it up; abused child trying to cope; however, I would characterize the book as like a \\"paint by numbers\\"-so obvious. The minute the author threw in eccentric neighbor Mr. Wilson, who gave the little girl target practice, I knew what was coming and checked the end to be sure. As far as the plot \\"twist,\\" which was especially ridiculous since I don't think mama would have given much weight to the recommendations of a therapist, it has been done before, and so much better in \\"Prince of Lost Places\\" and others. This book was so awful that I wish I did not have to give it a full star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising heart-wrenching","review":"I liked this novel for the writing style---from the voice of a little girl who conveyed, in a voice that was convincingly that of a little girl but had the heart of someone who knew there was something wrong with her world yet survived it by standing on the outside of it. I won't give anything away and I never saw it coming but I will say, I was surprised and a little disappointed in the twist. I had to put it aside for a moment to be able to continue reading the scenes with Richard and the hard-edged grief her mother took on after \\"Daddy's\\" death--it seems difficult to believe anyone could survive so much heartache, yet \\"Me and Emma\\" seem to tell their story in a way that is convincingly confident that all will be ok--their hope is hearbreaking--so...Flock must have done an excellent job in developing her characters for me to become so invested in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never saw it coming!","review":"Even though the subject matter was a little hard to read at times I found I could not put this book down. Very well written so much so I felt like I was there. Never guessed the surprise twist in the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing.Exploitation of a serious subject for entertainment","review":"Basically, this is a story of horrific child and spousal abuse, for children and woman with no way out with no other redeeming quality. Mid way through the book I was able to figure out the\\" big reveal\\"ending, which was not a big surprise.There is nothing interesting or new about this story in terms of literature.The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that the writer was able to convey the absolutely despicable and desparate situation in which the female characters find themselves, so the 2 stars goes to the writing style- but otherwise this is exploitation of a very serious issue for entertainment's sake. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I had never heard of this book until I saw it at Costco with the Costco Book Club Selection sticker. I'm so glad I bought it! Like another reviewer, I started this book one afternoon and did not go to sleep that night until I finished it. My heart went out to Carrie and Emma. Some things that happened during the book that I thought were inconsistencies were totally understandable by the ending. I will be passing this one on to my daughters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant, touching, heartwrenching","review":"I tucked this novel away to save for vacation, as I felt it would need my attention. I'm glad I did. I was lost in Carrie and Emma's world for two days, feeling their heartache, their bravery, their pain and loneliness. Definitely not a feel-good novel, but one that wrenches all your feelings, nonetheless. As one reviewer points out, it makes you want to reread the book as soon as you've finished it,if only to pick up the clues you've missed. I also was reminded of my own blessings in life, as it is not hard to imagine these events occurring in may homes, unbeknownst to us all. I picked up another novel when I finished with Emma and Me, but couldn't give it my full attention as I was still lost in thought, wanting to know the rest of Carrie's story. I hope some day Ms Flock will let us know how Carrie fares. To me, that is a successful novel, leaving the reader wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF AN EVENING","review":"THIS BOOK WAS SO BORING I STARTED TO SKIM (QUICKLY) THRU TO THE END AFTER THE 3rd CHAPTER.....EVEN THE ENDING WAS NO SURPRIZE.....WRITTEN THRU THE EYES OF AN 8 YR OLD TELLING EVERY BORING THOUGHT AND CONVERSATION (90% of which had nothing to do with the abuse) OF EVERY BORING DAY WAS A WASTE OF A NIGHT OF READING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transparent Secret","review":"Like many others, I was intrigued by the \\"spectacular finish\\" promised. On page 16, I was positive I knew what the big secret was, and I let myself keep reading to about page 45, trying to second guess myself because maybe it was just too simple. Then frustration kicked in, and I skipped to the last 10 pages. Surprise! I had it all figured out and didn't need to suffer through the gruesome details. I'm a bit saddened by the fact that authors and screenwriters (this reminded me a lot of a big movie a few years ago with regard to the \\"surprise\\") feel that in order to have a big, surprising finish, they have to lay out clues the size of elephants from the first chapter on. It was just too obvious and since the subject matter was so depressing, it just didn't make sense to read it all the way through. Too bad. Initially I thought of purchasing her first book, but have thought better of that now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent writing but I hated this book","review":"This was a book club selection so I had to finish it. It got a good response from most everyone in our book club but I have to say, I hated this book and would never recommend it to anyone. I was depressed the whole time I was reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing - But I Hated It","review":"If this was not a book club selection, I would have never finished it. Although the pacing and plot of this story were lacking, I can find little fault with the author's writing.My main complaints: 1) The \\"shocking plot twist\\" was obvious from about thirty pages into the story and 2) I'm just sick and tired of these stories where the daddy/stepdaddy gets drunk and beats the hell out of everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book. Couldn't put it down!","review":"This book held my attention all the way through. Never did I see the end coming!!! Great twist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written melodrama","review":"Flock is excellent at getting inside the head of her main character, Carrie. However, the places she takes Carrie will feel cliched to anyone who's ever read Southern fiction or seen an M. Night Shyamalan movie. You have the abusive, dirt-poor stepfather, the charming but feckless dead papa, the careworn mama, the kindly neighbors -- nothing you haven't seen. I figured out the twist about thirty pages in and spent most of the rest of the book waiting for my suspicion to be confirmed. (I'm pretty sure Flock cheats a few times to try to disguise it, but that could be defended as being a POV issue. She's also inconsistent with the timing of the backstory -- but, again, that could be a POV issue.) It was depressing going, and not so much worth it.It's not a bad book by any means, but you've seen it all done better before."},{"rating":"2","title":"heartbreaking and tragic","review":"I couldnt put this book down! The subject of abuse as seen through the eyes of Carrie is so heartbreaking as she tries to protect her little sister Emma. You dont see the twist near the end coming and it leaves you wondering what clues you missed to explain the plot twist! Very sad and hard to read, yet at the same time I couldnt stop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected surprise","review":"I bought 'Me & Emma' on a whim, not knowing anything about it. I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before the book because without knowing there a 'twist', I didn't look for it or expect it. I was actually genuinely surprised and few books truly surprise me. I gave 'Me & Emma' four stars instead of five because I thought it was a little slow in areas but then left me hanging at the end.'Me & Emma' reminds me of a movie where you're given subtle bits of information that don't quite piece together until the very end. Upon re-watching the movie, you see and understand it in a different way.'Me & Emma' didn't end when I closed the book. The story is haunting and has left me thinking about it long after I finished reading it. I plan to read other books by Elizabeth Flock."},{"rating":"1","title":"So predictable!","review":"Unfortunately, I realized about 2 chapters in the \\"big plot twist\\" at the end! It is a well written book, and it almost makes the abuse sections all the more devastating, as the narrator is extremely naive in her view of it. I won't give away any spoilers, but I simply couldn't get beyond how obvious it was what was going to be revealed. (I also didn't care for the \\"cloudy\\" nature of the plot climax.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This single word sums up this book better than any long-winded review I've read so far....BRILLIANT!

The book was passed on to me by a co-worker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I was hooked on this book from the second chapter and finished itin 2 days. It was a fabulous easy read. I loved how she describedthe characters so vividly and loved the ending. I am going to gether other book to read next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electrifying secret!","review":"I loved the prose in this book. The perspective of young Carrie as she tries to handle her world, the accuracy and portrayal of a young girl's life was wonderful. I kept reading the novel because the story builds and builds. As a reader you know there is a climax because this young girl cannot continue living in this harsh, unrelenting world where grown-ups are creating a world that is unfair and full of bitterness. BUT the secret that is revealed completely took me by surprise!! WOW! It is well-worth reading for the startling discovery and how it makes you think about the rest of the book! Excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this book because of the great reviews...","review":"...and I was extremely disappointed. First, I agree with many others, the ending was too obvious. I saw it coming from the beginning. I won't delve further because I don't want to ruin it for the people that dare waste their time reading it. Second, the author's attempt to capture Southern dialect is horrible. It's so bad that, in my opinion, it distracts from the flow of the book. Third, Carrie is supposed to be an eight-year old girl, but she has the vocabulary and thought of a twenty something. I know this book is a work of fiction, but if the author wanted the characters to seem real (which I think she did) Carrie's vocabulary didn't fit that of a \\"real\\" eight-year old girl. Finally, overall the book was really, really, really slow until the last 25 pages. If the author wrote the entire book like she did the last 25 pages, I probably would've given the book 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Astonishing Novel","review":"I found this book riveting from the moment I picked it up: beautifully written, elegantly crafted, with characters I cared about deeply. This book is rich, lovely, heartbreaking, and extraordinary. All along I thought \\"this is a really, really good novel.\\" Then I got to the end and I found it just stunning. Liz Flock has written an astonishing novel. I'm flabbergasted by the few negative reviews here. I can't fathom that we read the same book! I loved Me and Emma, and immediately began reading There's Something About my Sister, Flock's newest novel. That, too, is hard to put down, so now I\\"ll go back to reading it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"I loved this book.

A+!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Essential","review":"Even Queen completists can pass up this instrumental CD, which offers cheap-sounding \\"productions\\" of some Queen songs. There's no comparison to the originals, and even the Royal Philharmonic's \\"Classically Queen\\" was better than this low-budget \\"home recording studio\\" sounding collection, which is dominated by tacky synth sounds and obsolete drum machine patterns. One can only hope that the surviving members of Queen had nothing to do with this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"What did you expect?","review":"I think you'll enjoy this offering from LAL, but not for the reasons espoused by other reviewer(s). I think you'll find the music quite basic, the lyrics a bit droll, the production rough, and the vocals garage band chic. I don't think you'll draw lots of clever comparisons with Sonic Youth, the Stones, or Led Zep. In fact, I think Miss Direction owes more to Velvet Underground than any other band, but enough about me.What makes this record worth a listen, worth a buy is that LAL knows that R'n'R is about goofing off and having a hoot, so they go at it. Join 'em."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I cannot believe that I bought these. I agree with the former reviewer that these are not quality-looking at all. This does look like it came out of the dollar store and I have been looking for a place to put them and they look good NOWHERE! I am either going to give them away or just throw them away.

Insipid, un-inspired, pedantic...what can I say. Talk about re-inventing the wheel. Chin up backstreet...these guys pose no threat to the pop landscape. In fact, the fumes from the fake blond highlights on their jaunty little heads only add to the misery of listening to screeching attempts at harmony. But for the 8 year old in all of us...they are cute. Hope that's enough...if not, save 10 quid and go for Moby 18. Sorry....."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT The Starlite Orchestra","review":"Anyone searching for CDs by The Starlite Orchestra, a really fine, small (16 piece) 'big band' sound orchestra, will be disappointed by this one. Not a single song on this CD was actually played by THE Starlite Orchestra I was looking for. They all sound more like some guy on an electronic keyboard. If you're looking for bearable music of a guy playing songs that Frank Sinatra made famous, on an electronic keyboard, it MIGHT be worth a buck. But you will likely be VERY disappointed if you're buying it because you have other CDs by the real Starlite Orchestra, because this CD is either bogus or the guy playing the electronic keyboard on this CD has decided to call himself by the same name. Either way, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle conversion is a disgrace--shame!","review":"Durant's books have been, and will be, read for many years. He is a master historian who knows how to write commanding prose. But truly, what a disgrace this Kindle download is. There is a typographical/conversion error on virtually every page. Some make the text all but incomprehensible.Durant's memory is poorly served with this shabbily done digital conversion. Yes, I confess it's a lot easier to hold in my hand a Kindle or (in my case) an iPad than that heavy 900-page volume, but the conversion is truly reprehensible.Shame on the company who released this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing...","review":"I believe that the reader from Greece summed this feeble attempt at a Georgian-English/English-Georgian lexicon quite well.

It is very rare, perhaps only 10,000 copies were made back in the 70s, but believe it or not, I have seen a new 2003 edition.

Mostly, the acerbic wit of author T. H. White is in evidence as he ridicules all manner of traditions and beliefs. There in neither elephant nor kangaroo in this story. He refers to the lodger and farm wife as 'he the elephant and she the kangaroo' in explaining their repetitive disagreements about things philosophical. Possibly this refers to some known fable or legend which I have not so far been able to discover.A funny book but not an elephant book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Me List the Ways","review":"The concept of this book was interesting. The Archangel Michael relays the coming of the second flood to Mr. White and his not-so-bright companions. Mr. White sets out to build a 20th century Ark out of an overturned barn.While there are some good points to this book, they are quickly overshadowed by pages and pages and pages of lists. The author goes on long winded tangents about what items are in a room, and what has been packed into the makeshift Ark. People in one small town, thinking that Mr. White is some kind of savior, attempt to follow him in makeshift boats. A 313 word sentence is used to describe the various people, their appearances, professions, and other stuff I could care less about. By the time I got near the end of this book, I was just ready for it to be over.If there had been more periods in this book, and less commas, I would have liked it enough to give it 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this CD, I really did","review":"I wanted to like this CD, I really did, but I just couldn't. Andy Griffith is a good singer, who can rattle off those blue-grass songs making them just spring to life. The problem is that in this CD he takes a group of hymns and tries to sing them like he's an opera singer. His voice is good, but doesn't match this style. As such, the songs come off a little irritating, like when you sit in church next to a repressed opera singer.Worse, you'll notice that while the title mentions 25 hymns, there are only 14 tracks here. For each track he sings just a bit of the hymn, leaving you feeling like there should be more but you somehow got ripped off. It's very nice to hear old Andy singing again, and in spite of everything that does make this a pretty fair CD, but that's it, fair = 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Joys of Protestantism","review":"I gave this CD a chance when it first came out. Being a non-Christian, one would wonder why a guy like me would bother with it. But most of the hymns I was familiar with from my Baptist upbringing, and I knew that they could sound nice if sung right. Still, Griffith is not really cut out for this sort of thing. His voice is steady and not that unplesant, but it's just rather dull. You may like it if you are an older person and these songs bring back memories of endless hours of genuflecting in church on Sunday mornings, but apart from that, I see little of real musical value here. May be of use also to musicologists studying the evolution of hymns or something of the sort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Replacement.","review":"I am a chaplain at a Long Term Care Facility in Texas. For the past year I have used this tape twice a week on the Alzheimer's Unit. If these residents can do nothing else, they can still sing the hymns of their childhood. It is both amazing and inspirational to see the joy on their faces when they can recognize something from the past. I have worn out the tape and am replacing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andy Griffith is more than a TV star.","review":"I really enjoy this album and I bought it because I lost the copy I had of it, and I didn't want to be without it.

Professor Van Helsing now finds himself arrested for the murder of the infamous vampire through whose heart he had just driven a stake.\\"Son of Dracula\\" was a great story as well. I am always a little reticent about watching the legendary actors take on the roles of the villains they were not best known for. Lon Chaney, Jr. who is remembered best as the incomparable \\"Wolfman\\", now plays a descendant of Count Dracula, who in my humble opinion has never been played by ANYONE better than Bela Lugosi. However, Lon Chaney, Jr. does indeed do justice to the film because he is an outstanding actor and legend in his own rite. The film is compelling, well acted, and thoroughly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dracula's Daughter A+; Son of Dracula C","review":"Dracula's Daughter is a very nice movie. The plot is solid, and the actors and costumes really shine. The main actors in particular are all impeccable and fabulously adorned. The actors themselves seem to embody the true emotions of their characters. This is much better than the trite and see-through acting of many similar movies from the same time period. Dracula's daughter is also not gory or extremely scary, which seems quaint these days. I would give Dracula's Daughter 5 stars by itself.Son of Dracula is a fun movie for the period, but it doesn't seem overly serious. The acting and scenes are rather desultory - nothing too clever to uncover here. Of course, Son of Dracula is not even the first sequel after Dracula, so this is no surprise. I would give Son of Dracula 3 stars by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"gave it 3 rating because i thought it was the regular strap for guitar good thing a guitar center is on my way one time and bought the regular strap. im using it right now and it looks nice for my acoustic guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"too tight a buttonhole","review":"This strap-holder has been okay once I got it on correctly, but really the buttonhole needs to be a little larger, or the button a little smaller, as it was EXTREMELY difficult to put on.Now that it's on my guitar I intend to keep using it...but I would not buy another for other guitars, it's too much of a pain to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"neat idea","review":"Why didn't I think of this?

Unfortunately, the leather is a little too thin and, even more important, the button is not deep enough for either of my straps. You need a really thin strap to secure it on this.

The other one is still in the package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on function, mediocre looks","review":"I bought this strap button for my Yamaha acoustic guitar after realizing I had no way to attach my new strap. It fits my guitar well. It was a little tricky to button/unbutton, but at least I know it's on securely. I had no problems attaching my Planet Waves woven guitar strap to the button. I haven't tried playing yet, but it doesn't seem like it will interfere with the strings or my hands.The only downside is how it looks on the guitar. The leather seems to be a pretty good quality and it looks nice with my strap and guitar, but it doesn't seem to sit prettily on my guitar. I'm not sure if the loop is a little bigger than my head stock, but the button sits awkwardly off to the side. It's not a huge deal and it doesn't look terrible, it just doesn't look as slick as I thought it would when I purchased it.Overall, I'm pretty happy with my purchase. This strap button will definitely get the job done for me, and that's all I need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for electric guitar","review":"I like to attach ALL of my guitars by the neck/headstock instead of using thetop button, and have just used the typical shoestring in the past, but no more.Once you get this baby on the strap, it is not going anywhere.I have a few of these installed on guitars (and one bass) I play a lot.They (obviously) give a lot more support than a string, and will not dig in tothe finish as a string might.Give it a try, you just may like the way the guitar sits, as you don't get the neckdrop that comes with just attaching to the body of the guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"guitar strap button is not bad at all. i have it on my rogue starter guitar that i bought through amazon and it works just great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me on a slotted headstock Martin","review":"Purchased it to use on a 00-28 slotted headstock Martin and it just didn't fit well for me.

The strap ends are made of leather, and are not \\"light-duty.\\" The end that attaches to the base of my guitar works fine, but the other end would not strap onto the Martin Strap Button.

Your best friend is the one person you connect with and share secrets with but as you grow older the relationship must change or it becomes confining.

Michelle Williams trulyshined, showing her maturity as an actress that belies her Dawson's Creek character. The relationship between Holly and Marina showed how fragile friendship can be as the two characters grew apart but clung to each other out of habit. The scene where Holly finally gains the courage to break from Marina, realizing that they would only destroy each other, and themselves, should they remain friends was realistic instead of over played. The romance between Holly and Nate was also well done. I enjoyed the chemistry between the two actors, the awkwardness, growing awareness and finally the acknowledgement that they were meant to be was great to watch. I truly enjoyed this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Review","review":"I discovered this movie on cable. It is an excellent portrayal of a dysfunctional friendship. The acting between Michele Williams and Anna Friel is very realistic and holds your attention throughout the movie as it depicts their friendship from early teens through parenthood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong performance - strong movie","review":"This movie didn't need big action scenes, headbreaking stunts or a supernatural plot to be good. One should call a motion picture only movie when you are really moved by it. And this one surely is a big movie. Not the classical-tear-jerking-coming-of-age-stuff we're used to.The strength of it comes from the actresses and actors in it. I was astonished to see how good both Friel and Wiliams were able to play the same characters in different stages of their lives. I especially enjoyed Michelle Wiliams performance (I admit, I already liked her a lot before I saw this movie), I never imagined she could be that good and convincing (and with a quiet Brit-accent in her voice).Unfortunately this movie isn't out on sale in Europe yet (...hopefully yet).Cheers,FB."},{"rating":"2","title":"FILM=GOOD....DVD=BAD","review":"I loved this movie when I saw it in the theatreand couldn't wait for it to be released on DVD.But don't believe them when they say \\"widescreen\\"I guess it is in a sorta fakey-letterbox way,but it's obviously not the film's true aspect ratio.The opening credits are, but it promptly switches to the disapointing black bars that really just annoy me more,because it still almost has to pan&scan in some scenes.Either \\"format to fit my screen\\"or give me the movie the way it was shot.Not this crappy inbetween cop-out, damnit.Other than that, the film is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"my thoughts on this movie","review":"I really enjoyed this movie , throughout the movie i was wanting holly and nat to become a couple and i am so happy at the end they did because they overcame all the obstacles even though it took forever.

Then as the days passed, I kept thinking about it and it snuck into my heart. I watched it two more times before returning it to Blockbuster.Every woman who has ever had a best friend or a frenemy will appreciate this movie. I've never seen the dark side of female friendships represented so well. Michelle Williams is Holly, \\"the sweetest girl in all the world.\\" She is an intelligent, shy, overlooked beauty. Her best friend's brother (Oliver Milburn), is absolutely captivating and charming. If you don't fall in love with this movie, you'll fall in love with him. Anna Friel does a capital job as her manipulative best friend. The contrasts between their personalities and the events that unfold are both heartbreaking and heartwarming.Also has a great soundtrack, and it is not your typical chick flick. Even my husband enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"I saw this book in the bookstore several times before I bought it. I thought it might not be that good, even though I love Debra White Smith's books. I ended up buying it one night, and read it within 24 hours! I couldn't put it down, I thought it was great. I had recently watched Pride and Prejudice, and this book was very good. It's similiar enough to remind you of the story, but yet still has it's own twists. I recommend it to anyone, and I can't wait to read the next one in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite modern Austen with a Christian slant","review":"I would only recommend this book for teens or young adults looking for Christian romances. For Jane Austen lovers, or people of other faiths, I'd stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I received this book as a gift because the giver knew what a big fan of P&P; I am. At first glance, the book looked a little cheesy and the synopsis on the back supported that, so I didn't know what I was in for.After reading it in one day, I have to say that I liked it very much! It was an easy read, very believable, and you definitely relate to the characters. It makes me want to find more modern stories like this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money...","review":"I am a fan of all things Jane. I was thrilled when I stumbled upon this series. If only I had known they were \\"Christian Lit\\" I wouldn't have bothered. Nothing against the God-fearing and their books, but the new genre of pop-religious fiction, thinly disguised as chick lit is, quite simply, a waste of trees.I knew the book was doomed from the very first when the heroine (supposedly a literature scholar) is asked for her interpretation of the first line of P&P; (\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\") she replies \\"What Jane Austen is saying...is that when a single man of large fortune moves into a neighborhood, the women in the community will assume he is looking for or in need of a wife-whether he really is or not.\\"(Wow. Thanks for the in-depth educated analysis.)My consolation is that I did not have to pay for these, and can return them to the library from whence they came."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really hoped for better things . . .","review":"I really hoped to enjoy this book more. I forced myself to keep reading several times, hoping for more substance. This book was terrible--too wordy, too predictable, just too much of whatever and not enough of good, crisp writing. However, I must say that I appreciate the Christian values of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read in a long time","review":"This book truly is enjoyable to read. It is just like Jane Austen and is from a Christian perspective. I loved reading it and have read it over and over again. I love jane Austen and debra White Smith's writing style takes you on a romantic journey that is worth reading. I recommend this book as well all the ohthers in the Jane austen series by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Impressions makes a great impression!","review":"I have always loved Jane Austen's novels and Debra White Smith does an awesome job of retelling the story of Pride and Prejudice in a fun, modern way that still stays true to the book. The first time I read the book I couldn't put it down and I have read it many times over since then. It captures the essence of the intricate storyline that Jane Austen created and transforms it into a modern day romance. If you love Jane Austen and if you love romances then you will love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Awesome Book!","review":"Once again, Debra White Smith has proven herself! I enjoyed this book immensely -- and am looking forward to the next one. Please keep writing, because it truly is a ministry for the Lord!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Debra's done it again!","review":"Up until 4 years ago, I hated to read. By chance, I picked up Debra's \\"The Texas Series\\" books and was unable to put them down until I finished the last one. All of Debra White Smith's books make me feel like I am \\"in\\" the book watching what is happening at that very moment. First Impressions is no exception. Debra is a gifted writer who is able to describe every detail to the \\"t\\". She is one of the few writers who is able to keep my attention. I have yet to read one of her books that are \\"cheesy\\". She is a very educated,intelligent and Godly woman and it shows through in her writing. Great Job, Debra!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lessons Learned","review":"Smith deserves credit for taking on the daunting task of writing a modern translation of a classic. The author's purpose is to focus on God more than on Austin, yet still maintains the story line. I used this book and others by Smith, especially her Seven Sisters series, with some clients because of the valuable lessons regarding true identity in each one. It is wonderful to find an author who will take even the non-Christian classics and use them to show people how they can discover who they are to God and how God has a wonderful plan for each life - a plan that can seem quite adventurous at times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasting Impressions","review":"I confess to having an addiction to everything related to 'Pride and Prejudice', and have devoured/endured a number of spin-offs inspired by it. 'First Impressions' stands out as one of the worst offerings I have witnessed to date. The unnecessarily predictable plot is slow to unfold and painfully improbable. To my mind, the writing style is clumsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love Pride and Prejudice -- don't read this!","review":"I found this to be one of the worst \\"spin-offs\\" of Pride and Prejudice I have read. By the way, it wasn't all that great as a modern romance novel either. The characters were cardboard and the writing merely mediocre. I couldn't even bring myself to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capitalizing on Jane Austen's legacy","review":"As an admirer of Jane Austen's genius, it disturbs me that writers like to take her stories and \\"modernise\\" them, or, in this case \\"christianize\\" them. Jane would be appalled. Firstly, she herself was a devout Christian woman, whose father was a minister in their parish. To say that Miss Austen's books are \\"non-Christian\\" and do not convey \\"christian values\\" is simply absurd. Please, do yourself a favor and read the originals before resorting to Ms. White's series. This series is, at its worst, plagiarism, and at its best, nothing more than fanfiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Impressions","review":"First Impressions was the first out of the Austen series that I read, and it was impressive. I loved it. The book kept me moving, I literally couldn't put the book down until I was finished with it. I then went out and bought the rest of the Austen series that were in print. I just love getting lost in these books. It is nice to have romance books that arn't sleezy and that focus on God and his love for us. I am a huge fan of Debra White Smith and would encourage all my friends and family to read her works of art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for P&P Fans","review":"In a way this book is predictable, because you know the P&P plot, but with the modern retelling, I loved wondering how the author was going to craft each relationship and conflict. The way the author weaves the modern story into the script from the original is fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great story!","review":"I really enjoyed First Impressions. The characters were fun and so human. The story centers around Dave and Eddi, but I enjoyed the secondary characters too, such as Eddi's two sisters, Jenny and Linda (who were soooo opposite)! I also enjoyed Calvin (Dave's very good friend). You'll love how Dave resolves the situation between Linda and Rick! What does that mean???? I say get the book and find out! You will enjoy it. I can't wait to read Reason and Romance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't able to finish it","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did, but the author's writing style and choice of descriptive words distracted me from the story. There were too many \\"Like a\\", and \\"As ifs\\", which are fine when inserted discreetly once in awhile, but become overkill when used in every other paragraph.The description of the tornado was distracting at best. The author used the following words, all within a few pages: \\"a white-tailed monster\\", \\"demonic dragon\\", \\"beast\\", \\"snowy tornado\\", \\"devil\\", \\"gyrating monster\\", vacuumous spiral\\", \\"serpent\\", \\"ghastly specter\\", \\"capricious adolescent\\" and \\"white vortex\\". It was too much.I read parts aloud to my husband and we shook our heads and just groaned at the choice of wording. I can not commend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Read","review":"As an ardent fan of Jane Austen, I approached this novel with caution and a little bit of interest. As a young Christian woman, I approached this with a lot of doubt seeing as how I usually cringe at the sappy love-stories that evolve and drown you in modern Christian novels. Having said that, First Impressions turned out to be a lovely surprise! It was a light read, nothing too heavy on the soul, subtly humorous, and very enjoyable. I loved the nuances of Pride and Prejudice that fit into the story and its characters, as well as the pace that was set. There was no unnecessary gabble that went on or drawn out description. Mind you, there were parts that one could possibly call a bit sappy, but they turned into endearing elements of the characters. I would highly recommend this book for young girls (especially those who have already been acquainted with Pride and Prejudice)."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes, what is the song?","review":"Excellent soundtrack, like everyone says. But mainly I want to reiterate the question that's already been posed: What is the song that plays during the dvd menu? If you or someone you know wrote that song, I would be happy to pay for a copy of it.Someone suggested the song is \\"L'amour à 3\\" by Stereo Total. It is not. Probably someone from the band Stereo Total wrote that, because it's not even close.Please--if you know where to get a copy of this song, the song on the dvd menu, make us all happy and share the love."},{"rating":"2","title":"music makes the movie","review":"There are some movies in which the music makes the movie, and would not be as great without the soundtrack. I <3 the Huckabees, Garden State, and essentially The Dreamers. From the begining (screen of the play menu on the dvd) in which a song plays in the background, the music is an essential part of this movie. It made the movie a completely different enviroment.

When someone talks about a child being 'bad', I find it irritating, but for an author to focus on words like 'naughty', 'bad', 'nice' in a book that is supposed to teach children about having making choices that truly please God, is the essence of talking down to a child. Even a three-year old can handle more descriptive adjectives than that.The spanking thing bugged me too. Why is this the first resource to turn to when a child does something wrong?That said, my three-year old loves the book because the lessons are short and work for him. We haven't skipped any of them, but sometimes I move quickly through the ones I like least.A book I liked a lot more is \\"20 Bible Verses Every Child Should Know\\". Both kids (and mom) loved it, but you can only read any devotional book so many times..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Maritime Photo Portfolio","review":"This is a gorgeous collection of maritime photographs. You neither need be from Maine nor be a photographer to appreciate the stunning beauty of the windjammers and lighthouses that Mr. Chillemi has so artfully captured in these photographs. The pictures are left to speak for themselves, with little commentary from the photographer at all, and absolutely no technical photography jargon; however, the introduction provides some insight into the joys and challenges experienced and some basic techniques employed while capturing these magnificent subjects on film. After admiring these pictures, I had a strong urge to get in my car and head \\"down east\\" to the Maine coastline myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got what I paid for. A cheap DVD player that is collecting dust in my garage.","review":"The sound levels are way too high out of the speaker connections and way too low out of the audio out. At the lowest volume level the speakers were still above conversational volume. When muted I could still hear them. The line out is more like a pre-out, even at the highest volume level my tv didn't produce sound above conversational level. The video out was also poor qualityI took it out as soon as I had it mounted and all the connections made, then bought a JVC KDDV6200 from Sears.

I visited that exhibit and purchased this book at that time. It's been very difficult to find another copy in the intervening years.John Simon wrote a pithy and excellent introduction to this volume, and Barber continues on with his own narrative, which is surprisingly well-written, accurate and even witty at times.

I wanted to like it, and bought it because it is set in England in the 600s, an intriguing time about which little is written. However, the author needs to learn her craft. Such phrases as \\"she gazed into the deep profound depths\\" is an example of the sloppy writing. And I don't think I've ever read a book that has such awful point of view problems. The author flips from the mind of one character to another, sometimes several characters in one paragraph -- which makes for disjointed and unelegant prose. Although I'm sure her research was extensive, her abilities as a writer are not up to the task. If this book was edited, it certainly doesn't show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it...","review":"I had to buy this twice for my daughter since her number is 23 on her basketball jersey.She lost the first one.

Unfortunately, being the best DBZ movie isn't saying much. However, as far as the single-mindedness of the DBZ movies go, this is the most entertaining. Since it was released in America at the height of the DBZ craze, it benefits from probably the highest production values. Most notably, the music. It features music from Disturbed and Deftones, which are implemented well.Fun Fact:Even the edited version of Lord Slug that was shown on Adult Swim featured the Uncut version of a Disturbed song, so the F-Word was actually on Cartoon Network.

Perhaps fewer heroines would have improved the plot, as it was a little confusing to be constantly switching viewpoints and plot threads.

Missing is the element one most looks forward to on a Keaggy album - his guitar. His guitar work has become subordinate to his singing. Now, don't get me wrong, I love Keaggy's voice, but it is WHAT he is singing here that is most distressing. Many of these songs were co-written by Alan Shackrock, and they are mostly a theologically incorrect muddle of cliches. They are not mature songs, but songs you would expect from artists of lesser value. Very little is worth saving on this album, and the use of a drum machine as well as extensive use of Shackrock's songs is unfortunate. A total mess of an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, effective.","review":"Loved it so much for my one foot's Plantar's Fasciitis, that I got another one to keep my other foot healthy as well.

Westinghouse said they authorized BB to fix it. BB said I had to send it back to CA from NC. Westinghouse said ok to send it, which I did. Two weeks after they received it, they could/would not tell me the status, saying there was nothing in their database yet, but they would send an email and let me know. A week later I got the same run around, with a supervisor telling me she could/would not call the repair facility to find out the status (still nothing in their database).

I watched the video to determine if I could just omit the meditation at the beginning and work from there and the cardio part seems very energetic, possibly fun and is maybe something I can do, but I was disappointed with the lack of description of the moves prior to going into them. The moves are all thrown together making it easy to get lost in transition. The routine contains so many different moves as well that it is so easy to get confused for a beginner or someone who has not completely memorized the entire routine. This makes working out with this DVD pointless since you are unable to follow the moves. It was very annoying to say the least and I am not sure that I am even going to attempt it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout but not burlesque","review":"This is my second YBB workout and it certainly gets my sweat going.

I can't say that it really lived up to my expectations regarding the actual moves but the workout was fun and energizing.

Unfortunately, it turned out that the reception was actually worse with this antenna than with the old-school UHF antenna which I inherited with me house.My impression of the Terk antenna is that it looks nice but feels a bit cheap. (It is extremely lightweight.) Installation was a breeze and there are tons of options to choose from in terms of mounting locations.The return process was easy--as always with Amazon. Someone said you can't close the sides of the antenna once you open them, but this is not true. If you look close to the hinge point you will see the word \\"PUSH\\". If you push there, it will release the arms and allow them to be closed.I ended up getting those missing channels by purchasing a Motorola signal amplifier. You can find that on Amazon too and it is amazing. I'm cancelling my cable at the end of the month!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Antenna","review":"I live 35+ miles from towers, most of which are roughly the same direction - within 15 degrees. Installation was easy - as high as I could get it on outside of house. Amplifier has a tiny switch - make sure you don't miss it. I pick up about 25 extra channels, but many are useless...weak signal, foreign language, religous, and duplicate channels. There's also channels that Dish doesn't know about so they show up in the program guide without any programming info. About 12 are worthwhile and 6 or 7 of those are HD. This includes \\"blue\\" signals. I was surprised that some channels are coming from nearly opposite direction - must be reflected. Once in a while, especially in windy weather, my signal strength goes down on all over-the-air channels and occasionally I lose the signal all together - a bit irritating. This is the first and only antenna I've tried so I can't compare to others, but overall, I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Rabbit Ears First....","review":"I bought this because I'm about 25 miles from the OTA HD stations.

The amplifier works well but requires a power source, which I did not have on my roof. I have since relocated the antenna inside my attic and have had good performance.

Terk quality and ease of installation is there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately Worth Buying","review":"Before buying this antenna, I relied on a small, amplified indoor antenna above my TV. I live in a rural area about 2-15 miles from the broadcast towers in the Baton Rouge area. I would often have to move the antenna to pick up different stations. The combination of a metal roof, chimney, and large trees were hampering my reception.Upon receiving the Terk HDTV, I hooked it up next to my indoor antenna. The signal strength went from half to full strength. I did not have to move the antenna to pick up all of the stations and my ice-maker and other electronic devices no longer interfered with the reception.I am so impressed with the difference that I am no longer planning to mount it to my chimney and instead will mount it in my attic to protect it from the elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after 2 months","review":"One of the arms broke after 2 months on the side of our house.

I'm in Southern California, about 60 miles from Mt. Wilson and get all channels at about 90% signal strength. In fact, when I first unboxed it before I had a chance to put it up, I had it sitting on a chair in the living room and it even worked well that way. I'm sure this thing would work in a closet or attic. This is a very well engineered product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"I am very happy with this antenna. Wanted to get rid of our expensive satellite bill and this works just great for the local channels. We get over 74 local channels in the Los Angeles area with this, even the ones listed as violet on antennaweb. I love that it is so low profile verses the larger antennas.

I also bought a Phillip's multi directional HD antenna that had more channels than the Terk HDtv.. The Terk HDtv is very uni directional if a fly lands on it then you are out of luck..LOL!!!For the price of the Terk HDtv you can buy two of the Phillip's HDtv and i had great reception.

It depends on location location location."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Antenna - Very Directional","review":"I decided to ditch cable and go with OTA programming instead, and with the DTV switch over coming I wanted a good antenna to get the most out of this process.PROS - Worked as described, pulled in great reception on all channels antennaweb.org said I should be able to receiveCONS - You really have to point it accurately, I shouldn't complain, it's sold as a directional antenna, and it lives up to it's name, but with the help of a compass, and a little nudging, it soon pointed in the right direction, and gave a great picture.The side bars for me almost stopped me from getting it to the right angle, they are a lot wider than they seem in the picture, and they seem quite wide in that. Make sure if purchasing this, that the location you intend to mount this on, won't require the antenna to be pointed too much to the side, or it'll get stuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Receiver for blue zone","review":"We live over 30 miles from the city and the reception was very good. Mostly blue zone. We even got a very good signal reception from a few stations in the opposite direction (about 15 miles), 180 degrees, which we were not expecting. Very glad we didn't purchase the rotator which we didn't even need. Amazing product for such a small item.

It brought in a vast number of extremely clear channels too! In fact, most people..even professionals in the electronic business, were amazed with its performance!The price was very reasonable, which was a big plus.We have recently restored an old Airstream travel trailer and we just ordered another Terk HDTV antenna to install on it!We HIGHLY recommend this antenna and believe that you will be more than pleased with the price and the reception. We feel it is a great bargain.(we're actually going to get another one for a Christmas gift for one of our children that can't afford the cost of cable/dish).Rosemary and Art from FL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I'm getting all the available stations.

There was always something not right. This one is my best ever. I have installed it on my roof. Its low design makes it barely visible from the street. I live in the middle of the San Francisco peninsula. Signal reception reported by my TV was 50~85% with my previous antenna it replaced. It is now 92~95%! Since digital television, and with a new high quality flat screen TV, I do not feel the need to pay for cable and satellite TV. Reception of HD broadcast is as good as Blu-Ray.

I bought one for my condo and the other one for my brother as a gift. It has good reception and I was able to view about 48 channels that I could see very clearly. Orientation of any antenna is important if you want to able to view must of the channels available in your area. It was very easy to put together right out the box and installation was easy too. You got to have some basic tools to do this. I have owned mine for few months now and so far it has performed well. My brother is not having any issues either.Fcoram72"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good outdoor antenna","review":"We bought the HDTV converter box first and used it with the antenna we had which was in the upstairs of our house. We got several more channels but had a problem with the digital signal coming and going. I ordered the Terk antenna and my husband installed it at the top peak of the outside of our house. We haven't had any problem with the digital signal coming and going like it had before. We aimed the antenna the direction of most of the stations but on some days we even get a few channels from the opposite direction, almost 50 miles away. I chose this antenna because of the reviews I had read online and so far I am happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Antenna","review":"Bought this so we'd receive digital tv.

Some extra channels come in as well. I live approx. 30 miles from baltimore and washington, near frederick Maryland. I am now considering an antenna rotator to go with it. I will probably get many more channels then.Great product. Not sure what weather will do to it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"works okay.","review":"I bought this to replace a Terk TV55 that couldn't receive a strong enough signal to get one DTV station in our area. All the transmitters are located in the same direction here, so this works fine. It's mounted in the attic and pulls in the one station that I couldn't get with the TV55. If the transmitters in your area aren't all in the same direction from your house, this isn't the antenna for you. Also, our transmitters are only 15 miles away, so I can't comment on how it'd work at greater distances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stung for the first time.","review":"Antenna did not live up to it's billing.

Two points about this version. 1) It is a great contemporary country song, as good or better than most of what's out there. 2) I find Allison Moorer's more complex voice a better counterpoint to Kid Rock's vocals than Sheryl's, especially set against a more country arrangement. This is no knock on Sheryl Crow. She is a very talent woman who deserves the accolades she receives.

So as long as you aren't expecting anything other than the show itself, you won't be disappointed. The picture quality is the same as when it first aired on television. Other than that, the DVD's came out fine, just check to make sure nothing is wrong with the discs as some of them tend to shift during shipping.I have heard that if you can afford it, get another country's version of the sets, such as the Canadian version, because it has better picture quality and it actually has extras on the DVD's.

Its a simple matter to check & frankly makes me wonder what else suffered from laziness on this release. (David Marciano only guest starred a couple of times in the season).Also, it would be nice if the amazon editors would actually list the episodes included on this release. Thankfully other reviewers give enough hints to figure out how this differs from the Canadian release (series 3 & 4) of the same episodes.

After a pair of lackluster albums and a mediocre, yet overlooked, effort in between, Bis slips in a surprise before his upcoming spring release, and it's straight perfection. Both firepower AND skills are up to par on this outing. Bis has his energy back, spits flame over beats that can finally keep up with him, and comes off with the best album of the year, hands down.

Overall I can only say I'm looking for someone who can learn some great techniques for use in a church setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sumptuous and sacred","review":"Duquesne's collection of world-renowned masterpieces depicting the life stages of the Blessed Virgin Mary and accompanied by his well-crafted essay is a delight to the eye as well as the theological mind. He begins with the story of her parents, Sts. Joachim and Anne, and chronicles Mary's life through her death, Assumption into heaven, and, finally, her magesterial role in Christianity.The paintings by famed painters such as Caravaggio, Raphael, and Michelangelo, are neatly paired with works of lesser-known artists, such as Pierre Prud'hon, Simone Martini, and Jan Provost (at least, the latter three were unknown to me until I beheld this tome). Duquesne's script is theologically sound and full of interesting Marian facts, delivered in a reverential but not pietistic tone. I enjoyed this book tremendously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch in all respects","review":"I am a huge fan of Steven's, but if I were really pressed to choose a favorite of his albums, edging just ahead of \\"For the Sake of the Call\\" and \\"More to This Life\\" would be this album, \\"Heaven in the Real World\\". What incredible messages! The CD is literally fantastic, start to finish. The song \\"Miracle of Mercy\\" touched me and spoke to me like no other song, and to this day, when I play it, I can never just listen to it once. By all means, put this one in your shopping cart!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of SCC's best.","review":"In my opinion, this is one of Steven Curtis Chapman's best albums.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steven Curtis Chapman \\"Heaven In The Real World\\"","review":"I think it's the beginning of his best work musically, lyrically, messagecally... in it's message.

Sort of...","review":"Based on the title of this book, you would think it would have some real content. After reading the first part of this book, I was deeply disappointed. I think this book is great for project managers who want to learn the development side of the J2EE technology. But for developers/engineers, it is a complete waste of time. Although the author does touch on every subject associated with J2EE he fails to connect all the dots. Explaining Java servlets and JSP, as one example, was a good start but there is nothing about how they work with each other. There arent very many examples either, but the ones that do exist, get right to the point and explain the subject matter appropriately. Too bad that isnt enough to make it more than a 2 star book. Glad I didnt pay full price for it (bought a used copy for $6 - barely makes it worth it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book","review":"I have read hundreds of technical computer books and I own many of them, so I can judge very well if a book is worthwhile. \\"J2EE: The Complete Reference\\" by Jim Keogh is the \\"WORST\\" book I have ever read.

Avoid this book and do not waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"After reading all the reviews about this book i decided to buy it from amazon.

No code sample, no usage... If I was searching for list of classes and methods, the Sun documentation available online is more than good.I have not yet seen a really good J2EE book, even because I haven't read so many, but the Sun's tutorial looks very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"an Overview of J2EE API reference","review":"Mostly of the pages of the book are API Reference. The first half of the book didn't teach you any J2EE core thing, it just provide basic material such as SQL and HTML etc. I think most of the people already know that when buying book for enterpise system. The other half of the book is just an overview of J2EE. You must not be able to write J2EE applicaton or even understand J2EE after reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be \\"0 star\\" book.","review":"This is a worst book I have been read.

It covers a lot of topics, but none of them well. For example, EJBs are covered briefly. It does not mention any EJB patterns, any pitfalls in the EJB design. Even basics are not covered that well. Basically, this book is probably a good thing if you want to prepare for the job interview or want to quickly brush up on some basic J2EE concepts. It's is not a good book to really learn J2EE architecture and implementation details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor review","review":"I don't usually write reviews but this book seems to have collected some unwarrented high reviews.If you expect to learn J2EE, buy something else. The JSP and Servlet sections (which I already have experience) are incomplete enough to mislead you in the wrong direction. As for the EJB section (I have no experience), I know I will not be able to use this manual to learn.When I purchased this I was in a hurry. I now regret my haste. Do yourself a favour and by something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a disappointing book. Avoid it !","review":"Just can't understand why the rating of this book is so high.

In the late nineteenth century only the wealthiest, or most desperate people traveled far from their place of birth. For everyone else, Lafcadio Hearn wrote beautifully descriptive prose describing people, flora and fauna of exotic places. In this collection, Hearn takes the dry translations of missionaries, and scholarly writing about China, and transforms the original documents into six exotic and very beautiful fairy tales. Hearn calls them ghost stories, but they have far more in common with Arthur Rackham than with M.R. James.The language in these stories is vivid, almost baroque, with wonderful images of shifting, delicate colors and exotic locations.People who love this short book, will probably love his book about his experiences in the Caribbean, as well as his wonderful stories from Japan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been better","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this book. I had such high expectations for it! I like it when a series updates the readers on the past heroes and heriones. How are Jenise and 'Adeanne' getting on with the children? You know stuff like that.

I will read the other books in this series, but only because I loved the previous ones - this one not so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only particial story","review":"I was very disappointed that this book only has part of the story.

I was looking forward to a good read and this disappointed me. I bugged my husband to get this book for me and did not expect the rambling of the story. It was too short for my liking as well. To me this was good money and time wasted. The other parts of this book did not make up for what the story lacked. My husband got the next one for me without my knowing and it was just as disappointing as this one was. I really enjoyed the first 3 of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the cover???","review":"Now I'm just curious as to why anyone would look at this book and think it could possibly be good? I'm not one to judge books by their covers generally, but come one! This is a crime against not only Photoshop, but nature as well! This is the single weirdest, creepiest thing I've ever seen. I wish I could clean this image out of my brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled potential","review":"I love the Rejar series, but this story was dull. It had all the makings of a fantastic novel, but it never really took off. The love story between Soosha and Daxan was sketchy and contrived.

I had never seen some of the early shows, including the opener. Now it all makes SENSE!!!Its nice having this series on DVD, but there was no remastering done in the transfer. Thats a shame cause some of the blips on the screen are a little distracting, they could have at least cleaned up the Dallas intro for crying out loud.But this show has stood the test of time and the characters are just as interesting today as they were 30 years ago. Very entertaining, nice boxed package with some extras like commentary by Larry Hagman that is worth checking out.

Eathan Cooper's story,told from the mind of the central character, the successful CEO of a large bank, immerses the reader in his stratagies and relationships as he leads the bank through a major and risky real estate deal, manipulating people and relationships as he goes.

Highly recommended to those trying to move up the corporate ladder."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Control is a Compelling Read","review":"In Control's Harry Kramer is a new star in the fictional corporate villain hall of fame. He is a hateful, but absolutely absorbing character. I take comfort in knowing that business is not completely dominated by men like Harry Kramer. But I have met some of the Harry Kramers of this world and In Control's protagonist is a chilling distillation of their worst and most fascinating traits. Still, I must say that I enjoyed the ride almost as much as I enjoyed the story's skillful and dramatic conclusion. Author Ethan Cooper's understanding of corporate jungle warfare is profound."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable character in a fascinating business story.","review":"At the corporations where I have worked, the people who rise to the top are a lot like Harry Kramer, the protagonist of In Control. These people are attractive, shrewd, competitive, and narcissistic. At the same time, you feel a certain grudging admiration for such characters who do more good than harm while creating a world with themselves at the center. In Control captures this type of character perfectly while telling a gripping business drama that is resolved -- brilliantly and unexpectedly -- in the final chapter. Personally, I admire Harry Kramer. I also think there is a lot of pain and sadness in his life, which his ambitions force him to create or endure. He is a complicated and unforgettable man, but probably as familiar to most readers as the person in the corner office. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, very weak","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews on this site and was very disappointed.

Kramer is a cunning, manipulative and vain man who enjoys the status he has acquired and looks down on lesser mortals - but yet he has a certain charisma which engages the reader's sympathy. He has climbed the greasy pole and fully intends to stay on top but a cloud appears on the horizon in the form of a downturn in the property market in which the bank is over-extended.

Nor do I usually like jazz/rock. So I'm really suprised at how much I've enjoyed this disc.I think it's primarily because alto sax and saxello player Elton Dean finds himself in a context where his innate melodicism comes to the fore and his declamatory, expressivist tendencies are properly situated. For me, this constitutes his finest playing on record, and I've heard him in quite a lot of settings, including lots of his recent extended avant-garde outings.Holdsworth, too, seems more interested in melodic and rhythmic nuance than mere pyrotechnics. The other players, Hugh Hopper (bass) and John Marshall (drums) consistently provide engaging rhythmic support. Not revolutionary but hugely satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"very comforting and easy to read","review":"This book was extremely comforting to me after the loss of my wonderful fiancee.

Rabbi Goldie Milgram is a very creative and original teacher who delights in sharing a myriad of personal experiences.

As a straight, single young man (now a straight, married and not so young father), I fondly remember this film as being honest and humane, with three characters I cared about. I'm appalled that other reviewers recall the gay kiss as being greeted with hostility and derision by other filmgoers (why were they there, and what were they afraid of?) I can see how some people feel this film fell between two stools (too reticent for gays, too gay for straights) but it had a freshness and honesty matched only, in my viewing experience, by Taxi Zum Klo (a much more explicit gay film, but equal in its humanity). I'd be happy to own this film on DVD and I'm heartened by other reviewers' accounts of how much this film means to them personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIMELY. TRUTHFUL, POIGNANT","review":"I saw this movie when I was just 18 years old. I immediately related myself to the story. The acting of the main stars are exceptional and the movie portrayed each characters' roles with stark realism. The gay roles breathed life to the truth that we are here and not just punching bags for ridicule.I wish they could make movies with gay theme similar to the sincerity that \\"Making Love\\" was able to successfully portray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally on DVD - it's about time","review":"I am a gay male and I highly recommend this movie. I enjoyed seeing it very much when it first came out and have been waiting for it's DVD release. Sure, it's a romantic (and antiseptic) film - probably get a PG rating today. But the story is just as valid today as it was in 1982. What happens in a marriage when one of the partners falls out of love - or falls in love with someone else? That, in a nutshell, is the plot. The cast is just fine; no great fireworks are required. Michael is fine as the bewildered husband, Kate has probably the best role of her career, and Harry is young and handsome. If you watch this movie (and I hope you will), the ending is very moving and effecting. It's a tear-jerker, but a little real emotion never hurt anyone.And, any movie with Wendy Hiller can't be all bad, can it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done. A moving, well-acted film","review":"I remember seeing this when it first came out. Actually, I was first coming out areound the same time and I was terrified. Anyway, I remember seeing the ads on TV and I went to see it one afternoon -- and I skipped school to do it. Maybe it is because the film came out at an important time in my life, but I do have a special place in my heart for it. Kate Jackson is wonderful in this. I have never seen her in the same way since. Both Ontkean and Hamlin are great in their roles (and kudos to them for doing this risky film.) Today, it is dated in some ways - but the story itself is still very relevant. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making Love Scene Completely Cut","review":"I saw this movie in the theater some almost 30 years ago with my then partner and I definately remember the Love Making scene being hot and heavy though heavily shadowed in darkness. But the scene is completely gone in the DVD, as well as the kiss. Now why in the world would they cut that out!!!??? That was the whole point of going to see the movie at that time, it was on the cutting edge. One star because you screwed with the whole point of the movie \\"Making Love\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Customer REVIEW for \\"Making Love\\"","review":"Since this movie was made so long ago, I was able to overlook the incessant homosexual stereotypes that seem to be a staple of this movie's many sub-plots. All in all, the movie was excellent compared to the overabundant, trashy gay-themed movies being cranked out over the last 5 years. The story was very common to most of us in the male gay community, the outgoing and out-of-the-closet typical token gay meets the straight, married and confused bi-curious(?) man... a strained and exciting affair begins and ends, etc. etc. ... Kate Jackson's performance was mediocre at best, completely eclipsed by the mere site of Michael Ontkean and Harry Hamlins gorgeous bodies and manliness devouring eachother in the several erotic scenes that appear to be only moderately edited. A GREAT MOVIE OVERALL, i recommend if the price is right, BUIY IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Making Love by any other name","review":"I remember seeing this movie many years ago on TV. Of course, I wondered what was left out. When I saw it was on DVD, I ordered it. The movie was well scripted and well acted. It may not be true to life, but it is worth watching. It depicts how gay flings can break up heterosexual marriages. I would highly recommend this movie especially if you like Harry Hamlin, Michael Ontkean, and Kate Jackson. All three are good actors and make it real and believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Movie, Sad, But True.","review":"It wasn't perfect in a sense that they were Gay, but these things happen all the time in everyday life of people.

It's a interesting movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???","review":"I really don't understand how people can compare this third- rate movie with a masterpiece like \\"Brokeback Mountain\\". Dull plot, less than average acting (Michael Ontkean is particularly awful in his role, and he is the main character in the movie, so...), and situations full of cliches. I would recommend it only for historical reasons as the first mainstream Hollywood movie to openly address the topic of gay relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I completely agree with Davis below . this movie had the same impact on me.....and helped me from making some big mistakes .....such as trying to be straight......it showed me that there was a way of self respect and, yes, pride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making Love","review":"Saw this movie back in 1982-when was first released in theaters,then bought when it,was released the video market in Beta and VHS formats,now updating my video collection in DVD.Liked it then(memories when first came out-publicly)and Still would enjoy viewing it today and fortunate to have it among my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks depth but ok for learning to program EAs","review":"This book is poorly structured and lacks depth. It trivialises aspects of EAs, especially representational issues. I understand the emphasis is on teaching the reader how to program GAs using mathematica but I would not recommend this book as an introduction to GAs. The visualisation aspects of Mathematica applied to EAs are useful, but I would definitely recommend Melanie Mitchell's Introduction to Genetic Algorithms or one of Koza's books for those interested in GP."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful portrait","review":"Elegant filmmaking, surprising storytelling, this film succeeds on every level.

The sword was Epic. Very well made with a lot of details.Cons: Unfortunately when I opened the box and took Cloud out his leg fell off right away. All my excitement just went downhill after I saw his leg fell off like it was already broken before someone put him into the box. Perhaps my action figure was just a defect out of the hundreds out there, but with his right leg broken I can only super glue his leg back and can't pose him in any cool pose or any sort of pose. Also one of his arms couldn't fit into the socket very well which affected Cloud's ability to hold the sword properly.Overall: Amazing action figure but poorly designed. If his leg wouldn't have came off right at the moment I took the action figure out then I would of given this review a 5 stars. However His right leg broke off the moment I took him out of the box therefore I give this action figure a 2/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"roy scheider","review":"This is a classic movie that is never played on television, so I just had to have it in my collection.

This is truly one of the great car chases in movie history and it seems to go on forever. In reality, any cop who conducts this kind of chase would be severely disciplined for endangerment, but hey, that's entertainment! Take away the chase and the movie isn't really very good, but there are some nice gritty shots of NY. A good deal of the cast and crew is recycled from the French Connection, an infinitely better film. Worth seeing once. If you're on a time budget, scan directly to the chase and get on w/ your life...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Seven-Ups","review":"The Seven-Ups is a bit slow-paced at times especially at the start,but once it gets to it's key moments that I happen to like then it really kicks up,the Best Part of the Whole Movie is the Car Chase(which I dare say is Better than Bullitt seeing as there are two GM products,both 1973 Pontiacs one is a Grand Ville 4 Door Sedan driven by the Baddies as they say or the BadGuys the other a Pontiac Ventura which is basically A Chevy Nova,there was also a Buick version: Apollo and The Oldsmobile Omega.)This Movie ranks up there with Corvette Summer(Favorite),Stingray(1978 Movie-favorite)Bullitt,Smokey&TheBandit1&2(3,out of sympathy)and of course another Favorite \\"The Driver\\".If your into GM especially Pontiacs you need to watch the movie, as for the acting it is Superb,the plot is great.But the Chase is what did it for me,and the rest of the movie is just icing."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY INTENSE POLICE DRAMA.......AWESOME!","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST!

Plenty of exciting action in this film. The film contains one of the best car chase scenes of all time. The viewer is just glued to the TV watching this entire chase. This movie was released in 1973 so that many of the special effects were done with stunt actors and not so much with computer special effects. I see this as a plus back to an earlier time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his faves","review":"I bought this DVD for my boyfriend because he is a huge car chase fan.

Roy Schieder is very good in this film. It has turned into a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, straightforward tale","review":"This movie, along with its companion piece The Super Cops, gives you a taste of NYC in the 1970s. While neither are big budget blockbusters like The French Connection & Serpico, both get their storytelling job done efficiently & in a way that'll sitck in your mind for its spareness. I recommend that you buy French Connection & Serpico along with this film & Super Cops, then get The Panic In Needle Park & the first Death Wish, & lastly The Anderson Tapes & Dog Day Afternoon. That collection will allow you to see how bad life was back then in The Big Apple from 3 perspectives (Law enforcement, citizen, & criminal) & how much things have improved by comparison. Not perfect by any stretch, but WAY better than it was, & as a buddy of mine from the Bronx said: \\"As bad as things were, we could always say that @ least it wasn't like New Jersey & Detroit......YET!\\", then he'd smile, & that smile made me glad I was living in Oakland/California @ the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the car chase","review":"OK, this is a long slow 70's French Connection type movie, and like the French Connection, (for me) it's memorable for a car chase (Bullit falls in this same category). I don't know if it's an urban legend but I heard a stunt driver died making that car crash). For me the only good part of the movie but worth it is for the CAR CHASE SCENE! I have no idea what the print quality is, but it's nice to see this out on DVD. Think I'll look for that car chase scene posted online because it's good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"A standard and straightforward cops and bad guys movie without too many twists. 1973 NYC, a very suspenseful soundtrack, car chases/foot chases, and Roy Scheider are all points of interest. Fans of any of the above may find it worthwhile. I kind of liked it though it never reaches greatness. It's a step down but similar in tone to the French Connection. Not bad Ebert. But I wouldn't call it a 'must-see' either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Performance, Good Buy","review":"I bought this at [local store] at a reduce price... The performance was not at Fürtwangler standards, but good, and excellent considering the price.Giya Assatiani solos in the 4th movement were good, crystal clear, with what seemed like forceful projection. The 2nd and 4th movements, my favorites in the 9th, were just right. I've heard some recordings of this standard which seemed a little washed out, but this one is better than many selling for much more money.I've bought several of the HDC recordings for listening at work. The series appears to be recordings from various orchestras in the former Soviet Union.Note that these comments are all from hearing the album played on a PC sound card with company-issue headphones...a real sound system will probably give better results. However, for the price, it's a good buy for my purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"Sleepy LaBeef is a great performer and has cut some fine tracks but he has also recorded a lot of dreck.

I've had the privalige of meeting Dug, Ty and Jerry, and I can promise you that is exactly what they are. I'm glad they put this together, and its a must for serious fans of King's X."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lay Back and Enjoy","review":"I keep thinking that one day I am going to buy a Piazzolla CD which is terrible, but that has yet to happen. Armaguedon is another pleasant surprise dredged from the depths of the sales rankings. One of three Piazzolla movie soundtracks published by ANS records, Armaguedon is composed mostly of a bunch of musical snippets as befits a soundtrack. The music is smooth, romantic and has a very European, dare I say French, feel to it. And it flows effortlessly as well from one track to the other without any jarring dissonance. My favorite tracks are Panique au Theatre and the vocal Chanson pour un Homme Triste. The vocalist is not named in the insufficient liner notes, but her voice has a haunting quality to it. Too bad all movie soundtracks can't be as well done as this one, the only thing that keeps it from five stars is its brevity. This one is great for laying back with a loved one and a bottle of wine. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to understand","review":"I found this book quite difficult to understand. It has too much jargon, and the instructions to the games are sometimes unclear.

The acting was stilted. Scenes didn't link together well, and some made no sense as to why they were included. Then suddenly there's miracles galore (sarcasm), but they had to wrap up the film in 10 minutes. A women has a 60 second labor, not likely for a first-time mother. The new father vows to quit his high-paying soap opera gig in order to focus on his wife and kid. That's nice, but you jettisoned your income source just when family expenses are going to increase. That's irresponsible and immature. This is the director's idea of a good father? Everybody resolves to do better in the last 5 minutes, despite months' and even years' worth of issues building up. Unrealistic.

It told the tale of three married couples and their problems mixing marriage and life's problems. I wish it would have emphasized more how these couples took their relationship problems to the cross. However, I have witnessed couples face problems not a lot different than the ones shown here. This movie emphasizes how important it is to be committed to each other and how to work toward solving problems, rather than to look at divorce as the answer. Anyone going thru a divorce knows how devastating it is for both partners for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"If you are looking for funny family entertainment look no further.

All the charactors were well developed and secondary charactors like Bradwarden the centaur had a special spark to them, and were not just filler charactors. The PLot made sense and was cohesive throughout the book. So another hit for Salvatore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I didnt like this Book. I found it boring like a cooking book.

This book was what he's known for, but I was expecting alittle less Drizzt here. This is the only reason that I didn't give it five stars. The story is exceptional, I love the fighting monk school and Avelyn was a strong supporting character. I didn't expect him to die in the end, but who knows that he's really dead. Bradwarden was another good supporting character and I didn't expect him to die either, but who knows what the rest of the plot will bring. If we have characters like these that pass away in the beginning of the series, then what other characters are in store for us to find. I look forward to reading the rest of the series and am even eager to read the silent blade due out in just a few short months.

After I read it i wanted to put it in the toilet and go to the bathroom on it. This book has no plot, characters with no originality, and the battle descriptions that I've always relied on Salvatore to write with such quality were nonexistent in this book. This was a pathetic excuse of literature. Salvatore was trying to write about little childrens' fantasies that have to do with a purple toad jumping onto a green lillipad with a fork on it. Does that make sense? Of course not!!!! Neither does this book. Salvatore let off a stinkbomb when he wrote this. Salvatore didn't include anything about himself even though he said this was his autobiography. What is Salvatore now an imaginary person named Elbryan. I think he's too far in his own dreams and is living in a fantasy world. The book Everyone Poops had more quality than this. If you bought this your blind to what makes a book worth reading. May purple elephants fly high forever!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was terrible. It's laughably bad. The only redeeming quality of Salvatore's writing is the unintential comedy of the transparent characters and plot. I have read a lot of fantasy and decided to finally try Salvatore; I'll never make that mistake again, he's worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Fantasy Book","review":"I liked R.A. Salvatore's Cleric Quintet series of books, and the Dark Elf Trilogy and found them to be fun and exciting series. I picked up this book in anticipation of some more great reading. However, it did nothing to amaze me, nor did it offer anything new. Generally, books of this genre offer a set of characters that would be considered an odd-assortment \\"adventure party mix\\", and this book stuck to that recipe: a Ranger named Elbryan, a Fighter and his love (Pony), a Centaur (Bradwarden), a magic-wielding Monk (Avelyn) and of course Elves. I enjoyed the story pretty well, and the characters were developed well enough, but not earth-shattering. There were things and characters I felt were underdeveloped, but overall found it to be a solid and enjoyable story and I will continue on to the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Demon Awakens","review":"While I enjoyed this read, I could not help but feel rather distant from the characters and uncaring about the situation. The entire premise is underwhelming, kind of \\"been there, done that,\\" but somehow the execution makes for an enjoyable, if unoriginal, read packed with Salvatore's trademark action sequences. Elbryan, the main character of the story, seems to be kind of a Drizzt-wanna be, and he never even comes close to succeeding. There are a handful of characters that enrich the experience, however - Avelyn the monk, Bradwarden the Centaur, and Bellimar Juraviel the (winged) Elf. Fans of Salvatore shouldn't miss it, though, when it comes right down to it. If you are looking for an amazingly original adventure, however, keep on looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is too slooooow!","review":"Ok, so I bought this book with great expectations .

Salvatore tries to make up for this by filling this story with human interest, but the characters' personalities fall flat, and soon become as tired as their catch phrases. Throughout all of this he gets incredibly preachy, spouting pages filled with tired mantras of \\"do no evil, trust in your friends, treat all animals with respect, and don't litter\\" via a plot device allowing the main character to talk to himself. There's much better Fantasy out there, skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Salvatore","review":"Anyone that has read R.A.

It is almost a straight pull from Lord of the Rings, with some hot sex talk thrown in for good measure.I like other books of his, but this one is too predictable (provided you've read LotR). It's an easy read, provided you scan a few chapters here and there. An easy read, but still not worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demon vs. Elbryan","review":"RAS's first in the Demon War series, but it's already got me hooked on it! Elbryan and Pony are very unforgettable characters, as well as Avelyn (ho,ho, what! =) Elbryan spends his youth with the elves and learns to be a ranger. The elves teach him their way of looking at the world (which really makes you think). As with all the RAS books, there are masterful battles; with evil powries and goblins and giants (and lets not forget the Demon...;) The centaur Bradwarden is one of my favorite chatacters of the book. He's funny and sensible and everything. Overall, a great book that leaves you wanting more more More!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one, please.","review":"I bought this book as an autographed copy. What a find! I had thought. After reading it, I returned it back to the store I'd bought it from. It took all my self-control not to throw the book against the wall before returning it.I cannot begin to list the problems with this book. An incoherent, meandering plot with lackluster characters and a villain that's almost too silly to believe, is a start. Do I really need to know how sailors satisfy their carnal urges while on long trips? Does anyone really understand why the heroine--and I use the term lightly--has three different names in the story? And why did the elves treat Elbryan like a slave and not a friend, if he's supposed to be some sort of savior?I heartily urge those who haven't read it; please don't. I'm glad some of those who posted their reviews liked it, but there are better books to read than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARE WE ALL READING THE SAME BOOK!","review":"This book started off well. The discription of the raid, the pain and confusion Salvatore so expertly conveyed was some of his best work to date. The rest of the book, and the trilogy?...Blew chunks. Elbryan was so predictable it made me ill. Salvatore completely over shot the most interesting character. Pony! The fight scene when she was on watch! Excellent! Salvatore should have centered the book solely around her, because Elbryan was truly a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.A. Salvatores best book(s)","review":"This is most definately one of the best books I have ever read! This is an epic fantasy where Elbryan and his best friend,and later on his lover Jilesponie, and their friend Avylen battle against the forces of the evil Demon Dactyl Bestesbulzibar, after his armies destroyed his, and hometown killing everyone in the town except them.

Holman is successful in portraying the life of a family living with a schizophrenic mother. This is such a serious subject that in the middle of the book I thought I would be depressed at the end. However, I was not. It sure made me think about my own behavior and how people around me perceive my personality idiosyncresies! The title was a bit deceiving and I purchased the book strictly on the basis of title. The subject was not at all what I expected, but I was not disappointed and I couldn't put it down until I was finished, at 2:00 a.m!

Too much reading and not enough interactive sitations dealing with the concepts. Not enough examples and step by step directions to solving problems would have helped.

Each whimsical illustration tells the story of dinosaurs preparing for bed and asks if they pout, stomp their feet or cry at bedtime. In the end we learn that dinosaurs don't put up a stink, but instead give big hugs and kisses before going to bed. The illustrations are fun and the story is sweet with a great message subtly telling children the right way to go to bed. (It's perfect for any parent who has ever tried to put a stubborn child to sleep!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a fun book that my girls love to have read at bed time. They are not so much into the dinosaurs as the actions the dinosaurs do at bed time and how they can relate to the bed time stalling tactics of the dinosaurs!

He has the \\"how do dinosaurs clean their room\\" book and it was always one of his faves. So I thought this would be a good one since lately he has been not liking bed time. Pefect.. now when I read it and I say \\"does a dinosaur throw himself on top of his covers and cry?\\" and he says \\"noooooo\\" with a smile. So he gets it, no fits at bed time. So far it has helped. Also he likes to pretend to read this to himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute. Bed Time story...","review":"This is a cute little book that is a great bed time story. In the first have there are dinosaurs putting their children to bed and by the second half the dinosaur parents have changed into real mommies and daddies putting their children who are acting like dinosaurs to bed.My children quickly grasped the fact that when they roar and cry and fuss and ask for one more book they are acting like a dinosaur.The book is just long enough that your child will feel they have heard a good bedtime story and yet not too long to keep you up reading to them all night.The illustrations are cute and match the text and enhance the story. The story is clearly written and easy for young children to understand.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect bed time story!","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old son. He loves this book. I also have bought the other ones (How does a Dinosaur get well soon, and How does a Dinasour count to ten, How does a Dinasour clean his room?) He loves all of those books. They actually helped stop the little whiny episodes when it came to bed time and taking his medicine. I have not gotten sick of reading these books yet. Those books are good for the entire family!

Jane Yolen and Mark Teague are two of my favorites children's books creators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inflicts guilt and manipulation","review":"My son was given this book as a gift. I was disturbed by the text. It makes children feel that they should just do what they are told like \\"good\\" little children. Children should be allowed to express their anxiety about bedtime, not just shut up and go right to sleep because their parents said so. Children ask for that one last drink, that one last story, etc, because they want to make sure their parents are there for them. They want to feel secure. Some children have a hard time transitioning at the end of the day and need those reassurances. That is why this book bothered me. I do think the illustrations are great, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night?","review":"What a wonderful story for pre-school and the early primary grades!The illustrations are just so colorful and not scarey.The story line is just perfect for nap time and bed time.Since we don't really know what the dinsouaurs looked liked,the diversity of kids and people just fits right in.I can't wait to read the book to my new class this September!They will soon know all the names of the dinosaurs from long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS BOOK!","review":"I, along with my PRE-K students, adore this book.

It is the perfect rhyming book with ample opportunities to add life to it while you read. My girls love to stomp their feet on the floor, and we all stop when we get to \\"does a dinosaur\\" and real loud all three of us ROAR and they get such a kick out of that. They also like to show me the Mama and the Daddy at different points. We also have the clean up book and that is equally as good. And the illustrations are fantastic. A HUGE fan of this author/illustrator and I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I bought this book for my daughter because of her love for dinosaurs and it ended up being her all time favorite book. This is well written and my husband and I love reading it to our kids. I love that on every page there is not only a different dinosaur but they sneak the name of the dinosaur in as well.

I totally regret having purchased it. I have consulted it only 3 times and each time there was nothing in the book or index about the subject I wanted information on. It seems more of a step-by-step for someone who knows nothing about Word or even how to use Windows, than a \\"complete\\" reference. The three subjects I looked up (to my disappointment) were: Digital signatures, security, and startup switches."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing new concept to me!","review":"My favorite quote from the book is, \\"...that who you are is not primarily a human being having a spiritual experience but rather a spiritual being having a human experience.\\"This book addresses our connection with God without the confines of religious thought. It addresses very human experiences. This book gives support for the idea that the \\"unexplainable\\" things we experience may have meaning in the bigger picture.I recommend pages 135 - 136 as a preface to reading the book for anyone who struggles with the role of God in their lives. This is an excellent book for everyone, even skeptics! This is an uplifting and quick read. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time to read","review":"The way it is described you would think you would learn some techniques for remembering birth experiences or past life experiences.

They could just as well have been living in a tenement in New York city, buying their canned sardines and bags of peanuts at the local market and using a bare bulb for light. It is easy to survive in the wilderness if you stockpile enough sardines and kerosene. What would have been a challenge is IF they had attempted to survive on what they could forage, fish, hunt, or grow with the tools they could make (like the Native Americans did). Simplicity is an easy thing if the canning factory is operating, the peanut farmers and merchants are toiling their trades, and one has enough of a pension to purchase those necessities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent product","review":"Having a number of differnt tattoos from back to all over arms, and living in a DRY, AZ, DRY climate id say just based on ease of application, lack of fragrance, and how it feels going on to a fresh 3/4 forearm sleeve this is superior to A+D/Tattoo Goo, that ive used in the past, I also have Cats so the less attraction of hair on it the better!

I have put the tape I bought in a dusty cupboard and will watch the ancient taped TV version until the publishers think about releasing the better version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Midwest Has Never Been So Funny","review":"This is honestly one of the funniest movies this reviewer has ever seen. Christopher Guest (Best in Show, This is Spinal Tap) hones his \\"mocumentary\\" skills and proves he is king of the genre by giving the best performance of his career in a superbly written and directed film.This all-star cast delivers an amazingly believable performance, transcending (or perhaps descending) real-life social status and fame to convince the viewer that each cast member is actually a citizen of rural America, caught up in the excitement of presenting a play for a New York City reviewer.Several movies, including \\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\" and \\"Miss Congeniality\\" have recently attempted \\"Waiting for Guffman's\\" cinematic feat, but all have been grossly outside Guest's bullseye. This movie is an hilarious look at stereotypical middle America, packed with the punch of Christopher Guest's sharp wit, and a believable documentary style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The key to enjoying this movie .....","review":"... is to be prepared to watch it at least twice without distraction. This kind of humor is the \\"long-term love\\" that grows over time rather than the \\"one-night stand\\" that immediately burns out. Christopher Guest is a brilliant improvisational talent who surrounds himself with other such capable actors for his projects. There is rarely a script, per se, and the humor in the film comes from the rich and layered, realistic-but-oddball, ad-libbed character portrayals and development in fairly simple life situations. Add sight gags and subtle puns that are never \\"in your face\\" like laugh-track, sit-com humor, and you create a masterpiece that never grows stale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Movie Ever","review":"My heart stopped when I saw that \\"Waiting for Guffman\\" is coming out on DVD.

However, heavy metal isn't any more ripe for satire today than it was approximately 30 years ago when Spinal Tap was first released; i.e., heavy metal is just as misunderstood and underappreciated as ever. Truth be told, the heavy metal genre engenders just as much quality music as any other rock and roll genre (somewhere around five to ten percent of it). What is the point of satirizing something that is substantially misunderstood and underappreciated? It seems to me that satire best lends itself to sacred cows such as, for example, small town values and community theater (the targets of satire in Waiting for Guffman)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Look at Samll Town America and Community Theatre","review":"Christopher Guest brings his Moc-umentary lense into sharp comedic focus in this amazing examination of one small towns attempt to launch a musical telling of it's history. The same wit and gentle pokes that Guest uses in the recent Best of Show are in vivid display here. You alternately fall in love with and pity the naive enthusiasm of Guest's assembled cast of small town thespians featuring Eugene Levy in his best performance to date, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, among others, as they wait for the arrival of a big time Broadway producer on the opening ( and only) night of their theatrical masterpiece.If you have ever participated in any community theatre in your life, or lived in any close knit community, be it a small town or suburban neighborhood, you will fall off your sofa with laughter, as these all too familiar characters and situations unfold before you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting For Laughter","review":"After viewing Christopher Guest's superb mockumentary \\"Best In Show\\" this film was a major disappointment. The laughs in \\"Waiting for Guffman\\" were sporadic and obvious. Guest's Corky St. Claire character's flamboyance was a little much. The depiction of Middle America was condescending if not outright insulting. The normally reliable ensemble cast(Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard, Parker Posey) could not even transcend the weak material they were given to work with. The centerpiece of the film, a community theatre production commemmorating the history of the fictional town of Blaine, was flat and boring and not even remotely funny.

Come on, people, IS THIS REALLY A GOOD MOVIE?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny, overall a desperate attempt at humor","review":"I dont understand why this film is such a cult classic. It had funny acting, but there wasnt hardly any plot to it, and none of it was funny. it is far from a masterpeice- I think it is over credited from the direction of Christopher Guest and its limited release of only 64 theatres. My friends said that this movie was so hilarious-the portrayal of a small town and white trash. Well to say the least their humor must be a bit primitive. I have nothing against low-budgeted films, but this documentary film was incredibly boring. I dont reccomend this to anyone. Its a terrible attempt at humor beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Best In Show","review":"Christopher Guest's mockumentary is about a small town theatre group that puts on a play and invites a famous Broadway critic, Guffman, to attend. The would-be stars all have grand illusions of being discovered by Guffman, and making a big splash in show biz.A lot of people find this film hilarious; I didn't. I never cared about what these characters were going through; they seemed way too stereotypical and phony and the actors just weren't believable. They weren't sweet, innocent, or endearing; they were boring.If you want to see most of the same actors in a much better mockumentary, also written and directed by the Guest, see Best in Show. It is hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"This video is a riot!","review":"This is one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen. Some folks may not \\"get it\\" -- their loss. From what I understand, the show is essentially a filmed improv -- the actors were given a detailed plot and character study and just went with it. Watch this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T MISS THIS MOVIE!!!!","review":"Waiting for Guffman sets a comedic standard which will be hard to surpass! This is the funniest stuff you'll ever see. The ensemble cast is AMAZING, at one moment making you belly-roll in the floor and at the next touching you to the core with their enthusiasm, hopes and dreams. Bare-naked souls who strike a little too close to home at times! Just an amazing piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guffman is the best mockumentary ever!","review":"This movie is flat out hysterical. It is a mockumentary of a small town theater group and the lengths they go to put on a musical for the 150th anniversary of small town Blaine, Missouri. Watch and become entranced by Corky St. Clair, the drama master, who remains stuck in the closet, Ron and Sheila Albertson, travel agents and wannabe theater stars, Libby Mae, a DQ girl with high aspirations to hit the Big Apple, and Lloyd Miller, the jealous music director longing for the spot light. This movie is 84 minutes of pure laughs and hilarious situations! END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda, Shoulda, wasn't...","review":"This movie... well, 'mocumentary', is hard to get excited about.It's like the guys behind this movie figured that they find theatre boring, so they'd go and make a movie about how boring theatre is - and the people in it.At the start there's all these staged 'interviews' of the various characters, you feel like you're watching a documentary about a small town. After a while, the 'movie' gets going, and it's kind of interesting, especially the bit when they finally do the show.It's vaguely ironic, and yes, satirical, but in a most obvious, telegraphed way. There's no jokes, no slapstick, no real ideas... they pin all their hopes on the satire, and, after a while, the desperation to be oddball grows tiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"I immediately rewound it and watched it again!","review":"There are 119 customer reviews as of now, so there's little or no point to me writing this, except to reiterate that everyone, EVERYONE should see this movie. It is one of the funniest, most quotable, most memorable movies ever made. I adore it. The writing, the acting, the directing, cause me to laugh out loud every time I see it (I've probably seen it twenty times, which for me is a lot). This movie is awesome, and I love it, you should see it. If you want to make it a double bill, get \\"Noises Off,\\" as well. Dang, I love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Waiting For Guffman\\" is the best comedy in years!","review":"I recommend it to all my friends and I have rented it so many times I can't count, so I decided to buy it! Everyone loves it and it is so much better than some of the movies today. It will make you scream with laughter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, On Our Top 10 List!","review":"This treasure is a favorite with my entire family, including 2 teenagers. That it merited an \\"R\\" rating is truly tragic, because it means many people who would otherwise love it will avoid seeing it. I honestly can't think why this would be \\"R\\" rated, with all the much more explicit sexual and violent scenes in so many \\"PG-13\\" movies. Perhaps there was a foul word or two, but certainly no sexual or violent scenes that would keep older children from enjoying it. This is a \\"must see\\" movie if you enjoy community theatre or have ever been stage struck. By the way, we are still looking for the \\"Remains of the Day\\" lunchboxes, and agree with Corky that any child would be tickled pink to take one to school!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical","review":"Unbelievably funny, this movies is one overlooked gem.

It gets funnier and funnier each time.God bless the citizens of Blaine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing ever Happens on Mars.....","review":"First off I LOVE PARKER POSEY. But that's another story envolving wips and chains. This is one of the funniest movies EVER. Fred Willard kills me.

This flick just cracks me up. Corky is one of Guest's most memorable characters ever and the songs about Blaine are a riot. This is in my top 10 comedies of all time, easily, and my favorite of Guest's \\"mockumentaries.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Guffman is Great","review":"This is a family favorite - depicting a hilarious community theatre experience in 'Blaine Missouri'. Christopher Guest and his band of actors have created a very funny movie (one of many) - that is our favorite out of all of them. (Spinal Tap, Best of Show, Mighty Wind, etc. . .)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle humor that provides belly laughs galore","review":"After wiping the tears from my eyes after watching \\"Best in Show,\\" I discovered this little-known gem. Much like an earlier review stated, I too could watch this movie every single day and laugh until my vision blurred. I cannot remember a movie in the past twenty years with as many quality laughs and subtle jokes as \\"Waiting for Guffman.\\" Sadly it suffers from a horrible title, but after one viewing even that is digestable. Every single character in this masterpiece is outstanding--there are NO weak characters and NO weak moments. It is important to listen carefully for all the jibes and one-liners delivered, especially by Fred Willard. His runs are priceless. I have to finish this review quickly because I want to rush into the living room and watch it again for the umpteenth time this month. Highest rating possible!!! Thanks go out to Christopher Guest and his troupe of comedic masters for a job well done!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Corky is a Hit","review":"Waiting For Guffman is the best movie ever. My whole family has watched this movie more times than any of us can count. Every time we watch it it just keeps getting more hilarious. We love all the actors. We love Christopher Guest who plays Corky St.Clair (\\"everybody dance\\"). We love Parker Posey who plays a dairy queen worker(\\"i've been thinking about what i could do with ice cream...\\"). We especially love Eugene Levy who plays Dr.Pearl(\\"you have to go where the love is, and for me the love is in Miami\\"). And we love all the other hilarious actors in this movie.But the one thing we love most are the classic songs- \\"Stool Boom\\", \\"A Penny For Your Thoughts\\", and \\"Boring, Boring\\". We love the movie, it made us laugh, it made us cry, but mostly it made us laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeping Hats","review":"A few years ago, I was pretty bummed out over losing at a facist academic competition that shall remain nameless. I needed to see something to lift my spirits. It just so happened that Guffman was showing in the local second-run art theater. Sweet Jesus! That was the ticket. Simply the funniest movie I've ever seen in a theater. I about literally injured myself. Every performance is a gem, every line is quotable (\\"Every Sunday between four and five, I have no feeling in my buttocks\\"). I have made it a personal mission of mine to force everyone I know to watch this movie, and without fail, everyone has loved it. A must see, possibly the funniest movie of the 90s. You are only hurting yourself by depriving yourself of this movie. Personally, I think it's funnier than \\"Spinal Tap.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you laughing constantly","review":"No crazykedor, you *don't* get it...the movie is a SATIRE, and a hilarious one. Everyone I know who has seen this has loved it - particularly my roomate who used to do community theater himself. Every actor is perfect in their over-the-top role. Every time I watch it, I pick up on another joke that I had never noticed before - my favorite is the absent penny in 'Penny for Your Thoughts'. This is one of the best under-discovered movies you'll ever see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Christopher Guest!","review":"Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy have written by far the funniest movie I have ever seen. Every line is quotably hilarious! Not a minute goes by that I am not rolling on the floor laughing. The whole cast is amazing in their portrayal of Blainians. Though incredibly funny, Waiting for Guffman certainly is an acquired taste. If you love it, you will LOVE it. A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Red, White, and Blaine","review":"Fantastic movie! Christopher Guest is amazing! He deserves two thumbs up way up! Entertaining and funny. A film you will enjoy. You can't go through the whole movie with out laughing.CORKY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This has been called the \\"Spinal Tap\\" of the community theater world, but it really is - and in a good way. It is directed in the same pseudo-documentary style as Spinal Tap, and is just as drily hilarious. The actors are all terrific and make you feel like they were born for these parts. And with a cast that includes Eugene Levy, Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara, you can hardly go wrong. This film was obviously crafted with a lof of love and effort, and it shows through. This is a film that gets better with each viewing, and it is already a cult classic. Kudos to Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy for daring to write a brilliant comedic film at the expense of \\"marketability\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it","review":"This movie is very similar to the directors other popular film, Best of Show. I don't really understand the overwhelming praise for either of these films. The problem with it is there really isn't much outright humor and I don't think I cracked a smile more than once the whole movie. I'd say its more overall amusing than it is funny. Several reviews of this film stated that the viewers were 'rolling on the floor with laughter'. This completely confuses me as there isn't a single scene that presents enough of a comic situation that you could really laugh out loud at it. I understand the type of humor that he is trying to achieve in the movie, it just totally misses its mark on me. I guess I'll stay away from future Guest films as I just don't find anything remotely funny about them and they are as boring as watching a real documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of tedius - not that good","review":"This movie dragged. Just so you know where I'm coming from I liked Spinal Tap, A Mighty Wind, and Best In Show. This one's worth skipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MY THING","review":"I enjoy most comedies, this one I don't. If you don't want to laugh outloud this movie is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"really, not that funny","review":"Might be ok for a rental, but all these great reviews are misleading. It's a long string of understatement and purposely anticlimactic punch lines. It's an interesting exercise, but the joke's on the viewer. There's a reason you haven't heard of this movie before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"I am sorry for the other riviewers, I thought the movie was original, and well acted, but also boring and meaningless.This is unless, you are really into homosexual, and feminine men.The beautiful Parker Posey, was a good actor and beautiful as always.I would not buy it or rent it, unless everything else slightly viewable fos already gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS EVERYONE ELSE SEEING HERE?","review":"I bought this video because the reviews were overwhelmingly good. Personally, I just don't see what everyone is raving about. Yes, the acting was great, but that's it. No fascinating story. No fascinating characters. If you want a really funny film about a small-town production, get \\"A Midwinter's Tale.\\" It is far superior to \\"Waiting for Guffman\\" in every aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best comedy film since \\"Blazing Saddles\\"","review":"As one who grew up in a town similar to Blaine, I could not stop laughing at the antics (so believable!) of the characters in this \\"show.\\" Guest is a genius---I loved the fact that Corky St. Clair staged \\"Backdraft\\" although it was closed by the local Fire Department. The bios of the characters were wonderful: the travel agents who never travelled (except for the time the husband had to have \\"surgery\\") outside of Blaine and his wife with her bangs sticking straight up in the air; to Dr. Pearl, the beloved, singing dentist to our Dairy Queen princess--Parker Posey--who is priceless and to all the other wonderful actors in this film. I would have loved to have \\"sat in\\" with Guest and Levy when they wrote this brillant piece of art. Run, don't walk, to get this video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guffman is expected...","review":"In the small town of Blaine they are preparing for their 150th anniversary of Blaine by staging a play that would represent the small Missouri town. The director sends a letter about the show to a Mr. Oppenheimer who is going to send Mr. Guffman from Broadway to view their play. This stirs up some high expectations by the actors and director of the play, and they begin to dream of what this might lead to. Waiting for Guffman is a comedy that has dry humor that grows on the audience as the film progresses. The actors perform well, which creates some very interesting characters that keep the audience's attention and leads the story toward a very rewarding cinematic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Community Theater Run Amok","review":"If you have ever met someone who thinks the raves they received as a member of the chorus in their high school production of \\"Oklahoma\\" mean they are broadway bound, this is a film you need to see. Comic geniuses Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy dare to ask the cinematic question -- when is bad theater good? The answer: when outrageous characters (as portrayed by some of the most brilliant comic actors working) join their talents to sing and dance the history of one small town in the middle of America into the annals of filmdom. This is community theater run amok. Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher Guest is great!","review":"I'm a big fan of Christopher Guest and Waiting for Guffman has to be his best movie. All the reviews are right: this film is hilarious with a crazy assortment of interesting characters. I just love Guest's brand of humor. Christopher Guest is a genius!......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Few will enjoy this","review":"I know there are many positive reviews of this movie, but I can't quite tell why. I watched this with a bunch of friends and the only two who found it funny grew up in small towns and were kinda weird anyway. I admit that there is creativity here and I like the aspect of the improvisation that always accompanies Guest's films, but what good is improv and ad lib if it's not that funny? This film has it's moments but there are dozens of funnier movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Unanimously Hated this Movie, Beware of Positive Review","review":"I cannot believe how boring this Movie was. I had a very diverse crowd over to watch this DVD on my big front projection theater. Everybody was getting so annoyed and flat faced we had to turn it off after 45 minutes. I am absolutely amazed at the positive reviews. In my opinion, this movie is simply boring. It was far worse than State and Main. It was State and Main crossed with Best in Show, except that it took the worst parts of EACH. Every character was forced and not humorous. I've seen far better Saturday night Live Skits (the current Saturday Night Live). I've given this film too much credit already by even attempting to compare it with the above mentioned films.Berst in Show was a 3/5 star movie. State and Main was around a 2/5 Satr movie, in my opinion. I cannot give this any higher than 1.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked \\"Spinal Tap\\" you might not like this","review":"This movie was tedious and for a VERY limited audience... I rented it and it was dreary and boring. Too many of these movies are former \\"Second City\\" cast members who've forgotten how to write a script. Improv doesn't always work in movies.Also--Fred Willard is NOT FUNNY. He is the \\"Anti-Funny\\" and drags down anything he has ever been in. Why a brilliant mind like Martin Mull ever teamed up with that moron is behind me. Christopher Guest is only marginally funny. He likes to play these effete characters, though--ever since Sat. Night Live. What a waste...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing better","review":"This is quite possibly the funniest movie ever made. If you get it. Anyone who has ever been involved in small-town community theater will really enjoy it. Christopher Guest is masterful in this, and Eugene Levy is at his best. I can't count how many times my wife and I have watched this."},{"rating":"2","title":"True comedy at its best","review":"A genius cast, hilarious script with outstanding characterization. Each character is unique and the actors portray them in comic brillance.A must see movie. If you loved Second City telivision, or America Tonight, with Martin Mull and Fred Willard,(which by the way, I am looking for dvd or vhs copies of this show or Fernwood Tonight),then you really will enjoy this comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"so funny","review":"I love it so funny very funny laugh so funny great movie i laugh it make me pee my pants so funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for Guffman","review":"Best movie ever made--well, we love it. Came fast and was a fun surprise to get it as I had forgotten I'd ordered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Was Alright","review":"I'll start off by saying that I love and own This is Spinal Tap. I also thought that Best in Show was really funny and that A Mighty Wind was worthy of a rental. But this Christopher Guest movie just didn't live up to my expectations, which were based on other reviews that called this movie Guest's best. Well, it's not. It's got a few moments in it that made me laugh, but overall the movie was filled with too much boring stuff. Usually these movies will have plenty to laugh about, and there will be an occasional joke that doesn't work well.But in Waiting for Guffman, there's too much that doesn't even seem to try to be funny. Instead it paints a picture of how boring these characters are, which would work if it were made to be funny, but it isn't. This movie seemed like a good premise for a movie that could have had a lot of funny bits in it, but it didn't take advantage of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Movies Ever","review":"Waiting for Guffman is one of the best movies ever. Christopher Guest is a genius. I think the acting in Guffman is about the best I have ever seen; every actor in the movie does an incredible job of portraying small town people who couldn't perform if their lives depended on it. We started laughing from the opening scene when the City Council is discussing where to position the snipers for security at the small town's sesquicentennial, and we never stopped laughing. We have now watched Waiting for Guffman 20 or 30 times, and we love it every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher Guest is a genius!","review":"this man's mind is a miraculous thing!i haven't laughed this hard in a long time!this mock-u-mentary is classic!CORKY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to love this movie!","review":"As a huge fan of the movies \\"Best in Show\\" and \\"For Your Consideration\\", I was so excited when I came across another Christopher Guest movie featuring many of the same players. I truly wanted to love this movie, but to me it just fell flat. The first time I watched it, I fell asleep half way through! I have managed to stay awake to watch it three times since just to be sure I wasn't missing some underlying comic theme, but to no avail. In the other Guest films I've viewed, the pace is fast and the humor appears effortless and natural. In \\"Waiting For Guffman\\", the comedy is forced and contrived, and the movie seemed to drag on forever. It's like the actors are trying too hard to be funny, and failing miserably. That's not to say there weren't a few humorous moments in the movie, but I would recommend renting this movie first before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guffman review","review":"This movie was somewhat comical, but lacks any real interest. Nothing really happens that makes the viewer actually want to see more. The only part that I thought was pretty good was the actual play itself. The part with the aliens was very funny. I did not like the fact that no one liked the music teacher and everyone liked the other guy. The fact that I cannot remember his name only reinforces the fact that he didn't really interest me. It did not seem fair that he did not listen to any of the music teacher's comments. The movie didn't show why the actors and actresses liked that guy so much. Why did they love him? Was he that great of a guy? These are questions that should be answered in the movie. If they are not, the viewer is left clueless to many things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good enough for a rental.","review":"This non-scripted movie is good, but I wouldn't buy it. It's good if you like a lot of awkward humor, but if you're waiting for a big laugh get something else like Rat Race. The later movie with the same actors, Best In Show is more deserving to be in your collection; don't bother Waiting for Guffman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Spinal Tap!!","review":"Guest and cast are hysterical! WAY better than Spinal Tap. Absolutely a riot of laughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stool Boom!!!","review":"Seriously one of the best comedies ever made. This film is brilliant.

Probably the best of all the Guest films."},{"rating":"2","title":"CORKY RULES!!","review":"This is THE single, funniest movie I have seen in my 41 years! I watch this movie over and over again whenever I need a good, old-fashioned belly laugh and it never fails to deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Modern Day Wit.","review":"This film is one of those rare modern day comedies, one that makes you think. For a lot of people, mulitple viewings will probably be necessary to \\"get\\" the movie. However, for anyone who has had experience in community theatre, the film is a humorous riot from beginning to end. Christopher Guest is a genius! The film is a mockumentary about Corky St. Claire (Guest) a New Yorker hoping that his new musical \\"Red, White, and Blaire\\" celebrating the town of Blaire, Missouri will mark his Broadway comeback. After receiving a note scheduling a visit from a Broadway producer named, Mr. Guffman, the cast and director believe that this is their big chance at fame and fortune. However, for anyone who has seen or read, Waiting for Godot; well you can guess what happens. Hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do You Know These People?","review":"\\"Waiting For Guffman\\" makes me laugh just looking at the box. There are plenty of great (and a few classic) moments in this film. Just try to order a Coke at Dairy Queen again without thinking of Parker Posey. Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara's audition is one of the funniest things ever put on film. Having worked in community theatre for years I have met every single one of these characters. While they lack talent, they make up for in enjoyment. That, my friends, is what community theatre is all about. Not to get too deep, but these ordinary folks are ultimately able to transcend their lives through the arts. Now, is that such a bad thing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"GUFFMAN ROCKS!","review":"I simply can't get enough Guffman! \\"I'm feeling good about where this movie stands (deja vou?)

This belt is perfect! It can carry 10 gels + electrolytes for marathons. It can carry my droid x, wallet, and keys for those hour or less runs. The elastic belt seems to be what keeps this thing from bouncing. You really don't notice it is there. I have some ridiculous number of belts now, and this one is definitely the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nathan Gel Waist Pack","review":"I absolutely love this running waist pack. It's big enough to fit my inhaler, phone, tissues, keys and a few gel packs. There is also a velcro secured compartment in the back to hold train pass and credit cards. The sizing chart is accurate. I ordered a small and it fits great. Some users complained of the long straps annoying them. If you can tuck them into the side slots it shouldn't affect you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits like it's not even there","review":"I was a little hesitant to purchase a waist pack (thought it would rub and be uncomfortable). WRONG! Been wearing this for about a month. Did first 10K with it last weekend and didn't even know it was there.

He likes it because it is very slim and does not create a lot of annoying bounce. He can carry his car key, credit card, driver's license, ipod and a bar in the pack. You can easily roll this pack up and make it very compact for packing. This is a great purchase for someone who wants to carry some small essentials on runs or hikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my second one","review":"Got my first 3-4 years ago.

The writing is tight and sensitive. But -- I don't exaggerate -- the rest of the book reads like the diary of a suburban high school girl on her first internship... right down to what color jacket she packed, what kinds of sandwiches she ate for lunch and the first names of all the people she met who sat around mostly drumming their fingers' on their desks. The author spent 99% of her assignment to assist crash victims' families doing paperwork (!!!!) The other 1% of the story is revealed on the inside flap. Once you've read that, you've essentially read the book. How any editor could have published this air sandwich of a book, I really can't understand. It is so empty in the middle, I wanted to pull my hair out. Still I persevered, thinking it would redeem itself. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"This book was NOTHING like what I expected. The author leads you to believe she was thrusted into a traumatic experience that changed her life. Her experience dealing with plane crash victim's families was brief and inconsequential! It appears she wanted to benefit financially from an event she was only slightly involved in. I'd give it 0 stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"very very very very disappointed","review":"This version of Axum (6) definitely is much much less than what it purports to be. It may have had all the bells and whistles in terms of plotting power (I have not tried all), but the user interface is terribly not friendly. You can try this: make a graph, then go to print setup to change page from landscape to portait. If you luckily go through, then go to undo, or go to print setup to change back to landscape, 9 out of 10 times you will be errorred out. Also try this, make a scatter (x, y1, y2, y3, y4.....y10) plot, then try to change all datapoints to the same symbols. It certainly takes at least 10 tedious steps to accomplish this. In summary, I strongly suggest you stay away from it if you have the option."},{"rating":"1","title":"?1 or 3?","review":"Not sure what I bought; thought it was 3, but only got one.

Only issue is that it reads like a bunch of newspaper articles strung together.

It will infuriate you, whether you live in the state or not. It's a great example of investigative journalism (obviously, the first reviewer works for the Kaolin companies who have been robbing the poor blacks and even the state of Georgia blind for decades!)

The characters are irratic and the story line overdeveloped in some places and underdeveloped in others. Example: if a wealthy New York bachelor is trying to impress his affluent next door neighbor with a house warming gift, he most likely would bring something from Tiffany's, not a MacIntosh Yankee Candle.

This game is titled as an RPG game but it is not! The game provides a very limited RPG system(like myth 2 more or less) and it functions,looks like a --strategy-- game and not like an RPG game. Altough there are heros they are very similar to the 'normal' units. In addition the game is mission based(like a typical strategy game)and the only diffrecne between this game to a startegy game is the fact that your heros can gain XP points(and the quantity of those doesn't change).

The movie felt very familar only this time different actors and language were involved.

This movie certainly won't inspire you to any great action but it is something you can watch if you have spare time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a bad telenovela","review":"As soon as one realizes this movie is shot on videotape and not film one's heart sinks. Like a bad telenovelo, scenes go on and on and all one wants to do is yell \\"Cut\\" to the director. The story is familiar: a prostitute who works johns on a train, drugs them and steals their money, one night hits the jackpot -- two suitcases crammed with money being transported by a courier out of Spain. Tracked down by an agent hired by a crooked banker, a relationship evolves between the hooker and the agent, who double crosses her, then backtracks -- only to be double crossed in return. A tired story that appears to have been lifted from countless other, better written scripts, this flick has the look and feel of an el-cheapo Mexican outing. Good Spanish actors wasted in a movie that looks like a hastily thrown together production."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Dexter & Company!","review":"Very nice early Dexter Gordon with Kenny Drew & Carl Perkins. One can listen to it straight or on random sequence and the album will take the listener to a very nice peak of Jazz sensibility.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Japanese indie rock trio with a bit of a punk rock influence. The vocals are very scratchy, which add to the overall emotion of the songs, but might turn off some listeners who can't handle it. Overall, however, this album is VERY solid, well put together rock and definitely worth a listen.Recommended tracks:#4 The Hill of Hope - Great song!!! Verses consist of muted guitar, soothing bass, and a nice quiet hi-hat, mini-drum roll combo which lead into beautiful, melodic choruses.#1 Make for the Wasteland - Good song all around, catchy chorus, it's got everything you could want in a song.#2 One-Way Ticket Song - Nothing less than a good song.#12 Corrected Eyesight: 0.6 - A bit of a change of pace from the other album, but that isn't to say that it doesn't have its fair share of rocking. It is a very climactic song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rivetting read","review":"An intriguibg and clever story and a must read for anyone with an office job or anyone striving to build a career.

High expectations: Huge letdown.","review":"Being pregnant with a rare type of identical twins (monchorionic/single afterbirth), I had high expectations of this video. I paid for extra shipping because my husband and I wanted to watch it so badly. VERY disappointing. This video does not focus very much on the actual science and miracle of twins. But rather, the studies on homosexuality of one twin verses heterosexualism in the other. It went off on a huge tangent about this study. Don't waste your money, plan to catch it on tv for free so you can only watch the parts that ARE ACTUALLY about twins instead of their sexuality theories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Seeing Double","review":"This documentary shows how identical twins are created. However, it discusses many pairs of identical twins who look nothing alike. For example, they showed identical twins in which one twin was just half the size of the other. The point is that numerous factors during pregnancy can affect the twins differently. As a person who hates science, I found this work friendly, rather than science-dorky. I would consider giving this as a gift to people who are twins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price","review":"We wanted a hammock to put under the kid's playset, so we didn't want to spend big bucks with the kids climbing all over it.

Another thing that bugs me about this band is their need to create really ugly, nu-style artwork/layouts that look more fitting on a KORN album than an underground death/grind album.

At this point it will start to bother your teeth, making it almost painful to chew the gum. then about 5 minutes after that the gum will turn to powder, hiding itself away in every crevice of your mouth, and once you finally get all that mess out of your mouth, you're stuck with the rubber/dead animal flavor for 30 minutes to an hour.The story here is: Altoids did mints well, and sour hard candy very well, but gum?

The rehearsal of the grand pas de deux was routine and the instructions for dancer improvement was given in a very muted Russian, which made it useless for non-Russian speaking viewers. Watching a rehearsal should be instructional as well as showing the viewer the immense hard work the dancers put in to learning their roles.

In combination with the photos, the narration really gives you extensive detail of the hikes. I was surprised with how much more info was packed into this DVD than I gleamed from the books. In fact, I picked up on some things that I missed when I was there in person.Given what it was designed to do, highlight the trails, it did this task very well. I would have liked a few more scene selection options, and maybe some more overview maps but all in all I would highly recommend this title to anyone planning a backpack or hiking in Yosemite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hiking Guide Yosemite DVD","review":"This is an excellent DVD for those planning a trip to Yosemite, and plan on seeing the sights via day hikes or backpacking trips.The descriptions are packed with details and pictures to take you on a virtual hiking experience along each trail.

The narrator offers a variety of information about the spectacular scenery (which is in abundance in Yosemite!) as well as plants and tree varieties. He also points out the best places to refill water supplies so one does not get caught without an adequate supply.Throw in a few suggestions to help you plan against potential disappointments (making appropriate reservations) and you have a great resource to help you plan an excellent Yosemite experience.I personally hike Yosemite frequently and will use this as a resource as I continue my exploring of this magnificent National Park!M.A."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE LOVES IT!","review":"Ordered this for my aunt who swears by it!

It covers the fundamentals of NFS V2 over UDP, and NIS quite well, and has a good troubleshooting section, which might help beginners negotiate the interoperability and tuning issues that are common in today's multivendor environments.

Years later Seiko still has few watches that display GMT/Zulu time. This is a must in Aviation. I just love my Skyhawks. I have them stainless steel, two-tone, and black. My black one is my favorite and it has really taken a beating. All the way to Iraq for a year with no problems at all. I crossed multiple time zones all over the Middle East and Europe and this watch kept me straight. Some countries don't do Daylight Savings (Kuwait) and others do (Iraq). The Skyhawk always got it right. Having a dedicated GMT display is key. My only complaint is that my Two-tone and black models have backlights, but my stainless does not. Why would Citizen leave that out on the Eco-drive models? Anyway, if you fly professionally, this is the watch to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch","review":"This watch was a replacement of another Citizen watch that was much heavier and more approriate when wearing business attire. I needed a watch I would not be afraid to wear on a day to day basis and blended in with casual wear. The JR3155 series watch was perfect for that. I decided to go with the polyurethane strap instead of the stainless steel because of weight. It is light weight with no compromise to the function of the watch. Having a secondary time zone is nice.

It will be the last. Is this typically how he writes? I've read hints that the Stainless Steel Rat novels are parodies of sci-fi pulp, which is fine. In that case, I got the joke. I got the joke five pages in; the rest was just extraneous. If it was a joke, it was spread awfully thin. A tattered plot filled with guys constantly \\"growling menacingly\\" and dames \\"husking seductively\\" (sorry, tossed it and am writing from memory)? Full of people otherwise otherwise engaging in all sorts of off-putting and utterly unverisimilitudinous behavior and speaking dialogue that would make Isaac Asimov blush?

From attacking Hell with a squad of Marines armed with salami (who said hard salami wasn't a lethal & useful weapon?) to the woman who loves the twins and figures out a way to marry both, this book leaves the fan with a grin on his or her face well after the book is closed. (If you're not grinning after the rocket ship underwear, then something is wrong -- and it isn't with the book!)If you haven't read the series, then you will find yourself at a loss for a while, until you pick up on the characters' individual traits.

I really did. Granted, they've never been particularly deep and maybe my tastes for pulp sci-fi have changed. But this is pretty crap. The characters are not at all engaging and the plot is only very mildly interesting. The best thing I can say about this book is that it is very cheap. And it's a hardback, so it makes a stable coaster while I seek worthier pages. I still am fond of Harry Harrison for promoting Esperanto, but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rat goes bonkers","review":"Any rat fan who's expecting a Stainless Steel Rat novel with a straightforward plot will be disappointed.

The plot IS, at times, quite confusing and of course very unbelievable - but who cares! This book is a great escape and proves Harry Harrison is still a great scifi/humor. (Sorry Harry, but my favorite SSR is still \\"A Stainless Steel Rat is Born\\"!!) Harry Harrison is my personal favorite novelist and Jim diGriz is my favorite character in a novel!

I've been a die-hard fan of Slippery Jim for around... two decades (and I'm only 26). This book, however, is a phenominal whiffle of bunk. I can't believe that the series has become this corny. It's terribly insulting that Mr. Harrison would do this to one of my most beloved literary memories. Not that I want to give away any spoilers, but I have one word for those of us that have already read the book... SAUSAGES!So lets say that you don't believe me. Just have a look at the cover.

I was wrong. Very wrong. This book reads like a parody of his previous books. The humor is forced, the characters are flat, the plot is ludicrous (and manages the neat trick of being both rushed and tedious at the same time), and incredibly useful (and incoherent) devices are invented at the drop of a hat whenever the main characters need them.I earnestly hope that Harry Harrison doesn't write another SSR book because if he writes one I'll buy it and read it and I'm pretty sure after the last two that I won't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"The Stainless Steel Rat Goes To Hell - in a hand basket.

Unfortunately this novel does not meet my expectations. Its plot seems to wander from one stupid thing to the next - totally ruining the scene.

The story left more questions than answers. I'll re-read the first 2 books in this series but I'm not sure about this one.This was a real disappointment and I'm sad to say that the conclusion to this triology really didn't make much sense.

Is this murder in any way tied to the fact that Jilly's long lost mother has suddenly appeared in her life, bringing along a new step father, neither of which Guy thinks is worth trusting as far as Jilly could throw them?There's nothing really new or surprising here. You have old friends finding love and passion, evil interlopers, murder, and a handful of colorful characters to jazz things up a bit.

I gave it four out of five stars because I really enjoyed reading the parts about Charlemagne, but the parts about the war were not very enjoyable to me.

The CD is a relative short one although this is made up by the exceptional songs on this ultra magnificient album. The following songs can and will make the 'Best of' Switchfoot Anthology and the band deserves one since being around from 1996 to now. These songs are 'Home', 'Concrete Girl', 'Life And Love and Why (one of the best Switchfoot songs before Dare You To Move), and 'Don't Be There'.This Christian trio remind me of the music of Lifehouse and the lyrics mean something and the vocals are meaningful.

I wouldn't recommend buying this entire album because if your taste in music is anything like mine, you'll only listen to a few songs. I really only listen to Chem 6A, which describes the woes of a high school classroom from the perspective of a high school student. The other one that I like is Might Have Ben Hur, about seeing a girl on the street, saying hi and then the relationship sparking. The words aren't exactly \\"enlightening\\" or whatever, I just like the tune. I think you should just buy these two songs, but listen to all the samples just to see if there are other that interest you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Switchfoot's first CD","review":"Legend of Chin is a classic CD for Switchfoot.

However, once I start reading it; it gets harder and harder to continue. For one thing, I don't find any of the characters likeable. I somehow find them lack of emotions and mechanical. For another thing, I just don't like the writing style. It's like reciting the events rather than really have them laying out to the reader's eyes. There are very few dialogues and not enough descriptions for me to picture what's going on in the story. At the end, I have to skip pages to get to the end and just finish with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZ...","review":"The premise of two rivalrous sisters was a good one, but this book fell flat with me. I had to read this for a book group and kept trying very hard to find something to like about it. The plot was slow and preposterous. The charactars, however, were the greatest insult. Not only could I not find one I could like, I couldn't find one I could believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I started out liking it but never developed an attachment to any of the characters. At first, I was trying to figure out who the \\"bad\\" sister was but after all the rehashing without much progress, I eventually didn't even care.I also felt my intelligence insulted since the author felt the need to restate opposing arguments, as if I was unable to keep it straight myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Disappointing","review":"THE GOOD SISTER was pretty bad overall.This novel is not poorly written, but it falls short on plot and characterization. All four of the major characters in THE GOOD SISTER are remarkably wooden and unlikable. There is no one to root for in this book.The author also uses way too much exposition -- summarizing major events of the story instead of making them come alive scene by scene. The amount of exposition seems to increase as the story progresses. This leads to a rather bland reading experience.The novel eventually turns into a rather convoluted whodunit, but I didn't care less about the outcome, because I didn't like or relate to any of the characters.I realize that THE GOOD SISTER isn't supposed to be great literature, but I didn't find this book particularly entertaining as a beach read either. I've read much better stuff from Nora Roberts, Sandra Brown, Jackie Collins, and even Sidney Sheldon. My advice is to skip this book, and go with one of those writers instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good Sister is the Bad Novel","review":"This one started out with a lot of promise, but then died a slow and painful death caused by a severe identity crisis. Is it a psychological thriller, is it a romantic thriller, is it a mystery? Who knows. The novel is written-well, from sentence to sentence, but as an organic whole, it just does not work at all. The characters are beyond wooden, the dialogue is terrible, it was painful just to finish. Stay away. This one has no redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good Sister","review":"I bought this book because I have been reading all the books recommended by Kelly Ripa. I was very disappointed by the book. I didn't think it was an easy read. The book is broken up into parts. The first part was so technical and in so much detail that it did not keep my interest . Once the book reaches the third part (about 177 pages into the book) the story is really moving. Personally, I prefer a book that moves from the first page to the last page. I did not find it very romantic and I was actually able to figured out who done it about half way through. I have never been able to do that before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I really enjoy other Diana Diamond books I have read, so I was pretty bummed after I started this.For the first half of the book I kept going back and forth as to who the 'bad' sister was, but by the time it was revealed I didn't care anymore.I actually did not like either sister. I found them both weak, and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP THIS ONE!","review":"To say this is atrocious drivel is to pay it a compliment. Skip this book and save your money AND your time. Learn from MY mistake and pass this one up.Jennifer, the biz whiz and her actress sister Catherine have been rivals their entire lives. They are a year apart and despite the lavish gifts they received since childhood, there is that underlying resentment and rivalry.Jennifer marries this revolting excuse of a man named Padraig O'Connell. He has no saving grace. Natrually Catherine gets into the mix and the marriage goes bust. That was ONE favor Catherine granted Jennifer!Towards the end of the book, there is a battle to the death (and yeah, we do have a casualty here, folks) and the lackluster ending does nothing to enhance the book. There was not one single likable character in this atrocious book. There are no surprises, no shocks, no saving graces to be found. This book is a complete waste.I would not wish this book on anyone. This book belongs in the toilet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you entertained from page 1","review":"From the very first page of the book, when you are introduced to a very interesting pyschopath, this book keeps your attention.Just in the first few pages you learn that one sister blinded her other sister's baby doll so that her own doll would be the prettiest; broke her sister's ankle in junior high so that one would be on the field hockey team and the other would sit out the season; and sent out horrible emails about her sister and father to the business world so that her father would get mad at her sister. The one sister also admits that she tried to help kill her other sister. And that's just by page 11!How can you not go on reading? The writing is a breeze - this is an easy book to read - better than a stale Steele!Read it just for entertainment purposes - not for any deep meaning. This is a great book to read when you are busy doing other things (like getting ready for the holidays) because it gives you a break from the real world for a while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good info","review":"It is a rule book...I can not get too excited about it.

This book looked promising but was sadly disappointing. This one is not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Large Disappointment","review":"I was so excited about this book because I LOVE the \\"Dark\\" series and all the other non-Dark books Ms. Feehan has published. I understand that there are only so many Dark characters and books that can be published, but this book seemed too far fetched, even for me. I had to force myself to not only finish the book, but to even get half way through it. After about 150 pages the plot picked up then about 25 pages later I was again disappointed and the aburpt ending was a complete let down. Nomally, I recommend Ms. Feehan to anyone I see reading a book, but this is not a book I would recommend to anyone.I would not recommend you purchase this book if you have not already. However, as a truly devoted fan when the next book is released, and there WILL be a next book, I will give it another chance. Hopefully by then Ms. Feehan will have added her special flare that has made me wait with great anticipation for her next book. If not, then this is a series I will not continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice change of pace!","review":"I have to admit that I was getting a little bored by the Dark series (sorry, I loved them in the beginning, but they are starting to sound an awful lot alike) and I wasn't sure about the concept of this new book. I am SO glad I gave it a try. All the fun of the Dark series with a new twist, sizzling sex, and a slew of great men for future books. I'm hooked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Overwrought","review":"Disappointing. This novel was a very slow read. I was tempted to stop reading throughout the book. Too much time spent on how miserable everyone was. Excess of \\"shards of glass in the brain\\" type of writing. The romance dialog and scenes even had an overtone of misery. It was ultimately too much to deal with. I like the rest of Ms. Feehan's books but I don't expect to read the rest of this series. It's exhausting, and not in a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good new series","review":"I love most of the Carpathian novels, so I was hopeful that this new Feehan series would be good. I wasn't disappointed. I know some people find the story line awkward and convoluted but I enjoyed it.I thought the characterization of Lily and Ryland were believable and their love story was good.This book does set up the entire Ghostwalker series, so it is useful to start here, even if you don't end up reading the entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"New series - GREAT","review":"I love Christine Feehan's books about the Carpathians and I thought she couldn't get better.

You will love them too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read other \\"Game\\" books first","review":"I have found when reading a series of books that often I like the middle books much better than the very first one of the series. For that reason, I purposely avoided reading this book first and chose Deadly Game hoping for the author's more confident voice further into the series. I really enjoyed Deadly Game and pushed forward to this book. Wow, what a difference. This book felt like it plodded along. I really did not have a strong affinity for either of the main characters and was relieved when it was finally done. I will continue reading this series because I know the series gets better. I think you could completely skip this one and go on to still read the series and not miss much of anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Her Usual","review":"I read the second book in this series first, so thought I should go back and read this one for background. I am a Feehan fan, and have enjoyed her Dark series. I like the premise for this series, but she could have done so much more with the plot. It reads as if half the story was cut out to make room for the endless sex. I like good erotica as much as the next person, but after about the third time I just skipped over the steamy parts and looked for some story. Other reviewers have complained about Christine's repetition of phrases. Let me add \\"bare bottom\\" to the list. This was disappointing. Mind Game is better, and I am hoping the next book in the series improves even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment","review":"I am such a big fan of Christine Feehan. Discovered her early and wait impatiently for each new book. I think her Dark series is sexy,taut,different and totally consuming. I enjoyed The Scarletti Curse almost as much.

She repeats herself a lot in this book. I just found it kinda stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, but...","review":"the entire story is incoherent and disjointed. The story doesn't flow well and I especially hate the way it ends. (The last paragraph is rather crude, in my opinion).The hero and heroine are hardly believable in their actions. They fall into bed at the earliest opportunity and the heroine does some pretty dumb things when she's supposed to be a brilliant scientist. The heroine in Dark Desire (a much better book), a brilliant doctor, was much more believable and didn't give in nearly so fast.Don't get me wrong; I am a fan of Ms. Feehan -- particularly of her early Dark series -- but I can't say that I like the direction that her writing has been taking of late. Magic in the Wind (from Lover Beware) also had the same glaring faults as this novel and I could barely finish Lair of the Lion, I wanted to shake the stupid heroine to her senses!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Boring--2 1/2 Stars","review":"I've read ALL of Feehan's books and have reread many of them because I loved them so much. This story, however, was boring. I found myself skipping paragraphs then skipping pages. There were a lot of repetitive conversations and thoughts. Both Lily and Ryland thought the same things over and over. Also, although I find this shocking (coming from me) the sex scenes WERE redundant. It just got to be enough already. I really found it hard to believe that after Lily was punched in the face and slapped around and dragged by her hair, she would want to have sex that very same evening with Ryland. That's really stretching it.It was not as well written as her other stories. It's definitely not a re-read for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad....","review":"I LOVE Feehan books. I am constantly rereading the \\"Dark\\" books. I even order the Large Print to get them in hard back. HOWEVER, this \\"Shadow\\" book was at best a shadow of the \\"Dark\\" books, a faint shadow at that. A PAINFULLY BORING READ. I COULD BARELY GET THROUGH IT. For the first time ever in a Feehan book, I had to fast read (skimming over stuff) to get to the end. Oh Christine, tell me you're not succumbing to publisher pressure to \\"get the book out\\". So here's a 2 rating because you're Feehan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always awesome.","review":"As all her works, it hooked me from page one.

He had been making psychic soldiers, basically. Telepaths, telekinetics, dreamtalkers.It is discovered that she was also part of this project as they had been scouring the globe for talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe my expectations were too high","review":"I became an instant fan of Ms. Feehan with the first book I read from the Dark series. I would eagerly await each new book published. However, the last few books she has written have been very disappointing. Shadow Game has been the worst so far. The only thing that kept me turning the pages was the faint hope it would get better. I like the idea behind the book. Handled differently it could have been a winner. I hope Ms. Feehan goes back to what worked so well in the Dark series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time or money....","review":"The story was a great idea, but the dialogwas atrocious.

To my surprise, I really liked the concept. The main characters reminded me of those in \\"Dark Guardian\\" and \\"Dark Descent\\", maybe because the leading lady in this story also doesn't get dominated so easily by the leading male.

He's much happier in this vest.However, the one reviewer is quite right about the size. When we first got it, he was a chubby 26 lbs., and that small JUST zipped up.

We removed another a couple weeks later. After that she was swimming on her own and asked to swim without the vest (which she did!).These are not PFDs and are no substitute for adult supervision. We always, always swim with our kids when they wear these.

If there is any deficiency that I have found it is that they authors seem to begin more with the assumption that the barrows are of ancient celtic origin and work from there, rather than spending more time supporting their conclusions regarding their origin.

Second, you need to buy a 3/32 bit headphone adapter for normal stereo headphones are too large for this device. Next, for some reason, this mp4 player only charges for only 2 hours, as compared to the advertised charging time which is 6 hours. Lastly, you can't configure how you wish to playback each track. It will only playback the tracks based on the order in which you put in each song. So bascially avoid this item at all costs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one and save yourself the tylenol!","review":"I'm an experienced programmer who wanted to learn java and MS J++ 6.0. I made it half way through the first chapter when I gave up and decided to return the book. I'm sorry, if an author cannot get a hello world example correct as well as basic screen descriptions, it's not worth trying to figure it out. It seems obvious to me that the author has not tried his own exmples. It's as if he wasn't familiar with the subject matter prior to writing the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Everyone Wanting to Learn J++","review":"I got this book based upon the other glowing recommendations. I was VERY disappointed. This book is as dry as a text book. It jumps quickly from subject to subject. And you hardly ever code with this book! What ever happened to the idea of learning by doing? Perhaps you need to be experienced to like this book. Okay, but the cover says, \\"Begin as a novice...\\". Finally, there is no CD with the book - you have to go on-line to see examples. In general, this book is NOT the right book for EVERYONE, especially those new to J++."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Review - Lots of Bugs, But Lots of Information","review":"This book is driving me crazy! I'm up to page 564 and I find several more bugs in the examples presented. Since the book does not include a CD with bug-free working examples I am really tempted to knock on this book. It also frustrates me when an author prints source code that clearly has never been tested. But despite all the bugs, the book is fairly well written and covers many topics. It does a good job of explaining Java development for Windows, but is really poor at describing Java programming for platform independent applications. But then again I find Visual J++ to be a very poor development tool for platform independent applications. For that, purchase Borlands JBuilder 2 (it's a much cleaner environment). All in all, the book presents a lot of material in an easy to understand format, but don't expect many of the examples to work the first time. You will become an experienced Java programmer through the process of fixing the authors code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclear explanations with examples that don't work","review":"I'm a very experienced programmer (though not in VJ++) who found this book to be very difficult to use. I had to read some of the explanations three or four times to get at the meaning -- and that was in Chapter 2! Also, some examples were clearly wrong.

You may be able to save yourself the trouble of returning it (which is what I did.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This book tout's itself as \\"Open This Book as a Novice and finish It as a Pro\\". This is a VERY incorrect self-assesment. As a novice, I found that the sample code in the book was just plain wrong.

It probably would have been better titled \\"starting from the middle\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"One to miss","review":"I bought this book having no previous Java knowledge or experience, and have to admit that I found it to be of a poor standard. Maso moves too quickly between topics, leaving some necessary information to be poorly documented, or left out completely. In order to fully comprehend some of Maso's explanations, I actually ended up having to buy another book.The most annoying point that can be made regarding \\"Visual J++ From The Ground Up\\", however, is that many (if not even most) of the code listings are actually incorrect.

You also get more thread on the cone than some of the expensive brands - 3000 yards. The yarn is 100% polyester but feels like cotton. I've had no problems with thread breaks and its not too \\"hairy\\" which makes threading the needles and loopers easier. Maxilock places a product label inside the bottom of the cone so you can easily identify the color and dye lot of the thread when you need to purchase more. The thread doesn't slide off the spool so you don't need to use thread nets to keep it under control.Maxilock also makes a \\"Stetchy\\" thread which is the same as a wooly nylon, for soft and stretchy projects and for making a decorative edge. and a varigated version of the all-purpase thread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Early 30's Movies, But Not Really \\"Forbidden\\"","review":"This set should have been sold as a Bill Wellman (the director of all 6 movies) box set, not as Forbidden Hollywood.

But it was an older CD of John singing some of his favs, so it was well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn how to act, then learn how to sing....","review":"Wow. Rediculous. John needs to learn how to interpret a song, because right now it sounds like a kid trying to interpret Sondheim without ever leaving his house his whole life. He needs to sing simpler songs that have little to no emotional attachment, so he doesn't ruin them. Also, John needs to be his own artist and do them at least stylistically different than all the cast albums I own of the songs he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so upset","review":"I bought this CD because I trusted Amazons recommendations. I regret though that the CD is horrible. I have these songs already recorded mostly by the original cast. I was expecting John to bring new things to the songs, new feelings, arragments, something. But each song isn't any different than the original recordings. I am very dissapointed in this purchase. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Compilation!","review":"John Barrowman should go on Broadway and stay there, he has one of the best stage voices around, and is a commanding actor as well. Saw him as Bobby in Company at the Kennedy Center and he was magnificent. This CD is glorious.

He had a very sharp,powerful,clean and passionate voice during this performance. I decided I would like to have his music on CD so I ordered this CD from Amazon. It arrived yesterday and I have listened to it 3 times already!.He sings a great collection of Broadway songs that showcase his voice and talent. He includes some songs that are less known. I am glad that he introduced me to these songs. His version of \\"Tell My Father\\" from \\"THe Civil War\\" is sung with passion and love. Being a big fan of Sondheim, I am pleased Barrowman included some of my favorite Sondheim songs. I liked this CD so much that I just ordered his Cole Porter CD. Bravo John!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't you reveal what the song is trying to express","review":"Thankfully, I only borrowed this CD. Just as the John Barrowman that I saw in Miss Saigon, Phantom Sunset Boulevard and Hair, he continues to try and be JOHN BARROWMAN!!! Where are the characters and feelings that have been written for these songs? I would've have given you more or less, but at least you have a quality voice that would be so much better for B'way or the West End if you weren't so stuck on yourself. You could have better technique and musicianship, too!!!! Sing what the composer and lyricist wrote, portray what the book writer writes and you should have an accomplished performance that no one can fault, but until that day you are a pretty face that should not be on a sound only recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barrowman On Broadway: Fun, But Let's Butch It Up","review":"If you've seen the already cancelled NBC primetime soap \\"Titans,\\" then you know Barrowman has a tendency to overact. On stage, ie, \\"Sunset Boulevard,\\" he wasn't bad. He's got plenty of charisma and a legit-sounding Broadway voice. \\"Reflections,\\" to some extent, furthers that notion. He sings well. In particular, the ballads. But some of what he does is forced and therefore, turns favorite showtunes into effeminate piano bar ditties you're likely to find at some piano bar in Greenwich Village. Maybe, he should hire a vocal coach or acting teacher to help him \\"butch\\" things up. Or take in a David Campbell cabaret-show (this Aussie also plays the New York cabaret circuit)for pointers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Painful Painful......","review":"John Barrowmans singing voice hurts my ears. plain and simple. his singing of \\"Why God, Why\\" made all of us who know what true singing and true voice technique should be, double over and cry. his over-emoting, almost screechy voice is enough to make a deaf mans ears bleed.

However, the new type of valve does not hold in the air.

It would have been perfect had the valve worked properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"dimensions?","review":"Does anyone know the dimensions of this pool, nothing is listed in product description anywhere? Is it still a nice pool even though some cannot get it folded up?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this piece of trash!","review":"Neither my husband nor I could ever figure out how to get this dumb pool folded back into its container. The instructions imply it basically folds itself. If you're unlucky enough to get one that doesn't, you're out of luck, since the instructions don't tell you what to do if the sides don't \\"automatically\\" curl in the right position! The \\"easy springs\\" were bent and broken in just a few tries. A TOTAL RIPOFF!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this pool based on the durability. I have three boys and was tired of having to buy a new plastic pool every summer. The pool is great except for the fact that NO ONE tells you that you have to fill the pool up completely to get the sides to stay upright. I have a 10 month old and cannot fill the pool that much. If I had know this I would NOT have gotten it. Just bummed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Pool","review":"I just love this pool. I actually am on my second one! The first one last 3 years, so earlier this year I had to go out and buy a second one cause I just dont think that any other pool can compare to this one. Although I did buy my pool at Shopko and only spent $17 bucks max both times. It is easily worth 30-40 bucks! I have had no problem with the valve on ether pool, with the exception of my little ones playing with it and deflating it. Its even easy enough to pack up and take with you on a hot day if you go on a trip or even over to Nanna's house.I recommend this to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought this pool for my son a couple months ago, in May. It held up fine until a couple weeks ago, it had 3 holes in the top. Tried to patch them up, repair kit did not work. I do not recommend this pool, due to the inflatable top not lasting. I thought this pool would last and my son had a lot of fun in it for the little time he had it, but not worth the money. Better off buying a vinyl non-inflatable pool that will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, love it, love it.","review":"My 2 year old loves this pool. So do I!Easy set up, easy break down. With the threat of West Nile virus, we have to be able to empty it easily. The best part is he can \\"run and jump\\" into the pool and not hurt himself. He loves it when Mom tells him to empty the pool- just lay back over the sides.Wish it had a cover-- last year's baby pool turned upside down over the water works most days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!!","review":"We love this pool! It shipped very quickly and immediately we put it up in the backyard. I have a 3.5 and a 1.5 year old and needed something larger than a baby pool. Our neighbor brings her 8 month old to play too and he has a great time in it as well. It's very versatile for age, we just let some water out when the baby comes in.The sides don't stand up if it's not full, well really even then they don't stand up. It certainly doesn't bother the kids though, or the integrity of the pool. I love that it's so durable, we've had about a million blow up pools and none last past a month or so. This pool will far surpass that...not only will the sides never break but the plastic that the tube ring is made out of is super thick. You can let the air out of the tube in less than 10 second and folding it up (though it takes some practice) is very easy!All in all this pool is a great buy, especially for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Picardía","review":"Esta es una de mis obras favoritas. En ella Quevedo se muestra como un maestro en el manejo del lenguaje. Utilizando la técnica del conceptismo, la narración está repleta de juegos de palabras que logran un efecto de comicidad a lo largo de toda la obra. Es un texto muy divertido que asombra por la capacidad del autor de crear ambigüedad en el lenguaje, sugerir más de un sentido con una misma palabra y producir efectos hilarantes con el doble sentido del lenguaje. El protagonista, Don Pablos, como todo pícaro, pasa por una serie de experiencias que cuenta con desverguenza. Releo este libro una vez al año y es siempre como si lo leyera por primera vez.

Its comedy harkens back to a Noel Coward farce with witty dialogue and humor arising from the confusion of characters. Is there really a ghost or is she unconsciously looking to avoid marriage? And, if the ghost is real, what are his motives? I saw Dona Flor & her two husbands, and its heavy handed drawing of the two male characters as extreme stereotypes of all intellect or all sex, is, frankly, boring. I'd pick Kiss Me Goodbye anyday.

The sea monsters are basically magnified closeups of aquarium fish (yes, really) and the little plastic model of the submarine moving past the aquarium fish looks really bad. (Did they get that model out of a cereal box?) Ben \\"Run For Your Life\\" Gazarra is obnoxious and miscast. After achieving greatness in \\"The Wild Bunch\\" Ernest Borgnine is doing stuff like this and would soon be in another low budget film, \\"The Devil's Rain\\". Still, any Yvette Mimieux film isn't a total loss--and the Lalo Schiffrin title music is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Listening for few dollars!","review":"I love Bruch and this low cost cd features his first Violin Concerto. The playing is excellent and the interpretation of Rafael Khismatulin makes the cd worthwhile. The familiar Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E minor seems a bit lacking in spirit, but is competently done. The major problem with this cd is that the sound quality is not up to what one is used to in more expensive cd's. Not terrible, but it sounds a bit flattened out. The performances of the orchestra and soloists are fine, however, and if you want an excellent Bruch rendition, this cd is well worth its easy to take price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be a lot better","review":"Little Evil Things is a great concept. The music is well done, but the writing and voice acting could be a lot better.If you're expecting radio drama style production, this ain't it. These are (ostensibly) scary stories told by a narrator. There are occassionally other actors, but it's primarily first-person narrative with an evocative score throughout each story.The stories themselves are overwrought Twilight Zone clones that start well but end predictably. The voice acting is hit or miss. Some of the stories are well narrated, but others are pretty hokey.Again, it's a great concept that could be executed much better. Perhaps volumes IV and V improve on the idea, but I'm not willing to buy them to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"feels like a rushed debut","review":"nothing really interesting here beside the song \\"Revolution\\" which is a clever anthem sharing sentiments with Garbage's \\"Boys Wanna Fight\\". sounds like a studio-polished bar band, strong musicianship but the album overall is pretty bland... might appeal to blue october fans topically but not nearly as creative as \\"history for sale\\".

This cd not only inspired me to take up learning the guitar, but has also introduced me to the best Christian music artist around!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"getting better all the time","review":"With each new release, Steven Curtis Chapman expands his ability to express passion through his music. More and more he moves beyond the soft, contemplative, predictable songs of his early career and ventures into stronger lyrics and more soulful music. He hasn't quite hit his peak yet, but the growth is really starting to show.Edgier songs include Lord of the Dance, The Walk and Rubber Meets the Road, songs that challenge with their lyrics and motivate with their music. Some softer but equally good tunes include the moving Free and inspiring Let Us Pray. Most of the rest seem to hover in the vanilla zone, not bad but not outstanding either.Again, if I had rated this back in 1996, I probably would have given it 5 stars. Knowing how far along Chapman has progressed, and the level of his ability that this album represents, I give it a strong four.Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best music SCC has EVER done.","review":"This was the first cd I bought of SCC and was totally blown away.

It is obvious that James Pattreson did not write this book because it was not as creative and spellbounding as the first. I considered not reading the rest of the series because of the thrid book.

This book shows that he shouldn't try to write a women's character. The stuff Lindsay did in this book, no woman in her right mind would do. If your good friend confided in you that her husband was beating her, would you immediately get your girlfriends together and tell them??? No, most women would keep that in confidence until the right time. Then showing up at the guy's office and threatening him? I'd be so paranoid that the husband would go home & beat my friend even worse. Totally not believable.P.S. Claire is a total bore, why couldn't he kill her off?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing...","review":"If you like stories from the Hardy Boys mysteries then you will love this trashy, very poorly written book by James Patterson.Cleary written for women's book club circles this one by James actually starts out good but get's worse as the story goes on. I was almost laughing when reading \\"signed by 'August Spies'\\"multiple times throught the book.Obviously written for teens not adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the heck...","review":"... is going on here??? ...sorry, but I felt compelled to comment upon the ridiculous deluge of reviews which happen to mention The Ghost Country...this is NOT the forum to promote a book in such a way, and no amazon customer is, quite frankly, stupid enough not to realise when a person is logging reviews under multiple names. Shame on you, whoever you are! (Shame on you even more for boosting the average star-review for this dire book!)It looks as if they've all been removed now...which makes this review hugely irrelevant"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a good read","review":"James Patterson is always a good read, always an adventure. Great summer reading or anytime when it's a Patterson book"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an interesting series - #3 best so far","review":"I believe this third in the series is my favorite so far. It seemed there was a lot of every possible emotion involved. As time progresses, I believe I will continue on with the series. The books have some tension, some love, some sadness, just a bit of everything. Most enjoyable. And of course, our strong female character at the lead. Have to love that and strange from male authors who seem to get it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next to Lake House, this is his worst","review":"I have been a Patterson fan for quite a few years. I felt this book was rushed to get done. Flat...monotone. Terrible. Lake House felt the same way.

After reading Step on a Crack, I about gave up on Patterson; I thought it was maudlin and that his writing was \\"lazy\\"...relying on too many characters he had used in the past. I actually think that having a co-writer makes these stories better.

She's the only one at a formal reception not dressed for the party and although it is crowded, she \\"locks eyes\\" with the killer [who is in a tux by the way].

Overall, preposturious and painful to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditch the Ghostwriter!","review":"This book reads nothing like the earlier two in the \\"Woman's Murder Club\\" series. Calling it trite fluff is kind. I realize Mr. Patterson is a multi-millionaire, but allowing such dribble to be put out with his name on it is a quick way to lose his audience and his income. I pay for a novel by a particular, proven author and I expect it to be of the caliber of the past works of that author. Shame on you Mr. Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is She, A One-Woman Police Department?","review":"I lost interest in this one early on. First Lt. Boxer just happens to be outside the house when it blows up. Then she's the one who bravely runs into the inferno to rescue the child. Then she's the only one who's smart enough to figure out that the red backpack in the street outside the house might be dangerous. None of the fire personnel on the scene, and none of the cops, is smart enough to even think of this. Then, when it's time for the police department to do a press briefing on the exploding house, who does it? You got it, Lt. Boxer. And finally, when someone needs to be arrested across the bay in Berkeley, SHE'S the one who travels to Berkeley to make the arrest. Isn't there anyone else in the San Francisco Police Department who can do anything? I put this one down about a third of the way through and won't be picking it up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't spoil it for others","review":"I normally love reading the reviews - it helps me decide on a book when I'm going back and forth on my decision to buy it. Although I already knew I wanted to buy 3rd Degree, I checked out the reviews. A few posts ago, someone completely gave away a MAJOR twist in the book. I shouldn't even say \\"gave away\\" because that might mean they hinted at it and I figured it out -and that would be alright. But no, they flat out said what happened in the end. I seriously couldn't believe it.Everyone is entitled to say what they want, but this section is called \\"Reviews\\" and not \\"The Ending of the Book\\".

Nothing in this book is remotely original, and there is never a thrilling moment. With almost more chapters than pages, this 'quick read' is not worth any investment in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I enjoyed the first two books in this series, so pre-ordered 3rd Degree. Unfortunately, this third entry is more like an outline of a story than an actual novel. This time around the embarrassingly short three page \\"chapters\\" seem emptier of content, the characters are two-dimensional, and the implausible actions of the main character Lindsay Boxer are those of a comic book super hero. What were the authors thinking when they wrote this, and how could their editors accept this drivel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it was better than the Lake House.....","review":"but that's not saying much. It did keep me mildly interested, but I'm very glad I got it from the library rather than spend money on it.After being unable to even finish The Lake House I swore I'd never read Patterson again, but decided to give him another chance.

A burning house, three dead bodies and a missing baby set the stage to once again plunge Lindsay, Jill, Cindy and Claire into another case of murder and suspense. These three women have been to hell and back together and have grown and matured. I love the way Patterson has developed these heroines and has invested enough time and effort into each personality that you care about what happens to each of them.This time the girls are dealing with a killer who strikes every three days and it becomes a race to try to catch the killer and keep the body count at a minimum. On top of the frantic need to catch a murderer, one of the women is harboring a deep, dark secret, that will prove fatal. Which Murder Club member is it and what will happen to her? This one will keep you reading until you reach the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Patterson","review":"Haven't had time to read the book yey, but I love everything Patterson writes.Can't wait to start it. looking foward to reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Nothing is absolutely perfect, ergo the 4 stars, but this was very good.

Liked \\"2nd Chance.\\" Hated \\"3rd Degree.\\" Is it because this \\"Andrew Gross\\" person might have wrote it??? If you read \\"1st to Die\\" and immediately \\"3rd degree\\" afterwards, you would not believe that the same person wrote the two books. \\"3rd Degree\\" shouldn't even be part of the \\"Women's Murder Club\\" series since only one of the 4 characters has a major role and he kills one of them off. Perhaps if James Patterson writes the 4th novel in the series (without Andrew Gross), I might be interested to read it. Otherwise, I'll pass on this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW !! GREAT shocker!!!","review":"I still can't believe what he did !!!! This book is the best one I have read in a long time that made me STOP and say WHOA and re-read a certain part again!!! I also have a feeling this will continue with the way it ended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy, laughably fast","review":"This is the most poorly written books I have read in years. The dialog and behaviour of the hero has me laughing every couple pages (not good for a thriller) The 111 \\"chapters\\" are often one page long, which may tell you something. The romance between the characters develops in a matter of a couple hours. The plot is awkward, and flits from place to place as if they are trying to condense 1000 pages of plot into ten pages. The plot of even bad episodes of Law & Order have more content and hang together better than this. I am hoping that the problem is that the second author wrote most of this, since no bestselling author should write this badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & Predictable Thriller","review":"I have to agree with the other review that rates this book as lackluster and poorly written. I haven't read the others in the series, but since I wasn't real impressed with this one, I'm not rushing to buy another. Instead, I am re-reading the Jane Whitefield books by Thomas Perry; which offer a much superior series of thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather have the 3rd degree","review":"3rd Degree has all the elements to make it good: a good-looking, fast-talking female detective (Lindsay Boxer), a good-looking, fast-talking female reporter (Cindy), etc, etc, etc., all part of multiple plot lines involving Bad Guys Who Get What They Deserve, Handsome Sexy Good Guys and Blood and Sex.But it's completely implausible. Is the San Francisco Police Department so incompetent that Lindsay is the only one who can investigate? (No! It is not! I live in San Francisco and read and review San-Francisco based detective/crime/noir books and movies. The cops here are not idiots.) She goes everywhere and conducts all the interviews herself. The medical examiner, Claire, is the only one who does autopsies. The reporter, Cindy, appears to be the only employee at the newspaper. She writes all the stories and gets all the communications from the terrorists. Good thing or the plot would never move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extrememly amaturish writing","review":"I will not comment on the story, but the quality of the writing is poor. It needs to be edited by a 7th grade English teacher. I recommend that you go to the hardcover version on Amazon and use the \\"Look Inside\\" feature to read the first chapter. That will provide an example of the writing style so you can decide for yourself it is readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"3RD Degree","review":"For years I've read James Patterson and he never disappoints.

Ed Glosup"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a bad sequel","review":"As much as I've like some earlier writings, this seems like a half heart effort. It's typical Patterson plot, i.e., tragic event, single investigator getting over lost love, major tragic event, then good guys get bad guys just in time. Not only is this wearing thin, the chapters average about 3 pages. I bring this up because when you account for white space, the book is reads more like a short story than a novel. If you like reading a book a day, pick this one on a day you're really busy. Suggestion to Patterson - Break the pattern next time (example - write from the perspective of the \\"evil doer\\") and you're following will stay in tow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor story by usually reliable author","review":"I have enjoyed many of James Patterson's novels in the past, most notably The Beach House and The Jester. I had never read one of the Women's Murder Club series, but thought I would give it a try. What a disappointment! The story started out well, but quickly deteriorated. The love story was just terrible and very forced. The women don't really do anything useful to catch the killers, but just happen to be part of the law enforcement team that is after the spies. The ending was just awful with no new information, surprises, or excitement. The last few chapters were completely unnecessary and boring. I would not recommend this book and would suggest some of Patterson's other works instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didn't Like It-What Happened to Mr. Patterson here?","review":"This book started out interestingly enough, but after about 100 pages-it really bored me a lot. The pieces just didn't seem to fit together and the story took off in other strange directions that was difficult to relate to the first part of it. Frankly, it had me confused.The other books in this series were great, but James lost his touch on this one. For another thing, the characters were underdeveloped!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S A WOMEN'S WORLD","review":"The main plot of terrorists within the USA going after people they believe are harming the world is ok, but nothing really inventive. The story loses a great deal of crediblity when one of homicide detective Lindsay Boxer's friends is murdered and she is not pulled from the case. Heck, one of her other friends performs the autopsy as she watches.I wasn't a big fan of one of the main character themes in this book. Basically, it is written from the point of view that all men are either abusive and evil, or nice but stupid. Talk about sucking up to the women readership. Meh."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mystery here","review":"I always look forward to James Patterson's books, but this one was not up to par. It lacked suspense and for me was very predictable.

In this 3rd installement of the women's murder club 3rd degree is a book you dont want to put down. Each chapter leaves you wanting more i couldnt wait to see the ending. The part I did not expect was when they killed off the d.a jill. I didnt expect that to happen and although it isnt going to be the same main 4 characters I know he probably wouldnt have done it if he had to. so in all i give this book 5 out of 5 i highly recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this book.

Patterson is an excellent storyteller and all his other books I have read have been great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads Like a Lifetime Movie","review":"I've read the first three and do love Patterson's Alex Cross series.

What a colassal bore!!! He sold out the Women's Murder Club and put in this dribble with Lindsay falling in love - what?? One of the girls is gone forever and I found myself saying \\"so what?\\" How promising he made them in the first 2 books. Mr. Patterson totally missed me with this one. That means that he will have to earn my trust again. The next book of his that comes out, I will pick it up from the library - not spend my hard earned on it. I'm pulling for the next book.

This is not one of Patterson's best, but it is still an enjoyable way to kill a few hours. Speaking of killing, WMC fans will not be pleased about the pointless exit of one of the main characters, a fact that is not news to anyone who has seen ads for this book. It will be interesting to see what book 4 brings. Will the author just bump them off one at a time and end the series? I guess we will have to wait and see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile Disappointment","review":"This book is written at the sixth-grade level. Sentences are often simple declaratives. The characters are sticks that talk to each other, but reveal nothing but their inner selves or thoughts. Also written in the first-person.The book is a page turner, because each chapter begins half down the page, lasts all of one page, leaving the second page half empty. If consolidated, the book would have all of about 100 pages. There are 111 such chapters.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Goodie ...","review":"Clear your schedule, sit back, relax, and enjoy this little Patterson gem.

The pace is fast and smooth, with everything tying in together rather nicely for an efficient overall story package. I was a tad put off by a male author writing from a female character's point of view, but it works nonetheless for the most part. The suspense is taut, the action very visual, the emotions of the characters fairly real. A good little read. I'll happily seek more works by this author based on this first tale of his I've been granted the good fortune to read. Nicely done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naiive and destructive Professor Chomsky exposed","review":"This book sheds light articulately and in great detail on a man who has behaved so strangely and used rhetoric in such a destructive way for so long. After reading his book you will understand his sheeplike followers, but at the same time feel sorry for a man with such great, yet squandered potential who comes off, like his followers as strangely naive and spoiled. Professor Chomsky has done so much damage to this world and to America and it's important to understand how a man like this thinks and how he was able to create a movement based on lies about the very country that has adopted him and his family, made him wealthy and famous and allows him the very freedoms he uses to try to damage it with. This book succeeds in that endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ad hominum attacks reveal more about the writer","review":"This book is pretty amusing. Every time you read ad hominum attacks, such as those in this silly book, you realize how unsophisticated the writers are. Even more unsophisticated: dedicating a book to someone you hate! Now that's scholarship!Also amusing are the reviewers who spew hatred -- you really have to get a life! If your self-esteem was solid, you wouldn't be such a crybaby. Boo hoo."},{"rating":"1","title":"pot calls kettle.........","review":"What I find interesting here is the use of linguistic subterfuge in accusing Chomsky of linguistic subterfuge. If one chooses to read beyond the smoke and mirrors here one will be disappointed to find little else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imperialist Propaganda","review":"I have not read this book, and do not need to. After one reviewer compared Chomsky to Grima Wormtonge in The Lord of the Rings, I had to laugh. Any one who has read Chomsky will know that these pathetic attempts to undermine one of the only people who has a pretty clear idea of what is happening in the world today are just one more attempt by the imperialists to create misinformation. America is a country founded on genocide and control and the real apologists are those who would justify our terrorist actions agasinst the rest of the world. But for those readers who want to continue living in an ethnocentric fantasy world where America is a benevolent super power fighting evil terrorists, this book will probably provide plenty of self-deluding niceties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogical, misleading, childish","review":"This book is a childish attempt to discredit Chomsky's work by mischaracterizing him, name-callling, and knocking down straw men. The author is illogical, ignorant, and dishonest. I'll be honest -- I've only read a few chapters of this book. The first thing I saw when I flipped open the book at the library was a section called \\"Chomsky and the Jews\\". I immediately knew what type of crap I was in for -- your basic \\"not accepting Israeli government policy\\" <---> \\"hating Jews\\" argument. Then he went on to rip apart some arguments that Chomsky hadn't made, and used that as proof to show how irrational Chomsky is.Complete trash ... just some ignorant scumbag piggy-backing on Chomsky's notability to sell his poorly written book.Don't waste your money or time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beauty of free speech","review":"It's doubtful that Chomsky is concerned about being ignored by The New York Times these days, since he recently published a very long article there (\\"A Wall As A Weapon\\"). To the claim of Holocaust revisionism, I should say that I'm the son of a Holocaust survivor, so I take this seriously. This charge stems from an essay he wrote about free speech, which he allowed to be attached to a book by a French crackpot, who claimed that the Holocaust never happened. What Chomsky wrote in the essay is that (a) he hadn't read the book and (b) didn't think it was even worth reading. He went on to say that if we're in favor of free speech, we have to allow it precisely for views we despise, even without bothering to read them. The same hold true for this book. Free speech. Write whatever you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you want to practice reading","review":"I have read all of Chomsky's non-Lingistic work and feel that this book mis-represents him in every way it can. This book is simple, too simple, and as such, does not enlighten the reader as to either the man or what he stands for. I would suggest that the best way to hate Noam Chomsky is to understand him, by reading his books, listening to his speeches and reflecting on the ramifications of what he says and what he stands for, which does not include either the destruction of the US or Israel. The authors need a good dose of anger management and it is apparent in the plethora of hate-filed speech that fills it's pages, that this is a work that did not need to be written as all it seems to do is induce people to find out what all the hoopla is about. Ironic, which is why the mainstream ignores him rather than rants about him. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exposing the unhinged","review":"This book is a \\"must-read\\" for those only somewhat familiar with Chomsky's unhinged anti-American and anti-Semitic rantings of the past few decades. For the rest of us, it is an insightfully entertaining, well written and cogent counterpoint to the remarkably arrogant and idiotic positions taken by Chomsky and his minions of the radical left."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"There are lots of crazy books like this which don't let facts get in the way of trying to discredit a person or idea to further the authur(s) own agenda. But the worst part of this book is that it is boring. Uninspired truely a painfull book to get through. good if you have trouble sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on You for Even Considering This Book Worth Reading","review":"The other reviewers here say it best when this book is a representation of the sad state of affairs for people who are unwilling to look in themselves and ask what they are responsible for and what they can do. It is a far easier thing to blame everyone else for being \\"anti-American\\" than look at what policies you support that cause this \\"anti-Americanism\\" to result.In addition, look at the language here. Those against this book are quite specific with their criticism. Those who support it are quite general and rely on catch-phrase slogans and name calling to, in their minds, get a point across. It is to the people who are like the latter that will probably find appeal in this text--one that does not pay attention to facts and details AND fails to accomplish anything other than mudslinging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal or Conservative is not the issue!","review":"Notice how none of this book refutes any of Chomsky's claims.

This book is so full of propaganda and crappy refutation it's pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"My God!!!!!!!!","review":"After reading some excepts from this obvious monstrosity of a book, and some of the reviews, I was tempted to write an in-depth defense of Chomsky's views. However, since I am short of time, and hope that my defense could possibly alter the weltanschauung of Chomsky's critics (a generous label for many of them I know) I will leave the reader with this quote from Bertrand Russell about another controversial Jewish philosopher: \\"Spinoza is the noblest and most lovable of the great philosophers...ethically he is supreme...As a natural consequence, he was considered, during his lifetime...a man of appalling wickedness.\\" I think this should tell you all you need to know about those who depict Chomsky as immoral and wicked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Tripe","review":"I own this book with about 25 other Chomsky books. Anyone familiar with his works will notice how things are distorted out of context to the point of absurdity. Equating anti-America and anti-Israel simply because he speaks out against the abuses of the two governments is a petty play on words.Im not going to bother doing anything but urging people to read up on the workds of Chomsky and compare it with this book. The lies, distortions and pathetic attempt to demonize Noam is ridiculous. Every claim in this book has been addressed. All the readers have to do is look and see the truth for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great fiction book","review":"This book is an outstanding effort to deface Noam Chomsky. This book could be used by both extremes. For the right, it could be useful if you have never read anything by Noam Chomsky and want to misunderstand his work. But save yourself $10 and just say \\"he's an anti American traitor that hates America and the freedom we represent.\\" That recycled rhetoric is free and your friends will be impressed. I'll give an example of the misunderstandings that the book presents: Horowitz calls Chomsky a Holocaust denier because Chomsky wrote a foreward about \\"free speech\\" that appears in a book written by a Holocaust denier. For the \\"Chomsky cultists,\\" the book might lead you to search out some of the documents that Chomsky sites and check his sources for yourself. But unfortunately, if you have read a lot of Chomsky material, you'll realize that the book is full of purposeful misinterprertations or naive misunderstandings, and it is not well written or organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rabid hatred, distortions and lies","review":"This book is nothing but a straw man. Please make yourself a favor and read some real Chomsky. He is one of the greatest thinkers of all time, and one of the most humane personalities you'll ever meet. His optimism, honesty, sense of justice and relentless battle against tyranny has been amazing. This book is real garbage, and anyone with an IQ above room temperature and some sense of morality, will realize from all the kicking and screaming, the rabid, insulting tone, that this book is very suspicious.

The arguments are very superficial. For example, the book makes a big deal about Chomsky supporting a man losing his free speech. This is an old story, pretty much the only story a lot of the media ever covered on the one of the world's greatest intellectuals. You can be in support of someone's freespeech and not support their views--plain and simple. Enough said.The other arguments leave out the whole picture and are pretty invaluable. This book might make some feel better that they don't read Chomsky but that's because they can't look at themselves and their own country becuase they're drones of some kind.

Their attempt to construct any valuable argument has been so badly woven, the book reads more like a bad comedy than a political argument.The purpose is clear, and so is the technique. In order to try and refute Chomsky's monumental body of work, these two scream, and whine, and yelp in a common tactic of the most rancid far-right: invent as much garbage as you can and throw it around. Somebody may even believe it, even if only part of it.The result of the authors' clumsy tantrum is hardly worthy of a couple of pre-school kids.

No need to waste your time with this joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"proof of anti-Americanism?","review":"The idea of attempting to \\"analyze Chomsky's intellectual career and the evolution of his anti-Americanism\\" is not much of a goal to set out on. What exactly does \\"anti-Americanism\\" mean, beyond a paranoid way of saying \\"political critique of one's own country\\"? Using the term \\"anti-Americanism\\" as if it means anything is dangerous, as has been demonstrated by the history of investigations of un-American activities. Not to mention that Chomsky's critiques extend past America to other countries, first and foremost, Israel. The only valid use of the term \\"anti-Americanism\\" which I can imagine would be to refer to people elsewhere who blame all problems on Americans, and fail to see their own contributions to problems and those of their governments. But to use the term when talking about an American citizen, who clearly likes some things about this country (the dude still lives here!) is ridiculous. Critiquing government policies is never anti-American."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny","review":"Horowits and Derschowitz ,,both much less smarter than chomsky,it seems to me, after failing to get anything done in their books, finally turned to attacking the one of the smartest and the most honest man in the world.

That is irrational.It would do us all good to shelve the \\"well Limbaugh said, well Franken opined\\" ideologies and instead focus on facts, and a collective search for the truth for the benefit of all. Because in the end, I've got a revelation for all Americans: It's not about you and your ideas. It's not about me and my opinions. It's about all of us working together for the good of all humanity.And bitter, sensationalist, Jerry Springer show hack jobs like this do nothing to further that cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete slander of a humanitarian thinker","review":"Aside from the fact that the publisher of this book, Encounter Books, is affiliated with the Project for a New American Century, the think tank that staffs the Bush White House and created its post-9/11 foreign policy of pre-emptive war, the axis of evil, and everything else Bush relies on to fight the war on terror, a full year BEFORE 9/11, the book is also full of complete misrepresentation. Chomsky never sided with that lunatic French author who denied the holocaust. He never denied Pol Pot's atrocities. He is not anti-American. He only asks Americans to apply the same standards to themselves as they apply to other nations. When we do that, we discover that, often times, our government deceives us into believing we are the moral crusaders of the planet, while we bomb civilians into ash and support death squads and dictatorships across the planet.

Like another reviewer has said, Chomsky's main work is cataloging facts largely ignored by mass media. He actually shows a reluctance even to state his own opinion. Rather, he quotes, US government officials or documents -- rather than listening to spokespersons and their media stenographs -- to try to find out what the US government is really thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious","review":"This edited volume features an assortment of ex-leftists and Zionists throwing everything at Chomsky, including the kitchen sink.

Big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"More rant than objective review","review":"There are a ton of reviews here about this that go on and on and on. I am sure they have put all of you to sleep. YAWN. This material is so subjective, that I doubt any review can do anything this personal justice.My feeling on this book is simple - It seemed and read more like a \\"We don't like Chomsky, so we are going to rip apart everything he has ever said or written\\".I do not feel it was honest analysis. It felt like two angry little children trying to cash in on the Chomsky name. It felt more like two little kids using big words, yet, essentially saying, \\"Not uh, Not uh. See, I told you so.\\" and nothing more than that.Was it boring. YES! Wow, I think reading every DVD player installation manual ever printed would have been more enjoyable. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"badge of honor","review":"David Horowitz is obsessed with Noam. Mostly, his jealousy comes from the realization that he will never be on the same level as Chomsky as a scholar. Horowitz has some of the most dispicable views possible. He stated at Villanova Law School a few years ago that it was okay that three million Native Americans were killed because they would not have contributed anything of value to the world anyway. For a man like Horowitz to hate Chomsky, Noam should think of it as a badge of honor. Horowitz sends people to Chomsky's talks.If you want to read Chomsky, it wouldn't be hard to go elsewhere, he unlike Horowitz is the most cited human being alive. Read Daniel Dennett's book on Chomsky where he considers Darwin and Chomsky two of the most improtant scientists of all time. Read Gilbert Harman's take on him, a professor from Princeton's philosophy department. Horowitz elevates his status by going after Chomsky. There will never be an anti-Horowitz book because he doesn't matter that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"It says it all...","review":"This book lays it out well: Chomsky is a pretentious intellectual who thinks his bit of success w/ linguistics gives license to pontificate on any subject that crosses his path. For additional insight, consult Paul Johnson's \\"Intellectuals\\", the last chapter.Chomsky has written things that only self-involved, small-minded 15 year olds, or the mental equivalent, would find compelling. Take notice, this is an excellent text that outlines the man's considerable errors. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"intellectual honesty or slander?","review":"Polemicists seeking to slander Chomsky regardless of facts might take pleasure in this work. But, knowing Chomsky personally and having read his works thoroughly, this book misrepresents his arguments to create a pastiche bearing no resemblance to the man or his ideas. Chomsky never relished 9/11. The scion of Hebrew scholars, he hardly hates Israel. Indeed, he briefly lived on a kibbutz there in the 1950s. He does see Israel possessing significant freedoms and a press more vibrant than America's, but is also very critical of Israeli policy toward Palestinians and presents arguments to that end in the tradition of Avi Shlaim.While one can certainly disagree with Professor Chomsky's ideas, this book is hardly the place to familiarize oneself with them. It is more in the tradition of tabloid than scholarship. For those seeking intellectually honest critiques I suggest looking elsewhere...."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic character assassination","review":"After reading this book its plain that what we have here is a character assassination against a great patriot and teller of truth with encyclopedic details of American foreign policy.

This sort of censorship is ridiculous, and serves no purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a performer!","review":"I saw Ben Folds for the first time in London, when he toured with Neil Hannon (Divine Comedy), and was knocked out my his performance. This CD, is a great summary of his live solo show, and it is wonderful to see his brilliant piano playing and audience working, on the DVD.The only artist that makes me do air piano!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds Best","review":"Ben Folds has always been mediocre in my mind. That is, until I heard Ben Folds Live. Listening to Ben Folds without drums and guitar is an entirely different experience. It's raw, expressive, and more accurately captures the music's humor and intensity. Now I love Ben Folds, his witty lyrics and awesome piano tunes are always playing in my car. But the music isn't the only reason this cd is great, the stories and audience interaction also adds to the album's amazing, \\"organic\\" feel. By the end of the cd, you'll think you really know Ben Folds. You get insight into his music, life, and personallity, adding even more to the musical experience. You will not find another cd that connects the artist so directly with the listner. I only wish I was at the actual concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD great .. what DVD?","review":"Having just seen Ben Folds the prior week supporting Tori this CD is a very good rendition of the concert experience. To date though I have been sent two discs that do not include the bonus DVD, I'm pretty doubtful that it's even available at this time. but this disc is worth it for the performance alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This CD is the best Ben Fold's has ever released, summing a truely inspirational career in music with Ben Folds Five and now alone. With nothing but a piano, he captures you from first track to last in ways many, if not most bands can't even dream of doing. Ben Folds has given the new younger generations one music outlet that is truely based on musical and creative talent. Let us only hope that CD is far from being the last we hear from Folds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. My favorite live cd.","review":"this cd is fantastic, the recording and how Ben works with the audience (see Army) is just great. I saw him over the summer w/ rufus wainwright and guster and he did Army the same way he did on this cd and it was just one of those moments that will live with you forever, it was just so cool. and he is jsut as good live like that as he is on this cd. my favoirte song on this cd is probably his version of Emaline or One Down such fantastic songs, i recommend this cd to all ben folds(five) fans and fans not of ben even"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds Live is a pleasant surprise","review":"I went to see Ben Folds with my son and his girlfriend, not knowing exactly what to expect. His show is a marvelous experience and I bought the CD right afterwards.The bonus of being able to really hear the lyrics makes this CD an excellent reminder of his talent and performances.He uses his occasionally sarcastic wit on several songs (the opener One Angry Dwarf...) is a classic. The narrative tracks, \\"Army\\", \\"Philosophy\\" and \\"One Down\\" are appealing, both lyrically and melodically. The ballads have beautiful lyrics, in particular \\"Brick\\" and \\"The Luckiest\\". Another song that I think has a lot of substance to it is \\"Not the Same\\".I know that Ben Folds has experimented musically on other CDs, this one is a very good introduction to his style. The only thing that I can fault is that they left off the Ali/Cosell tribute, \\"Boxing\\". Add that and this is near perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I urge you not to buy this cd.","review":"I went to the show in St. Louis last summer, and it was OK. Little did I know that the show was repeated verbatim all over the country. I am a big Ben Folds fan, and he's great...but quite hollow by himself. There's just something missing. I might feel differently had I not seen the show, but as I did, this CD is incredibly boring and lifeless, and the DVD is no better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"So I got this cd a while back. I really like it. Its just a great album to sit back and relax to. It's a beautiful album and it shows how good Ben's songs solo and with the five really are. These songs stand alone with just Ben and a piano. That's a pretty big feat to accomplish. The cover of Tiny dancer is great, but the highlight of the album is \\"Brick\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds: Lyrical Genius, Piano Mastermind","review":"The Ben Folds Live CD/DVD is a piano soloist masterpiece. Ben truely takes you into one of his renowned live performances, without sacrificing audio quality. There is humor, there is music, there is absolute genius. Congrats Ben on one of the few CD's that actually deserves to be bought in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Makes it All Worthwhile","review":"As a die-hard Ben Folds/Five fan, I bought this album with great anticipation and was not disapointed. The CD itself is great from a collector's standpoint, though noticably lacking some of the musical fullness of Ben Folds other recordings. I would definitely not reccoment this for those unfamiliar with Folds (buy the self-titled Ben Folds Five cd to hear him at his best), but for anyone who likes this amazing performer already, the DVD clips of his concerts are spectacular-not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds Breaks Away","review":"When anyone hears the name Ben Folds, they instantly wonder \\"Where's the 'Five'\\". \\"Ben Folds Live\\" does not need the question.\\"Ben Folds Live\\" is essential for one who wants to explore the music of this talented muscian, but doesn't want to wade through previously released albums to find it. You can hear the songs you know and love, then explore and love the songs you don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"How is he so good?","review":"Just like anyone else, I guess there are some songs I would rather have seen on the CD and DVD, but other than that, I can't say a single bad thing about this set. I've seen Ben Folds live a couple of times now, and his shows are honestly the best I've ever been to. What you finally get a hint of in this CD is his incredible sense of humor; I would have bought the whole thing just for the last track on the DVD. Anyway, if you're a fan of Ben Folds I'm sure you already know to get this CD. If you aren't a fan yet, then go to a show and you will be. And those unlucky not-yet-fans who don't have the oppotunity to go to a show should buy the CD anyway so they can see what they are missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem from Ben!","review":"This is a fantastic CD that once again proves that Ben is the most gifted live performer alive today. The recording is superb, and on a good system makes you feel like you're sitting right in front of his piano watching him work. In addition to the songs themselves there are a number of extended solos where Ben's piano mastery really shines, and his vocals are impeccable, even on those notes that you know from singing along with him, are hard to hit. The audience also really plays well into this album as they take the part of sax and trumpet, as well as chorus on a few tracks. All in all, this is simply a fantastic CD from start to finish. I am looking forward to the day when Ben comes to Minneapolis or St. Paul so I can go and be mezmerized like I was when I played this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat!","review":"I LOVE this CD. That really says it all. I am now listening to it for the first time. That's right, I have not even finished the CD once and felt compelled to give it an excellent rating already. I am usually not a fan of live cd's, but Ben does a great job. The piano sounds great, Ben is having a good time and the crowd supplies just the right amount of energy without being overbearing.

I'm a big fan of working-class organizing, but Mort simply ignores all sorts of challenges facing the modern labor movement, particularly the ongoing role of race and citizenship. One contributor relates a story of flying to Bangladesh to meet with workers there and returning determined to start them a union -- reinforcing not only a historical pattern of white \\"social uplift\\" but also reflecting the AFL-CIO's narrow idea of establishing unions rather than organizing the working class -- not all of whom might be currently employed or in traditional jobs.A useful book on the modern labor movement requires a certain amount of distance, to say nothing of an awareness of the complexities of class, race and nationality. This simply isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much vibration","review":"I am very disappointed with the vibration of the light reflector. The unit is mounted fine and exhibits no vibration.

It did the job but for its size it's noisy - could be the loose fit of the plastic grille. After about 6 months the fan quit, though the light continued to work. We finally got around to checking it out yesterday and the problem is the unit itself, not the wiring to the switch as we'd hoped. For much less than a year of use I feel this Broan fan was a terrible value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading description","review":"Amazon's description is deceptive and fraud-based. The description clearly indicates that this fan has a 100 watt light and a 7 watt nightlight. You find out, however, upon receipt, that that option is only available on one of the 3 options, so the main description is, in fact, untrue. This fan, as shown, has a 100 watt light. There is no nightlight. If you wanted the product that is described, you would have to purchase a round light, which, if you read the reviews, is so noisy, that you have to shim the cover to keep it from rattling. So, the fan that is described, is actually quite a bit more expensive than the fan depicted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisey","review":"I bought this product to replace the one that was installed in my bathroom but made too much noise. 6 month later and this one is making the same racket.

I've also had to replace the motor 3 times so at $65 per replacement motor this $100+ fan is now over $300.

I never thought I'd write one, but one day, inspired by maybe my third reading of this book, I did.The lessons and especially the examples in this book are good for beginning and intermediate poets, though even advanced poets can learn or have their knowledge refreshed by reading the very sane, very straight-forward advice.

I quite never understood the need to do epic concept albums based on books, Journey to the Center of the Earth, King Arthur......also never understood why he just never did music and associated it to a new idea, something he had uncovered himself. Yes did this many times. At any rate, Rick is a good classical pianist and has good stage presence, and is funny at times. During the video, he makes note of some crafty stage workings gone dreadfully wrong and has a good story about it. I was a little unsatisfied why he chose to do two medly of YES pieces, \\"Wonderous Stories, and AND you and I , but left out the major keyboard middle part of And You and I\\"....All in All, the rest of the video is nice, and Rick does a decent job of Talk/Play roll playing here, and nice to see he still can perform..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good playing, few funny stories","review":"I was under the impression that this show was in the same format as that of the one-man shows that Rick has done throughout the Eastern US in the fall of 2003 (\\"The Other Side of Rick Wakeman\\"). Sadly, while in the introduction he says he will be telling many true and funny stories, there are either non-existent or have been cut out of the DVD. 95% of the video is just him playing his best-known pieces. He only tells one full-length story (of being drunk on stage in Seattle in 1976).If you are a fan of Rick's music, you won't be disappointed by the musicianship of this DVD. But if you're looking for a video full of hysterical anecdotes, go see him live instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a legend!","review":"The only way to describe this dvd/cd set is \\"perfect\\". The cd features the music tracks from the dvd concert. The dvd also features some bonus studio tracks. Overall, you get a lot of music. Also, Rick Wakeman tells jokes and stories between the songs on the dvd which are quite humorous. The concert features Rick alone playing keyboards, and on two tracks, a recorded orchestra backing track plays, but this does not cheapen the performance. It's not the long haired caped crusader from the 1970's, but if you're a fan of his later work, you'll enjoy this. The style of the performance parallels his Classical Connection albums and the Piano Tour album. [My only complaint about the whole concert is that there are bird sounds played in the background on his \\"Birdman of Alcatraz\\" track, but I'll let him get away with it this time!] My favorite Rick Wakeman dvd to date!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"If Rick hadn't been one of the all time great keyboard players he could have been a great stand up comedian.

The DVD is ok in that you get to see the master in action. But Rick Wakeman is more for the ears than the eyes. The set looks a lot like the \\"Who Wants to Be A Millionaire\\" set. This is all you see, along with Rick's keyboards and such. Sure he tells jokes, but his accent's heavy and it is English humor afterall.

It is the UK CD2.The alternate version is forgettable, but the remix of the title track, with its saucy flavour, earns its place on the CD.\\"Like a Swimmer\\" is a lovely mellow vocal piece with warm synths, various percussion, and trumpet. For me, this is one of the most rewarding discoveries on an Underworld single. It's rare to get such an excellent chillout track from Underworld, so it makes a nice addition to any Underworld collection. Keep them coming!

There is not one singe hexagram which states in its line structure that you should \\"trust the Cosmic Order.\\" The hexagrams reflect prevailing circumstances, and the rest comes from us. Carol Anthony's book belongs with the self-help genre. It reflects, not the oracle, but her own ideals, biases, and agenda. It reflects her. This is a book of pure projection.

Their songs aren't incredibly long, so they are generally straight to the point. And they also seem to be on the more extreme sides of the spectrum than Opeth. The growling is much more sharp than Akerfeldt's, and the clean singing hits higher notes. The same goes for the other instruments, when it's hard, it's hard, and when it's soft it's really jazzy.Overall, not a bad start.

Aside from the fact that the narrative itself is about as boring as a high school history text; Clancy can't seem to decide whether he wants to actually tell the story of Special Ops Forces, or offer a platform for a dry and uninspiring autobiography of Carl Stiner. The reader is repeatedly assaulted with poorly camouflaged whining about the \\"big\\" Army mistreatment and misunderstanding of SF.

The accounts of combat are sparse and most of them I've seen before in other places. Actual facts about Special Forces techniques, training, equipment, roles, and missions are not real prominent in this book which makes you wonder why it's even worth the time.

Apparently quite a few because it goes on and on ad nauseum. I lost interest and started skimming the book about halfway through.

Also, good with just a touch of hot cocoa, added along with Altoids, in coffee. And yes, they are good in hot cocoa, too.

I understand that this is a college level book but it didn't need to use so much jargon. The paragraphs are almost impossible to decipher on the first, second, or even third read. The author obviously had to use ambigious language to make himself seem more academic. When explaining the works of Goya they devote an entire chapter to him. Pages upon pages which in reality could have been truncated down to perhaps 3 or 4. The pictures are on one page and the explanation of the pictures can be PAGES away.

As a beginners' book, it's disappointing to find installation of the database pushed all the way back to chapter 7, and with that the chapter starts by saying that a full coverage of installations is beyond the scope of this book!

Frankly, my brother and I made home movies with 'special effects' like that when we were 12!

Not even collaborators like Robbie Robertson ever received such praise from Bob. As always, Gene's romanticism (\\"With Tomorow\\") and full-hearted writing are moving throughout.

The first few experiments were very simple and easy for her to do on her own; I just served as supervisor.

She seemed a little disappointed with some of the experiments at first; I think she was expecting grand explosions and chemical reactions. But she did have fun measuring and mixing. And enough ingredients were supplied so that she was able to do the experiments again on her own. So it definitely provided hours of entertainment for her, and that made it a worthwhile buy. Some of the lessons were beyond her, so I'm not too sure how much she actually learned/absorbed. But it was a great hands-on introduction to science."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blowing away experiment.","review":"This kit was a good way for my sister to learn a lot about science.

The fact that when my ten year old son opened the box and said, \\"Where is the rest of it?\\" should say it all. I am a microbiologist, but I thought this would be a good way to introduce my children to science without boring them to tears. Instead, I spent most of the time explaining why you shouldn't do what this kit says and you definitely should not use those petri dishes, and how you of course are not carrying around that much fungus on your fingers! I suggest getting a book from the library if you would like to do some science experiments with your kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter thinks it is awesome!","review":"Good little science kit!

The pieces seem impervious to both his and his 1 year old sisters misuse of them (walking on and chewing on).

From the opening note of the title song you are hooked by the pure power of the rythm guitars. Marc Storace of Krokus fame sounds fine on every song.

It is typical modern UN-melodic American garbage that only fools latch onto. Marc Storace sounds ok but the guitar solos are weak and the songs even weaker.

This book is not amusing, the plot is transparent and the characters are one-dimentional. The premise is plausible enough and Charleston is always a good setting, but there is nothing after that. Our heroine's mother is kidnapped, but does she involve the police?; of course not. She does continue having tete-e-tete's with the city's socialites and dropping into the best restaurants, although she never seems to eat a meal. All in all this was one of the worse books I have read in some time. I finished it just to see if there was some saving grace somewhere. There wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked out of the box","review":"This didn't even work out of the box. I followed the instructions and..... NOTHING!

Thankfully my expectations were very low due to the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Documentary: The Geisha","review":"A very comprehensive work on the world of the Geisha. The format is understandable. Various perspectives of geisha life were represented such as that of the client, the geisha mother, the young geisha in training and the modern accomplished geisha: this was very enlightening and shed great insight into traditional Japanese culture. Some of the comments made by the male American author seemed a little too steeped in Western preoccupation with sex, but overall the film was very informational and sincere. A great film to show to high school students studying world cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Mesmerizing","review":"After reading Memoirs of A Geisha a year ago, I became obsessed with Geishas and Japanese culture altogether. Since I didn't have A&E on my basic cable system, I was disheartened to have missed this documentary when it was first shown. Discovering that it was available to the public here on Amazon, I quickly snatched it up. I was extremely excited to hear firsthand what Liz Dalby (author of Geisha which I also have read) had to say on film, along with Arthur Golden (author of Memoirs of a Geisha). I was completely fascinated throughout the entire video. It is a shame that the Japanese today aren't investing their time, much less interested in preserving their culture. Geishas are a national treasure to Japan and they are losing out to technology, materialism and self-absorbtion. I would hate to see this part of Japanese history and culture go the way of the dinosaurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful look into the tradition of Geisha!","review":"This is an interesting look into the life of the modern day Geisha. I highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in this secretive underworld. Steeped in tradition, the Geisha is a living paradox: Incredible beauty, the ultimate symbol of prestige, operating under a code of silence and borderline abusive conditions for the girls. This documentary features interviews with modern Maiko (apprentice Geisha) as well as an overview of the history and a look at some of the changes over the past century. Author Arthur Golden (\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\") speaks about his rare outsider's peek into this closed and exotic world. Beautifully shot, with lovely voiceover work by Susan Sarandon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Target Discus","review":"The discus arrived in time for my grandson's birthday and he was thrilled with it and the bag I got to go with it.

What I really like about this volume and the series in whole are the relationships between the characters. As well as thier individual development. With this volume in particular the trust between Ayato and the people around him are really pushed to the limits. And this volume does a great job with this all while keeping the story interesting. That's what makes me really like this anime series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crying shame...","review":"RahXephon has slugged along at a steady rate, giving viewers little to adhere to, or be enthralled by outside of the incredible artwork. This DVD does provide some backstory, but doesn't tie in how any of it works, or why we should care. After these episodes I felt enlightened...but I am not sure why because the motivations and reasons for any of the histories or characters involved is immaterial. A lack of connection between events and reactions takes its toll worse in this disc then almost any other. The affairs in love and politics around the Earth defense forces doesn't get properly established most times to warrant a great pay off, and the same is true for almost any situation in every episode of the series to this point. Where it is going is secondary, I am just watching the incredible art and allowing the room temperature writing to wash over me as I wait for a 'shocking' resolve to WHATEVER is going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first and best guide to the Goons","review":"Roger Wilmut is a great chronicler of 20th Century British comedy. All his books are worth reading, and this one-- a concise, well-written guide to the BBC's peerless Goon Show-- is no exception. Meticulous research and intelligent evaluation all in one package."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit dry, but an essential reference for fanatics","review":"I first bought this as a spotty teenage goon fan in the late 1970s. It's still probably the best systematic guide to the show, carefully listing the shows by name, and providing the alternative names when they were not coherently announced. What I particularly enjoyed was his analysis of the characters - the tendency of them to pair up [with the notable exeception of Bloodnok] and the decline of Moriarty as the shows progressed. He also gives due regard to the importance of Secombe/Seagoon in the mix - something ofen overlooked by fans. Wilmut writes well, if a little dryly at times. The book could have done with more anecdotes about the show - a lack which indicates an absence of input from the principal participants. It's now about 20 years since it was first published, and the book probably does need an update. But this is still the most essential guide to a show that revolutionised comedy, even if the humour has now dated somewhat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disipionting","review":"I would have though NationalGeographic would have gone in to more detail on the subject.

Ripley Forte is the perfect hero of the day. Texas shines as the centerpiece of the novel, because she is truly a state where this might have happened. No its not the best novel ever written, but its catchy, exciting, a little intrigue, just the sort of thing for a great summer read. One Caveat, while the books can be read apart, the best read is in unison. Get all three and enjoy the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"This book was hideous. The only book that I have reviewed on Amazon that I hold in as great disdain is the \\"Ayes of Texas\\" also by Daniel da Cruz. As is true with the other novel this book is so full of clichés, stereotypes and impossible science to make even a callous reader become nauseas.Basically Texas is an independent country and must fight those evil Russians who control the rest of the world for all practical purposes.

The painful stories Miss Lonelyhearts receive often have a grotesque dimension but also may touch the heart. The novel's ironic play with its hero who is at once fake and real sufferer, sympathizer and exploiter makes it difficult for the reader to know how exactly to take it. The writing has a violence and power in it but its tragic story too somehow misses to make its fullest case in sympathy, for Miss Lonelyhearts appears somehow real and unreal at once.The work of a brilliant but deeply disturbed young writer whose life and work had no second act."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a step up from p90X","review":"There are four DVD workouts in the P90X+ series and one supplemental workout.Upper PlusTotal Body PlusUpper PlusIntervals PlusKenpo Cardio PlusAbs/Core PlusThese are some serious workouts.

My experience is that it focuses more on core and overall fitness and less on muscle building, promoting a lean muscularity. There are many high rep exercises that continue for a period of time, which translates into a lot of reps (i.e., far more than the 8-10 reps that optimally build muscle mass). I have achieved good results doing a full 90 day P90X cycle to bulk up, then doing a month of P90X plus to cut and lean out.

Plus is a huge disappointment compared to their classic series. Just as most of the other reviewers stated, Beachbody's motive for Plus was to clearly profit off the success of their predecessor. I enjoyed P90X because of the little equipment needed (pull up bar and bands). With Plus it's as if they want you to by the Bowflex Selectech dumbbells. There are moves that you simply can't do without dumbells. At least with P90X you could choose to use the bands.

I have seldom read its equal in imagery or complexity. The constant references to games and mirrors compels you to not only see the characters from every angle but to consider yourself as well. It is a classic \\"bildigsroman\\" (SP? English teachers forgive me! I tried), and takes the main character from young child to mature adult. And the journey is worth the trip! I reread this book at least once a year.I recommend also Ford's \\"How Much for Just the Planet?\\". Imagine a Star Trek movie written by Gilbert and Sullivan and directed by Blake Edwards! And check-out Gregory Keyes' Bester trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"I loved the history, and culture of this book.

I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This is a sort of Star Trk book that makes you really think! It is about the kind of Klingons you never see any more. Not the smooth-headed ones from the original series, and not the ones from Next Gen and DS9 either. But the ones with the single anterior ridge and the canine fangs, the ones you see on the first ST movie. Their society and their home planet were different, but their customs especially the sense of honor is similar to the modern ones. In this story a young Klingon, Vrenn, is 10 years old and beginning his military career. Yes, this race of Kingons has a short lifespan and grows up as quick as we saw Alexander grow up. And Vrenn quickly becomes captain of his own ship and is sent on an important mission. You'l be surprised at who the villians are in this story! Let's just say it is a very unusual ST tale!

This opening only really serves to introduce the main characters of the book and is otherwise confusing and completely unnecessary. I almost put the book down because this section was so uninteresting.But it does pick up somewhat from there, when we follow Vrenn's life and his rise from humble beginnings to command a ship of his own. There are some interesting dynamics between the characters but as usual when dealing with Klingons, you're never quite sure who can be trusted or who will ultimately betray whom.Nearly every bit of Klingon lore and culture introduced in this book has been contradicted by the \\"official\\" canon of later TV shows and movies, so it's not even really good as a peek in the Klingon way of life.Bottom line - unless you are passionately interested in all things Klingon, I would pass this book by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise John M. Ford","review":"John M. ford's book probably is the first book that doesn't portrays Klingons as villains. Most of the Star trek authors prior to TNG's debut used Klingons as stereotypes or villains. Worse, some of the authors including Blish and Goldin discredited the klingons as dishonorable and deceitful villains.John M. Ford not only did NOT used Klingons as stereotypes but depicts them as heroes even before Worf was conceived.John M.

He has an amazing vocal ability and the lyrics for his tracks are quite well done and never sound forced or phony. It is true that most of the tracks are not written by Belafonte himself. However, still takes nothing from this collection of amazing island and calypso tracks such as Banana boat, Mary's boy child and many other nice tracks that are amazing to listen to and if one has a decent vocal abilities (like I do) then they are fun to sing as well.

The Boys try their best to redeem \\"Great Guns,\\" but it's a losing battle. Stan and Ollie's lack of creative input is woefully apparent. If you want to see the team in military surroundings, track down the far-superior \\"Pack Up Your Troubles\\" (1932)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laurel & Hardy in an utterly forgettable Army comedy","review":"\\"Great Guns\\" allowed 20th Century Fox to announce the \\"return\\" of the boys to the silver screen, but unfortunately this 1941 film directed by Monty Banks came out six months after Abbott & Costello's first starring vehicles, \\"Buck Privates.\\" The comparisons did not help Laurel & Hardy, who are the retainers of the pampered son (Dick Nelson) of a millionaire. When their charge is drafted and goes off to prove himself in the Army, the boys get drafted as well to be with him. Actually, the lad does well, not only with the army but with a girl (Shelia Ryan), and it is Laurel & Hardy who have a hard time with the tough drill sergeant. The romantic plot line actually ends up taking center stage and most of the comedy routines are things the boys would have left on the cutting room floor in their hay day. Another sad feature film from the tail end of their great careers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of their greats, but a typical, topical '40s comedy.","review":"This military comedy is Laurel & Hardy's answer to Abbott & Costello's \\"Buck Privates.\\" A lame script doesn't do Stan and Ollie justice, but there are a few howlers (including an \\"inspection\\" scene with Laurel stashing a crow down Hardy's pants). A good supporting cast of familiar faces helps. The video transfer is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunaltly, typical of their 40's films...........","review":"Fox tries to form another Abbott and Costello out of L&H in this usually dull film that has very few bright spots.

If you want a good WWII comedy, stick with Buck Privates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too messy of a routine for me","review":"This isn't funny to me: Hi, I'm a comedian and sometimes comedians do this kind of thing or that kind of thing, and I'm going to do this kind of thing right now. That is essentially the kind of humor you will find on this album. It doesn't work for me because it dissolves any pretense of spontaneity. Katz brags that he has been doing comedy for so long that he's not at all uncomfortable \\"working the room.\\" He then proceeds to \\"work the room.\\" Some of the jokes and set-ups are good, but he keeps ruining the routine by commenting on what he is doing as a comedian, and talking about what he used to do as a comedian, instead of actually being funny in the moment that is being recorded. He's at times either trying too hard or not hard enough, and this fragmented approach to comedy doesn't make me laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool","review":"A very easy to use tool for keeping your budget on track. the only improvement I would suggest is that it let you track your current expenditures alongside the budget, but that is just a minor nuisance.

What I like about the movie is it's raw, down to earth tempo.Kate Nelligan and Judd Hirsch are superb in their roles.I highly recommend people see it.

Also, it included many illustrations from old children's books without identifying the illustrator or the book they were from. More than likely the copyright had expired on these images yet this practice irked me for two reasons-first, this shows a lack of respect, for not only those neglected illustrators but for all illustrators, and second, an aspiring illustrator may have been moved to investigate and study an illustrator that they liked had the name been listed. Bad form for a book whose intent is to teach.If you really want to learn about illustrating picturebooks, check out Writing With Pictures by Uri Schulevitz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers Beware","review":"I am giving one star to this DVD set to bring attention to the quality of the DVD set.

It was what got me started watching anime. I would give it 5 stars if the quality of the DVDs were up to par.BTW, most of the high rankings given by others were for the show and not the DVDs.

From the first time I saw the show, I was hooked on it. Luckily, I got to see the first season first and the rest in order. Now about a month ago I bought the boxed set uncut version and was shocked and amazed at how much better the show was in Japanese. Also, there were many more episodes which they didn't show on Cartoon Network. For about 3 years, I was off being hooked on Sailor Moon because the fourth season really lacked. But now, I want to see every episode in its original form, uncut and in Japanese. Watching theshow makes mewant to learn the language evae more. I now have to buy season two and so on.

Not to mention preview and opening placements. It is as if all the money for this project was placed into the box art itself. This is a real shame for stateside fans who have waited so long. ADV could have gotten better quality just by ripping the R2 import DVD's, slapping a sub-title track on it, and selling that. Many people would have been willing to pay more if the quality was worth it. A real shame that Pioneer didn't wind up with the license.

Oh it's the original all right, and I can see now why it was chopped to pieces for the US viewing audiance. The music blows, the transformations blow, and Luna, oh Luna, I miss the British goodness of your voice. If you grew up with the special messages at the end of the show, and enjoyed those tid bits of 'do gooder input' like I did, then you won't like this series. But I did enjoy seeing the teachers panties, and the infamous, 'I'm a stick and I want to lose weight episode.' Maybe it's the fact that I didn't have the option of dubbed, but how can you when the scenes don't match up anyways. So if you feel that American television ruins the Japanese animes then this is for you. However, if you like good music, and you hate glancing at the bottom of the screen every two bloody seconds(By the way, jokes aren't too funny when there in subtitle form.)then this, myself included, is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season one Sucks in Japanese Audio........","review":"I had been watching Sailor Moon whenever I get the chance, but when ADV realese season one and two as a box set in the Japanese dilouge, I was mad!!!

And in the name of the moon, I shall punish you!\\" Instead it reads, \\"Sailor warrior for love and justice, Sailor Moon.

While the different instruments and decent lyrics make the music tolerable, it is definitely the lead vocals, done by Kim Corpening, that make the band what it is. Unfortunately, Kim has left the band for more honest work, so buying this album will only depress you. Good music, great vocals, but no future.*snif*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We have two other videos from this series that I love. That's why I was so disappointed in the SHAPES video. The references to the shapes are just too vague. The pacing it also too slow.

In that book, I really enjoyed the way Mr. Zacharias wrote, it was a great entry and he talked like I could understand. Now I am not a scholar, but I'm not dumb, but to me, this book was all I could do to get through the first chapter awake. Not to mention had to keep a dictionary close to understand all the 50 cent wording he uses. I guess if your looking for a thesis of higher intellect and you can understand all the boring comparisons this is a book for you. Me, I really like Dr.Tony Evans style of writing.....I can understand the man because he speaks like he's from this century and like average people carry on in conversation.

I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate Only","review":"The hose reel has one very bad fault. The fitting for the hose is outside the reel, so you have to run the hose through the side of the reel and to the fitting. When you roll up the hose, it kinks because of the tight curve, and, puts such a strain on the fitting that leaks are also a problem. I bought 2 right angles, 3 two-inch pieces, and hose fittings and brought the fitting to the inside of the reel and it works fine now. Another problem is when you pull only a short section of hose off the reel, it keeps spinning and unreels the rest of the hose onto the floor.It will do, but certainly is no more than that. Definitely too high priced for what you get, and the modifications you have to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money better spent elsewhere","review":"Well made but without the finishing touches. Sharp edges, rough turning mechanism. Lighter that you would expect- allowing it to scoot around as you pull out the hose as well as necessitating a foot on the base to hold it while you wind.Bolting it to a wall or floor would obviate the moving problem but not the sincerely rough cut edges of Entire unit.Pros: not owning it.Cons : everything about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!","review":"It isn't the best transfer in the world, but it is still such a treat that this funny, wonderful little fable has finally arrived on DVD.

It is annoying. For the first 3/4 of the movie a grown man crawls around in a diaper or some velvet child's outfit and whines. Oh I forgot he attempts to nurse from the babysitter even though she isn't lactating and she enjoys it. And one quick hint at inscest. Aside from that the social worker tries to rescue the baby from the mother and two sisters. The ending is suppose to be a twist as to why the social worker is going to such great lengths but if the viewer thinks about it...it isn't that difficult.

It was the most idiotic reasoning so it stands to reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment_Wah-Wah","review":"As a fan of weird/obscure/b-movies and after reading some of the reviews here on Amazon, I was excited to watch this movie. Boy, what a disappointment. First off, the movie isn't really a horror movie. Yes this movie is weird and the plot is somewhat bizarre but it wasn't \\"weird\\" or \\"interesting\\" enough to pay around $20.00; trust me on this.Some of the bad points of the movie were: The grown man (who actually looks a little like Keith Moon in his later years) acting like a baby was pretty lame. On top of that, there were no cool sets or visuals. The acting was horrible (and not in a good, campy way). The dialogue and conversations were drawn out, boring, and annoyingly hard to hear.The ending was kind of cool but there were lots of plot holes that led to it.

I distinctly remember reading all the Pip and Flinx novels.Alan does not however just write science fiction, this was a more standard adventure story, along the lines of Clive Cussler. Your usual moral tale, obsession, lust, priorities, betrayal, death, murder and most of all gold. All set in PNG, Papua New Guinea. Foster as usual turns a fine tale that is entertaining and educational.One striking thing about this book is the visceral sense of detail that Foster paints of PNG. I have read several books on polar exploration and as harsh and stark as the artic environment, PNG seems so in the opposite direction. Where the land of ice and snow are a dearth of life and variety, New Guinea is an overwhelming explosion of life. Where the environment threatens to kill you just as quickly...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adventure Yes-PNG No","review":"Having travelled in remote areas of PNG three times in the last ten years, I looked forward to this book touted as adventure in the real PNG.

Yes, read it as a good adventure, but then go elsewhere to learn about PNG, its people, and its natural history.

But, they've taken this classic and chopped off its sides -- and thus emptied out both a great deal of its fun and visual power. Producers: DVD is a film-lover's format.

The kid gets bullied and beats up the bully. Santa is supposed to be a kid's dream at Christmas. What does this movie show but a mean spirited fake who scares kids and ruins their dreams.

Pretty much the same excuse of every person who has seen this is that it reminds them of their childhood. I cannot contend that. However, I think the movie is actually pretty mean-spirited and after awhile pretty bland. In one sequence we have Ralphie uttering the F word and then beating up this one kid to a bloody pulp (with his mittens!) Then you have the scene where that one kid gets stuck to the pole with his tounge. They seriously should have gotten Roald Dahl to direct this movie! Not much of an ending either. He does get the BB gun however. Stick with It's a Wonderful Life for your Christmas viewing pleasures."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could, I'd give it no stars","review":"What is this junk? How can so many people think it's so cute and funny and consider it a classic?It's just about a whiny child who wants a gun for Christmas, and just about every adult tells him he'll \\"shoot his eye out\\"! That's the 1940s' equivalent of a child asking for a violent video game such as the Grand Theft Auto series and parents saying, \\"you'll end up shooting your next door neighbor\\" in today's world! How can you call \\"A Christmas Story\\" a classic if it's a hypocrisy of today's standards?Yes, entertainment's entertainment.

It's just a movie that's so stupid you'll wonder what you're torturing yourself with it. I cannot say anything good about this movie. It's...just...bad! Over acted. Over played. Overly stupid.

HOW CAN ANYONE DISLIKE THIS FILM? In my opinion, A Christmas Story perfectly captures the perspective of Christmas from the average child with hilarious results. And the \\"true stories\\" from the screenwriter's childhood have become classic gags. The leg lamp, the evil mall Santa, getting caught saying the F word by parents, the Bumpus' dogs, and sticking your toungue to a frozen pole are such classic material that I still laugh each time I see them to this day.On the video quality front, the BluRay is just okay.

This movie certainly is a classic. I'm a sucker for flashback films told by a narrator and this is perhaps a primary example of these films. For those of you living under a rock and unfamiliar with this film, it's about a little boy named Ralphie and what he wants for Christmas. The cast is fantastic and it's hilarious without being raunchy. This is how comedies used to be and some would argue should be. No doubt this film is great, but what most people don't know is that there is actually a sequel, with the same narrator, made 11 years later. My Summer Story follows Ralphie and his family the following summer and while the cast is different, the story is equally as good. I'd suggest you check out both films and be careful not to shoot your eye out kid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another DVD rip-off.","review":"Like so many people have so rightly pointed out and angry at,too, is that this classic receieved such poor treatment for the DVD format (I give the DVD two stars, not the movie itself). Bad picture quality, very few extras, and, of course, the biggest rip-off of all, it's in full-screen instead of wide-screen. Wasn't widescreen one of the main selling points for the DVD format? Of course it was! This particular DVD was only put out to cash in on the popularity of the movie without taking the time, care, and money to take full advantage of the format.

Compared to the orginal DVD, which I looked at for the sake of comparison, this 2003 edition has a much clearer image, better color, and a more balanced contrast. Although I have not been able to find any statement verifying my conclusion, I feel strongly the film has been digitally remastered for this special edition.

(but it's a good movie)","review":"A Christmas Story comes on TV like a billion times a year but it's still an O.K. flik. It's about this kid (Peter Billingsly) who wants a BB gun for Christmas. He does all this crazy stuff like visiting santa claus so he can convince everybody that he can be mature enough to own a BB gun. His mother always says he'll shoot his eye out and that annoys him. The plot for this movie is weak but it is well-acted and entertaining (especially around Christmas time). This is an O.K. film but it is not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"While most Christmas movies you only watch one month out of the year, this one you can watch anytime. Definitely worth buying this seasonal classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the grandkids loved it","review":"the grandkids slept over at christmas time and this DVD went over \\"bigtime\\" before they went to sleep for the night with anticipation for the following morning. the BB gun theme was perfect to hang all the excitement of the season on.....i know because i had the same wish over 60 years ago when my family moved from the city to a dairy farm in wisconsin and got a Red Ryder that first christmas. it's a timeless presentation....sure to please during the holiday season. highly recommended. pk"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Story - DVD","review":"This is a fun movie that brings back both childhood and parental Christmas memories past.

Basically, it looks almost the same as the DVD, which is pretty good for an older movie. If you already own any of the DVD versions, there is little need to upgrade to the Blu-ray version. If don't have own a copy, them the Blu-ray version should be in your collection if you're a fan of the movie. There's also an \\"Ultimate Collectors Edition\\" just released, but it doesn't include any new scenes or extras on the disk. It includes a metal tin, some other goodies, and costs about $15 more. The movie gets 5 stars for being a Christmas classic. The Blu-ray disk get 4 stars for being nothing special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"LOVE this classic!

If you grew up in the Midwest as late as the 1970s, you can completely relate to Ralphie and his friends and family.That being established, my gripe is with the \\"special features\\" DVD rather than the film itself. (I also really enjoyed the commentary by Clark and Billingsley.) I found the \\"featurette\\" a real disappointment. What a cool idea...getting Ralphie, Flick, Schwartz, and Farkas together after 20 years! Now...tell us about the MOVIE...what was it like to shoot, what did you think about the process, etc. No offense, but who CARES what these guys got for Christmas? And no mention of Darren McGavin, Melinda Dillon, or the actor who played Randy...very disappointing.My advice is to purchase the cheaper DVD without all the extra crap. Sometimes it's worth it, but not this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Hilarious","review":"This is the funniest movie ever made period.

Pink bunnies rule"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it zero stars if I could....","review":"I'm so glad I'm not the only one in the bunch who thought this movie was not funny, not a kid's movie, and just plain depressing. I did snicker at two lines in the movie, and it was interesting to go back to the times when kids sat around the radio with decoder pins as their form of entertainment. But those three times I just mentioned, well that took up about 1 minute of the whole movie. The rest was depressing and torturous. I agree with the person who said they should have made it that he wanted the BB gun for his birthday, this way you could leave out the whole Christmas aspect, since the whole tone clashed with the spirit of Christmas anyway. If you want to see a movie that is a bit twisted/cynical, yet has the redeeming powers of Christmas, get Chevy Chase Christmas Vacation. Now THAT was a funny movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I GIVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE ZERO IS AN OPTION","review":"Why would anyone waste their time with this horrible piece of trash.

Even UHF is better than this piece of crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie to let the kids watch...","review":"Despite the controversy over Jamie's provocative negative review, I happen to agree with him/her. While some parts of the movie were humorous I must admit, the movie as a whole was dark and mean. Swearing is glorified, as well as the violence. I watched through this movie before allowing my kids to see it, and I decided this was not a movie to let them see at their age. This movie does have it's followers, but you must see that this film is not one that young children should be seeing. Santa Claus is also portrayed as sinister, which kids will not understand and could be potentially traumatizing. I'm afraid to say that I did not like this movie. I do not believe that it should be considered a classic like Miracle on 34th Street. If anything, it should be a time waster for older, more mature teens. I'm sorry if I offended loyal fans of this movie, but that's what I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"Why has this become a classic holiday movie? I'm no big fan of schmaltz, but A CHRISTMAS STORY is utterly devoid of warmth. Its characters are unlikable, everything looks grimy and cheap, and Jean Shepherd's Lake Woebegonish narration is grating.Next Christmas, skip TBS' 24-hour marathon and watch LORD OF THE RINGS, PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES, SOME LIKE IT HOT, heck, ANYTHING but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christmas Story","review":"I have to agree whole heartedly with Jamie. This is the worst Christmas Movie I have seen. The profanity ruins it. It's a 1940's film with 1990's movie profanity. If you have children under the age of 10, you need to be aware. The father is mean. The are two prolonged scenes where a bully makes another boy put his tongue on a metal pole and another where Ralphie fights with him. And to top it off the Santa and his elves are mean. There is not an uplifting feeling throughout this movie...."},{"rating":"1","title":"christmas demons-unleashed!","review":"I first saw this movie as a child, and i have been scarred ever since. I cannot get anywhere near a christmas display at a mall, etc. without feeling sick to my stomach and fearing for my life(and sanity). I have also developed an aversion to full-body snow suits as a result of this film. My therapist said i was over-reacting...i have since found a new therapist. As soon as the cold nip of winter can be felt in the air my dreams turn to nightmares. All of the demons that haunt my sleep are manifestations of characters in this film...elves, santa, taunting children, evil dogs...they are out for my blood. FOR GODS SAKE DO NOT LET CHILDREN WATCH THIS FILM...trust me, it can scar children FOR LIFE. I urge you as responsible parents to block tbs(they play this movie 24hr's a day around christmas) on your TV so the children do not stumble upon this movie. It will rob them of their innocence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't a Christmas Movie Supposed to be Joyful???","review":"Ever since I watched this movie the first time, I cringed whenever it is broughten up. To me, I can't find an ounce of what Christmas really means. It upsets me to watch a movie where the whole time the kid is dreaming of shooting people. That doesn't create a very positive image for children today. I only seem to have this oppinion, while the rest of my family adores this movie. I can't stand to even listen to it! Not a great holiday classic in my eyes. The whole movie is made up up tense momments and things always get worse. It doesn't put a cheery image of Christmas in my head, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE CRAP! Go Jamie!","review":"I agree whole-heartedly with Jamie. This movie is an overrated piece of crap. First of all, calling this trash funny is apalling. Children being beaten up 'til they're bleeding is heartlessly cruel. Swearing is NOT funny, despite reports of the contrary. I feel awful everytime I see that kid stick his tounge to the pole. It is sick whenever someone says this is a classic. If you recieve this as a christmas gift, kindly throw it in the garbage. It will save you and your whole family from vomitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get better","review":"C'mon, you don't already own this? Where have you been? There is a reason TNT plays this continuously all Christmas week and best of all, you never get tired of it. Great, Great buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic!!","review":"As always, this is a great movie! I use a playstation 3 to watch my Blu Ray's! The picture quality is just slightly better than what it was shot in, and the audio is still in a mono format, but it is still a great movie! I think the picture keeps it true to it's roots and give it that oldies feel, so they were good in not doing much to it! However, I do feel the audio could have been cleaned up and enhanced more. I will enjoy my blu ray Christmas Story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a children's movie","review":"I saw part of this movie while I was at my chiropractor's, and I couldn't believe my ears. In shock, I asked the receptionist what swearing was doing in a children's movie. She shrugged and said, \\"It's pretty mild swearing, isn't it?\\" I've heard some oxymorons in my life (ex. military intelligence), but that one took the cake!If you can get past the variety of black and blue words, then there's the \\"lamp\\" which the boy refers to as \\"electric sex.\\" Again - in a children's movie?I'm just glad I never intentionally set aside time to waste on this movie. It's a cute enough idea; I even enjoyed the \\"narration\\" feel of having an adult male do voice-overs of thoughts and memories as if the story is told in retrospect. But it's not a movie I would ever want in my home, let alone have my children watch elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I know this is a classic but...","review":"I saw this movie for the first time last week. I understand that it is a Christmas Classic, but I found it sad. My family said people like it because it reminds people who were kids in the 50's and 60's of their childhoods. I personally found it depressing because of the appearing parental apathy and the insensitive way in which the children were treated. I laughed at a couple of parts, but overall I will not watch this movie again and prefer something that promotes love and cheer."},{"rating":"1","title":"STANDARD Version for DVD?","review":"This is my second favorite holiday film (only to the orginal \\"Grinch\\" cartoon).

I'll still be watching it this year, because it looks like Saran Wrap is over the entire screen when viewing this Blu-ray copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a feel-good family movie!","review":"I can't figure out why this movie is considered a Christmas classic. The dad is a blowhard; the mom is passive and depressed; and there's a ton of profanity, some of it from the children! The solution to bullying is presented as beating the daylights out of the bully. Santa and his elves at the department store are positively horrid. The only bright light is Peter Billingsley, starring as the older son. He is charming in his single-minded quest for a Red Ryder beebee gun for Christmas. But my kids, 8 and 10, hate the movie and I wish I hadn't chosen it for our Christmas Eve flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this move.","review":"i love this move. the boys imagination is just wonderful. also the lamp is so ugly I am glad the wife broke it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linda","review":"Cute kid but inappropriate language mostly from father.

We will see how we all enjoy that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perennial favorite","review":"When this movie first appeared it received very little notice. Probably Melinda Dillon was the closest thing to a star. It quickly became a nostalgic favorite. Every thing fit together so well: The kid trying to convince his parents he needed the Red Ryder rifle to defend them against the bad guys, the bursting with pride father (Darren McGavin in his best role) over luckily (?) winning the table lamp he put in the window so the neighbors could see, the quiet mother who was so ashamed to have anyone see the lamp and who accidentally - of course - broke the lamp, the younger brother who had to take the double dare to touch the frozen light pole with his tongue. Those days are gone forever, but the memories remain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, OK DVD","review":"This is a holiday clasic!

It's hard to knock the classic story of a boy and his quest for his Red Ryder air rifle. Is there questionable content? Yes, the movie was made in a different era, and portrays an even older era.

To see the real story of the Christmas story you need to see this on DVD and all its Red Rider Beebee gun glory.The cast is superb, the tale one all babyboomers will feel is a lot like their childhood. It is fond remembrances, without the overly cutsie pie touches. The kids are real, the emotions are real and funny and the late Jean Sheppard's wit ( and narration) shine in this perfect tale of a boy and his desire for a Red Rider Beebee gun and the lengths he will go to to 'help' Santa remember.I love books, and often when one is made into a movie, I prefer the book. To Kill a Mockingbird is one that I loved in both book form and movie form, and this is the other. Based on several of Sheppard's books, this is a true gem.Every family should have this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurrah for movie, Shame on DVD","review":"This is a must-see, completely charming, wonderfully acted (and I usually don't like child actors), heart-warming without being too mushy, Holiday Season story.But they made the DVD in Pan&Scan (except the opening credits, which are in widescreen). SHAME ON THE DVD PRODUCER!The whole idea of DVDs was that there's ample space for both widescreen and pan&scan versions. P&S (now called \\"Full Screen Format\\" -- to make you think it's a good thing) makes movies look like made-for-tv shows, with no vistas and too many closeups.How about an un-modified version of this terrific movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Christmas Movie","review":"I watch this every christmas.

The story and filmography will make you think that this was a classic you grew up with as a kid. However, unless you were a kid in 1990 - you're wrong. It was released in 1983.As far as the DVD is concerned - there is nothing to get excited about. Aside from the theatrical trailer, there are no special features on this disk.

It is boring, silly, immature and a great big waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing holiday film","review":"I just watched \\"A Christmas Story\\" and was very disturbed by it. It takes place in the 1940s (I think), but it is not at all like \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\", which was made in the 1940s. There is a lot of violence in this film (hitting, beating, slapping) and worst of all, profanity. The boy in the movie has a fantasy of getting an air rifle and killing crooks. In this age of gun violence, this is the last thing that kids or adults need to see. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. And if this movie is about Christmas, I certainly couldn't tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far the Absolute BEST!","review":"\\"A Christmas Story\\" is my all-time favorite movie so there is absolutely nothing bad I can say about it!Set in the 1940's, the story revolves around Ralphie, a nine-year-old growing up in the midwest, who only wants one thing for Christmas: a bb gun. The movie follows Ralphie, his friends, and family through hilarious adventures, most of them revolving around the bb gun.Laughs abound in this movie and you can't help but cheer for Ralphie when he finally receives his coveted Christmas gift.Every Christmas I watch this movie and still cannot get enough of it. Although I own it both on VHS and DVD, I can't help but watch the 24-hour marathon on TNT on Christmas Eve.This is one movie that is a classic and will be loved for many generations to come!

The characters are unappealing; the situations are unoriginal; the \\"jokes\\" that are tortured out of Darren McGavin are as funny as a crystal bowl shattered on one's bare foot; and the plot makes hardly any sense. Where the film endeavors to elicit humor--such as in the final Chinese restaurant scene--I find myself shaking my head, considering and reconsidering precisely whence I'm supposed to derive the giggles. And please tell me why it is the least bit funny to have a young boy solidly stuck by the tongue to an ice-cold metal flagpole!

It has all the exaggerations with its ups and downs.Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) spots a \\"Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB\\" 200-shot Carbine with compass, in the window of a story and fantasizes on how to get it for Christmas.Will he succeed?And if so will he shoot his eye out?I had one of those Davie Crocket hats when I was a kid. There were lots of other items and actions that I could relate to. However my wife likes the watering method used by Melinda Dillon (mother) around the trophy. And she likes the way the mother conserved electricity by turning it off. I could see her snickering through the corner of my eye. I am not sure I should have bought this movie. It may prove fatal to any window plans.The sequel of \\"A Christmas Story\\" (\\"It Runs in the Family\\" [1994]) lacks a lot of the originality of this one.My Summer Story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Watching Childhood Christmases All Over Again","review":"I grew up 20 years later than Ralphie and Randy, yet still remember all those wonderful things at Christmastime: a big department store with Santaland and an expanded toy department, a downtown Christmas parade, going out to get the tree from a tree lot, Bing Crosby playing on the phonograph, plus Dad being gruff and a bit contentious, Mom a worrier but understanding just when you needed her. Oh, I had TV instead of radio, our furnace was oil instead of coal, and the toys and cars were a bit different, but A Christmas Story wrapped up all my memories in a hilarious package. The new DVD is terrific: a great picture in widescreen, Jean Shepherd reading the original stories that inspired situations in the film, seeing Peter Billingsly and the other kids twenty years later.

Everyone tells him that he'll shoot his eye out. Ralphie tries everything he can to get that gun. On Christmas, Ralphie gets his wish. The people that warned him about it were also right. The film has the most believeable family. How many parents were like this?. I know of many. Peter Billingsley gives a wonderful performance as Ralphie that is cemented in stone as a film classic. Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon as his parents are top notch. The film is hysterical and very tender and touching as well. I'd watch this movie all year round!.

I have read that the book is supposed to be funny, but I certainly was not tempted to laugh any one single time. In it Stanislaw Lem describes a future world where everybody is drugged. At a first look it seems like this future world, 2039, has achived Jeremy Bentham's dream: \\"The greatest happiness for the greatest number of people\\". But then Stanislaw Lem comes with another definition of happiness, which I actually think is more precise: \\"My own happiness is not enough, the others have to be unhappy as well\\".

Oddly enough, the friction over free speech is not between the political \\"left\\" and the \\"right,\\" because there are practically no conservatives in the administration or on the law faculty, and the majority of students offered admission are also of the leftist persuasion. The battle over free speech is between the \\"left\\" and the \\"far left.\\" (p. 170) Conservatives are rarely mentioned in the book; the major players consist of traditional leftists like Alan Dershowitz versus the new leftists, known as \\"Crits.\\"To read the rest of this review, go to http://www.intellectualconservative.com/article4340.html"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme","review":"Thomas wants to convince his readers that those who are twarted from saying hateful derrogatory comments are victims.

The performance is simply too eccentric. I would suggest Szell, Walter, Reiner or Solti. And if by some strange luck you find a copy of the long deleted Steinberg recording, grab it right away. It is a great performance. If you already have one of the above, this recording may interest you. It is a perfect example of how not to conduct Brahms. Despite, that negative comment, it does have some moments of interest but not enough to be your only version of a great masterpiece. The Strauss tone poem is pretty much a disaster because of poor orchestral playing. Again, I would suggest the Szell recording. Despite it age and analog sound, it is still hard to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZzzzzz....Zzz...","review":"This could have been so much better.

Secondly, it completely blows over the Delaware River crossing, which is 80% of why I wanted to see it since I live in the area.

Back then there wasn't much available in the way of horror documentaries so it was a welcome addition. It doesn't have much to it other than some scenes and most of the trailers for each movie. The overall selections for this package aren't particularly impressive either so it does leave one wanting more. Not all of the clips are scary so it's hard to call it the \\"Killer Compilation\\".

Unfortunately, all the \\"special scenes\\" they've picked for the Giants of Horror lack any real terror to them at all. I was particularly disappointed by the scene taken from \\"Nightmare On Elm Street.\\" They could've done much better! It also includes original horror movie trailers (nice), a biography of each Boogeyman (nice), and an special game you can play on the DVD (lame).

Maybe they'll get it rite next time. There should have been more than one clip from each movie, and having said that, let them be the complete clip. Many of them just kind of stop in the middle of a scene leaving you saying, \\"What the hell was the point of that.\\" There are some interesting extra tidbits but not worth the money of purchase.

I couldn't believe how little attention was given to these guys. Overall, I was disgusted -- the real stomach turners are the Hellraiser/Puppetmaster scenes which prompted me to trash the Taco Bell I brought home for lunch. Some unknowns and \\"unimportants\\" (as I'll refer to them) are also featured, but as their scenes [stink] and I haven't seen the films they star in, they matter little to this [poor] compilation.

I'll give it one other star for the very small trivia \\"game\\". Just having Robert Englund speaking to you, either in mock or with pride at wrong/right answers, is worth one star - if I must.

Look how many suckers bought this thing (sadly counting myself amongst them)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD will make you a horror fan","review":"Before Boogeymen I had maybe seen 3 horror movies in my life (Scream, A Nightmare on Elm Street and Psycho). So I am not a horror fan. But my friend is and he got Boogeymen and we watched it together. We watched it with the flixfacts on (very key) and again with the Robert Englund commentary on and I learned so much about the horror movie world. Now I appreciate what all the fuss is about. It's kind of cool; especially when you get the insights of the actors & directors involved. After a few hours of watching Boogeymen, I can hold my own in any horror movie discussion (although I did not do too well on the dvd-rom trivia game). So if you don't have the desire to watch all the movies, but want to be clued in to this immensely popular genre, I recommend buying Boogeymen. With all the great scenes, commentary, trailers, flixfacts etc. you will wind up a horror fan just like all the other freaks out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst buy ever","review":"WARNING:THIS IS NOT A REAL MOVIE!It said three hours of entertainment but thats a dam lie .the only thing that was kinda cool was the trivia and that wasn't so grate :("},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of fun facts","review":"So I finally found out what Leatherface the cross-dressing chainsaw massacre's mask is made of, not pleasant! I forgot how disturbing some of these older horror movies can really be, and they made Chainsaw Massacre for under $80,000. You can't even get catering for that these days. I was very impressed on the design and layout of the Boogeymen DVD. I think what I enjoyed the most was the trivia facts that accompanied each of the films. Not to mention the fact that it got my adrenaline going.

The selected scenes generally lack any scares and come from some of the poorer movies in their respective series (Childs Play 2? Jason Goes to Hell??). The video quality for some of the excerpts is substandard, considering the fact that most of the movies' prints have been cleaned and transfered to DVD before \\"Boogeymen's\\" production--Texas Chainsaw is one example.Also, beware of the 5-star reviews here. I find it odd that they all have virtually the same length, written style, and end with a glowing snippet for the DVD. Perhaps the fact that they mention the DVD production company more often than not explains the bloated overall ranking for this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Compilation","review":"This is collection of what is supposed to be some of the scariest villains ever in movies, but the main problem is most of the clips are of not-so-scary parts. These may have been scary back in the day that they were made, but now, we have all been so desensitized that this compilation is all just something to laugh at how cheesy this dvd is. If u want to watch real horror, get the Exorcist or the Omen, both of which I cant believe were omitted from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"I came across this CD in a second hand shop, and was amazed at how good this is.

Hard to beat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and durable weight","review":"This is an accurate and durable weight. I have read numerous articles about free weights being off. I weighed mine and they were accurate. The only thing that kept them from getting five stars is that they are on the bulky side likely due to the neoprene coating. I am female 5'7\\" with long thin fingers. If my fingers were not on the longer side it may be hard to grip these well. They work for me, but I would be careful if you have tiny hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect product","review":"This product was exactly what I expected only better. It arrived in a timely manner and I have been using them with my Jillian Michaels DVD that I ordered at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice weight to it!","review":"Needed a heavier set of dumbbells, and these met my requirements. What I like the most about them is that the ends are not really round, kind of flat, so they don't roll off the work bench. The neoprene covering is excellent and won't slip if hands are sweaty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too light for me","review":"I got these as an enhancer to my workout which is fine, however out grew the weight after a few weeks.

I cannot do some of the exercising suggested with the product because of trouble with knees, I'm 78.But I feel stronger, refreshed and ready! after a few minutes with the weights. Then I walk for the strenthening of my legs. I hope to work up to the 4 lb weights. Besides, they are pretty. Amazon.com sent these out fast. That's another good thing I appreciateRose"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, But Uncomfortable","review":"I like the color and size of these weights, and of course they seem to be pretty accurate in weight, but they are really uncomfortable to hold! It is not a smooth surface that you'll be holding onto - there is a large seam line on the weights, and you can see what looks like screws poking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for walking","review":"I bought these so that I could use them during my power-walking. I really love them, they are just the right weight to walk with and still gives you the burn of a weight-lifting session. They have a great no-slip grip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, effective weights","review":"These weights were exactly what I was expecting - 3 pounds and purple. :-) I was concerned by other reviewers' comments that they might be uncomfortable and have things \\"poking out,\\" but mine don't have any problems like that. There is a seam, naturally, but it doesn't hurt my hands at all. I bought these to replace some 2 lb weights that had foam lining that my dog chewed off. She can't chew the neoprene off these!One small con keeping me from giving it 5 stars: I found them cheaper at Target. As an Amazon Prime shopper, it almost never works out that I find something cheaper in town since Amazon usually has great prices and I get free shipping, but Target had a selection of weights that were a couple of dollars cheaper and seemed just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me?

I would give it 0 stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duh, it's a weight!","review":"Seriously, how can you review a weight?? Does this thing weigh something? Yes, about 3 pounds. There, it's served its purpose!!! The purpleness IS hard to beat---shade is darker in real life, less lavender. Looks great with my grass green mat.Some of the reviews mention the seam on the coating. Yes, it's there, but it's smooth (at least on my set). And if it bothers you, just rotate it. This isn't rocket science--this is juicehead territory!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product with reasonable price","review":"The first thing that I like most about this dumbbells is the price that is reasonable compared to the other dumbbells sets sold on Amazon. I was not sure when I ordered whether it would be a good quality dumbbells because the price is relatively cheaper that the other brands. However, once I got them, I think they looked really fine. I cannot see any difference of this set of dumbbells from the other brands which I bought before and more expensive. The only one comment that I have for this dumbbell set is that there is a small bump at the end of each dumbbell which I am sure that it was not the design, but some defect from manufacturing process. Although I don't like this small defect much, it does not bother my workout at all. So, so far I rated this dumbbell four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted","review":"This item was exactly what I wanted. Light weight with the comfortable neoprene grip. Also a very reasonable price and free shipping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-sticky set of weights","review":"This is a great set of weights at a reasonable price. I had a different set of 3-pound weights, but lost them; I purchased the Valeo set to replace them, and I like them much better.My last set had a non-slip grip as well, but it was smooth and very sticky; it stuck to everything! I couldn't leave it on my carpet because it would pick up strands; I always had to leave it on a smooth plastic-like surface. And it would pick up dust on the sticky surface!But the Valeo set is a little bit textured and not sticky at all! If your hands get really sweaty, I can see how it might not be so non-slip, but I haven't used it for rigorous activity or outdoors, so I can't say from experience.While I do like the purple color, I wish it had other color options. But I'm happy with this set and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat the price!","review":"They do the job, only think I don't like is the handle is very thick, but it is not a huge deal. Definitely does the job and you can't really find them cheaper anywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Pound Neoprene Hand Weights","review":"The hand weights arrived in a timely manner and in great condition. I've enjoyed using them several times, and they are just what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hand weights","review":"I just got these and so far, so good. The 2-pound are quite light, you might want to get at least the 3-pound. Still, they are building my muscles - I am small. They seem pretty sturdy. The neoprene is good because they don't slip and it's not uncomfortable even if you sweat. I would definitely buy more of the same brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"3-Pound Neoprene hand weights","review":"Good quality and excellent price.

Good price too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice weights for exercise classes","review":"Package came promptly and was well-packed to prevent any damage on other items.My wife loves these and says the weight is perfect for her excercise class. The weights are easy to hold. Perfect texture and grip size.The only improvement I can suggest would be to make the ends \\"edged\\" (instead of rounded) to help prevent them from rolling everywhere while driving.Otherwise, you could just put them in a gym bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"I ordered these weights in December 2011, both the 10 lb and the 8 lb. The 8 lb weights immediately started shedding the neoprene coating. Every time I see them, more and more looks like it's coming off, and I hate to use them because they are a mess to look at, not to mention the coating it leaves all over the floor. This started happening a few months later w/the 10 lbs weights. I do not do anything weird to them. They just sit there when not in use. I would return them but can't imagine what it would cost to return 36 lbs of weights....Just recommend buyhing something else. I'll probably have to replace these soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for jogging and aerobic","review":"I use these while working out, usually doing jogging or aerobics. Helps to tone my arms as well as burn extra calories. I like that they're easy to grip. The one thing I'd change about them, knowing what I know now, is that I'd get a model that actually goes around my hand for use on longer workouts. For something short though, these are great, especially since I can easily go up or down on weights, depending on how I am feeling that day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"The combination of simple hardware and robust software makes this product a practical solution for keeping business cards information and share it with others. Synchronization with Outlook works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wheel will drive you nuts!!","review":"The wheel design (round tube outside of cage) is TERRIBLE. I don't think they ever tested this on a live hamster. Our hamster decided that would be the ideal place to nest AND run. The sound of hamster food, hamster droppings and shavings being slung around is worse than a handful of gravel in your clothes dryer! We had to put a stick through the opening of the wheel to lock it in place and give her a smaller wheel inside the cage to run. We will sometimes 'unlock' that wheel so that she can run in it while we aren't home to hear it... it slings hammy 'filth' in about a 3 foot radius. We are very disappointed. No matter how many times we dump and clean the wheel (no easy task as it doesn't fully disassemble...) she isn't discouraged from nesting there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy and easy to escape from","review":"We thought this cage looked fun for our newest pet. It is horrible! He poops in the wheel and then when he runs poop flies everywhere. The wheel is also very noisy. We had hoped to move the hamster into our daughters room but the noise would keep her up all night. The hamster has figured out how to open the door to the look-out room and escape. We now have it taped shut with mailing tape. After 3 escapes it is time for us to find a new cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cage EVER!!!","review":"Do not buy this cage! It is a piece of garbage. Upon assembly, the entire top cracked. Every time I clean it, a new piece breaks. The wheel is impossible to clean, as it does not come apart so waste collects and you will spend a great deal of time swirling water through it trying to get it clean to no avail. The sky tower does not fasten properly and your hamster will escape. Petco and all other sellers should be embarrassed to actually be taking money for such a piece of junk! Shame on all of them for continuing to sell such a poor quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has issues","review":"Definitely NOT a good choice for my winter white dwarf, even though the bars are narrow enough for him to not escape. He got into the wheel and couldn't find his way out (he's too short/small)...I have my 9 mos old Syrian using the wheel, liking it, but the cage itself is not large enough for him and I question its quality as there was a crack under the fly wheel that occurred during installation, which is why I unfortunately can not return this cage after using it just 3 days. I suggest if you have a dwarf, to get the Habitrail dwarf habitat as my hamster took to it and loved it right away. Perhaps this might be a good choice for a younger Syrian and may work out okay if my dwarf can grow into it...but I have to be honest in that I am not impressed with CritterTrail products after seeing how much better made Habitrail is."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible cage, very cheaply made","review":"My daughter saved up for weeks and bought this cage with her own money, which makes me even angrier that it is so cheaply made. It falls apart very easily and is difficult to clean. We are looking for a new cage. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The great escape","review":"I bought this at PetSmart a few months ago for my 2 year olds new hamster Buddy and I agree with the others that it is a pain to clean. My biggest problem with it though is that my hamster can easily open the lookout tower and also the wheel if I place on the ground. The latches are very easy for him to open from the inside and he has escaped once. I finally resorted to using packing tape to keep the tower closed and don't allow Buddy to play in his wheel on the floor anymore. Also, there is a problem with the the wheel hooking to the habitat and the little wheels that the wheel spins on wore out very quickly leaving shavings all over the place. We had to order replacement parts for that already too. Not impressed at all, but am stuck with it until I can justify buying a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamsters get stuck in wheel!","review":"We have several plastic hamster habitats and this by far is the worst. We have 2 hamsters and neither can get out of the wheel once they get in. They will try and try, but just can't pull themselves up the tube. We have a robo, and a dwarf hamster, so maybe if you had a larger one it could get out, Also, as has been stated in other reviews, the wheel is impossible to clean. You have to soak it in the tub to actually get it clean. Right now we are looking to buy another cage for ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best cage to be found","review":"This cage is very cute and appealing to the eye, but cleaning it is strenuous. Assembly is simple because everything snaps tightly together, but for this same reason, disassembling it to clean it is difficult. I haven't broken the pieces just yet, but I have broken several fingernails instead.Also, the wheel attachment does not seem very well thought out. As the hamster runs in it and goes to the bathroom in it (because all hamsters do), it gets very dirty but does not come apart enough for thorough cleaning. That, and the sound of hamster droppings clinking in it is enough to drive a person insane.Perhaps other Crittertrail cages would be a better choice, because I do understand the allure of the expansion kits and universal connectors for future renovation."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"my black bear hamster has already outgrown this cage in about a week. the spinny wheel on top is a flimsy, dirty nightmare. it's loud and wobbles off the base. taking the cage apart to clean involves taking apart everything and breaking a few pieces accidentally or intentionally, since they don't snap apart or together easily. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, especially since i paid full price for it at petsmart! i am going to try a different crittertrail cage because i like the tubes. the only bonus i see is that my hamster poops in the lookout tower, which should in theory be easy to clean but in reality is frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible cage, buying a new one","review":"We purchased this cage three weeks ago for a our son, and we are shopping tomorrow for a new one. The hamsters are very hard to see through the dark plastic. Additionally, they like to sleep (they are in it basically all day) in the wheel, therefore they do a lot of pooping in it. I have been unable to get it apart to clean it, and we can never get the hamsters out to play with because they are always hiding in it. I had to remove the wheel and soak it in the tub while my son babysat the cage so our furry little friends didn't escape.I am currently on amazon reading reviews to find out a better alternative. I called the store to see if we could return the cage, but they said it is unreturnable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it","review":"I loved the way this cage looked, it's really pretty and an entirely unique wheel design. It's too bad it didn't turn out to be practical.There are at least four major design flaws with this cage:1) The wheel doesn't come apart for cleaning.2) Dwarf hamsters (the box claims it is an appropriate cage for these) are too small to get out of the wheel. Once they get in, they are stuck there.3) The tube doesn't connect to the wheel, leaving a small gap. The \\"latch\\" on the end of the tube there serves absolutely no purpose.4) The lid of the penthouse can easily be pushed open by a hamster as it doesn't lock tightly in place.The cage looks cool, but I would pass on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wheel stinks... LITTERALY!","review":"We bought this cage for our fancy russian dwarf hamster. we cant get him out of the wheel. he sleeps in the wheel, & he leaves the wheel only to eat and drink, then he stockpiles his seeds and food in the wheel. when he tries to run he gets smacked with piles of food. he also pees in his wheel which creates an ammonia \\"spelled wrong? LOL\\" smell. then it is very hard to take the wheel apart, especially everyday? I DONT recomend this cage! P.S. did I forget to mention how loud the food is in the wheel when he tries to run in it??"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR HAMSTER TO GET OUT","review":"This cage is horrible, I should've listened to the other reviews - the lazy lookout is too easy for a hamster to get out of - even after duct taping the lid shut, my daughters teddy bear hamster still managed to pop the entire top half off and escape. She is heartbroken. Do not get this please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cage ever","review":"I now own this cage and I have experienced the most horrible memories with this cage. This cage looks appealing but my hammy has gotten out of this cage not once but twice. My hamster got out because it could open the cage from the inside, not a secure door! Also I have broke the wheel just trying to open the wheel to clean it which is also very flimsy. It is very very hard to clean"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this...","review":"I purchased this cage for my daughter's first gerbil. We brought him home and set him up in the cage. 2 days later I came home from work to find part of his tail missing and blood inside the wheel. He managed to get his tail caught between one of the ventilation spaces in the wheel. We immediately returned this cage and bought a new one for him. He survived the ordeal and is much happier in his new cage! I would not recommend buying this page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but....yeah.....","review":"I received a hamster last Friday and got this cage along with it. The wheel is impossible to clean and when she goes to the bathroom in it, it clanks around there with her. You can't take the wheel apart for a thorough cleaning. She is also able to get out of the \\"lookout\\" area. She discovered this last night by pushing her head up and unclasping the top of it. I found her happy as can be on the floor! Going to Petsmart tonight to look for another cage. Also the tubes are very hard to connect together. Overall it's spacious and cute, just not thought out very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"wheel","review":"The wheel on this cage is a pain in the butt to clean i couldn't get it apart once it was together and my hamster put food in it at night and ran it makes a loud annoying noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"This cage is horrible. Our daughters hamster has gotten out of the top look out tower twice. We had to rubber band the clip so she couldnt bite and push it open, THEN she pushed the entire top off! We had to purchase a different piece to use there....expensive and NOT easy to find.Secondly to clean this stupid wheel is IMPOSSIBLE. The little critter runs and pees and poops, so you have urine all through the wheel PLUS the joy of listening to the clinking of hamster poop bouncing all through the wheel. To clean it you have to use a screw driver to pry the plastic pieces apart, completely take it apart and wash....then allow to dry. Meanwhile there is no way to close off the hole so the hamster cant get out. AND because the wheel is on top of the cage there is pee dripping down onto the cage as well as whatever the cage is on......gross.I would keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is a great writer","review":"this book in particular is amazing its, setting was true to the time and city, a really wonderful book and in great condition. i give it five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A teengirl in the London Punkscene coping with all problems.","review":"About a girl of my age who is actually doing alot of things which u would say she's too young for.

It has a info on the characters and pictures from the seasons. The dvds are orgnaized inside the book per season and underneath each one it gives you the list of episodesin the particular dvd.

The packaging is minimal, which I did sort of expect. My main complant is that some of the episodes wont play. It just gets stuck on the copyright warnings, shows warning one then two then back to one then two again, continually. Its done this on at least one episode of most of the disks and I haven't quite found a way around the season 2 disk I'm currently on. I noticed in a couple season 1 episodes the lighting and coloring changed so much from camera to camera within the same scene. Most is minor considering the price but episodes not playing is a deal breaker. Anyone else experience this crazy loop phenomenon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging looks nice.......","review":"It's a great show that I've enjoyed watching with my daughter and niece. The packaging totally sucks. Most of the disc are stuck in by the glue holding the pages together. Almost every disc has a scratch from removing it! I had to buy a cd holder to store them in.

Oh, sure she should!!! Actually, this is a sweet, romantic story about two people who, beyond their strong mutual attraction, seem to genuinely like and find comfort in one another's company. The dance scenes are fun, the plot contains strong elements of humor and sensuality, and the leads turn in some engaging performances.Good movie, especially for the ladies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow-Wee","review":"I personally liked the movie.Chris Atkins is incredibly sexy even without the Blue Lagoon hair.

The film was written by Joan Tewkesbury and directed by John Avildsen so how was this 80 minute mess created? It's a bad film, but if you're a fan of 80s cheese, you might like it as a nostalgia trip. The music's actually pretty good. The only extra on the DVD is the trailer and what's interesting about the trailer is that it actually advertises the movie that Night in Heaven could've been. Another nice thing about the DVD is that the main screen features Bryan Adam's song Heaven. I'm not sure but I think the song appeared in this film before it became a number one hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A night in hell.","review":"In \\"A Night In Heaven\\", Lesley Ann Warren plays a college professor named Faye. Christopher Atkins is Ricky, a student in her class. At the end of his final report for his class, Ricky cracks a joke and Faye is not amused. She decides to fail him and make him take the course over again.The next thing you know, Faye goes to watch some male strippers with some friends of hers. Who is one of the strippers? Ricky! Anyway, they develop one of the dreariest affairs I have ever seen. No sparks whatsoever.There is also a dull side plot involving Faye's husband(!). He quits/is fired from his job. He puts 2 and 2 together and figures out that his wife is seeing the stripper. What does he decide to do? You'll just have to see in the exciting, I mean boring, climax.I'm not really sure what the point of this movie is. There is no passion in anyone's performance. There is no actual plot and the romantic part of the film is tedious. Only recommended for fans of Christopher Atkins naked body."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Forgotten Camp Classic","review":"The premise of this movie is too hoaky to be believed, isn't it? Christopher Atkins, known best as Richard from The Blue Lagoon, makes some smart remark in class and has his teacher fail him. His teacher, Lesley Ann Warren, goes out with some friends to see some male strippers and - surprise! - HE is one of them. Then they have an affair.I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry. Half of me is convinced that this is all just some weird dream and no one actually put this on paper, let alone made a whole movie out of this. The other half of me is disgusted with whoever gave this the go ahead. It's just too hilarious to believe, but it's real. Recommend it? Well, I guess I could.

Even with the immensely talented cast, the cd sounds at worst limp and choppy, and at best, merely adequate -- Even the showstopers come across as perfunctory (and with this show, that's saying something!)I'm sure there is an amazing recording of this show. The 1999 cast album isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money!","review":"I saw the movie and was bored to tears. I saw an ameteur production and spent the whole evening anticipating my escape from the excrutiating pain of it all. I was forced to listen to the recording by a friend and I had had it. This musical is awful. My eyebrows raise when people call the music \\"catchy\\" or \\"funny\\". Aside from the opening song \\"Another Openin', Another Show,\\" which I have to admit is slightly entertaining and will get your foot tapping, the rest of the musical is boring and endless. Don't waste your money on this excuse for a musical. Why it was revived, I still don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"New orchestrations are revival cast album's undoing","review":"The 1999 Tony award winning revival of KISS ME KATE managed to show there was still life in this 50-year old show. Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie are ideal as a modern day Fred and Lilli. Amy Spangler has the proper saucy style for Lois. There was some (needless, though minor) tinkering with the book and the show's famous Overture was dropped. (That Overture must be jinxed: on both the Columbia and Capitol cast albums it was replaced by the Entr'acte. The 1987 London cast uses a new Overture.) The \\"updated\\" arrangements by Don Sebesky are no improvement on the originals, although the use of Elizabethan styled music for the Shrew sections is appropriate. The new recording includes more dialogue than previous releases. The production moved to London after its Broadway run and that edition was taped and has been released on DVD and is well worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"zesty new revival of the Cole Porter classic","review":"The 1999 Broadway revival of KISS ME KATE was a big success, running nearly 3 years and spawning a national tour as well as a London production (which was taped for DVD release). The cast album is a real delight. Brian Stokes Mitchell (KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN, MAN OF LA MANCHA) is a grand Fred Graham, and Marin Mazzie is a thrilling Lilli Vanessi, the feuding ex-spouses starring in a musical version of Shakespeare's \\"Taming of the Shrew\\". Michael Berresse and Amy Spanger add a playful sexiness to their performamces as Bill Calhoun and Lois Lane, with Adriane Lenox as a perfectly-belted Hattie. The orchestrations by Don Sebesky are bright and full of bounce; I especially love the bluesy arrangement of \\"So in Love\\". This cast album is highly-recommended if you already own the OBC with Alfred Drake, Patricia Morison and Lisa Kirk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yashu is a house hold favorite now...","review":"The flute and accompaniments of this music is very unique and soothing to the soul.

Crimson Wings far exceeds the need to show the struggle and dwells on the death itself, it was so pronounced and disturbing that I will be throwing this movie out without viewing it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"nature film","review":"A film about African flamingoes. It gives very little information. How old the babys are is never mentioned so there is no time relevance.

Contrasted to Baraka with its brilliant footage and a fantastic soundtrack this one does not come up very good. It is too bad these things weren't addressed, music, information, visuals, to make a better production.

I must admit I was put off by the first chapter in his book (the Moon a spaceship? really?), but being familiar with the author I pushed past that chapter and concluded that he merely presented it because it is one of the theories out there floating around, not because he necessarily believes it himself.

Some claims even conflicted. For example, the \\"Greys\\" are either from Pleiades or Zeta Reticuli or Mars. All three are claimed in the book.The book was also riddled with typos, including one in the very first paragraph, and ended with a re-hash of the authors \\"Rule By Secrecy\\" book, in which the Federal Reserve is really just a conspiracy platform created by the richest of European banking interests.A real dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

He provides thorough research references/footnotes etc. so you can pursue the interesting topics that he uncovers in more depth. Anyone interested in alien intelligence on this planet should read this book. As a result of this pleasant reading experience, I have purchased his other books and am looking forward to examining what they contain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, well-researched book!","review":"A well-researched book and a \\"must read\\" for students of Ufology, debunkers and skeptics alike.For those of you who have been avoiding this issue it is time to become informed. The author sums it all up in his introduction: \\"To get beyond..a restrictive mindset, one must be open to all possibilities-to seriously consider alternative theories and explanations\\".

Good for making it look like he's read more than four books on the subject.Overall this book doesn't mention anything new. Half of it is probably not true anyway. The only thing this book doesn't mention is the lost continent of Mu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash","review":"This book is a rehash of UFO folklore. The title of the book is misleading because it does not focus on the \\"Agenda\\". I'm sorry I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER BOOK BY JIM MARRS THAT FLYS","review":"Alien Agenda and it's importance to the world of UFO's begins immediately with the first chapter. I am not going to tell you about the MOON, but you will find that with the reading, the first chapter is as important as the whole book with extraordinary and almost unbelievable facts to support the revelations Jim presents. As usual in all of Jim Marrs books, his research is mind-boggling with information from many sources, FOIA data, books, other UFO Researchers, and INSIDE sources; but with Alien Agenda, he out-does himself. If you buy this book for just the first chapter, your money will be well spent and you will have a book of historic significance to keep in your library for your children and grandchildren to read many years from now.Just because I have centered on the first chapter only goes to show the reader what to expect from the entire book. After Alien Agenda, I will continue to purchase Jim's books as soon as they hit the bookstores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marrs Agenda","review":"This book is a waste of the paper it is printed on. Although Mr. Marrs brings to light a number of inconsistancies in the official reports versus what really happened(according to the participants), Mr. Marrs agenda is to expound on his conspiracy theories about how the Government and the rich are controlling the world. He believes that there are plans to save the top 2% of the country and the world at the time of Armaegeddon and let the remainder of the world die. For a book as well written as this, it is disappointing that the conclusions support the author's bias' instead of suggesting how to further determine the veracity of the reports cited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old same old....","review":"Filled with unsupported anecdotes, this excerise in contrived paranoia spews the same silly UFO conspiracy nonsense that so many others have foisted upon a public all-too-eager to believe that \\"the government is out to get you.\\" Admittedly, it is the best-written of the genre to date, but that cannot overcome the main shortcoming of this tome: there's no real truth, no substance, no solid evidence. Read it for what it is: speculation, fear, and opinion with a dash of plausible science fiction. Close but no cigar."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disaster","review":"Someone should write a book about why Marrs continues to write books about things he can't prove. Not only is this badly written, but Marrs does a fabulous job of presenting only 1 side of the argument--his own. \\"Witness testimony\\" is all fine and dandy, but why is that Marrs can't ever come up with proof for his claims? Oh wait, the U.S. Government covers it all up. Good Lord, do people really buy into that garbage, or do they just want to believe it? The latter is my opinion. Until Marrs can show pictures of these \\"aliens\\", his arguments will continue to be shot down. Maybe the Majestic 12 has all those aliens over for Sunday dinner, but I suspect the truth lies in the hyperactive imaginations of \\"eyewitnesses\\" and \\"experts\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magnificent Accomplishment","review":"This book explores all the dimensions of UFOs from the dawn of their existence to the present.

They wanted to transform him into a nationalist, militarist and racist to get more publicity for him. So they falsificated many of his aphorisms he did during 1886 to 1888. This book and ONLY this book made it possible for Nazis to abuse him, the anti-nationalist, the philosemetic and anti-biologist.- Be careful with this book. I agree, it is sad that Nietzsche didn't leave a real \\"master work\\", so there is only one solution: Read ALL his books, starting with \\"The Birth Of Tragedy\\", finishing with \\"Ecce Homo\\". So you can get all the changes and the whole development in his philosophy. So all together, all his books summa sumaris are his \\"master work\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is garbage.

Shame on him!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and misleading, Nietzsche's words twisted","review":"The Will to Power was published by Nietzsche's sister for her own purposes. Nietzsche did not get along with his sister - and for good reason. She was involved with a leading anti-semitic group of that day. Nietzsche painstakingly went over his notes and arranged each aphorism, each word, to be perfect. He was, after all, a professor of Philology. To accept his estranged sister's attempt at arranging and editing his notes into a book is insanity. She had her own agenda which was far from any of Nietzsche's intentions. This book is one of the reasons that Nietzsche got a bad reputation for being anti-semitic and connecting his idea of the ubermensch with Hitler's Master Race.If you do read this book, take it with a grain of salt. Most of the words were his, but not in a form that he would have published."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Will to Power: Nihilism for Dummies(well... not really)","review":"I am a sixteen year-old junior and when I picked up this book, I had a general background of Nietzsche; M.Manson's biography, Xenosaga, other resources, etc... His ideas are well written, if not too well. Those looking for easy flow will not find it here, nearly every phrase has an antecedent or is a symbol of something else. The most important thing to remember is that this book was originally written in German during the 1880-90 era, a time of decline for Germany. While not a veritable \\"bible\\" for everyone, especially those that believe in \\"God\\" and that the powerful are wrong and evil, it has served as a great reference in my case for moral arguements against my classmates and a unique and fun way to analyze society for what it really is.-NOTE: Decent to good reading ability required.-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak","review":"This is a poorly written book on the important subject of race in politics. Carter spends the entire book blaming conservatives' exploitation of race for their recent resurgence. In many examples, he is outright wrong(such as his analysis of the Willie Horton debacle), and in others he dramatically overstates the significance of the particular action. The only credible observation is that of the evolution of a new form of politics, a political system in which \\"image is everything\\". However, Carter complete ignores liberal manipulation of race in politics, and this book subsequently comes off as being very biased. If you're looking for a good book on race in politics, I suggest reading The End of Racism by Dinesh D'Souza or Hating Whitey by David Horowitz."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUALITY HOLDS","review":"cool holds. they have killer texture so far, and seems like it will last even when they get chalked out. the large set is good for angled walls, tho not too steep. the Patina patterns are similar enough to bishop patina I have seen. sweet holds... climb-it did'm right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"i watch this movie on a regular basis. luckily many moons ago i left a VHS tape recording a sporting event. after reviewing it i found this lovely movie tacked onto the end. since then i have transfered ito DVD and it takes pride of place in my DVD's.

You can tell that this is a woman trying to write a character that is very very far from her own life experience. Jimena's use of slang is forced and unnatural sounding. I don't really sympathize with her. It might have helped if we had had a flashback to the night of Veto's murder.Ewing is not good at making use of her supporting characters in these novels, focusing soley on the character whose point of view we are getting. So then, it seems that those who aren't in focuse act out of character (ie Vanessa getting another boyfriend besides Michael...sure)Maggie is still an annoyingly alusive/all-knowing character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but still not as good as into the cold fire.","review":"Before I read this book I used to not like jamena, but now I see things from her point of view. and now I see her trubuled past and how she transformed from gangster homegirl to Goddes of the moon.

What he calls Mind Magic seems to me to be a kind of insight or wisdom into a problem or life in general.I particularly like his approach of not saying this is the way and the only way. He says this is what some people have done, what some people have learned. It is still up to you to develop your own way of dealing with the real world.

Ronald , comptia said I needed two years experience, try just one month of reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"Although this book probably contains enough information to pass the exam, I found it to be a poor read. The authors introduce acronyms that have not been defined and make gross assumptions about the readers background in higher mathematics and cryptography. It was one of those books where you find yourself reading the same paragraph multiple times only to that the topic is just not well explained."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE NO MORE TO BE PUBLISHED!!! SERIES CANCELLED BY PUBLISHER!","review":"I just read Shield of the Sky and knew that Hammer of The Earth came out in Oct 2005. I was wondering why Amazon didn't have any more of the series available since this author is usually fairly consistent with her release dates. I went to the official Susan Krinard web-site and it states that the publisher Luna has canceled the series. The story will not be wrapped up if you buy Shield of The Sky and Hammer of The Earth you will just waste your money on two books. While they may be enjoyable the story will not end, I hate when this happens!! I guess just not enough people bought these books. I have to say SHAME on AMAZON for selling it at it's regular price, it should be in the \\"discount aisle\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to our collection","review":"My younger son just loves Imaginext stuff and has most of the pirate and castle sets. He just recieved the Ghost Raider for his 6th birthday and it has been a big hit with both him and his older brother (9). It is a cool looking skeleton boat and goes so well with all the other pirate stuff- my son loves that it is spooky like his Phantom Island set. While some of the bigger sets (Phantom Island is a good example) have been a bit to detailed for my son to put together on his own, he was able to look at the directions and put all the pieces of the raider together by himself. This is a wonderful additon to the Imaginext pirate collection and a fun toy to fuel a child's imagination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"adorable","review":"it was a lot of fun putting it together. we took a flashlight and putit on ship so it would glow faster. very adorable and lots of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"8X10 poem..","review":"If you did something wrong and your in the dog house try buying this for your wife IT WORKS..!! Received it in 3 days and my wife loved it so I am now on here good side for now anyway !! Men if your looking for a great gift for your loved one this is a GREAT BUY....!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off doing this yourself!","review":"I purchased this item and personally do not feel that it is worth the money. It is nothing more than a heavy paper card on a cheap backing. I was told by the company that sells it that they have thousands of happy cutomers, I guess I am their first unhappy one, or no one else bothered to complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Worth It","review":"Though a surprise hit, \\"Hardly Working\\" (1981) remains among Jerry Lewis' lesser efforts. There are a few laughs, but Jerry's inventive cinematic style is nowhere to be seen. It's a low-budget, poorly made film. The best thing about \\"Hardly Working\\" is that it enabled Lewis to make the far-superior \\"Cracking Up\\" (1983)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Springtime for Hitler look like Citizen Kane.","review":"Everything about this movie was so much worse than just horrible that I couldn't turn away. From the cheesily generic 70's TV music and titles to the blatantly stupid and unfunny \\"gags\\" to Jerry's immovable pinky ring, this could have only been made on a bet to see if the laziest, sloppiest, most amateurish and plain unfunniest movie in history could be made, released and even find some small audience of admirers. Scientology has nothing on this. And Lewis thinking that simply knocking things over and making goofy faces convinces me he was never really funny at all, but just came up in a time when people were starved for anything. Milton Berle had similar luck. I guess people could only watch quality stuff like the Marx Brothers and Preston Sturges so many times before any crap seemed like a needed break. Holy dung!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy God","review":"Hardly Working was one Jerry Lewis movie no one ever heard of. I enjoyed the comedy that only he could do. The story was not much but seeing Lewis screw up every job he had was good. Being one of his later movies Jerry Lewis still shows he can make anyone laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"How much would you pay?","review":"Question for everyone who left reviews and people who are looking please comment. How much would you like to pay for this movie on vhs? and how much dvd?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst -- don't miss it!","review":"This is the movie in which Lewis repays all his most generous MDA contributors with some of the most hilariously obvious product placement in the history of movies. If you're at all sensitive to product placement, and if you've seen enough telethons to know who Lewis's favorite corporations are, sit back and prepare to have your jaw drop to the floor. (It's also the comeback movie Lewis made once he saw how popular Steve Martin was in \\"The Jerk\\" -- how else to explain this movie's release shortly afterwards with the tag line, \\"Jerry Lewis -- The Original Jerk!\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"A ValuableTime Saver","review":"Pfeiffer did a great job in creating these forms!

Baby Dodds was one of the most creative drummers of all time, playing his press rolls with a very syncopate fills in woodblock, cowbells, tom tons and bass drum rims. As you will hear, this 1946 record have a unique and primitive drum style, lost in time. A different way to play drums never repeated again, but registered in this and other CD's from him (and as a sideman like Bechet's, Bunk Johnson's, Satchmo, King Oliver and others new orleans jazz leaders from the 20's, 30's and 40's).Great impros and 2 fantastic's solos.The second half of this CD is amazing, too!It isn't with Dodds! Another band.It is A PURE AND FANTASTIC CREOLE HABANNERAS records (not a mardi gras, for god)!! !!You are a lucky person to find this CD.This is DEEP JAZZ HISTORY!Buy it know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm prejudiced.","review":"I am prejudiced in favor of this disc because I am old enough to have heard all of these people \\"in person\\" and once upon a time Baby Dodds was my \\"bodyguard\\" when I went out of a party (at Jimmy Yancey's apartment) long after it was time for the bars to be closed. This was in the darkest part of the South Side of Chicago and not a time or place for a white guy to be wandering around alone. Fortunately for me Baby Dodds was pretty well known.Baby Dodds was a fabulous drummer strong hints of which can be heard on this disc. Don Ewell, as noted elsewhere here, was in his Jelly Roll stage and if you closed your eyes I am not sure how many people could have told them apart. (I will get a lot of static,no doubt, over this heresy). Everyone here earned their fame and if you don't insist on a full group and you like this kind of music you will enjoy listening to this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich, rich writing!","review":"What an amazing written Nottage is! I had only seen a staged reading of her play \\"Ruined\\" and couldn't wait to read more of her work. \\"Crumbs from the Table of Joy\\" brings together two unlikely worlds in 1950 and shows us sometimes in a raw way, sometimes with intelligent nuance and detail, how we are, after all, all part of one race: the Human race."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Quality","review":"Decent quality, no problems with the items. Not very good at holding the smaller wrenches I have, but fantastic at holding my largest. I have two of these, one for American (up to 1 1/16) and one for metric (up to 22mm). I've mounted them on the wall. The only issue is the mounting spots on the product are 5\\" apart, so if you're looking to mount on a wall and trying to hit studs, you'll have to improvise."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 year wait - and worth it!!!","review":"Salaryman make modern instrumental music that is intelligent and has a unique style built around keys, drums and occasional sampled voices and guitar. It can be perfect \\"soundtrack to your life\\" music but is also worthy of sitting alone with and enjoying through a pair of good headphones. As highly recommended as their previous two albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most awesome book!","review":"I read this book about 7 years ago, and have been trying to locate it... When I read it, it was called \\"Red Sky in the Morning\\". because Ben was born at dawn thus the 'red sky in the morning'. Wonderful book for junvenile & adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth Laird, a brilliant author","review":"This is one of the best books i have ever read. It has a lot of twists and deals with subjects that some people find difficult to talk about. All though it is quite sad when her handicapped brother dies, there are some funny and lighthearted points as well. I think this book has a meaning inside, and I would recommend it to anyone. Although I am not in this situation, I also think it would be good for people who have handicapped friend or relatives. I could read this book again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"creating a special bond","review":"I Hated reading books until I came across this book<Red sky in the morning>.I loved the part when they wrote about Ben and how he was so cute.You could hardly guess he was born with Hydrocephalus.There was a part I hated and that was when Ben died.I was amazed at how Anna could create such a special bond with her Hydrocephalic brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very mega","review":"I was most disaponited in this book, It reads like what it is. A qwicky attempt to cash in on the latest ( disaponting ) War-of-the -worlds movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"The back cover blurb is misleading - the giant robots are there for the first encounter alone, then they're gone for the rest of the story. The book was riddled with spelling and grammatical errors as well; I have no idea what the editor was thinking, or even if there was one.And the writing! I've seen fan fiction on the 'net that reads better than this. Save your money for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of resources and time, please grab something else...","review":"I have just finished reading this book, basically skimming the last 7 chapters (or days I should say). I gave quite a break in between, but when I went back to Day 14, I realized this is not going anywhere. I have worked on three programs on Animation and none worked. The whole code is given without any explanation. As one previous reviewer put it, that kind of code is already given when you run Visual J++. If there is no explanation, why need this book? I am totally puzzled. The Q&A at the end of each day is a big joke. I am really afraid of the programmers who would study this book and think that they are competent with J++ right away. I am immediately in search of another programming book. If anyone who would like my copy, please send me an email, and I will mail it to you if you send me the postage. IMHO, waste of time. Grap another book, please, if you are serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sams Teach Yourself Visual J++ 6 in 21 Days","review":"I had used other 'Teach yourself' something 'in XX days' before and liked them. I sure got fooled with this one! Avoid this book unless you are already comfortable working with J++. The examples are confusing. It rambles. It presents bits and pieces but never gives you a solid foundation. I really regret buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book to learn Java","review":"This book lacks detailed explanations. The examples are also badly constructed. The book is verbose and if you really want learn Java, get another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for Visual Basic/C++ Programmers","review":"As a C++/Visual Basic Programmer, I found this book very handy.If you do not already understand the fundamentals of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) then you will struggle a little as it does not thoroughly cover:- Concept of Classes/Objects.- Constructors.- Members.However, if you already understand these concepts (such as I did), then you will fly through this book with little or no trouble.This book takes you from beginner to an intermediate level whilst covering the following topics:- Applet & Application development.- Use of Dialogs & Standard Controls.- Graphics & Image Processing.- Multi-threading & Animation.- Exception handling.- I/O Streams.All examples are easily understood and fairly well explained.Just don't expect to become a professional programmer from reading this book.You will however be able to move onto a more advance book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful book","review":"This is a shameful book written by a God hater. It's full of lies and distortions. Clearly Kathy Burns has never met or spent any time with Mr Graham and his associates. Although Kathy Burns claims to be a Christian, from her criticisms of Mr. Graham and other Christians, I'd doubt that even Christ would be good enough for her. Don't waste your time or money on thie hypocritical book of lies designed to slam good people who have dedicated their life to Christ and live a godly life. Unlike Ms. Burns, they don't make a living ripping people a part due to envy and pride. There is no \\"hidden agenda\\". The agenda of Mr. Graham and his associates is in the open - bring people to Christ and that is exactly what he does - opens the door to evangelize them and from there they should join a church for further study."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Good That Men Do...\\"","review":"Ms. Burns casts stones on a large number of people and organizations who have done a great deal of good in our world which certainly hungers for the kindness and generousity of others. I wonder what kind of book Ms. Burns would have written if she had been searching for the goodness in Billy Graham and his friends? How uplifting and inspirational the exact opposite of the book Ms. Burns wrote would be.About your book, my global comment is: Is that so, Ms. Burns?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Kill The Umpire is one of William Bendix's best performances, right up there with Life Of Riley.This is a great baseball movie from the other side of the game, the umpire's point of view.Safe At Home is a great piece of nostalgia for baby boomers. Mantle, Maris, and the rest of the Yankees at their height! What's not to like?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kill the Umpire","review":"Although \\"Kill the Umpire\\" is a great Bendix classic, \\"Safe at Home\\" is more like a documentary or short that would be included with a good movie instead of billed as a double feature. This DVD is well worth owning just for \\"Kill the Umpire\\". Now if they will just put \\"It Happens Every Spring\\" with Ray Milland on DVD I will be basball movie satisfied for awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"William Bendix's best baseball movie","review":"While this is an older film now, it's still funny. And it's not just a comedy, it's also a film about doing the right thing.This is a film about former ball player having a hard time holding job outside of baseball. Every spring he loses his job because he can't stay away from the game. His wife puts her foot down and his father-in-law winds up helping find a job he can keep, and do well at.William Bendix was great in this film and the man he was to later star with on The Life of Riley; Tom D'Andrea (who played his neighbor Gillis in that series) showed that could do good work together.Not for someone looking for a faithful representation of the game, but if you're looking for fun film about the national pass time this is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball Joyful Escape","review":"When the rat race of modern life gets to you there is always timeless baseball. Unfortunately the modern world has found a way to corrupt the purity of the game. These two movies harken back to the older \\" purer \\" days. Yes the movies are dated and abit corny but the values still ring true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe at Home is a Safe Bet","review":"Very enjoyable film with the flavor of family sitcoms of the era.
