Who were going to be the bad guys? Russians? Mad scientist? Aliens from Mars? Ahhh, Colombians, the drug lords hidden in the jungles making coke for the insatiable American market.Well, Arnold solves the problem and gets the chick in the process.

This story could have been more interesting if he wasn't a fireman.

I venture to state that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story is flawed, boring and extremely predictable. The fact that Schwarzenegger's performance was very poor did not sursprise me at all. He is considered to be one of the worst actors in Hollywood, and I share this view. It is beyond my comprehension that Hollywood still produces action movies of this kind. \\"One man against the world\\" concept is extremely ridiculous and obsolete. In order for a movie to be entertaining, it somehow has to capture the viewer's attention. Furthermore, it should be unpredictable and feature talented actors. Collateral Damage has none of these essential features. In light of this criticism, I strongly discourage people from renting this movie. On the contrary, I think you should be payed to see it!

If you were into or grew up with MTV during the Backstreet/'Nsync/98 degrees years...you will probably find this funny.

Secondly, Even though there is a bit of China-style slapstick, Lam Sai Wing is'nt pictured as the bumbling fool that most other Wong Fei Hung movies depict him as these days. According to history, Lam was Wong's best student. This movie doesn't try to defy that. Third, the Kung Fu is wireless and fluid. Reason number four is the appearance of Kwan Tak Hing. He is truly the best at doing Wong Fei Hung and it shows, especially in the calligraphy duel scene.

The first half of the book is basically a review of modern physics. The second half of the book delves into the author's recent theories. He has taken a bold step in arguing that Einstein was wrong. He discusses his theory which states that the speed of light is not actually fixed, as Einstein argued, but variable. From this premis, he discusses everything from the beginning to the end of the universe. I found the book a tad confusing at times, but an enjoyable read, none-the-less.

What has happened in Physics is that theories have become more and more outrageous and less and less open to verification or falsifiability. Anyone can come up with a wild theory about other dimensions, quantum weirdness, etc. and the rest of us are supposed to bow down to it. Just one question - where is the evidence? And if there isn't any or if there is very little of it or if the evidence is unobtainable because we are talking about events outside of time, the theories belong on Art Bell's fringe radio show and not in a science forum.A bunch a physicists arguing these days is just as much of a madhouse as a bunch of theologians 500 years ago..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish, at best.","review":"In what's becoming typical of the genre, this book is 90% self-indulgent drivel.

I prefer my science to be cult-free, thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Has Nothing To Do WIth FTL Travel","review":"I thought this might be another FTL travel speculation book when I picked it up. I was very dissapointed to learn the book has almost nothing to say about FTL travel at all. Instead this is an attempt to convey a theory other than inflation to explain how the universe got from the big bang to the state we see today.The first half of the book is a good recap of the theories os inflation and general and special relativity. This part of the book is well written, concrete, and easy to follow. The second half of the book is very dissapointing. It starts to get very squishy in a hurry. After reading it I had no idea what the theory was or what it stood for, other than being a direct frontal assault on Einstein's work. The second half of the book is filled with rants about other scientists, journal editors, and university administrators, but there is very little science.I think that without a catchy title, this book would never have been printed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Petulant Child","review":"The book starts promisingly enough but by the halfway point has deteriorated into a self-indulgent polemic on the authors distaste and utter disdain for anything administrative. Especially if that administration is British. He also uses the book less as an explaination of his work than it is a petulant childs railing against his elders rules. The book is laced with languge and similies that his mother would have punished him for and his editor obviously allowed for shock value for there was little else of value where the author used it. All in all a disapointing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cosmology Needs Some Help","review":"This book leaves one with the eery feeling that we are moving rapidly towards the end of Western Civilization. It is another sad and embarrassing commentary about many of the players in contemporary cosmology, and as such, it reaffirms the existence of the socially and scientifically pathetic cast of characters already unashamedly portrayed in Alan Guth's book, The Inflationary Universe. Unfortunately, books in this genre seem to have more to do with the mutual admiration, promotion, and aggrandizement of a clique of insignificant minds than they have to do with any noteworthy scientific ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cosmology Theory or Educational System Diatribe","review":"The author spends way too much of the book in a diatribe about what he views as problems in the British educational system. I was disapointed that this was more about the author's trials and tribulations in the education system than about current cosmology. When the author does discuss his theory he holds back on the conceptual details because he claims the reader wouldn't be able to understand them. A book for the lay reader on complex technical topics needs a reasonably simple model to convey the essence of the topic to be useful. The author does provide reasonable models when discussing special and general relativity but leaves the reader wanting on his own theories. The bottom line -- the discussion of the education system gets in the way of too little cosmology content."},{"rating":"1","title":"the link is broken","review":"I only wish to let you know that in the Customer Reviews the link must be broken somewhere, since I cannot get all 54 reviews that are claim to exist.

He does a very good job of making the case in the face of an entire community thinking he is a nut job.Something perceived as \\"radical\\" does good for all of science as a whole. If anything Magueijo does engage us in necessary dialogue and forces us to think outside the box.A job well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive and Trivial","review":"Definitely not worth the read.. The book is little more than a meandering autobiography of a young, well-educated man who badly needs to grow up. He makes every effort to offend everyone, including most of his fellow cosmologists and all technical editors, then complains bitterly how everyone is against him. He even goes out of his way to offend his readers, with a sprinkling of totally unnecessary four-letter words. Although I have long advocated the concept of a speed of light variable with time, but not of space, Magueijo gets himself totally wrapped around the axle trying develop such a concept without in any way offending his personal God Albert Einstein (heresy!).

Some of this sounds like softer Filter, incorporating some electronic elements while retaining a definite rock sound. These guys almost seem to be \\"going through the motions\\" on these tracks; fairly simple (yet none too driving) guitar parts (alternation between TWO chords too often) abound, and lyrics seem bereft of genuine emotion. Granted, this is by no means a particularly bad approach to rock--nor is it an unpleasant listen--it just lacks the oomph to leave a lasting impression. Not only will intermittent listening render one unable to place the single's title with music (save perhaps the chirping falsetto oo-oo bridge); you won't remeber this seemingly random-named band either.

I have a master's degree in music perfomance so I'm not an uneducated music listener. I have around 600 albums and this one gets listened to more than any other. When I listen to a band, I generally listen for their \\"sound\\" not their genre. Consequently, I listen to many different styles of music. The guitar/drum/vocal sound is incredible. Yes it's pop-ish, but extremely well constructed, very catchy and highly energetic. The second half of the album is more mellow and thought provoking than the first but great for a night-time drive or studying. The most interesting aspect of the sound is the guitar which somehow finds a marriage of raw and produced. Madan's voice is fantastic, reminiscent of Bjork. I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, fun","review":"If you are a fan of Brit-pop, then look no further than \\"On.\\" Although dismissed as light-hearted fluff by some, the tracks on this album are superior to any of the top-40 tripe currently on the radio.

I'd advised the disgruntled writer to hold on to her CD--there is only one available on the entire internet and the seller is asking for $75.00. An unmistakable message--it appears that Kiri lovers don't want to part with Kiri CDs. Also advise other viewers to get the VHS from which this CD was made. Inexpensive now but it'll not be for long. It's called Kiri & Andre: The making of Sidetracks. It has the best closeups of Kiri that I've ever seen and shows what a happy-go-lucky gal she is.

Hard rocking songs like the opening \\"Shot in the Head\\"and a strong cover of Howlin' Wolf's \\"Howlin For My Darlin'\\" set a hard rock tone. Quieter and more reflective bluesy numbers like \\"Love Me Please\\" round out another very solid if ignored effort from the band.

It is an excellent example of a picture book that is loaded with serious and interesting information. The look of the book makes a kid feel comfortable immediately and the writing, while not college-level, will stretch a typical grade school kid beyond the norm. I especially recommend it if adult or child is planning a trip to Italy, as it provides much background information to help one appreciate Michelangelo's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange. Very Strange","review":"This was without a doubt the weirdest book I have ever read. I assumed this would be a romance but it was more of a mystery as to the details behind a childhood accident involving the main character, Cady, and her childhood friends and enemies. Her grandmother seemed almost like she had multiple personalities and her \\"friends\\" were not truly so. The most distrubing part of this book was the death of one of the secondary characters. I truly didn't like any of the characters in this book and finished it wondering why the heck I wasted my time reading it to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but redundant","review":"I liked the story well enough, but agree with a lot of the other reviewers in that it could have been written and edited a lot better.

I would probably read more from her, but my expectations are pretty low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst written book ever","review":"I had high expectations for this book. Was I ever disappointed. The story was unbelievable, the characters were as thin as a sheet of paper, and the dialogue read as if it had been written by a 13 year old. It was frustrating to read, because the dialogue just unraveled any interest I may have had in the plot. I was really shocked when I saw a picture of Fern Michaels. I would have bet that she was a very young author. Since she has been writing for over 30 years, there is no excuse for a book with such minimal plot and character development. To be fair, the concept of the book was weak, but a better author could have done more to make the book readable. Cartoon villians, inconsistent voice given to the comic relief of the grandmother and her servants, and a love interest who we are supposed to believe never got past his first love when he was 13. What a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION! What a bad book to read!","review":"I'm an avid reader and I just love to read everything. But, this is the FIRST time I have ever wanted to just chuck the book in the trash! I feel like I wasted my money on buying this book! The plot is really dumb, plain and simple, it's dumb! The author attempts (and fails miserably) to build a suspenseful plot around the fact that the main character, Cady, can't remember a simple accident that she got into. It's so cheesy! The author makes a big deal out of a situation that does not invoke fear nor does it call for such drama. Also, the dialogue is very child-like. The author doesn't give the reader the benefit that we can actually put two and two together, so it almost seems condescending. It's terribly written, wish I could get a refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drag...","review":"I must say Fern Michaels was again a disappointment. the plot of the book was too weak to actually write over 400 pages on it.it was very boring that I skipped through most of the pages and in the end; the big secret was too cliched in my opinion. Cady's romantic interest; Boomer the police chief wasnt strong enough for a main character and so was their romance for that matter. Lola was too fake. I actually felt sorry for Amy and i think our author is obsessed with dogs. you may borrow this book from a library or whatever but do not buy it in any circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing First Read","review":"The cover said \\"N.Y. Times Bestselling author,\\" and \\"characters are real and endearing,\\" so I was expecting a well crafted book. Unfortunately, I felt the characters were shallow stereotypes, with some bordering on the down-right silly. The plot was contrived and felt as if the author could not decide between writing serious drama, or farce, while the \\"death by shower\\" incident stretched my credibility to the breaking point. I am not likely to choose another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST DIALOGUE I've ever read!","review":"I looked at the reviews before reading this book and I was surprised by the nearly equally divided opinions about it. It seems like people either loved or hated it. I was intrigued enough to check it out.Whew! I am SO shocked that this ever made it into print! The basis for the plot isn't bad but the execution is terrible. The characterization is nearly non-existant and the characters act in ways that aren't consistent with previous acts & thoughts. In addition, the dialogue has to be THE worst dialogue I've ever read (and I've read a lot of books!).I recommend passing on this book unless you're a die-hard Michaels fan and you want to be able to say that you've read everything by her. It's a real stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely the worst book ever written...","review":"I only read up to page 125 and couldn't read another word.

Wrong!! This book started out slow and never even got up to a crawl. Perhaps it would have been a bit more exciting if the reader didn't know up front what had happened \\"that day\\". I am rather klutzy myself, but I have never seen someone have such a hard time keeping their clothes on as Cady does. The 'old trio' further served to add to the goofiness level of the book, but the ending was beyond ridiculous. True, I could hardly put the book down, but that was primarily so I could get through it and start something much more interesting. This will most likely be the first and last Fern Michaels novel I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst but that isn't saying a lot","review":"Fiction is not reality....take a deep breath and tell yourself this before you pick up this book with all of your good intentions. I admit that I have not read very many Fern Michaels books, but I recall thinking the same thing about a previous book of hers. The heroine in this book is completely ridiculous. I don't think you are supposed to be hoping the heroine will accidentally get hit by a Twinkie truck during the course of the book you are reading, but unfortunately I was. There is no really strong storyline to this book and the characters end up behaving like little kids in a fight over a toy. I understand that all fiction has an element of fantasy but this was truly a pathetic example of why we pay for books as entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not a Fern Michaels fan...","review":"Okay, this is the third book of hers that I have read, and they are all written in the same childish way. The writing is stilted and the characters are just silly. In this book, the characters are not even likable, even Cady, the \\"heroine.\\" The dialogue is too simplistic and the book was about 300 pages too long. I am not sure why Michaels is supposedly a great author- the books I have read are very dissapointing. I won't be picking any more of her books up to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I'm at a loss as to how a book so poorly written could be so highly rated. Michaels makes the mistakes of a college (or even high school) creative writing student. Her sentence level writing as well as her scene and character development are so simplistic that I had to force myself to finish the book just to see why people recommended it. If you do not mind poor writing and unlikely leaps in the plotline, then perhaps you can enjoy the few positive elements of this book. If you are ever bothered by such things, then don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, unglued and alltogether not worth the price","review":"This is one of the worst novels I've ever read! The characters are not exploited, the plot is scattered all over the place, and the dialogue is SO BORING it was only by sheer willpower that I turned the last page. Cady Johnson appears as a silly introvert heroine that, with only one visit from a designer, changes her looks, her wardrobe and her 20-year long fears and attitudes, and turns out to be witty, adventurous and interesting. If only! Boomer, the wanna-be hero, comes out of nowhere, with a life-long love for Cady that has been hiding in his heart and comes alive after just once glance to her renovated self. Please! Save yourself a lot of deception and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who edited this???","review":"No editor worth his or her salt should have sent this book to print. Did the author even read through it after writing it? Discrepancies abound, the dialogue is both rambling and choppy (breathe much?), and the \\"plot\\" never develops. Basically, you can read the blurb and be done with it. From one page to the next, the characters bop around from personality to personality, never reaching any more depth than they had when first introduced (getting a make-over does NOT constitute character development.). My guess is that this book was published because the author has enjoyed past best-sellers, and name recognition will sell it. I could find nothing even remotely credible in this story. And who gave the fashion advice? If you enjoy reading the equivalent of a first-time novelist's first draft, go ahead and buy (or better yet, visit a library). My assessment is that this book never bloomed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to read....","review":"I just couldn't get into the book. The writing seemed choppy. I didn't feel much for the characters. Skipped many pages because I was just bored. I did read the end though and it just seemed a little odd...especially the whole shower thing.

It does, however, provide an extremely detailed account of the horrendously, seemingly impossible task Stavka faced in dealing with the German onslaught. Glantz provides readers with mind-numbinlgy detailed summaries of armies created on paper only to be slaughtered on the field, of Fronts being designated by desperate planners only to be shattered, and of Generals placed at the heads of armies only to be sacked, or worse, when they, almost, inevitably failed to win victories.The huge amount of data Glantz provides is almost impossible to keep track of. This book was slow going for me. More maps, higher quality maps, and more charts and tables would have been welcome. The nearly frequent typographical errors were annoying. The excellent endnotes were sometimes hard to locate. I would have preferred footnotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but very dry history","review":"Like all of Glantz' books, this one also tells its story with authority. However, the focus is on the large scale, strategic operations and the high command, and therefore does not make for interesting reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for progressive fans.","review":"If you never heard of Camel and you like 70's progressive music then you must include Camel in your collection. Though purchassing all the earlier albums would be rather expensive, this CD solves that problem. The songs are placed in chronological order. It makes it evident that Camel's creativity was at a peak earlier in their career. Disk 1 is much better though Richard Sinclair's vocals on Breathless is a fabulous start to disk 2. Contributions by Lol Coxhill, Eno, Phil Colins, the Sinclair cousins from Caravan and many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"money better spent elsewhere.","review":"if you like somewhat mellow, mood inspring progressive rock, cd 1 is worth listening to. if you like 'hall and oates', cd 2 is your listen. whichever you like, you will be frustrated with the other disc - better spend your money on either the first camel albums/cds or on hall and oates or the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfinished Symphony","review":"I think it is a good collection for two golden decades of this fantastic British progressive rock band.

Rich, detailed, charming illustrations accompany rhythmic, rhyming text in patterns that build upon each other, featuring all sorts of animals throughout the day and night, and even the sun, moon, and sky. I loved the interesting and somewhat atypical choices of animals showcased (puffins, for example) as well as the more familiar ones. The story progresses throughout one entire day, from moonlight to moonlight, making it an excellent choice as a bedtime read as well.

To those people living outside of New Orleans, the relevance of the blues might seem to be an exercise in the exotic; for those living outside of New Orleans, any music beyond today's top ten tunes might seem a strange and foreign entity; music is a part of daily life in New Orleans--the only city in America where music is always in the air, breathed by citizens of every caste. How fitting that Sinclair's book should be published by the unfunded Surregional Press, also of New Orleans, and of a press run of less than two thousand copies. The commitment to culture is exemplified by both press and author, a commitment which has not yet bowed to lack of economic reward--although our collective financial fashions may undo us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stodgy Performance in Heavily Compressed Sound","review":"Do not waste your money on this one. The sound receives such dynamic compensation and compression that there is no audible difference between ff and pp dynamics. A tragedy, seeing as the orchestra is on top form. There is no ambience or bloom to the sound and Karajan's performance sounds weighty and vertical and never takes flight. It is one-dimensional severe Tchaikovsky. The sound also gets chopped off at the ends of movements, perhaps to edit out applause, but gives the production a cartoony, clinical feel. The picture also loses in its very distracting camera-work and editing. Perhaps the momentously electrical live account with Zander in Boston's Jordan Hall will eventually see the light of day. This DVD is a disgrace to Karajan's often superb abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good performance recorded poorly","review":"This DVD dissapointed me by the fact that the recording quality seemed very flat. The louds, particularly the 4th movement, didn't seem much different from the softs. I'm sure that it was an amazing performance, but the recorders don't let you listen to that performance. Another thing that bothered me were the cameras. They never seemed to focus on the important section of the orchestra. They also focused way too much on Karajan. I know that he is important, but not so much that the orchestra isn't. If you want to listen to a good recording, listen to his CD, or my preference is the Chicago Symphony recording with Daniel Barenboim conducting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy or rent","review":"I bought this movie thinking it'd be a good watch. I'm a big fan of the mafia movie genre and I love Harvey Keitel. But this movie was just plain boring, and far too long. But don't think I'm the kind of person who can't appreciate a slow moving film (I loved The Killing of a Chinese Bookie). Plus there was just some rediculous moments, like the nuns pushing the car off the cliff even though he was sitting right in it and in park....You want a good Harvey Keitel flick, go check out Reservoir Dogs or Mean Streets. You're looking for slightly obscure gangster movies try Wannabes, Revolver, Family Enforcer or Ghost Dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and confusing","review":"The story was potentially interesting but boy was it confusing, strange at times and too often very slow. The nuns ending up being a bunch of hit ladies was about the last nail in the coffin for this one, and then it wound up with a live pet lamb that had a bomb planted inside it. Too strange for sure. I am surprised I sat through all of this film.

One surprise - the author also takes a hardline with firm tofu: forget it. It was truly liberating.

Again, Tess evolves and grows with each passing book and I'm completely fascinated with her character development.In this particular work, Tess fights an unknown serial killer. Lippman crafts a phenomenal storyline, filled with twists and turns. Each chapter left me hanging on for more. It was so hard for me to put this book down and when it was over I was completely sad. I wanted the book to be longer, to keep going! This book sweeps you up in the terror and horror of one serial killer's path of destruction and his battle against one of the strongest and smartest woman heroine of all time.

He is a good story teller who, at times, is not honest about his topic and unbalanced in his judgments. I never will disuade anyone from reading any book.

A well-written book, but one that tells the reader a lot more about those who object to Catholicism than about the Church.

Kung is famous for challenging traditional Catholic teachings, especially those teachings concerning papal authority. In the past, he has even written ambiguously about the central Christian teaching concerning the bodily resurrection of Christ. His vision of a future Catholic Church includes ordination of women, a merely honorific papacy, and rejection of much of traditional Catholic devotion.

The facts he did give which were true, were only true in part and presented with a distinctive bias. On other issues, Kung lied, pure and simple, especially in regards to Pope Nicholas I, Pius XII, the role of Constantine in Rome, and so on.As a Catholic, Kung questions whether or not Christ actually founded a Church (read Matthew and John), doubts the Holy Trinity, papal primacy and most of the basic tenets of the Church. He is pro-choice, for the ordination of women to the priesthood and the compromise of basic Catholic dogma in favor of ecuminism.The facts are in error and his conclusions are garbage.

This book (The Catholic Church: A Short History) will be, in a way, a synthesis of his religious and scholarly work over the past four decades. It will be neither a Church history written from the viewpoint of the official papal historians nor will it be an anti-Catholic catalogue of crimes throughout time. The author writes as a Catholic and both his love for his Church as it should be and his frustration with it as it can often be suffuses the entire history. He covers the material both efficiently and passionately in a short amount of space. This book may be disliked by those who are either blindly pro-papacy or obstinately anti-Catholic, but everyone else should have an entertaining and informative read from an author who understands history as a lived experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend listening to it.","review":"Historical problems of the Catholic Church spanning 2000 years are clearly told.

Here and elsewhere, Kung questions the validity of the Resurrection, the primacy of the Pope in Church hierarchy, clerical celibacy, and the sacrament of Penance, among other things.It's no wonder the Vatican revoked Kung's status as a Catholic theologian for insistently denying papal infallibility and the full divinity of Christ.Kung arrogantly would replace 2,000 years of Catholicism with his own vision of a congregational, protestant Church.** Read H.W.

The beginning fifty or so pages did a fairly quick history job in explaining events and people. The Vaticun II part read like a liberal wishlist of how to destroy and rebuild the church in their own image. I realized the (Roman) Church is suffering from the many recent events but most are caused by what appears as the liberal agenda from within. I'm sure the American Catholic Church will use this as a gathering point for their new theology and use it to their advantage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended reading for orthodox Catholics","review":"It is not so much a history as an attempt to redesign the church.

Not recommended reading for orthodox Catholics."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking, informative, but light on details","review":"this was a well written, very interesting book that gave me a pretty good overview of the history of post-Jesus Christianity and the Catholic Church. i still see myself looking for a more traditional history book on this topic, though, as the author focussed more on the effects of actions and events on the church more so than the actions and events themselves. the author also assumes a certain level of understanding of the Catholic Church and it's structure, which made some of the passages tough to navigate. one warning- have a dictionary at hand- i've never even seen some of the words he uses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"little book with lots of information","review":"I like the fact that the author himself is a catholic priest.

Reading this as if he's lecturing at Tübingen gives me the sense he knows thousand of pages of information and had a hard time distilling it into 200. But clearly, the high point of his life was having his only liked pope, John XIII, name him a theological consultant to Vatican II. The low point was having John Paul II censure him for what seem to me are some off-the-wall views. If only the laity and his theologian buddies could vote - then Hans could get his ideas passed as Church rules! But alas, that wretched papacy got in the way! Thus, we have a emotionally scarred, vindicative person racing through history, selecting every bit of evidence to prove the papacy is the \\"gang that couldn't shoot straight\\".

I thought the time travel idea was explained reasonably well enough, but the whole thing got just a bit too silly for my own taste. By the end of the movie, it is left as a time travel paradox. The original movie had some logical lapses, but it was so enthralling. This adaption doesn't have the chilling self-destruct sequence of the original: instead, it delivers something pretty silly. The real climax of the adapation is not the self-destruct sequence, but more conspiracies and coverups.One viewing on TV is enough for me. If I decide to buy a DVD, I'll get the one for the original movie, maybe along with 'OUTBREAK', which is a pretty good effort in the 'germ disaster' genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Until the End","review":"While I did quite enjoy the first half of the Andromeda strain. I felt like the whole series just gets lost in the last hour or so. There is the addition of en entire temporal paradox that is left completely unexplained and only alluded to in the end. Their are some piss poor decision made by the decision makers like Doctor Barton risking the fate of the entire planet because her family is threatened. The whole self destruct sequence is far to cliche and the deaths and meaningless and pointless. In short that was a very enjoyable miniseries loses it's way in it's closing moments and becomes something not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor!","review":"I'm a fan of the original 1971 movie.

It has every anti-American cliché known to modern media from conspiracies about the gulf war to government hit men. The number of technical mistakes is far too numerous to mention. The science has more in common with the Greek mythology and the fiction just a vehicle to peddle a jaded view of the U.S. This was nothing more than agenda-drive tripe clinging to the coat tails of a great story and masquerading as science fiction.

If so, he deserves to share an eternal coach airline seat with Tom Clancy, who allowed the movie Adaptation of the Sum of All Fears. In both cases the movie is so much less than the book.

I do not want to even bother saying another word of this TV mini-series remake, it was a complete wasted effort.

I know TV movies are made on the cheap, but this is exceptionally bad. Every cliche in the book. First you might need actors playing scientists that don't seem like they would have trouble getting through high school. Some scenes are so utterly ridiculous they must be putting us on.

The art direction has no direction and is overly complex, difficult to look at and too dark. You can't art direct your way out of a disaster of a screenplay. The less said about this film the better actually since there is so little to recommend it. It fails on as many levels as the original succeeds.

Done in a very scientific-medical fashion that lent it a feel of reality-docudrama more than a movie, the 1971 movie remains one of the best Michael Crichton movies ever done. This REmake is nothing of the sort. Horrible acting. Bad dialogue. And the \\"thumb scene\\" at the end was the bad icing on a very bad cake!I am a huge fan of the original.

If you are a fan of the original film or the Crichton novel then avoid this disaster. I am not against change and the 1971 film could use some updating but this story bears little resemblance to the original and the changes made are ridiculous. Many of the fundamental elements were left out, leaving those unfamiliar with the story wondering what's going on. What is all that stuff falling down the central core and why did the pilot's face mask fall apart? Apparently there was no time to explain the concept of the 5 level Wildfire facility but they WERE able to squeeze in slow motion scenes of the characters walking naked through showers and being sprayed down with foam.

I've just had it for a week, but I already feel my tummy folds slowly tightening. Amazing! Hopefully, I will lose the last 20 lbs of extra weight gain in the next month or so. By the way, I noticed this work-out has combined Pilates and ballet movements (the gal is graceful when she moves/changes positions) that make the exercise really engaging, too. She may not give you a cue when it's time to do a different routine but that's ok for me since it gives me just enough freedom to do/continue with a position.

Very Dance and upbeat with upbeat music I didn't really like. She also dances a lot in it. So, yes, I like this post-pregnancy workout the best from Tracy.

I emailed Tracey Anderson about this a few weeks ago, but I still have not received the correct DVD or any response to my complaint that the wrong product was received.Also, it would be helpful if there was some information on Tracey Anderson's dvds about the length of the workout or a breakdown of the various segments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: Not a postnatal DVD!","review":"This should not be marketed as a post-pregnancy DVD!

My legs and arms are showing a little more definition but not as quick as my stomach. I'm going to definitely continue with it. I purchased the Mat DVD as well to mix things up a little. I noticed the mat DVD focuses more on Legs and Arms and the PP DVD does more abs. Here's the breakdown on the two DVD's:Post Pregnancy DVD:1. Warm Up2. Abs (Crunches)3. Abs (Incorporating the arms & legs)4. Legs5. Arms6. Arms with weights7. Cool DownMat DVD:1. Plea Warm Ups2. Legs with a Chair3. Arms4. Arms with weights5. Legs on the Mat6. Abs (crunches)7. Cool DownI would definitely recommend Tracy's DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !!!!","review":"If you want to get amazing abs by doing cardio, then this DVD is not for you. But if you want to target your belly, butt and arms then this DVD is for you and it is GREAT!!I bought it because I always had problems with my tummy area ( and I never had a baby but I thought that this might help me) I am so glad I got it because after the work out I really did feel like I was working out muscles I've never worked out before (especially the next day)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ab workout","review":"I hadn't exercised in awhile and carried about 15 extra pounds. I bought this video and her dance video after reading the reviews. The first day after doing the ab workout I couldn't sit up in bed. My neck was sore because I was using it to pull up my shoulders since I had no ab muscle tone. She says to keep at it and I did. Within three days I could feel muscle fibers on the sides and shortly thereafter my stomach wasn't pushing open my blouses! I've been doing it for six weeks and still fast forward through some of the exercises because I'm not able to do them...yet. She's right in saying just keep doing the movement and eventually you'll feel it in your muscles. I now feel muscles in every area of my abs and people are commenting about how good I look. Wish I bought it three years ago! It's a tough workout, but good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"From the title, I expected there to be some cardio involved in a post pregnancy workout. That is not the case. Although this is a great ab workout, I gave it two stars because I don't think it is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"This DVD was very dull and uninteresting to watch. It's the same basic exercise that we are used to seeing. So save your 29.95 and don't let \\"Gwyneth\\" name entice you. Not worth the money. It \` s not interactive and fail to encourage and motivate ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This one routine is incredibly boring. The music is dull and fails to motivate. The instruction is minimal. I would recommend Postnatal Conditioning with Teddi Bryant or Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred. Both contain more than one workout routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I am very disapointed in Tracy and Gwen. For moms that just had babies this DVD could be completely demoralizing. Very few women have the strength let alone the motivation to get though this. There should be more mention of the fact that this ab workout is insanely difficult and you should do what you can, build your strength and than move on. At first glance it seems impossible and could be very discouraging for many people.Also the workout portion should be divided into chapters.Make sure you are in decent shape before even watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous workout with a great instructor!!!","review":"This is a tough workout and a great deal for the money. I would recommend this to anyone who is serious about getting in shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"This video is really hard, but even after the first couple of times, I can tell it will be very effective. I just had my third baby 4 months ago, and have so much belly flab that I am desperate! After the first two babies, my belly slimmed up on its own, but this time, not happening. Tracy's video works every single muscle and angle of your core. She does give modification for starting out, all of which I used and I still was only able to do half of the workout. This will be challenging for a while. As another rewiever stated, I am really sore, but not so much where I can't move and take care of three kids under three! The video seems to go really fast (the workout is 45 min.) and is very calm and soothing with classical music and Tracy's voice. This is going to be a great workout, and I alreay feel stronger! Thanks Tracy for sharing your expertise! Katie, Washington State"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing workout","review":"I bought this after having my second child. I was amazed by the results I saw after 1 week. My could feel my abs again, my legs and butt were firmer and my arms were noticeably smaller. I was doing the workout 5 or 6 times a week, but not following her diet plan because it seemed a little extreme since I was nursing my baby. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to tone up their abs, legs or arms."},{"rating":"1","title":"not practical for new a new mom","review":"The content of this workout is great, which is why it's such a disappointment that it is in one long segment. As a new mom, it's hard to find time to work out; sometimes I have to break up my workout into several sessions throughout the day. This is really difficult to do when the dvd is one long 50 minute chapter. The idea of fast forwarding to find where I left off can be a reason not to go back to the workout. Naps can be so short. I don't want to waste time finding where I left off; I'd rather choose another video that has chapters.Also, she gives very little direction and her voice is not very loud at times, making it hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and difficult","review":"Caution some of these movies i would not recommend to someone who just had a baby like Tracy says you should. The moves are very difficult and i can see how someone may get hurt if they attempted these too soon after having their baby. That being said, I love this workout. it definitely worked for me. I t is a bit long so everytime i get through it i feel so accomplished lol. Take your time getting through it and pair it with a form of cardio for optimal results, but even by itself i saw incredible results within the first three days. worth buying and the price is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Darn good!","review":"I really liked doing this Video. I am pregnant..I only have 1 month left in my pregnancy. Obviously I am not suppose to be doing it but I modified it quite a bit. It was difficult. I am sure it will be perfect for post-pregnancy. I really love the way Tracey is in her video's. She is so cool..she doesn't talk very much but she has way more personality in this video in comparison to the 90 Day Video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Beginners but Works","review":"I have to first point out that this work out is really difficult. I am in pretty good shape and had a hard time finishing it during the first week, so if you are looking for a no brainer anyone can do it exercise program this one is probably not for you. That being said, I have been doing this workout for 2 weeks and I have already gone down a whole dress size. My stomach is starting to look flat again (something I thought was going to take a tummy tuck to happen). My favorite part is the arms. I am not a fan of bulky manlike arms and usually skip arm workouts. But Tracy has great unbulky feminine arms and I have given her arm workout a go and I love the results so far. Honestly this is the hardest workout I have ever done, but the results keep me motivated. Hopefully, I can stick with it:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Abs!","review":"I have been switching this video off and on every other week for the past month with the mat work dvd, and the abs I am developing are simply lovely. I was fairly fit to begin with, so I was surprised at how challenging I found this workout. After a month I love the 'shape' of my abs. I had flat abs before, but the lines I am seeing right now are really nice. The workout is very challenging, and I am still unable to keep up perfectly with her which is refreshing for me to be honest- it means this dvd will leave me with loads of room to progress. I always strike people as in-shape, but recently, unlike ever before, people are actually coming up to me and asking what workout I am doing! I am very pleased with this video, as well as the mat workout and the dance cardio. I am excited to buy the Perfect Design Series soon :) I recommend this dvd- just expect to be worked hard, very hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"For women with babies?","review":"I got this towards the end of my second pregnancy. I have had two c-sections and definitely wanted to get back into shape. This DVD has low quality production. I agree with others who posted there isn't enough commentary so you are constantly staring at the tv in an ackward position. But the most annoying part, was the length! I have an infant and a toddler, which means I have no time and am sleep deprived! I ended up tossing this into the trash and bought Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner workouts that are shorter and more intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start after pregnancy","review":"I have always heard about Tracy Anderson but never tried any of her videos. Right after I had my baby 9 weeks ago, I was desperate to get rid of that fat flabby tire that has made its home on my waist line. So far by doing the video for the last three weeks, I have been very impressed. I agree with the other reviews that its not just for people who are post pregnancy, this is definitely a killer ab workout. My only complaint with this video is that there is no direction to know if you are doing the move correctly. You just have to try to copy her moves as accurate as possible. Great start to get back to my body!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST CHALLENGING ABS","review":"This tape really helped my stomach get back to normal. At the beginning I could barely do any of the exercises because they were so challenging, but if you stick with it you will grow stronger every day. Typical ab tapes are too easy from the start, but Tracy really knows how to challenge you! She is awesome and I would recommend this to any mother who has just had a baby and wants to get your mid section back in shape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can feel it working!!!","review":"This workout is exactly what I needed. It is very challenging and there are certain moves that I cannot do yet, but if I stick with it I know it will pay off. I definitely noticed a difference in my posture and stomach only after a few times. I do have to say I felt sore the first few times I did the workout, but that definitely goes away. Oh and I love the classical music. It was very relaxing. Great post pregnancy video!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally seeing something...","review":"I actually brought this video about 6 months ago. I have been using it on and off. Since last week I have been using it every other day and I have noticed a change in my abs. I was in disbelief but estatic at the same time. My daughter is now 14 months and I wished I would have started something sooner. I am gonna give this another 5 more weeks to see if I actually see a big change, my birthday is August 13. I am doing this workout 3-4 times a week and on off days I am doing 30 min. of cardio and yoga. We will see!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult!","review":"I had my baby 2.5 months ago & started doing cardio & some strength training but wanted something a little more challenging, so I purchased this dvd.

II just can't do this DVD - it is WAY too difficult. I wish she had someone in the DVD with her doing modified versions of what she is doing, because all of these moves are so painful. I am healthy and cleared for exercise, and I want to get my stomach back. This is just too much right now. Maybe in 6 months. I am going to try some easy pilates now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this workout!","review":"I was given this DVD as a Christmas gift after mentioning to a friend that I was planning on ordering it. I was 5 months pregnant when it was given to me as a gift, and I started using it two weeks after my OB said it was ok to resume my gym routine. Thankfully my body simply shed the weight I had gained immediately after giving birth (I attribute this to the pre-natal yoga and the healthy diet I maintained while pregnant). Yet, even after shedding the weight, I was still unable to fit properly into my jeans due to my body shifting to accommodate my growing belly.Tracy understands this as she herself has had a child and thus has designed this workout to really get your body back to what it was like pre-pregnancy.I love this workout and have faithfully used it almost daily (I take off one or two days a week) and it has gotten me back into my pre-pregnancy clothing with some room to spare!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"this is a great DVD to get rid of the baby belly. if you stick to it like she says, overtime you will lose it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"This video is quite hard, and I had my child 21 months ago! I love it though, because not many workouts make my abs sore anymore. And I can't even do everything in the workout (at least as many times as she does). I only gave it 4 stars though because she's not a very good instructor. You have to keep your eye on the video and pay attention or you'll miss the switches in movement. She's very soft spoken, and sometimes she doesn't say anything when it's time to switch to a different side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good if you have separated abs(diastasis recti)","review":"Ok, I'm gonna write a geniune review here today. I read and heard all good comments about this dvd so I bought it and tried it for 3 months but nothing happened to my protruding belly after two kids i got separation in my transverse abs so fix it first if you have this condition because I can't even explain it to you how frustrated I feel that I wasted all my 3 months doing this for 40 mins in hope ok give it time, give it time and give it time.... it might be good for those whose tranverse abs are already joined together. So, I'm going to try different excercises now like stability ball for abs and other transverse strengthining excercises now first and if they come close and I feel them hard together again who know when then I will think about giving this dvd a try...hmmm gosh so dissapointed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Joke!","review":"I purchased this dvd after the birth of my daughter and with high review from a well known magazine. To my suprize, I found that herculese himself would have trouble performing all the moves in this video. I could barely make it halfway through a 40 min session that expects you to do over 100 different types of crunches and \\"ab challenges\\"! There was also no cardio on the video like it implies. Not realistic at all. I was very disappointed and recommending this to a new mom would be an insult!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"This is not worth the $70 price tag.

(Our dog eats canned dog food so we open 3 cans a day on a regular basis.) Then it quit working.

It is mdf but a sturdy headboard all the same. My real only gripes are it is not a solid pearl white like the rest of their collection. It is more a washed white where you can see the mdf seeping through the white. Also it does not come with the hardware to attach it to the frame itself. All in all it has managed to hold to my two year old. I just wanted to give fair warning about the color and hardware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"We were a little disappointed in this piece of furniture.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN NYC BALLET EGO STROKER","review":"It seems those who purchased the VHS copy have been pleased,which makes me wonder if the material is different on the video from the DVD. I purchased the DVD and hate it. I would agree with another reviewer that the DVD is a mess! If there's a workout on this DVD they sure made it difficult to find it. This DVD primarily focuses on the lives of the showcased dancers and that's it! It's a glamour shot for NYC ballet dancers and a very immodest ego puffer for them. I studied ballet for 8 years and really wanted a nice ballet workout. This doesn't work you out at all. There's a slightly nice ab workout but it's not long enough or repetitve enough to do any good. Ballet can be a wonderful workout as well as a calming and healing excercise. It's truly unfortunate that the NYC Ballet couldn't accomplish the task of promoting the many healthy benefits a person can gain from doing a ballet workout. Instead they improperly use it as a publicity effort to promote themselves. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I was intrigued by this video, since I have a dance background and have taken a couple ballet courses in college. However, I found the frequent ballet terms difficult to follow and the instructions lacking. Unlike \\"normal\\" exercise tapes, there was little introduction to movements and injury prevention (especially when working on back muscles). The tape was a nice change from my other tapes, and I did feel the workout, but I would only recommend this to seasoned dancers and exercise enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout, Bad Editing","review":"I have taken many years of ballet, therefore the video was easy for me to understand. The only difficulty this video poses is that you HAVE to be watching the screen at all times, otherwise you find yourself totally off from what the dancers are doing. The narrorator does not tell you often enough when to switch sides, how many reps to do, or when a change of moves is coming. Perhaps this is the way ballet is taught, but for those who are use to video workouts that fully guide you through the program, you will find yourself a bit frustrated.However, the exercises are an awesome change of pace. It is not overly exhausting, but you definitely feel your body reacting. I absolutely broke a sweat, and cannot wait to workout to the program again. I do hope they come out with a second video that is a bit more refined.Again, I highly recommend the workout, but the video definitely lacks in editing and narrorating!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it......","review":"It was a refreshing change to the typical workout. It might be a bit to much for people who never took ballet since some of the positions aren't fully explained. As a child I hated taking ballet, but as an adult I love the workout it gives you. I felt the difference in my posture and overall body tone within weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most fun tape I own","review":"I love doing this tape. I don't get bored with the exercises and the music and camera work is beautiful. The tape is 55 minutes long with both floor and standing work. It doesn't seem as though you are working very hard, but after you are done your muscles will say otherwise. I alternate this tape with running and it keeps my muscles flexible and strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Ballet Dancers Only!","review":"This is not your typical workout video. Do not waste your money, unless you already know ballet. I took ballet for 4 years as a child, and I could not keep up. There is very little instruction, and the pace is rapid."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun, challenging toning....","review":"i really enjoy this video. this video has made my inner thighs lose inches and they are very scuplted right now. i had a very small dance background when i first picked this video up, and i learned all the moves fairly quickly. however, i will say that people who are not into dance whatsoever probably will not enjoy this dvd because it will be hard for them to pick up the exercises. the floor barre exercise for your inner and outer thighs is gruelling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent workout, great for a change of pace...","review":"I love this workout!!First of all, I'd like to point out that although I have no dancing experience, I had no problem catching on simply by attempting the workout a few times. I may have looked like a total clutz, but hey, that's the beauty of working out at home, right? But really, this workout is for ANYONE, not just experienced dancers, as I've seen claimed in some reviews. Watch your form, don't expect to look like a ballerina the first time through, and prepare yourself for some muscle soreness the next day!This video is a great complement to any workout regime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to return this","review":"I have purchased several excersice videos from Amazon, and this is the least favorite. I have taken ballet lessons, and learned the basics, yet stillI find instructions of this tape not informative enough. It tells what to do, but no specific explanation on how to do them right. It is in black and white, and very two dimentional. There's no encouragement, either. If you like ballet as I do, I'd assume you want to see the dancers in their most beautiful costumes and moves, right? If so, I don't recommend this. Instead I highly recommend Jennifer Kries's Pilates Target specifics. It is not ballet tape, but in one of four sections for thighs she uses ballet and she gives great instructions, encouragement, collors, and three-dimentional views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book yes, Video NO","review":"Having used the book for about a year, I was really excited when I heard the video was coming out. Sadly, I was bored. Worse, if you arent a dancer you wont be able to follow properly.

The set, the dancers and the music were beautiful. I am not sure why they decided to have Sarah Jessica Parker do the intro, it was pretty pointless. I recommend watching the video first and then trying the moves if you don't know ballet moves and lingo. This is fun if for a once in a while workout, I personally prefer Grace Lazenby's \\"All the Right Moves- Yoga, Pilates and Dance Conditioning\\" video for better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the Halcyon.","review":"All you need is 5 minutes of this dvd and you'll be knocked out, it's so incredibly dull. Very serious and ponderous in tone and production. No pointers on form and injury prevention."},{"rating":"1","title":"for experienced dancers only!","review":"i have a little dance background, so i at least recognize the terminology that is used in this dvd... on the rare occasion that any instruction is given. anybody who has never taken dance classes is going to have no idea if they're doing the exercises correctly. it's a pretty subdued workout, and you will find yourself getting tired by the time you get to the little jumps section, but as others have mentioned, you get very little verbal cuing, so you have to watch caraefully at all times to make sure the dancers haven't changed things up on you. which they often do. this would work for people accustomed to taking dance and just following the instructor; anyone looking for an instructional workout video, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what it appears","review":"maybe it was just me but it seemed that this video misleads people. the cover is appealing and it sounds great to be toned without becoming bulky. unfortunately, the video itself is extremely boring and hard to follow. there's no excitement to get you motivated, only a plain white room and a narrator with a voice that could put you to sleep in a minute. i also found it very hard to do and i felt like an idiot prancing around not one bit as graceful as the dancers.it goes on forever and i can never seem to finish. i only give it two stars because it is not the video's fault that i am not coordinated enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"As a dancer, I expected this video to be a challenging workout, but unfortunately it is not that difficult. They watered it down way too much. If it is meant for exercise beginners, this should be clear in the title.My favorite part of the DVD turned out to be the biographies in the special options!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money!","review":"I purchased this dvd, thinking it would be a workout, combined with ballet movements. It does have ballet movements, but there is very little workout. I could burn more calories sitting on the couch. I found it to be very boring, unless you don't mind standing and lifting your leg 20-30 times, and doing it again. I thought there would be more hopping and leaping and whatever else ballet dancers do, but it was mostly stepping and lifting. For an hour worth of working out, I didn't even break into heavy breathing, much less a sweat. Don't buy this, it is a waste of time.One good point about it. The abdominal section is great! I use this section after my regular video workout (which is not this video), and do it two to three times in a row, it has good moves to help flatten the stomach, by doing a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Expect Any Dancing","review":"I bought this video because I wanted a fun, new way to get in shape. I have also taken ballet forever and thought I might learn something from the pros. Nope. There is one tiny dance section (if you can call it that), and the rest is the dancers going through very slow, very boring stretches. I did not break a sweat or even have tired muscles afterward. The only thing I really liked about this video were the dancer profiles at the end, but I didn't buy this tape to see the E! True Hollywood Stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLEXIBILITY!","review":"This is the first review I have taken the time to write. Which says alot! I am over 40 and have found an exercise routine that doesn't pop my hips from kick boxing.With a few ballet classes in college many years ago, I was able to adapt to this tape very easily. My goal was flexibility and the tape delivers this in stars. Within two weeks my body had a very different look to it from the stretching and toning that this program imbues. My flexibility, poise, posture all changed with these exercises. Being consistent with an exercise program is not one of my strengths. BUT even after I had gotten off track with doing this tape; I always found my way back to it because of the quick results I got, the minimal time commitment (1/2 hr.per/day, doing warm ups and floor ex. only) and the way these exercises made me feel after doing them. This tape is a winner for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for former dancers","review":"This is a great product for former dancers who don't or can't do regular classes anymore. Might not be the best for beginners as proper ballet terms are used but the exercises are great for easing back into dance and keeping in shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for everyone","review":"i've been a dancer on and off for sixteen years and i cannot do this workout. the narrator talks too fast and does not explain anything. my ballet ignorant friends gave up after the first warm up. only buy this if you study ballet and have been studying ballet for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good introduction, love it!!","review":"This dvd is great. I was just diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and this is a very good workout and stretch routine after having to quit all physical activities over the last year. I have taken 14 yrs of ballet and have been away from dance for about 5 yrs concentrating more on karate and cardio. Very good direction and goes slowly at first. A great introduction for those who are beginners or have never done ballet. I've only done it for 1 week and my balance and flexibility have improved so much. I bought this along with the 2nd version of the nyc ballet which I would definately recommend, though a little fast paced for a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"a big plus for me is the exercises are in short segments, so that i don't get bored or fatigued for a certain area. however, for people who like to target a specific muscle group, ea segment may not be long enough. another big plus is the beautiful music, which is rare for workout videos. an hour just flies.the only flaw is the cuing is a bit off & there's no instructions. this is no problem for me since since i've taken ballet. but it may be a problem for a novice.i also enjoy the interviews at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this video","review":"I used to take dance lessons for years, but it's been almost two years since I stopped. This seemed like the perfect video to help me get back in shape. It's wonderful! It goes at a slow pace which makes it both relaxing and more difficult at the same time. It tends to focus more on the lower body, but I've found that by the end my arms are killing me from holding them in position. The dancers are, of course, in perfect shape, which can be a little intimidating (nothing like seeing a ballerina twisted like a pretzel while I can barely do the move!), but with the classical music and quiet tone, it's very relaxing and refreshing. If you're not familiar with ballet terms it will probably take a few times to get the hang of it, but it goes at a slow enough pace that it won't confuse you too much.I'm definitely going to recommend this to my friends back at the dance studio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thorough Workout!!","review":"Having seen and done almost every workout tape available to mankind, I was pleasantly surprised by the NYC Ballet Workout tape. I used to take jazz dance class and many of the moves were familiar to me. They are simple and really give you a good workout. I sweat more than I did doing 30 minutes on a stationary bicycle. After the workout, which goes by really fast, I felt good that I actually stuck to it to the end and I didn't feel worn down and beat and I am looking forward to doing it again! This tape brought back very happy memories of my dance classes and it was probably the best investment I've made in a workout tape in a VERY long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for toning, strengthening, and sculpting!","review":"Quality DVD with class and style. Broken down usefully into different sections for different ballet moves, easy to follow for the aerobics classes workout regulars with a good sense of body coordination and internal motivation.Great for a slow cardio day when you want to focus on toning, sculpting, stretching and strenthening, especially for inner thighs workouts which most people ignore."},{"rating":"1","title":"New York City Ballet Workout-- Nice to watch, HARD to do.","review":"I bought this video because I enjoying many forms of dancing and thought that this would be a video I would look forward to popping in everyday. I have some background knowledge in ballet. I found this video very difficult to keep up with because their is absolutely no instruction as to how to do the steps that they are doing. I would probably have to watch the tape over and over in order to pick up these moves. It's a great informational video on the New York City Ballet dancers but I wouldn't waste your money if you're looking for a good workout (unless you're very experienced in ballet...and I mean VERY EXPERIENCED.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic workout","review":"This is a wonderful workout--I've taken years of ballet and I was exhausted by the time I finished! I'd rate it, however, between 3 and 4 stars for two reasons--first, the narration doesn't keep up with the actual video so if you are doing a movement that requires looking away from the screen, you miss what the dancers are doing. Second, for someone who has taken ballet, it might be a bit repetitive or boring in parts.Despite those nitpicks, I was very impressed with the scope of the video. Every muscle group gets worked. I felt taller, thinner and more graceful after the workout and look forward to recapturing my ballet body!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay but not great","review":"okay, i just bought this and the secong workoutit was okay i guess. i mean, the steps are really easy and the workout is not tiring at all. i do not really consider it a workout but i guess if you just want to tuch-up on some basic stuff then it is a good video. but i being an advanced dancer at the age of 13 (a pre-proffesional) think it was a waste of time /money. it would be grteat for beginners though. that is all i have to say. hope that this review helps you. (oh yeah, my favorite part was the interviews and bonus features at the end of the DVD)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it, Hate it, Hate it, Hate it.","review":"As an athlete that many acquaintences consider \\"hardcore,\\" I deeply hated this tape. Unless you have been a professional ballet dancer your entire life, there is no way you would know how to do any of these moves. There is no instruction anywhere on the tape. If you want to watch 75-pound adults sway their arms for half an hour, this is for you. If you want a workout, stay as far away from this tape as you possibly can. This is the biggest waste of money I have ever seen in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back too!!","review":"I completly agree with Victoria M. Pond from Seattle, there is no barre at all! But I have to say the video is really nice; nice dancers, nice music, nice prodcution. I think, maybe, it is good for beginers, althoug theres a lot of center, quit dificult for beginers.Can some body recomend a very good ballet work out? Is there some kind of forum about this subjetc?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Relaxing Workout","review":"I bought the book of this workout and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was hoping there was a video and am happy to see there is. I read some of the reviews and it was indicated that the workouts weren't explained well or not at all on the video. Buy the book! It explains the positions and, of course, has pictures. There are tips for each workout. I am hoping the the video and book will compliment each other. I've only given it one star because I am just ordering it now. I thought I give a tip."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know how it is.","review":"The tape broke as soon as I put it in the VCR. So I didn't get much of a work-out. Other than trying to remove the tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Want A Choppy Workout?","review":"If you want a workout that stops and starts and stops and starts, then you should get this one via DVD. Your fingers get a GREAT workout because you have to continually hit the play button, even though the instructions say you can hit the \\"Workout\\" mode and you will be able to continue going through the program. That doesn't happen for me. I get to sit through all the introductions and credits while my heart rate drops, and then see the first warm up, and then have it go back to the main menu. Perhaps it's a defective DVD. I'll never know, though, because Amazon does not let buyers return open DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would make a great coaster.","review":"Thank god for the library. I was excited when I came across this tape at the library. I took dance classes as a child and have lots of rhythm. None of that mattered with this tape.There are too many gaps, so the 'workout' doesn't seem consistent. The narrator is horrific. It's impossible to follow his instructions. If you follow him, and look up, you realize that the dancers are doing something totally different.Do not waste your time on this tape unless you are a prima ballerina who can't get enough.Otherwise, use it to balance out an old table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"While the dancers are lovely to look at this in not a workout tape. Lots and lots of slow stretching but no cardio at all. If you are looking for heart pumping excercise this tape is way too mellow. For a better challenge just take a ballet class or look for other low impact aerobics. My tape was donated to Good Will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to return this","review":"I have purchased several excersice videos [...], and this is the least favorite. I have taken ballet lessons, and learned the basics, yet stillI find instructions of this tape not informative enough. It tells what to do, but no specific explanation on how to do them right. It is in black and white, and very two dimentional. There's no encouragement, either. If you like ballet as I do, I'd assume you want to see the dancers in their most beautiful costumes and moves, right? If so, I don't recommend this. Instead I highly recommend Jennifer Kries's Pilates Target specifics. It is not ballet tape, but in one of four sections for thighs she uses ballet and she gives great instructions, encouragement, collors, and three-dimentional views."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ballet workout","review":"This video was really useful to me, for what I wanted. It teaches terms and gives you a good workout. What I really liked was that each section was short, so I didn't get tired or bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible, defective","review":"if you can get past the technical difficulties, it might be a good workout. the first time i put it on, just to watch, it ran straight through, although with pauses between sections. when i was ready to actually do the workout, it went to \\"video diaries\\" after workout 1. i stopped and started again, this time by choosing the section i wanted. after going through that particular section, it jumped to one of the last sections. not in chronological order. so i stopped and started it again. after the first section, it went back to the main menu. what a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too plain and simple! (It's for beginners)","review":"According to the former feedbacks, I thought this DVD should be challenging or interesting. However,I was disappointed by not learning anything new and inspiring. Also, I disliked the dumbness of the dancers. It's more like a gym class than a ballet instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a workout.","review":"This workout may help with your flexibility, but you will NOT gain strength or cardio-respiratory endurance, or lose weight. It all depends on what you are looking for in a workout. If you are looking to sweat and burn calories, get a cardio video or go for a hard run. If you are looking to increase your flexibility and balance, this tape may help a little. Overall I did not like this tape, mostly bacause of the lack of instruction. They do very difficult moves and do not tell you how to do it. Personally I would recommend that you didn't waste your money on this, but, hey, it's cheaper than a ballet class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"I bought this DVD when it first came out and have only done it about twice. If you looking to lose weight or tone up this one won't do it. Its slow. While it looks good, and may be fun to do occasionally, its not worth the money. Invest in Tamilee Webb's \\"I want those\\" DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I had expected an actual ballet barre workout---the technique was lacking the cueing did not match the action.the photography was beautiful! The bodies of the dancers were inspiring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout for student dancers over a long summer","review":"I'm fifteen and I have been dancing for 8 years. Over the summer each year I always find myself getting out of shape. The NYC ballet workout is no excuse for a real class, but it has helped me stay in shape over the summer better than other years. I would reccomend it to anyone....ballet in general is a thorough workout. The verbal cues are pretty much bogus so mainly just focus on the dancers, but otherwise--> a great dvd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I was very disappointed with this video--perhaps if I had some background in ballet I would have had different expectations. I was looking for a different type of workout which it certainly is. However, I realized at about the 13th section that IT WASN'T FUN!!! Here are professional dancers holding perfect positions that I will NEVER come close to. I enjoy working out and have lots of work-out videos that I love--and many that I had to do several times before I really felt comfortable with them. I didn't even finish the whole workout--it was more like art than exercise. Watching perfection is one thing--it is beautiful--but it was not at all motivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Guidance?","review":"I haven't been able to make it past the first section of this dvd. There is no instruction, so I spend more time craning my neck trying to see what is going on (especially when doing stretches on the floor) than I do working out. I get so frustrated and uncomfortable by the end of the stretching section that I have lost interest. I wouldn't recommend this--do pilates or yoga for muscular strength and stretch toning, and something more guided for cardio. Otherwise you'll just be randomly jumping around your living room, like I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice video not good workout","review":"I did ballet for 7 years, I am familiar with the movements and this video is not really a workout video, you do it and unless you are completely out of shape, you won't feel/see any difference. The video is nice to watch, the dancers are in extremely good shape (yes! envy!) but they didn't get those muscles by doing JUST this video!! Come on! If you want a good workout look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated... skip it!","review":"I bought this video when enrolled in weekly exercise-ballet classes the the local club. i found this video to move way too slowly between the exercises, and too \\"markety\\" in how it presents them all. i was constantly fast forwarding to get to the next one. and each exercise itself it not repeated enough to be useful... far too many moves with too much time between them. overall, just not very useful or helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice visuals, poor instructions","review":"The video is aesthetically stunning, but the workout itself is fragmented and difficult to follow, due to the poor instructions. Some segments are \\"only for ballet dancers\\". Not for newbies."},{"rating":"1","title":"very difficult to follow, poor instruction","review":"as ex dancers, my wife and i were hoping this video would be as much fun as our old dance classes, but the instructors were bland and difficult to follow. It was not smooth and graceful, and the pilates refeernces seem unfounded. We did not like it and think it only sells beacuse of the name. Try somehting else instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame but a miss","review":"The dancers are beautiful, the voice cueing bites, slthough the moves get easier after a couple of viewings. But \\"a couple of viewings\\" is as far as I got. The wait between exercises is so very irritating. To keep things moving, I have to grab the remote and fast forward. And that breaks the flow too much -- every time I approach cardio workout level, there's that disjointed pause and boom, the heart rate drops. I didn't buy the video to look at dancers, but for a workout, and there it fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"the best part are the bios","review":"Sarah Jessica Parker's introduction is weak. And her hair is all hair sprayed and wierd. I have a bit of ballet experience, but the exercises are not explained at all and you're left just trying to match what they're doing on the screen without having any idea of proper form or even what exactly you're supposed to be doing. The exercises are not described per body parts, instead you have to figure out that some ab work is in the \\"floor barre\\" section, etc. This DVD layout is just a mess. Also, I don't feel that you do enough reps to really work out your muscles. The pictures on the cover and inside are stunning, and I thoughroughly enjoyed the interviews/bios of the 4 models. This DVD is best for glimpsing the life of ballet dancers and getting a rough idea of the exercises they do every day. Try a Method Pilates video, in my opinion you'll get the same long lean results without all this other nonsense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout but...","review":"This is a great work out for stretching and flexibility. If you had minimal exporsure to formal modern jazz or ballet classes ,it is useful. With no exposure to dance classes,it may be too much too soon. My one complaint is the dvd itself, it only plays in my lap top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout for retired ballet dancers","review":"This is an excellent video that verbally and visually explains very simply the movements of these ballet related exercises. The exercises are extremely beneficial as this is a combined series that works the entire body. Peter Martins does such a good job of commentating. As a retired ballet dancer, this video has helped me keep in shape as I am no longer able to complete a usual ballet program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, different workout","review":"this is a good workout if you are into stretching or yoga. i was sore for couple of days. although jessica parker's name is on the video, she only introduces the video and has nothing to do with it. the video uses ballet terminology so if you are not familiar with them, it is a little hard to follow in the beginning. otherwise, it is a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"The dancers are beautifully sculpted, and the extras tell you how and why they look like such perfect specimens of humanity. The workout itself is great; I have asthma and I prefer lower-impact workouts that won't trigger attacks. This helps with flexibility and muscle tone, concentration and coordination. I admit, they give no tips about form and technique, but I just try to emulate how they do it. If you're looking for something where they hold your hand and spoon-feed you, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product, price is beyond comprehension","review":"Even without paying shipping this price is over twice what I can pay at the local Wal-Mart or Target.

The towel used to be fairly soft and plush. Now the two thin layers will hardly separate. I examined a roll from my car trunk that is at least 8 years old and then examined the new roll. I'm not imagining things. The new rolls have a much coarser pattern and are just plain crummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I bought Bounty Paper Towels for 20 years, and used it all my adult life.

Though Alan Dutton was an author on both, only the 1981 version had co-author Diane T. Bunting. The Dutton and Bunting version is infinitely a better work. The quality of the writing and the photography exemplifies the effort put into it.

After cutting open the first mount with a pair of nippers, I successfully disengaged the nut from the jaws of death and was finally able to use it in the smaller mount provided.

It has a steady or flashing red light to make you highly visible from the rear. It definitely makes you feel safer knowing you can be seen in low visibility conditions or at night. Has a little push button on the rear to change settings or turn off. Easy to install and operate. Only complaint is to put batteries in you must effectively take it apart..be careful not to break anything during this process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light fell off while riding","review":"I have a trek 1.5 and I mounted mine under the seat post. It was a tight fit, apparently my seat post is almost too thick for this light- it was a little hard to get on, but it worked.1 week later while riding a normal ride, I noticed the light wasn't staying in place- it kept lowering and pointing downward. I had to lift it up multiple tmes while riding and keep checking on it. Next thing I know, the light is gone"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"awesome product. been looking for a rear bike light and this is the best. i also have a 3 Led front lights. im ready for nighttime biking.

One came missing a part and that is why I gave it 4 stars; however, I quickly recieved a replacement that works well. I chose this particular light because of the many high reviews and the price was right at $10 bucks. I will agree with the other reviewers that this light works well and is a great price. The two setting options are nice to have. In the dark with minimal street lights I am only able to see my husband because of this light and the one on the front of his bike (Planet Bike Beamer 3 LED Bicycle Light with Quick Cam Bracket Mount). My husband has his mounted to the back of his bike under his saddle and I have mine clipped to the loop on myTopeak Aero Wedge Pack with Buckle (Medium).

It went right on my seat post with just a few tries at getting the right shim in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Idea","review":"The LED lights are very bright and either stay on, or can blink. The whole assembly appears to have been well constructed and well designed. It will attach almost anywhere on a bike and the light assembly can be detached.

As it is mostly plastic, try and put it in a place where it will not get kicked, or bumped if the bike falls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for the Price but no instruction manual.","review":"This product came with batteries to put inbut didn't include any instruction on how to change the battery.So I googled it and found Planet Bike's instructional video on their Youtube.[...]Great light for the price, bright enough to blind people's eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with this, but watch out for the seat post size","review":"OK so I'm going to upload some photos to detail what I mean here, but this product does not fit so well onto some seat posts that have a big shaft. It comes with two rubber grips for use inside the ring but it wouldn't be possible to close it with either of those on my seat post! I have a Mongoose mountain bike. I had to cut off almost all of one of the rubber pieces to get it to even close and the screw barely gripped the thread on the other side!

We all have helmet lights, the blinking arm bands, and I have one of their Blaze 1 watt headlights too - all are just amazing products.you can set this one to either constant on, or blink -- the blinking is a real attention-getter.It also comes with mounts for either the seat tube, or the seat stay - I have a tool bag mounted under my seat, so I could not mount the light there - I mounted it on my left-side seat stay and it worked just great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell off and was lost on a bump","review":"Feel off on a bump - LED unit fell off and was lost.

I will concede that the light is quite bright, and blinks reasonably well. However, let me frame the scenario for you: I ride a cruiser bike, single-speed, on a city road the whole way, no off-roading or rough gravel road, yet this broke off THAT VERY SAME NIGHT as I was returning home. Fortunately I noticed and was able to retrieve the fallen light without too much of a detour. What a disappointment! Upon further inspection, I saw that the part broke off was a tiny plastic bit on the clip that attached the light to the bracket. Really, PlanetBike, really? You're supposed to be a bike company and you make something so fragile? Now I have to see if I can get a replacement or refund, and get something else that has actual practicality.

If what Hal Rosenbluth says about his company is even half true, it puts his organization at the forefront of employee value and relationship management. Beyond all that, it makes perfect common sense. Why we would think in our wildest imagination that an employee who does not feel valued by his employer would not transmit that lack of appreciation to his customers, is a mistery to me. The first 100 pages of this book are not be missed by any company who truly wants to improve their workplace culture, increase the productivity of their workforce and cut their turnover rate down dramatically. Read it and implement any one of the outstanding programs explained within and watch s shift in morale and productivity start right away. This book is a keeper and an excellent reference source.

Before that Country music was at it's popularity and Neil Diamond decided to join in on the fun.

The 401(k) is a pension on the cheap, designed to save employers money as compared to old-style pensions. And, as in the rest of life, you get what to pay for.The book shows how you can still make your pension work for you if you ignore the Wall Street propaganda.

So much conflicting information. What are we to believe? Is the economy really recovering as the administration would have us believe? For many workers the answer is No. In general, economic analysis in the media favors people who are prosperous (about 20 percent of the population.) while the fate of the vast majority -- the 80 percent -- is often overlooked. The Great 401 K Hoax judges society by what is happening to working class Americans and the news is not good. Thank God, Wolman and Colamosca are reminding Americans that the boom years are followed by lean years and the 401 K plan will not solve Americas pension fund crisis.

I am very happy with it. It is perfect for her. It was a little hard to finish the assembly of the drawers because you had to really push the dowels into the holes, even my husband had a hard time with them. I believe the rest went fine because he had our boys helping him. I'm not sure if I would call the color pearl white though. You can see the \\"grain\\" of the wood beneath the white color and it is not a glossy white (at least not to me). She is happy with it and that is all that matters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Desk with chair?","review":"I was wondering if anyone has bought the desk from the reflection pearl white series with the reflections pearl white chair (with purple velvet seat) together and does the chair fit nicely under the desk?"},{"rating":"1","title":"thumbs down!!","review":"We thought this desk would be great for our daughters room, to go with all the other white furnishings, however upon arrival of this desk we found it to be NOT pearl white as the picture may seem, but a dull white, and the drawers are not sturdy at all. Parts were missing, and drawer space is limited, The corners were chipped and the glue just don't stick as it shound. I would shop around before buying this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"We have the headboard, nightstand and dresser the veneer finish is peeling of at the edges. But for the price this is what you get. I did not expect to see the (fake) wood grain, this is like a whitewashed finish. The nighstand is smaller than I expected, it's shorter than an average nighstand. If I could go back I would of spent a little more money for better quality pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"The paint peels off","review":"We bought this desk along with the nightstand, dresser and headboard.

Not worth the money if I would have known."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not suprised that the desk was laminate...","review":"I was however surprised that the laminate was not the pearl white type. I love Target but the experience with this desk has been nothing but frustrating! This desk is not the same type of white laminate as the pearl white table and chairs from the Princess collection nor from the restore and restyle kids white selection. All of my purchases from Target have always been such and exceptional value that this is the first time I can say I feel taken advantage of. BEWARE it is just not the quality of item I am used to getting from this seller. Yes, it has drawer space but I have to question weather or not the drawers are sturdy. The white finish is also not pearl it is a white wood look alike. The finish also peels off around corners. I would look around before getting this desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wondering who was pleased with this desk?","review":"We recently bought the desk for my little girl and was going to surprise her for her birthday which is Christmas day.

If you like Topeak 'stuff', you will like this rack. You will need a 5mm allen wrench to assemble. The instructions are printed in multiple languages, making somewhat difficult to find the English. However, the assembly can be done by just looking for the pictures. I ordered the front wheel stabilizers, which work great too. I installed this rack in my basement, and will be moving it to the garage come spring."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good.","review":"Just set it up this morning. Set up in less than 20 minutes + some minor adjusting afterwards. Later on I moved it about ten inches from the original location, and it is super easy to move around. I installed it on the wood floors in the living room of my NY apartment, and so far so good. I purchased a set of carraige bolts at the hardware store to better secure it using some light cable, but I don't know if I am going to have to do that. It seems pretty sturdy. I am in an apartment, so no worries about a garage door opener vibrating it out, and I am not in CA, no earthquakes here. Before putting the bikes on it, I climbed up the pole just to really see what it could do. I weight 170 lbs, so I am about 12 lbs over its limit. It held me fine. Next I performed the jiggle test with two 30 pound bikes on it, and it seems pretty darn good. So good I decided to write a review. I am still a little paranoid about it, but we will see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rack!","review":"Solid construction and was up and running in 5 minutes. Very few parts to assemble and the parts that need to go together do it very easily. Any adjustments are made with ease, and we have two very different types of bikes on the rack and we have no problems fitting them on.This rack is one you should get your hands on!This is our first purchase into the bike rack territory and have not experiment with other racks, so if this is new to you as well, I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs the right conditions to work","review":"I really wanted this product to work. Its very well made - german engineering. The concept is great - nothing to drill in the walls.I read the other reviews, and understand why some like and some didn't like. I spent several hours over three days, and discovered that it depends on the surfaces you are installing it on (ceiling and floor). If you are putting this on carpet, with a textured ceiling - something for it to grab onto - it works. If you are putting it on a smooth concrete floor (in your garage, for example), or a smooth piece of wood (like in an unfinished ceiling in your garage), the stand doesn't grip tight enough and tends to move slightly. Under the weight of bikes, and with vibration from the garage door opener, it can fall over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable","review":"Had this for 15 months and this is not very stable. Maybe due to the seasonal contraction and expansion in my garage, the spring tension in the pole has given way at least 3 times, twice the stand slipped off the ceiling joist stud on its own. But once it is installed, it is great but if you live in a zone where the temps in your garage varies greatly with the season, watch out!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bicycle Rack Review","review":"Was given this as a gift. The quality is excellent and it sets up very easily. The first one came damaged in shipping but we had no problem getting a new one sent right away even before we had returned the damaged one. Would highly recommend this rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rack!","review":"This rack works very well in my small NY apartment. Setup is straight forward and takes about 15 minutes. A couple of things that worked for me on setup.... I made sure my wood floor was clean to ensure no dust would make the bottom slide (just to play it safe). Also, I probably added a little more tension than what the directions called for. It seems very stable. I only use one of the two racks for my mountain bike. The rack that I use is pushed towards the top of the pole to keep the bike up and out of the way in the hallway. To maximize space, I actually take off the quick release front wheel and twist the handle bars so that my bike is flush against the wall. Great space saver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleaned up my garage ...","review":"The bikes were kind of stored as an afterthought in the garage and probably took more abuse than they should have. I was looking for a solution that would get the bikes off the floor without having to suspend them from the ceiling or hang them on the wall. The Topeak storage stand is perfect ... a bit pricey but in the category of \\"you get what you pay for.\\" Installation is well documented and pretty intuitive. I used a 36\\" long piece of scrap 1x4 across the ceiling joists to ensure the stand did not punch through the sheetrock ceiling. About 8' from floor to ceiling; very solid feel and works great. I have a ladies \\"comfort\\" bike on the bottom (used the Allen tension bar to hang it:Allen Tension Bar Bicycle Cross-Bar Adaptor) and my Specialized MB on the top. One note, the 5mm allen wrench required for installation is NOT included with the rack so plan accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rack fell on my car","review":"This rack is highly unstable. It was holding two bikes in my garage, and fell down while I was away on vacation. Both bikes and the rack landed on the hood of my car, causing several dents and scratches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stand fell on my car too...","review":"I installed this in my garage. It was mounted under a stud and secure at the time of installation. After 12 days it fell on my car and left dents and scratches. It caused $2,100 in damage to my car. I believe the vibration of the garage door opening and closing allowed the stand to become loose. I would not recommend this stand to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Charge Your Chops","review":"Within a month I have already notice some serious improvements in my playing.

Intense Rock I is mainly directed at improving technique providing a lot of different 3-note-per-string, string skipping and sweep arpeggios sequences. Paul does a great job at breaking these things down while giving us a taste of his goofy sense of humor, but for my money Intense Rock II is king. Among other things Paul covers dynamics and control, and the last segment on practicing alone is worth the money. Do yourself a favor and pick this up, your guitar will thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"superior guitar instruction...","review":"... at a price that cannot be beat. the product contains both of paul's first 2 dvd's and offers a huge selection of over-the-top shred guitar. i had the 1st vhs way back in the day (the 80s!!!) and just about wore it out so i had to purchase this item just to have. if you want to take your guitar playing to the next level and save some coin in the process, get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one IS a 'cherry'","review":"Cherry Lips (Go-Baby-Go!) is probably the best crafted pop song ever produced. This import features the studio version found on their album Beautiful Garbage, so nothing new there.The so-called 'b-sides' Enough Is Never Enough and Use Me are both just excellent. It boggles the mind that these two songs aren't getting heavy radio play. I'm constantly impressed with Shirley Manson's voice and how she can match the different sounds/flavors of the band's superior musicianship and production on each song.The remix of Cherry Lips (the last of the four songs) is the only weak spot on this cd. Not because it's bad or anything, but musically it's just so stripped down (instrumentally) while doing almost nothing new with the vocals. If you're going to remix something, then REMIX it. All of it! That's just my opinion...If you like Garbage, -even if you already own Beautiful Garbage, get this cd. The two b-sides are worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Overall NCAA Basketball Games","review":"I have been a college basketball game freak for years. This game has the best overall graphics and game play you'll find. It does take time getting used to the new shot stick, but once you learn how to use it you'll wonder why this was never used before. I highly recommend this game if you are a true die hard basketball fan of the NCAA. This game can be difficult if you do not truly understand the GAME of basketball (why I say this is if you are a young kid or buying for a young kid). You need to know how/when to run certain defenses, and what offenses to run to break presses, zones, and man to man defense.

L'arc~en~ciel consists of some truly talented artists. They pulled off some very good performances, despite the obvious language barrier, and I enjoyed them thoroughly.I completely agree with a previous reviewer when I say that the one thing that disappointed me most was the fact that there is only one performance on the second disk. You can very well see the differences between their energy level in Japan vs. their energy level in the US. It was absolutely amazing! I would like to have seen more...

I for one really liked the writing style and prose but wondered why simpler words were not chosen. Some felt, too, they required a dictionary by their side. It was definitely a book one could easily put down. There wasn't much in the way of character development and the story lacked intrigue.

Filled with humor and warmth, this one is an absolute stand-out, not to be missed.At the heart of this book is Gabriel Gibbs, a young boy struggling to find himself after being thrown out of an upscale boarding school. Luckily he has his wise, if unconventional, brother Spencer to look after him as well as a muse in the form of the mysterious Lillian Dawes, a woman who is both more and less than she seems.

I'd reccomend it because it is rather succinct and easy to read.

Vladislav Tamarov, young and innocent as are many of our soldiers everywhere, does his duty to his country and is sent to Afghanistan, where he sees--and records--some of the disasters and tragedies of that war, a war that eventually the Soviets had to concede.Mr. Tamarov combines some very personal and touching accounts of his experiences there with some vivid--and telling--photographs.\\"War is Hell,\\" we're told and this book seems to reflect this sentiment well.This is a good book and I recommend it highly. And young Mr. Tamarov is a good looking young man, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly written","review":"Apart from not being very exciting, this book is terribly written. The language is just awfull. It seems like the author wrote it himself in english without mastering the language. In my oppinion that's one of the biggest no-nos in litterature.

Tamarov's book took me back to those years in Afghanistan, years I will never forget and that changed my life forever. If you want to see the Afghanistan war through soldiers eyes (literally), then you must read this book. By now I have seen more books about Russian-Afghanistan war, but only Tamarov's book really gave me the real feeling of those years over there.

The production was bad, the mix was terrible, the vocals dull, and the backing band mediocre. This all came as a mystery to me since Way's songwriting credits with UFO are so very impressive over the last 30+ years.

The music here is more of what you expect from Candlemass' classic period: somber doom metal with excellent deep-pitched vocals courtesy of Messiah Marcolin. I would rate this below \\"Nightfall\\" and \\"Epicus\\" simply because the songs are not as compelling.

Find Me in These Fields starts soft with an acoustic rif (a concept that seques throughout the CD), and in a clear, subtle statement of Phil's humble persona he makes a mistake and groans. That's right, The first tones are a mistake. Then he rips into a Keaggy Klassic \\"Strong Tower\\" Phil then sweeps through the recording with ease making firm statements in beatiful music. At time soft and acoustic and at others ripping guitar. I listened to this CD the first time with headphones and I am glad I did. A masterfully produced CD, this one could keep you in the headphones the entire time while time appears to stand still. Phils Christian roots are founded strong in this CD as always, but is also musicly sophisticated enough for people who don't particularly care for Christian or Theme music."},{"rating":"2","title":"layla? whatever!","review":"Why does everyone kiss Eric Clapton's ass and compare every decent guitar player to him?

There is a huge difference in every song, except the fantastic \\"midnight ravers\\" and two extra songs are included on the Jamaican version. If you have never heard disc one (Jamaican version) you have never heard Catch a Fire, that simple. With Peter arranging the harmonies, Bunny hitting the high notes and Bob's amazing songwriting this is the Wailer's true masterpiece.

A very well defined hook around the chorus combined with a very pleasing keyboard passage just captures my soul. Kinky Reggae, Stop That Train, Concrete Jungle, and Rock It Baby are other stand out tracks.

All the original Wailers are there including Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer. Their performance here is electric. The album was released in 1973 and it was this album that got me hooked to reggae music. This is the album that popularized reggae. Wailer fans will find this a treat. Listeners will enjoy the excellent instrumentation: the guitar, keyboards and percussion combined with gentle and soothing vocals to complete an exhilarating picture.The songs in the album address serious social and political issues. Some of the songs include \\"Slave Driver\\", \\"Concrete Jungle\\", \\"Stop that Train\\", \\"No More Trouble\\" and my favourite song on the album \\"Stir it Up\\".For me, this is the best and most creative album by the Wailers with its classic roots reggae.

But Peter Tosh's two numbers, \\"400 Years\\" and \\"Stop That Train\\", are actually my favorite songs on the album. It's a shame that Tosh and Marley (along with Bunny Wailer) had to go their separate ways as they truly were the Lennon and McCartney of reggae music. Also don't underestimate the contributions of the Barrett brothers. Emphasis on bass and drums is one of the distinguishing features of reggae music and no rhythm section was more powerful than the Barretts."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Catch a Fire!","review":"Let's just say if I was stranded on a desert island I would want to bring Catch a Fire (and my Discman)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"Really should specify that this is a compact disc an not a vinyl.

Debut significance and any innovation credit aside, almost all tracks here are just forgettable in their basic similarities compared to his next few years when he and the band hit a creative stride. The traditional sound remains, although mainly butchered beyond stereotype in most cases with luke-warm songwriting and sterile backing vocals. A few tracks that crept out to land on further compilations obviously pointed at deeper melodic strength which was to come.

I jury rigged something to keep the last bamboo rod solidified, and tested it out. The middle bamboo rodes moved every which way after just a few rakes. It didn't appear to be due to the side metal hinge missing, it just appeared to be due to the bamboo rods not being the quality of the prior bamboo rakes that we had at the house which lasted many, many years, and though a ton of abuse as well.

He has a sharp, critical eye (which he's not afraid to turn on himself) and I often, though not always, agree with what he has to say. You take comedy with a grain of salt, realizing that its easy to take shots and less easy to come up with real solutions to the world's problems.I sometimes hesitate to give a book like this a really high rating. Will this book change the world? No. Will it be read a year from now let alone 100 years from now? Probably not. And yet, this book made me laugh out loud more than anything I've read in recent months. It made me laugh more than I remember laughing at Miller's earlier rants. And now, in the aftermath of the tragedies lately, it's just what the doctor ordered. Enjoy it for what it is but enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageous fun!!","review":"Miller's cultural observations are hysterical! Nobody's safe from his barbs, nothing's off limits. His diatribes on public education & Hollywood are especially funny. (For more derisive commentary on schools & Tinsel Town, though, read \\"No One's Even Bleeding\\"). The thing I like best about Dennis is his willingness to goof on himself as well as others. The \\"Rant Zone\\" is full of honest & biting wit, two essential ingredients for laughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every chapter an ace","review":"The joy of Miller's humor is he plays the whole course hard.

On his most recent appearance on Leno (January 20, 2006), he showed when he isn't lauding Dubya or the war, he still shows signs of humor (\\"As a nation we're getting fat...if you're built like a tank, don't wear the top\\").But in this book, even the non-political rants don't have the bite as they did in \\"I Rant, Therefore I Am\\" or \\"Ranting Again\\".Perhaps, if he writes another \\"rant\\" book, he could do one on his experiences on \\"Saturday Night Live\\", since he was noticably absent from the \\"Live From New York\\" book. If Jay Mohr can do it, Dennis can...and he may just recapure my respect.Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dennis Miller, Comedian.....R.I.P.","review":"Dennis Miller used to have an edge to his work; he was always attacking those in power and made no apology for it. Now, with his recent and self-serving conversion to Bush and his brand of conservatism, he has become a voice for the elite. A comedian can be right-wing (he just might not be as funny), but recent appearances have demonstrated that as he has moved to the right, his comedy has dropped off and his political rhetoric (sans wit) has increased. I am sure his switch was motivated most of all by a resentment of paying taxes (a common thing for former liberals), but at this time, more than ever, we need dissent -- preferably angry dissent -- not fawning defense of the powers that be."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaper than toilet paper at 48 cents","review":"It's nice to see that this book has found it's price point.

Virtually all of those endeavors have produced nothing but embarrassing additions to his body of work. Three strikes and you're out Dennis. Do a favor for your potential fans and stick with what you're good at -- monologues on cable-TV.

If you only read one Alfred Bester book, this would be the one to choose.

Check it out (also recommend \\"Psychoshop\\" and \\"The Stars My Destination.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I thought I had read great books before. Reading authors like Asimov,D. Adams, books like stranger in a strange land. But now I relize none compare to the virtually unknown Bester. The Demolished Man tells a story that goes deeper into every char. then we are able to go into ourselves. This was the most powerful and wonderful book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Penny for your Thoughts","review":"Alfred Bester wrote two of the best sci-fi novels of all time--The Stars my Destination and this one. Here, Bester presents the difficulties of murduring the corporate competition in a world patrolled by and littered with telepaths. The action is intense and the fact that one ends up rooting for the murderer to escape is testament to Bester's style.This is a short, fun read that has held up to the test of time, fitting right in with William Gibson and friends.NOTE: Strazinski used this novel as a template for creating his telepath community in the series BABYLON-5 (not to mention making the evil sci-cop Alfred Bester), so fans of the series should take a look at the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read.","review":"This book is successful both as a sci-fi as well as a murder/mystery. Most of the book is devoted to the pursuit by Lincoln Powell, an esper(psychic), police detective of a very powerful and wealthy murder suspect, Ben Reich. The entire cat and mouse chase is written so expertly that every chapter holds your attention. Also, the interesting concept of demolition, the complete destruction of one's personality, and the pattern of psychic communication are intricately explored in this novel through some very well developed characters. I have only one complaint about this novel. The revelation made about the murderer towards the end of the novel seems to be reaching to add a very strong sci-fi aspect to the novel. In the end, though, I believe the novel delivers a very powerful and deliberate message. A definite enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Dissappointing.","review":"The first half of the book was pretty good, developing a vivid and gritty futuristic world where telepaths are a part of the human population. It follows a donald-trump type top business man who plans to kill his rival in order to 'rule the world' (as usual). This may sound dry, but it starts off pretty interestingly. Thats when things go downhill, for the main character and for the reader. The plot gets lame and corny in the second half of the book, not to mention patronizing. The telepath hero seduces a much younger woman, sends his current admirer packing, stops the business man from ruling the world, and in the end the hero and villain become friends. Say what??? The horrendous ending really makes the whole book not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder Non-Mystery Spectacular!","review":"In a future where crime has been made impossible to what lengths will Ben Reich go to rid the world of his rival? This ISN'T a murder mystery; you know exactly how the deed is done. The suspense is in watching how Reich is going to get away with it, especially in a world of telepathic adepts who can scan the minds of anyone and everyone. Alfred Bester's first novel, The Demolished Man is certainly a masterpiece of science fiction. More than a book, this is an experience that won't let you go until you're finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, the only thing I have to add is......","review":"The book says that in this future no-one is murdered, but that means those who are murdered are nobodys. (sort of like in the hitchhiker's guide \\"there were no poor, in least none worth talking about\\" I'm paraphrasing of course.) Once I realized that murders of the unimportant occurred in this future it was less confusing. I might have given it 5 if I'd realized that earlier. The modified assumption I gave will hopefully help."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Science Fiction Novel","review":"Even 49 years after its initial publication, The Demolished Man still stands as a true science fiction novel. The story of Ben Reich living in a future world where mind reading is a commonality amongst a group known as 'Espers.' In a world without crime, for one can know when you will commit one, how is one to go about plotting a murder? Ben Reich has the perfect plan. This book captivated me from beginning to end when I read it 10 years ago and I continually reccomend it to those that enjoy science fiction. Author, Alfred Bester, won the first Hugo Award for Science Fiction for The Demolished Man. In my opinion this book is still the hallmark of science fiction novels, unfortunately, however, Bester himself is so unheard of in many literary circles and more so in the general public. I highly reccomnend this book for anyone who has a flare for science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"Save some money and read the real reviews of this book elsewhere online before buying.

Admittedly, AS is a mess anyway, with no clearly defined central concepts and a syntax that makes Macromedia's Lingo look good. The book itself has no idea who its audience is. If it is for beginners, then comparisons with Perl, C++ etc, are useless.For an example of the editing, look at Table 4-1. How quickly can you make sense of it ?

Obvious Question #1: Can you remake a classic Western with rappers and make it good? Yes. Obvious Question #2: Did they do it here? No. Not even close. \\"Full Clip\\" looks cheap, sounds cheap, and was cheap. Having worked on this film, I know that the production company spent as little as possible to get this thing finished, with most of the money going to pay Busta and his posse. (There are still several crew members who never got paid for their work on this film.) That sad note aside, \\"Full Clip\\" does have a few bright spots: Busta Rhymes creates a suitably viable anti-hero, while Xzibit impresses with his passion and believability. Additionally, several of the supporting actors also gave watchable performances. Other than that, \\"Full Clip\\" is a shoddy piece of film making that, despite the crew's best efforts, is simply not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Busta...what it is right now?!","review":"I'm sure this movie is supposed to be dumb and very predictable, but it was so entertaining that I loved it anyway. Busta Rhymes is fun to watch, and I can guarantee you if Busta Rhymes wasn't in this movie, I'd have hated it, but I just am crazy about his style. The movie is a black western with Busta coming in town for his father's funeral and running across a crooked cop running the town. He calls his crew to get rid of the crooked cop and his crew end up taking over the town even more crooked than the cop. There's a love interest and a crazy, dirty-minded lady who owns the hotel.

The problem with the CD is the other music on this CD didn't help paint a mental picture of the film. At least not in my head. And I dont necessairly fault the composer John Barry for that. It is because to have that picture in your head, you must watch this movie multiple times. Unlike other movies, it is key to have watched the movie.

But it was much ado about nuthin' because the album was flat as dishwater. It lacked any of the memorable melodies or sweet power pop of Jellyfish.

This disc is one a them: a fine, fun, mindless bunch of well-crafted, robust riffs that'll keep you tapping for many a spatial hour -- and then you'll put it away, like those ridiculous sandals you bought last summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Gus Gus, Hate this album","review":"i got tickets to go see them in concert in 5 days anticipating this album's release and the great groves that i'd been expecting...i listened to the album 3 times now, and each time i listen to it, it angers me even more.

This doesn't even sound like Gus Gus, it sounds like a high school electronic band playing with their newly bought keyboards. Simple beats, simple music... Every bad song on this CD makes me think of every good song on Polydistortion and that makes it even worse. I have the remix record of Desire which is not too bad but the original version on this CD is just mediocre.The Gus Gus dynasty may be over folks. Rest In Peace Gus Gus..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited 4 years for THIS?","review":"When I first heard Polydistortion, I was in heaven....Then I waited and waited for This Is Normal to come out, and then again I was in heaven (Even more so...one of my all-time favorite albums) and then I had to wait 4 years (i still have yet to hear the vs. album) for this horrid, rancid, piece of tripe. But I was skeptical anyway, seeing as how they have moved to the MOONSHINE label of all things ( I mean...come on...home of Keoki and John Digweed? Give me a break!) I mean, even for the raver bullsh*t techno that Moonshine is famous for, this is a REALLY REALLY bad album. The beats sound more primative than early Alien Sex Fiend drum machines (Even though I do like Alien Sex Fiend), and the overall simplicity of this album is stomach-churning. SO, GUSGUS FANS ACROSS THE GLOBE - ATTENTION! THIS ALBUM BLOWS! I feel bad for writing such a negative review for one of my favorite bands, but THEY should feel bad for putting their fans through this sort of nausea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beats awesome, lyrics ok","review":"The music on this CD is definately GusGus & is as good as you would expect. Personally, I'm not a fan of lyrics in electronic music & would of liked it more if there were fewer on this CD. That's just me though.The song \\"I.I.E\\", like a lot of GusGus songs, hits hard(especially w/ the right stereo) at the 3/4 mark & is actually quite good. Woulda gave it 3 stars because of lyrics, but the music/beats bumped it up to 4. Still think that Polydistortion is their best CD.Worth getting if you've been wating for a new GusGus album, and still worth it if you wanna hear electronic music that isn't good. This CD gets better each time you listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, but still a Gus Gus fan","review":"When I read Gus Gus had a new album, I was excited. Unfortunately, I have been disappointed. Most of songs sound amateurish, almost like a house music parody.

For a richer, more organic sound, I recommend Gus Gus' earlier album \\"Polydistortion\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh ugh..","review":"Plain and simple, after Polydistortion and This is Normal the bar is set high. Gus gus missed by a mile. The most dissapointing CD I have ought all year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing at best","review":"I was extremely disapointed with this cd. In fact, I consider it the worst cd I've purchased all year.Gusgus' intentions were good in trying new sounds and trying to redefine themselves after the demise of trance, but the results are amateur at best. The timing is sloppy, the arrangements are dull, the tracks are poorly mixed, and the hihats clip on a couple of the tracks (listen to Your Moves are Mine if you don't believe me). It's painful to listen to squishy uncompressed drums but even worse to hear the snares not even hitting in time with the bass drum. There are seriously at least 50 technical problems with this album. This could all be overlooked if the damn thing had a decent groove or some sort of drive, but I never felt the desire to boogie even once through the entire cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"gus gus gets a Glamorous makeover","review":"Allthough I am a fan of gus gus's previous layered, textured , calmer releases, I LOVE this new sound. I had been waiting for a good dance record and when I least expected it gus gus drops a few members, gets a new label, and a flashdancey classy makeover. NOT what I expected, but Fabulous none the less. This record is intelligent, sexy, and refreshing. I wouldn't be interested in another Polydistortion, though just as marvelous , I really enjoy this new direction, and hope they continue to grow, and be innovative.

Doctorow book, and will probably be my last. I read 57 pages, and nearly every page was a confusing and tedious slog. Actually, considering how much I re-read trying to discern what exactly was happening, I probably read about 75 pages. I'm not sorry I put it down...comparing it to beating your head against a wall and how good it feels when you stop. It was like several unrelated stories spliced together. There was little meaningful punctuation which added to the confusion. Bad poetry was injected for no discernable purpose. The whole thing felt like stream-of-consciousness meanderings by someone on drugs. Doctorow jumped from one character and scene to another for what I could only determine was an concerted effort to be mysterious and erudite. Please spare me the self-important on the planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging Read, for sure...","review":"I love World's Fair and Ragtime and have read them several times each. This book is different in that there are what I would call stream-of-consciousness sections that just run in with no punctuation kind of like I'm writing here to give you an idea of it, and also there are some sections of poetry interspersed throughout (I'm not a big poetry reader, myself.)If you can get past all that, it's a good story that follows an failed poet and a young drifter and how their lives intersect.

It stands alone as beautiful, haunting, alluring, and innocent--just as Griet herself was in the film. Desplat perfectly captured the spirit of the story, enhanced and deepened a plot that was less than stellar.Scarlett Johanssen's acting is superb, as well as Essie Davis and Colin Firth. The story, though, was a bit tired--pretty housemaid/jealous wife/do-nothing husband. Its portrayal of Vermeer and his wife was a disservice to the real people, even though it is a fictionalized account.The two best tracks on this album are 'Griet's Theme' and 'Colours in the Clouds'. While I'm not keen on seeing the film again, this soundtrack is a treasure. It's a real work of art, second only to Vermeer's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I am a diehard Elton John fan and to say the least, this album is awful. In their own right, these artists are very talented, but there was not one who did justice to Elton's songs.

It is possibly the perfect vehicle for her haunting voice and far far better than Elton John could ever do. A must for any Sinead lover.

Bands like Humble Pie, Free, Wishbone Ash, Ten Years After, Jeff Beck Group, Led Zeppelin, Trapeze and many more were playing the blues heavy and hard. Savoy Brown was right in the middle of it all. The hard boogie and blues rock on this album will let you know where real heavy metal came from. Kim S. was a great guitarist. Most of SB had left the same year to form Foghat, but Kim put together a steller new lineup, and made this classic. This is one of Savoy Brown's best LPs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The luster left before this album","review":"I am amazed that this album has gotten such good reviews here.

The pace is slow and the only soundtrack is the ambient sounds, but there is a spare and moving beauty to this film that makes it utterly rewarding for the patient viewer. The enormous attention that the kestrel parents bestow on their brood of chicks is mirrored by the Zen-like care with which the caretakers endlessly rake and prune the cemetery plots, bringing the patterns and rituals of both nature and humans into extraordinary focus.

Anyone reading this book gets a very informative history of the Home Depot and the two owners behind it. You also get a clear picture of the management style of the company as well as what their priorities are. I am not a do it yourself person when it comes to home maintenance so last wekend I decided to view the experience from the inside of one of Home Depot's stores. Not expecting to buy anything, I left with four items that I could use for my apartment. Let me tell you, the associates are all fairly nice people and the shelves are stacked up high. Was everything perfect in the store, no, but we all could improve ourselves in someway. Anyway, as a shareholder in the company, I am proud to say that this is a company that is going to be around for a long time. And this book truly depicts the Home Depot environment very well as it focuses on a very large audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent business book, a fraud","review":"The book had it's good parts, sometimes inspiring. On the whole, it is an entertaining read with good insight on business and its ups and downs. I must say also, that to me it is a fraud. I shop at Home Depot often. I'll be damned if the service in the stores today is 1% as good as the authors (Marcus and Blank) describe it in the book. It's only proper that the founders would beat their chests about how great they are now, while HD itself detoriorizes from its former self. Don't get me wrong either, I shop there ... I'm a loyal customer. BUT I also know what HD USED to be like and it's definitely not the way it is now, the way it was described in the book. Hence, a fraud.So, if you want to know the \\"how\\", read the book. If you've ever been to a HD lately, don't read the book, it will just get you upset next time you walk into one of the stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look at how great Home Depot is....","review":"This entire book is a self-serving description of how good the Home Depot is and how smart the founders (the authors of this book) of the company are in conducting business. Sure customer satisfaction is important to the success of any business but it would have been much more helpful to detail how this function was promoted, implemented, and monitored during Home Depot's tremendous growth stage. Rather, the reader is offered selected stories of how an associate in a store did something incredible for a customer. Additionally, the authors appear concerned with offering excuses for past instances when the company did something poorly (e.g., lawsuits, acquisitions). This book had all the ingredients for a good story; unfortunately the authors appeared more concerned with their own legacies rather than a true discussion of Home Depot's history and present functional strategies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Inspirational","review":"This book has some clever insights and simple truths about management on a small scale and a larger one.

I've read both and prefer the objective and unbias version by Roush - who interviews current and ex-employees, vendors etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Lies","review":"Let's face facts: home depot is known for abysmal service and really, really shoddy haphazard installations. They probably spend more on defending lawsuits than on store development. This book makes them look like such wizards, such brilliant and benevelont businessmen, when in fact they have done studies to see what the minimum level of customer service they can get away with is - and then tried to stretch that envelope.I am sure Ken Lay could write books full of accolades to Enron.

My assumption in reading the reviews for this book (and reading its title) was that it would tell how some regular guys built the Home Depot from scratch, starting with an idea and building it into an empire.Instead what you get is the CEO and CFO of another home improvement company starting Home Depot along with an investment banking friend that lands them in front of a potential investor that happens to be a billionaire (Ross Perot). Somehow they don't seem like just regular guys anymore.The information in the book is okay, but it was really hard for me to get past this outrageous title that is nothing more than a lie.

While the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment, after the first day it looks like it's two years old. If you have an SD card in your Treo forget it -- the belt clip will pop your card daily. And the belt clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt. Don't even think about putting the Treo in your pocket as the non-slip cover won't begin to slide into your pocket. Finally, the price at $32.95 is outrageous for a $5 cover.

It is too thick to work with the Seidio Cradle I have, so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treo. The skin buttons do not always line up with the TREO buttons, so I misfire applications.

However, upon opening the box we found the plastic needle to be missing. After tracking down a needle at a craft store, I thought we were reading for business! WRONG! After only getting 1/4 of the way through a scarf the thing jammed up and would not turn in either direction. I didn't even bother to exchange it for another!

They told us that they had returns on that product every day, and also on other ROSEART products in general, and suggested we take our money back.

We tried to figure out the problem. We got another one and it did the same thing. She's completely heartbroken and I've had to explain to her that sometimes things just aren't made to last. She asked, \\"Couldn't it have lasted longer than a day?\\" Cheap working parts. She was very patient with it, but it just isn't made to last. Did you notice that it's made in China?

It would be so much more beneficial than to waste your $20 on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont' bother - it's not worth the stress","review":"This knitting machine shows pictures of a purse and other fun things on the box. How to make the purse wasn't even in the directions. And it was very confusing and difficult to make the other items. We tried to make a flat panel following the directions, but it didn't work as explained. We ended up making three tubes and by the third one, we finally figured out how to sew it so that it wouldn't unravel. All in all, a total waste of time. The kids were disappointed and I was frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Roseart piece of junk!","review":"My daughter received it for her 8th bithday; t looked like it would be fun.

When we tried to make a flat piece, it also kept dropping stiches. We finally unravelled the whole thing and are bringing it back.

I took it back to the store and got another one and I didn't make it through one round and it jammed and I had to cut the yarn out of it. Took the machine apart to try and fix for over 2 hours nothing. Went back and brought a 3rd. I was determined that I was going to get this to work. Broke after 10 mins of use.

Great idea, but needs to be more durable for $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tease of a Toy!","review":"This toy is great at first, once you've overcome the initial adult setup. Crank away, and pretty soon you'll have a nice tube. Don't get excited. Before long, the machine will drop a stitch, jam, or in some other way mess up something that had your kid excited. We've tried it six times, and the longest we've gotten is about 2 feet...a little short for a scarf. Most of the others failed within a few inches. It's a great idea; it just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My son bought this for his sister for Christmas and was so sad when it broke after about 5 minutes.

This is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it - we returned not one, but TWO!!!","review":"Okay, so as a mom to a 7 year old who crochets, I thought this might be beneath my daughter. Fact is, she loved the machine when it worked, which for TWO of them TOTALLED about an hour. The concept is there, but the plastic must break inside is all I can figure...We returned the first one after about 15 minutes. The second one lasted long enough to make two long tubes, then it, too, jammed the SAME way....I would love to find one that actually lasts beyond an hour, since as I said, the concept is good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Patience is the key -- after that, it's totally fun!!!","review":"When I bought this machine, I thought that this was the coolest thing ever! And I was right, but not at first. At first it caused me lots of frustration, but after i learned its \\"glitch\\" and fixed it, it worked like a charm. I made a scarf in no time, with barely an effort. You see when the yarn goes on the hokk, it sometime slides over and gets stuck/caught, all i had to do was to use some tweezers and put it back over.

More than likely, however, they just decided to turn out junk without a care for the brand name or the people they would be ripping off.

There isn't really a killer song here, just a lot of highly melodic compositions, it's easy listening without any of the negative connotations associated with that phrase.My favorites are All in All, Hobbit on the Rocks, Brother, & All She Said"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doug Sahm Will Be Missed But Nor Forgotten!","review":"What a mind-blowing CD; worth the price of admission for one single: Sunday Sunny Mill Valley Groove.

His music is a lively, driving mix of Tex-Mex, country, blues and straightahead rock and roll. This is an indispensible collection--my only complaint is it doesn't contain any of the band's great Sixties singles like the incredible SHE'S ABOUT A MOVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice with the sixstring","review":"Vernon Reid demonstrated with Living Colour why he was one of the world's best rock guitarists and on this '96 CD, you get to see him really turn loose. This is an intelligent fusion of Jazz and rock that has a quirky hiphop vibe to it. Don Byron's acidic clarinet is wonderful and the guest vocalists are sharp. Fans of Miles' early seventies releases should check this to see how that music translates to the new century."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was HUGELY Disappointed","review":"I bought this on the strength of the previously written reviews, which I felt were misleading at best. One guy called this \\"instrumental (save for one or two raps, and some funny interludes)\\" which is a grave disservice to those of us who like instrumental music. There are vocals, talking, raps, conversations, and those bad hip hop, sampled 'drop in voices' on 10 or 11 of the 16 tracks - if you like instrumetal guitar, pass for that reason alone. Add to that the totally overused, unoriginal bad scratching sound ruining several cuts including the, \\"flat out power soloing of \\"Mistaken Identity\\" \\" - which incidentally is quite a laid back cut overall, with slow , drawn out soloing, not power soloing.The comment made about, \\"There's moments of pure shred joy here\\" might be literally true, but they are so few and far between you'll fast forward all over the place looking for them.

But the song selection I can pick on KMFDM for. Also, the lack of power in some of the songs is very prevalant. DIY rocks, but the live version has no energy. Sturm und Drang is the best song on ATTAK yet it is incredibly weak, and the best part of the song is ruined by a crowd that didn't even participate in a \\"KMFDM\\" sing a long. very upsetting. \\"Dirty\\" is performed pretty well, and the song Boots recieves a pretty good performance, but overall, I should have picked up a different CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selling dad's Minutae for $5.95 ...","review":"I don't doubt the author loved his father, but it's a well-known truth that you mean the most to the people who knew you best.

I'm not a cynic by nature, but I'm not one to praise someone's \\"compilation\\" of unoriginal material lifted from much wittier men. I don't know why anyone would pay money for material that ought to be free. Even the thoughts that are original contradict other sentiment at various times presented in the book.

He admits that a book isn't the best venue to convey chiro techniques, which is why the VHS tape is available.Having said that, this book is [unfortunately] the only thing on the market available for public consumption.His anatomical diagrams are poorly drawn, but get the point across. His demonstrative photographs are much better. His narratives are straightforward, if a bit bias and preachy.If you or your family suffer from back problems and cannot afford to see a chiro regularly, then this book may be for you.

It was great fun to be there, in spite of the sound dropping away twice, being absolutely unable to 'relieve' one's bladder and hearing Cyndi Lauper (stoned and drunk) making a mess of Another Brick Part Two.A concert performance of this magnitude deserves everybody's respect, but Waters should have had the respect of not putting it out on disc. It is truly the worst 'concert' registration I have ever heard, and I am quite sure that 90% of it has been reworked in the studio.Most sorely missed is the guitar of one David Gilmour. The (two) guitar players that try to do his trick fall short a long way.Wait for the Pink Floyd live-release of The Wall, somewhere in 2000"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wall The Way You Didn't Want To Hear It","review":"Well, I give this release two stars because a huge effort was put into the production back in 1990. And I am sure it would have been a blast to attend. However, The Wall Live In Berlin as a CD is unlistenable. The only track that isn't awful is the full orchestra on the instrumental section of \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\" Several songs are ruined here, including Van Morrison singing Dave Gilmours parts on \\"Comfortable Numb\\", Cyndi Lauper singing \\"Another Brick In The Wall Pt II\\", and most horribly, the Scorpions performing \\"In The Flesh\\". If Waters had used his Bleeding Hearts Band, this might have been a better listen. If you want a live version of The Wall, you might do better with \\"Is There Anybody Out There\\", the Floyd' release of The Wall recorded back in the early eighties. The best bet however is to stick with the studio release."},{"rating":"2","title":"As I remember it.....","review":"I was there at the concert so I have a slightly different take on the CD than most. It wasn't about the music or who sung what song. It was more about the plight of a city and a nation. Roger Waters and the rest of the musicians put on a great show considering where it was at. Potsdam platz was nothing more than a mine field a few month earlier. With temperatures soaring in the 90F it was nothing more than a dust bowl. Yet they were able to pull off a great concert that was being taped live for the video. If your into European history, I reccommend the video from this truly historic concert not to mention it's not a bad listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST LIVE ALBUM EVER MADE","review":"This album doesn't even deserve one star. Every song sounds terrible. Roger's voice is not there and the other artists just don'f fit the songs that they sing(Cyndi Lauper, Another Brick... II??). Don't bother with this set, if you really want live Wall concerts, they are out there, with all four members, and they sound good."},{"rating":"1","title":"This blows","review":"As much as I actually do like Van Morrison, his vocal on Comfortably Numb was enough to absolutely ruin the entire recording for me. I think I've heard better vocal melodies on a Slayer album. He's not even singing half the time, he's just speaking the words--and when he does try and carry a tune around his now half-octave vocal range, it's as atonal as a symphony of tortured cats.While this is the major low point on the album, there are many others which try and compete. I don't know, maybe it's my too damn serious prog-rock background, but I had to cringe when Cyndi Lauper came out and destroyed 'Brick in the Wall'. The original Wall is a magnificent recording, a true work of art, as is the recent 1980 live release. This ablum is a circus of then-popular late-80's stars not at all doing justice to Roger Waters' brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO WAY IS THIS A FOUR STAR CD","review":"HORRIBLE!!

PLEASE!!!","review":"This version of The Wall shows without a doubt that the reason the orignal album is so good is because of the band that played ie Pink Floyd.This version is full of so called stars which butcher and hack their way through each song and you sit there waiting for the wall to be torn down so you can eject the CD and never listen to it again.Van Morrison sounds like he is drunk when he sings Comfortably Numb slurring his speech.Also I though Roger Waters was totally against stadium concerts which was his original influence for creating the wall even though the proceeds of the concert went to charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too great","review":"i could go on forever about how much this album isn't as good as the studio version, but i will just say thata : if you want it live, is there anybody out there?b : the happiest days of our lives doesn't flow very much, unlike the album and (earls court) live version.c: van halen doesn't sound like gilmour, and shouldn't try to.thank you very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different interpretation","review":"I'm sure I'm in an incredibly small minority here, but I find this version preferable to the Pink Floyd original. The songs have an immediacy and passion when performed live that they are lacking in the studio recording (I know, I know, how live is it when they fix it in the studio?). The guest performers do a fine job of interpreting the songs and some versions are exceptional, particularly Sinead O'Connor's \\"Mother\\" and Joni Mitchell's \\"Goodbye Blue Sky.\\" Even \\"The Trial\\" section, with Tim Curry and Albert Finney among the actors, fits the theatrical feel of the evening. The Wall was designed to be a conceptual performance; this is Waters' opportunity to show the concept as he sees it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the wall, definetely","review":"This album just proves what I've known for awhile, Pink Floyd can be great without Waters, but waters can't be great without Pink Floyd. Do yourself a favor and get the original, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Feels me with the urge to defecate\\".","review":"The Wall was a great album, when it was performed by Pink Floyd. The album would even have been good if Roger Waters had done it alone with regular stage musicians, but instead he had to ruin his masterpiece by having no talented performers like Cyndi Lauper. Waters may have written most of this album, but it was written for Pink Floyd to perform. Nobody, even if you have talent, should be allowed to redo a Pink Floyd song. David Gilmour, Richard Wright, and Nick Mason should consider this album an insult to themselves and to the Pink Floyd name. If you're thinking about buying this album, don't do it, save your money and buy the original instead. One question, if Waters is so against stadium rock (like he said the album is about), then why was it performed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack job","review":"This is not a live album. The original radio broadcast had the microphones all messed up, many artists ruining The Wall. Roger needed David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Rick Wright. Fortunately, The Wall Live 1980 does justice to The Wall. If I were you, I'd spend my money on Is There Anybody Out There?. Only highlights were The Scorpions, Bryan Adams and that is it. Van Morrison singing Comfortably Numb makes me sick. We need Dave and co. On this CD, the album was mainly taken from the rehearsals and the redo of the gig after the show ended. This is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songs, bad engineering","review":"I like all the songs on the CD, but I can't listen to it. I've got the limited edition numbered version, and I'm assuming the music is the same across the different versions that came out. I like Howard Jones enough to special order a limited edition disk, so I'm not slamming him because I don't like him. He's just taken the louness trend that ruins most of today's pop and rock music to such an extreme that I can't listen to the CD.To be more specific about why I don't like the CD, the music has been compressed so much that there are no dynamics left. It's compressed even more than Perform.01. Put another way, the CD is too LOUD! There's so much compression that I can easily hear distortion and crackling in some of the tracks.If you like being intimate and involved in your music, forget this disk. This CD is loud and in your face, and too loud to enjoy listening to by a long shot.

Then, one by one, bad things start happening. Bit by bit, Alfie starts waking up, realizing that he's been a taker, not a giver, yet he has nothing.The strange thing is that in real life, this would never happen. Guys like this are sociopaths, with no concern for anyone but themselves. Therefore, he would just find new women to use when the old ones refused to play his game or disappeared from his life.But, I still think the movie has something to say, for those who aren't too jaded yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Remake","review":"Sad to say I haven't seen the original(it is in my pile of unwatched discs). That's a blessing because I don't have to make unfair comparisons and judge this version on it's own merits. And it is smashing. This is a film that promotes morality and fidelity despite the central character being a cad. The movie is at once pro-woman and pro-life. I wouldn't say that Alfie gets so much as a comeuppance but an education in human relationships. Credit Jude Law, one of our finest actors, for making a seemingly smarmy character sympathetic. The film also sports one of the stronger ensemble cast of actresses you'll find in any film. Marisa Tomei, Susan Sarandon, and Jane Krakowski are certainly good but the performances that struck me most were from Nia Long as Alfie's best friend's girl and Sienna Miller as Alfie's manic-depressive girlfriend.

I grew up there, but I've also been to Paris and other European cities and hearing that line made me guffaw and think: There goes reality! I gave up despite the sizzling Nia Long, who stole every scene she was in. Law kept feeling to me like he was pouring on the technique, following the director's vision of the character rather than his own.

Buy the less expensive original version starring Michael Caine. It is by far, a better film than this remake. Jude Law seems miscast as sleazebag Alfie (though off screen... he is every bit as sleazy... ahem, ahem); and his performance, as the performances of his co-stars are lacking in every aspect of the word. There is no merit to this film. Alfie should NEVER have been remade. I would ONLY recommend the original. Ok?

The story focuses on the relationship that develops between them.The mood of this series is generally pretty light hearted even though it does have its fair share of drama. From problems faced within their relationship to trouble created by those around them, the series is basically about the couple's relationship and how this evolves over time.On the whole, this is a solid shojo series, well worth picking up. The characters are all really well developed and Karin and Kiriya are both likeable. The story is pretty fast paced and I found myself instantly sucked in by it. It does have its sappy moments, but that's what we all love about shojo manga after all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Omigod!!","review":"I thought the best manga series were Girl Got Game and Hot Gimmick, but wow!

ALL of the tracks are just their versions of each of these songs. The instrumentation is different since they use different musical gear. The vocalization is different (again... they are doing it themselves). Other than that these are carbon copies. NOT remixes like they pretend to be. The music itself isn't bad, but it is rather bland compared to the dynamic sound you get from the original Brothers.My opinion? You're better off not getting this unless you find it in a bargain bin. The imitations (NOT remixes) are just not good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this cd","review":"I've heard a bit of it, and i almost vomit on my keyboard.

The music varies widely from uplifting to heartbreaking.

This CD is no where near as punk feeling as Covered in Ants, but that doesn't make it bad.

This sucks!","review":"Ok, Guttermouth made a shirt awhile back, that says: \\"Punk Rock: A loud, fast, deliberately offensive style of rock music\\". I've always agreed with that statement. Punk rock is loud and offensive. The term \\"punk\\" was used to describe the Sex Pistols. In their time, the Pistols were probably the most offensive thing rock n roll had ever seen. My point is, this album is not punk rock at all. Even Mark Adkins is resentful of this album and he made it. Guttermouth is supposed to be obnoxious anti-pop music, not Blink-182, which is what this sounds like. DO NOT buy this album. Go buy every other guttermouth album though.

Even though I prefer Among the Living and Sound of White Noise this Album is solid from start to finish. Songs such as Time, Keep it in the family, Belly of the beast, In my world, and the punkish but yet amazing cover of Joe Jacksons Got the time are simply wonderful. There are some heavy riffs here which just keep pounding until your neck hurts. The sound of this album has a darker feel to it compared to other Anthrax releases but I like it. This happened to be Joey Belladonna\`s final album with the band but he made it a great one. All in all a very solid album which is not extremely spectacular at the first listen but it just keeps on growing on you until you can\`t do without. Rock on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved all Anthrax up until this one. I listened to it over and over, but I just couldn't find the melodic hooks that filled the other albums. The lyrics were also much more serious. Anthrax had always been socially conscious but with a good sense of humor. POT is lyrically heavy-handed, and the catchiest song is the cover of Joe Jackson's, Got the Time. I think relations within the band were strained by this point.

At first I really didn't like this album at all, after hearing S.O.W.N I guess I had high expectations. But in the end I took the album for what it is. This album is by no means the best metal/thrash ever made but your always tempted to go back and listen to it. My favorite song on the album(also the first one i truly liked) was In my world. If you haven't heard it then go [get] it now!!! The album is worth buying for that song alone. After a few more listens I fell in love with the likes of Belly of the beast and Blood Brothers as well Time and got the Time. Although there are some weak tracks on this album the excellent songs really outshine the bad ones. Take this one for what it is, it may not be as good as S.O.W.N or as energetic and killer as Among the Living but it's still great in it's own way. Joey went out with a bang not a whimper."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Anthrax album?","review":"I think so. Far darker than anything prior, and more mature (overall). Joey's vocals even seem to be in a slightly better register, not as piercing as before. The whole band just seemed tight and focused, even though Joey's departure and a whole new sound would emerge within the next two years...The songs are longer than typical for ANthrax, but don't drag. Darker subject matter, written about in a more serious vein than usual, as well. Not that the fun is all gone... the killer cover of Joe Jackson's \\"Got the Time\\" is an absolute blast, and Frank Bello shows that bass players CAN be a good thing in metal (for once)!Personal favorite, the last track \\"Discharge\\"... an awesome and slightly underrated album.

A few days after that, I had to change the batteries again. By then, when I spent some time with it, noticed that on the color by numbers, you can't even read the numbers! By the third time I had to change the batteries in a week, I was beginning to get a little upset. At that point, the stylus was not working properly and would not work on most of the selections.

Now I do not buy a new toy unless I can find reviews on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my 4 year break down in tears","review":"I just purchased the Cinderella Special Edition Disney Dream Sketcher for my 4 year old daughter.( She'll be 5 in 2 months ) She was so excited- until she started playing with it. It is very complicated to use. For example if you want to color the paint by number pictures you have to keep \\"clicking\\" back to the paints and then back to the picture. She could not tell what they numbers were because they are so tiny. I could barely tell myself. After about 20 minutes she handed me back the game in tears and declared it a bad toy and that she wasn't a smart girl anymore. This from a child that mastered Leapster and V-smile the moment she got them! I think the age range should be changed on this toy. It is much to difficult for the younger kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE","review":"I HAVE TO SAY I AGREE WITH EVERYONE ELSE, WE BOUGHT THIS NOT ONCE BUT TWICE I WAS CONVINCED THEY DROPPED THE FIRST ONE AS IT TRULY WORKED FOR 15 MINUTES.

Not worth the six AA it takes to power it.","review":"The overall impression of it by looking at the product's box and while the product is off is really good; however, once the product is powered on the screen is such low quality that it is difficult to view the screen. There are a few games allowed without plugging in a game cartridge but the options are limited. The product does not include a game which often run in the $20-$30 price range. There is no way I would spend additional money on this product. I feel ripped off already for wasting my time removing it from the packaging and installing the six batteries. The only reason I did was the children discovered an Christmas present which has not been played with (this product). I cannot return it and I wouldn't dare be the jerk to give this garbage to someone else's child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating piece of junk.","review":"We have two of these and neither of them work very well. They are very tempermental and it seems if the battery contact is not perfect the machine stops working. It stops working periodically while you are using it and sometimes it will not turn on. You can unscrew the battery compartment and mess around with the batteries for awhile and then it may or may not start working again. This thing is garbage and that's where ours are headed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Sketcher","review":"Do Not Buy This Toy!!! It was decent for a 2.5 yr old, even with its bad graphics, but it won't last. All of the reviews that gave this toy a bad review are correct. Batteries don't last, poor graphics (can't distinguish between colors & paint by numbers are so small you can't make them out), just stopped working after 2 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"We bought this to keep our daughter occupied in the car during long trips. She loves to do electronic coloring on the computer, the Disney software was appealing and the reviews were all good, so we were very excited about this toy. However, after unboxing and putting batteries in it, we are very disappointed in the product. The screen image is terrible -- you can hardly distinguish colors and the pixilation is very bad. The pre-loaded software only has 10 coloring pages. The dot to dot game doesn't have the child follow numbers or letters so it has absolutely no educational value. We were not able to test the additional Princess cartridge we bought without tearing opening the packaging, but even if the software was great it would'nt overcome the terrible screen image. The images look nothing like the one on the packaging. This toy is going back to the store tomorrow. It was a great premise, but poorly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"I have three kids...with three Dream Sketchers. They're great toys.

We didn't hear from them for hours. Any toy that keeps their interest this long is a winner in my book. My 4 year old especially loved the connect-the-dots game and the match game on the princess cartridge and my little one loved to paint by numbers and use the stampers. They especially loved being able to e-mail their artwork to their grandparents when they were done."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!!! A RIP-OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This toy has got to be the most annoying and frustrating toy ever!!! After my daughter played with it for literally 5 minutes it froze up. Their customer service just keeps telling me to reset it and that the pencil needs realigned. The screen goes blurry and it freezes up every 5 minutes or so. Then it wont even shut off when you turn the power off. Then they told me to use either of one of the two name brand batteries in it and I did and it is still doing the same thing. This item is a big disappointment and WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!My daughter gets very upset with this toy and it is NO FUN for her when things go wrong with it every few minutes!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work NOT BUY!","review":"I wish I had read the other reviews before buying.

They worked fine the first day but not since. I have gone through a ton of batteries as well and have actually had a few explode in the unit.

This toy worked for a short time and then would not even turn on. I sent it back to the manufacturer who responded with no help and sent it back claiming it to be repaired. It again worked for a very short time and then back to the same problems. Buy a leap frog leapster. Much better graphics and reliable. The graphics on the dream sketcher are poor at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"My daugther saw this toy in a catalog and we got it for Christmas, she was really exited, but after only 3 days the toy would not start; we replaced the batteries and then the screen froze.

This time I'm getting my money back!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I agree with the other reviews that this toy is poorly made. I did not have a problem with the screen freezing until recently and the batteries needed to be jiggled to correct that problem. The batteries need to be changed every time we try to use it. I now remove the batteries when it's not in use. The screen is also very fuzzy. My daughter doesn't show much interest in playing with her Dream Sketcher. She prefers her Leapster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eats batteries while it is turned OFF","review":"After reading the reviews, and getting the Dream Sketcher for 75% off, I decided to try it anyway, but to make sure the unit was turned off after use. The first three days we had it, we changed the batteries 3 times. SO then I did a test. We put six brand new batteries in it on Wednesday, and my daughter played with it for about 20 minutes. Then I turned it off, and put it in my bedroom. It remained off until today, Saturday, and when we turned it back on, the batteries were dead. So the thing eats batteries while it is off. The games were quite stupid and every cartridge had the same art program on it, so all you really got different on each cartridge were a few stupid games. When the batteries start running low on this machine, the screen will not turn off, even after you manually turn it off. Don't waste your money on this one. Ours is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I purchased the Disney Dream Sketcher for my daughter's for Christmas. If you don't have stock in batteries, I suggest you do not buy this toy. There is no other options for powering up this toy other than batteries. The graphics are terrible and I could of spent the money on something much better and more durable. Very disappointed this was backed by Disney. Nobody could have tested this toy because it would have never passed inspection. The batteries are hard to replace and it's not easy to operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks up batteries and never works","review":"We bought this product, three different games, and special ordered a cases for it for our four year old daughter for christmas, because she loves everything Disney and art.

Immediately the screen kept freezing and I'd have to unscrew the battery doors to reset it. The batteries kept popping up inside their doors even though the doors were on tight. A tiny screw fell out without our noticing and the sketcher no longer worked. I wrote to Jazware to ask them to send me another tiny screw and they never replied. My daughter wanted to play it since she barely used it so I took back the one without a screw and exchanged it for a new one. I told the customer service at the store that the screen kept freezing so they're going to send it back to Jazware. If they would've sent me the screw, I wouldn't have taken it back and they wouldn't have had to eat the cost of it. The new one which I just bought, has already had the screen freeze.

This one, Canadian, definitely, is the most comprehensive and up-to-date.First of all, it is the work of someone who speaks from experience. Therefore, all of the information is very practical and easy to understand and remember.When you read that \\"high triglycerides are bad for you,\\" the author does not stop there. He does his best to let you know what can be done about it. Or more precisely, what YOU can do about it.Indeed, this book clears lots of existing confusion on triglycerides (and the other blood fats) by telling you things your doctor is not going even mention to you.Of course, you may find some of the more demanding dietary recommendations in this book uncomfortable, but you know that they have been made keeping your health and well-being in mind. And that counts.It is a highly recommended reading.Alice M.New York, NY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anime chicks fight in slightly confusing Anime style","review":"I like this, it isn't the greatest Anime out there but it is good. the picture quality is pretty good considering the age of the films.There are the usual translation problems and drop you in at the deep end stuff like most Anime.Like what is a Boomer, why isn't the background for Silvia Stingray explained better. Also some of the episodes seem like fillers, the car one for instance. They only seem to establish Pris and Sylvia as characters leaving the other two until the last couple of episodes. They also introduce main characters on a whim expecting us to care when they die, they don't seem to establish relationships between them and the Night Sabres.You may get the impression i didn't like this but i thought it was good Anime.

The content of the DVD's is excellent, but I'm at a loss to understand why they chose to package the product in such a ludicrous box. I assume some marketing type thought that the package would make the product stand out on a shelf. As the consumer, I don't want a package that doesn't fit in neatly with the rest of my collection.

It should have better cooling system, better running processor and more working lifetime.Im seriously planning to sell this defective system and get back to basics, PS2 or Nintendo WII."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will break on you","review":"My XBox 360 lasted more than most, 18 months.

Maybe in a few years there will be some.Second, this console IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE with most games. Check the Microsoft site and they will confirm this (about 15 levels deep into the X-Box site). However, no where in the XBox manual do they tell you this.Third, Toys R Us will sell you Xbox games(not 360) and claim they will work with the new X-Box. They simply do not! In the rare case they do work, you must first download and install a software patch! DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE!!Finally, the XBox 360 is a decent DVD player and has great graphics for those with HDTV and the hookups (MS supplies the component cables).I was a huge fan of Microsoft until this product.

Microsoft is clearly #1. I have a first generation xbox 360 and have never had a problem to this day.

That being said, the 360 has INCREDIBLE graphics that far surpass the Wii and a pricetag that gives you far more bang for your buck than the PS3. Amazon was kind enough to provide me with an core system for cheap, and i will forever be grateful. but even so, the 360's GPU, processing, dashboard options, and online xbox live account all surpass what's currently availible on the other next gen systems. between the 3, your safest, and most prudent, investment is in the graphically superior, hearty xbox 360. oh and if you're going to buy it, get a wireless controller, headset, and Gears of War.

If you buy one now, microsoft is stepping up on the console issues, so these newer ones work pretty fine. Mine is working fine. And if you don't have money, then just buy this console. All you need is a memory card to save games, and amazon sells one for like $30 or less. So you spend $330, and you have all you need to start playing. If you want to play online, then go for the premium, but if you're just wanting to play games on your own free time, this is the cheaper deal for you. And don't worry, a 64MB memory card is more than enough to save games. Each game only takes like 1MB for game saves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Hardware Quality","review":"I bought this system on December 2006 and on April 2007 it was toast. My house has a central air conditioner system so it's always 24C. It broke with 3 red lights of death and I lost all my money, because I bought it in the US and I brought it to Venezuela. To fix it I would have to spend more money that buying a new one, so screw MS, such an expensive console should not break in less than 5 months. I loved the console, while it worked, but so many people are having this same problem because the console heats up too damn much. No extra fan solution is good enough. Buy something else, keep away from bad quality products like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it this weekend.....","review":"And so far I am very impressed. The graphics are incredible!

Since i had spent $400 for this system, i called the customer service to hope that i can get a fair deal. I was told i have to pay $140 to get it fix, i believed not include the shipping. I have 3 Xbox with 2 not function, i am not going to spent a penny on Xbox anymore.If you want to buy this system, pay extended warranty.

It's a good CD for Scorpion fans, but to a widespread general audience it's probably just the album that contains the hit Wind Of Change. Never able to recapture the brilliance of Love At First Sting, this one continues the Scorps' downward slide from the top of their game. I like this CD enough to keep it as a part of my collection because I really like the band, but after the first few tracks I usually get bored and listen to something else.

A \\"...World\\" of difference when compared to the quality of recent Scorpions offerings these days..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M GETTING OLDER...","review":"I'm getting older. I can't understand how some people liked this CD. It is very bad compared to others Scorpions albums from the 70's and beginning of the 80's.This CD is just horrible. Here in BRazil, the song \\"Wind of Changes\\" have been used for the soundtrack of soap-operas in TV ! Look the title of the tracks in the album: \\"TO be With You in HEaven\\", \\"Lust or Love\\".. etc. Compare it with older songs like \\"We'll Burn the Sky\\", \\"Fly to the Rainbow\\", \\"Pictured Life\\".. what a shame ! Bring Ulrich Roth back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Canada's Answer to Chicago in New York City","review":"I get goosebumps when I think of this album. \\"Live\\" doesn't even do it justice. It was explosive. Feb 6, 1972 at Carnegie Hall. \\"One Fine Morning, Take it Slow\\" and \\"I Just Wanna be Your Friend\\" were the staples of this one fine album but I particularly like the band's versions of \\"Rockin' Chair, Insane and the \\"Byrd's\\" classic \\"Eight Miles High\\", the latter mainly because Lighthouse just doesn't play it anymore. The only complaint with the album is I had wished they had done another if only so that songs such as \\"Pretty Lady\\" and\\" Sunny Days\\" could have been included. I'm fortunate enough to be living in \\"Lighthouse country\\" so I get quite a few opportunities to see them even now. If we can get Amazon to put some sound clips with the album selections, then more of you can find and appreciate what most of us already know. Lighthouse rocked...and still does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Live cd I have ever heard","review":"WOW! If you like rock/jazz with the power of a live gig, this is the cd for you. Lighthouse, for those of you who don't know was an powerhouse in the 70,s. Under the leadership of Skip Procop this group broke all bounderies, groups like Chicago, Blood Sweat and Tears, owe much to this group. Songs on this cd that stand out, 1849, Sweet Lulabye, and The Byrds-Eight Miles High.This is one of those must haves for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthouse - Too Bad Too Bad","review":"I really like this album, it well represents this band whom I've seen live several times. Whatever happened to them, this reminds me of how much I enjoyed this band live. Whether they are on the same level as Chicago is not the question, this would have been a nice concert to be at. If the editorial comments are true and they ignored Woodstock, it just shows how others viewed this band. That is a really what if question had they been present at Woodstock. This is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh!","review":"This book was a big fat disappointment which added nothing new to the knowledge of the fate of the Romanovs. The bulk of the first half of the book concerns itself more with describing squabbles among the various scientists researching the matter than with providing historical or scientific facts. I had the feeling that the author did not have any real information and mostly just blew smoke. Additionally, at the time of publication, two of the bodies had not yet been recovered, so it could hardly be correct to call the book \\"The Final Chapter.\\" The second half (the entire second half!) of the book dealt with the claim of Anna Anderson. It could have been handled by a few sentences, as in: DNA proved Anna Anderson was NOT Anastasia. Budda Boom, Budda Bing! Crummy, clumsy book, unworthy of an author who has otherwise written so brilliantly on Imperial Russian history."},{"rating":"2","title":"different from most romanov histories","review":"rather than focusing on the imprisonment and deaths of the Romanovs and just using the findings of DNA evidence as proof this book details the process of testing DNA and the legal debates and court cases that surrounded it.Massie updated his Romanov history which began with 'Nicholas and Alexandra' (unlike other Romanov historians) when bodies were found in 1991 and testing was done, i hope he updates again to include the 2007 discovery and its DNA findings as well as the blossoming tourist industry in Ekaterinburg from Romanov pilgrimages"},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately Needs Updating","review":"I'm really surprised that Mr. Massie hasn't bothered to write an update/afterword to this book. A lot of questions left unanswered in the book are now resolved. Such as were the bodies finally buried? What happened to the bodies of Anastasia/Marie and Alexei? What about Soloviev's criminal investigations, what were his findings? The book is outdated as it stands.Furthermore, I found a lot of the book extremely difficult to get through. No less than 101 pages are devoted to Anna Anderson. This is ridiculous for a historical account. And, I found it a difficult 101 pages to read. There are many different characters all trying to block each other's attempts to get Anna Anderson's tissue sample for DNA testing and I really just wanted to know...well is she or isn't she Anastasia?I think this book was written before it should have been. A new book on the subject would be able to address and answer the questions that were not resolved at the time this book was published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the vast information","review":"This audio is like a good mystery with all the interesting facts and figures.

A WONDERFUL BOOK!","review":"This is the so-called \\"sequel\\" to Robert Massie's masterpiece \\"Nicholas and Alexandra.\\" It is an excellent book about the imprisonment and murder of Russia's last Tsar and his family. If you want to learn about this important event in Russian History, please do not waste your time with Greg King and Penny Wilson's \\"The Fate of the Romanovs.\\" This book, \\"The Romanovs: The Final Chapter\\" by Robert Massie is the book you should read. It also dives into the myth of Anna Anderson and proves she was a fraud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well wirtten!","review":"This is a very well written historical piece describing the fall of the Romanov Russian royal family. One is left with a sense of loss when they are murdered by those in power during the Bolshevik revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Massie describes all events following the discovery of the czar's remains in scientific detail. He also manages to keep the readers attention through a thorough discussion of DNA. The Imperial family comes alive once more through this book, and one wonders what punishment the Russian people would inflict upon Lenin today for his horrible deed. The subject of Britain's royal relations to the Romanovs is also discussed. Massie's description of DNA disproving the claim of Anna Anderson is also quite compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Massie....please, FIND a new dead horse to beat!","review":"Robert Massie has spent execptional amounts of time for over 30 years flaying this dead horse about the Romanvos. He has all ways been dead wrong with any of his \\"findings\\".As any /every one knows, history is a fairy tale, slanted by the winning side. Russians are incapable of telling the truth. The British are not known as exceptionally truthful. There are legions of individuals both directly involved and peripherally involved with the \\"fate\\" of the Romanovs, but none will band together and state the facts. TOO, too ridiculous, with Massie acting like Moses coming down from the Mount. Hey, Bob, after all, it is ONLY your version of the facts.His \\"research\\" is sloppy, he relies on dubious sources. He violates all the basic tenets of factual, honest journalism.By all means, AVOID any and all books with Massie's name on them. Total waste of time, effort, ink, paper and money. He should have quit with \\"Nicholas & Alexandra\\", so long ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Romanovs","review":"Massie wrote an excellent and very detail book on the quest to find and identify the last Romanovs. The book began with the finding and identification of the bones and then went into the Anna Anderson mystery. Massie is a great writer which he nonetheless proved in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but out of date","review":"This is a very interesting book (of course Robert Massie is a great writer and historian) but it is very out of date. At the end of the book, a final resting place had not been determined for the remains of Tsar Nicholas and his family (they are now buried in St. Petersburg in the Peter and Paul Fortress with the rest of the tsars who followed Peter the Great). Also, the remains of the Tsar's son and heir Alexis had not been found and one of the daughters was missing. Now these remains have been found. Would be great to have a new edition with updated events and information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I have got this book out of curiosity and was not mistaken.

My grand applause to the author! I bought more of his books, I am pretty sure I will also like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXTREMELY WELL-RESEARCHED AND INTERESTING","review":"A very well-researched and extremely interesting book that provides many answers to what really happened after the massacre of the Romanov family. The book is fascinating simply for its chapters on Anna Anderson alone. Massie, however continues to do what he did in his previous book about the Romanovs: he tends to sugar-coat their lives, giving them an unrealistic, fairy-tale existence, rather than letting the family's true personality shine through. I also agree with the previous reviewer who said that a family tree would have been a nice addition!

The more she quoted scripture and personal inserts, the more I became enlighted and focused to do the will of God as it concerns my body and mind. I would recommend this book to all of my friends, married or single. I think that this would be a great topical discussion for a single ministry.

It slides in as if to shed some bit of light on the topic of sexuality for the saved and single, then proceeds to give some of the weakest, most brain-dead arguments for all of its major points. It is filled with flawed logic and rhetorical tricks. It's a bad sermon--relying on emotion and guilt, rather than logic, faith, and the Word. This book should serve to do one thing for its readers: inspire them to write. If this book got published, be assured that whatever you have been thinking about writing can be published, too. Begin writing immediately! You cannot do any worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Single Saved and Having Sex","review":"Ty Adams is very transparent.

It is described as a blend of South Asian music, electronica, and funk. The comments I read about it persuaded me to expect a CD in which one could find danceable songs with a traditional Hindi music influence. But most of the tracks come across as adult contemporary world music. One hears more jazz than funk, and most would be pretty difficult to dance to. The Punjabi bhangra music mixed with electronic dance beats have proven very popular and danceable in the UK. Someone looking for South Asian-influenced dance music would be better off with a CD from that musical genre. \\"Asian Groove\\" makes for pleasant, fairly interesting background music, but alas, not much else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chalo!","review":"This instalment in the Putumayo World in the world of groove music is quite good. \\"Pheli War\\" by Bally Jagpal is an excellent song, although I'm dissapointed with the choice they made for Bally Sagoo \\"Noorie\\". While \\"Noorie\\" is itself a pretty good song, it's not one of his best. There's a good blend of the different styles of South Asian music, and I can't complain about the song choices made. I was a little suprised, however, with the choice of puting the German group Mo' Horizons in this, since they're not Asian, but they do a terrific job mixing Sitars with electronics. They missed out on some very popular Hindi artists, however, like A R Rahman.

So if you are like me, and attended Landmark at one point, you will likely be familiar with many of the concepts - and best of all, be hearing them from a fresh perspective. I went through Landmark 5 years ago, and can tell you this book was exactly the refresher I needed (without the $500+ tuition) 5 years later.There's literally thousands of self-help books out there, and no doubt, you've probably felt like you've heard all there is to hear (and tried all there is to try).

I am human and drift into being at the effect of circumstances. This book provides a gentle yet powerful nudge on where my attention and intention should be daily.

It seems a bit too familiar thus a little lackluster for my adventure books. As usual half way through the pace picks up and the action starts moving.

Its because of this ending that I'm anxious to read the next Dirk Pitt novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a good read anyway","review":"Clive Cussler was not at his best with this book.. The historic part that he always starts his books with is always very interesting and it is fun to see how it fits in with the story.

Come on Mr Cussler let them retire and have a life - bring back Kurt Austin and pal..Have Dirk take over NUMA (The Admiral could retire)...And that last small chapter? Whatever were you thinking?? That was a bit too much for this faithful reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly good","review":"The only reason I finished reading this book was to see how it all tied together.

I won't make the same mistake again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites, by a favorite author","review":"If you haven't read any of Cussler's work, this light read is a great starting place. There are elements in every Cussler text that every fan knows to look for. Dirk's autos, his ladies and that elusive appearance by Clive himself. I never miss a word. I am almost disappointed at the making of Sahara into a movie, that is not at all how I pictured Dirk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, exciting commuter book","review":"This was my first Cussler book. Recommended by a friend, and to say the least, i was not disappointed.I have since read \\"Blue Gold\\" and it also exceeded my expectations. These are not by any means brain stormers - they are fun to read action packed stories with just enough dialog to keep things going. I compare Clive's books to a movie that doesn't tax the brain or require 3 1/2 hours of your life. It is not \\"epic\\" or historically(but you can def tell he likes his planes and guns, accurate details) important, its just fun. That is enough in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"The only good thing about this book is that I got through it somehow. A weak commercial clone of previously entertaining Dirk Pitt books. There were many technical inconsistencies and a slow forgettable plot. I disliked this book so much, I tried to contact Cussler to find out why he did this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"The characters are not believable. The main plot line of evil business trying to take over the world helped by evil ex-special forces heavies, has been done to death. Cussler left out the Holy Grail, but managed to sneak in about every other cheesy, implausible plot element. All the credibility and technical sophistication of a Batman comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A drop in Cussler quality !Not a good book for new Cussler Readers!","review":"Though its book continues the cussler journey with Dirk Pitt at the helm it falls short of expectations established by the previous books. If you have read Cusslers other books i would say you should read it b/c their are huge plot points that occur in this for the series. If you are just looking for something to casually read grab an earlier cussler novel I gaurantee you will find them betterIn this book Dirk Pitt isn't the normal Dirk Pitt, yes he does solve the mystery but he doesn't do it in the regular way, he does have parts where he is the hero but it is not the typical style that I was used to. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't that good"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! This was bad!","review":"Stay away from this book. The first Cussler I read and probably the last. It is a train wreck of a story. Improbable, unbelievable, and at most times stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"got worse","review":"The book was intriguing at the beginning. I got hooked with the historical prologues and even the beginning events of the story. But starting with the New York plane chase it went downhill rapidly. The whole Cerberus plot to monopolize oil seemed to appear out of nowhere and then ended just as quickly. Dirk Pitt's constant hero acts became less and less plausible as he and NUMA basically take over the jobs of the FBI, police, Coast Guard, Special Forces, and Justice Department. And the dialogue at some points is just horrible. Authors should know by now to write dialogue that is more conversational. Very little of Cussler's dialogue in this book is conversational.Overall I found the book a huge disappointment and found myself skimming entire pages toward the end just to get it overwith. I don't think Cussler is a bad author, I just think he needs to cut the cheesy lines and also come up with a plot that doesn't make Dirt Pitt seem like the second coming of Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Cusslers best","review":"Like many other reviewers, I can honestly say this one has its cheesy moments. The whole Viking thing comes out of nowhere barely making a connection to the story. You're fumbling through looking for a connection that just isn't there. The \\"magic\\" briefcase had me cringing as well. It felt like Cussler had a long chat with William Shatner the night before writing that in. The ending has a suprise twist that was as predictable as it was cheesy. Not recommended as your first Cussler to read. If you plan to read Trojan Odyssey, however cheesy, the ending is a must read, there's some important character intros."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh. (from a non-Cussler-reader)","review":"I'd like to give it 2 1/2 stars, actually. It's not as bad as 2, but it sure doesn't rate 3.Not bad, I guess, for an adventure novel. The prose is fairly ham-fisted, though--if you're looking for a well-*written* novel, you won't want to read this one. I didn't much care for the author's cameo (it seemed more like a piece of fantasy-fulfillment than a legitimate plot/character device), but those who read a lot of Cussler might enjoy it.It's an interesting story with some pretty clever ideas driving the plot, but the characters really aren't much more than cardboard cutouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirk goes out with a wimper","review":"The historical references in the begining of Cussler's booksare always intriguing even though they are far fetched. Heoutdoes himself with his historical? references this time.The story itself is rather mundane, an evil oil tycoon andhis henchman bent on dominating the United States. Also, theaction scenes in this book don't live up to his earliernovels. I still would have given this book 3 stars untilthe final chapter. The last chapter was so inane and contrivedit made me physicaly ill. I will have to immerse myself inthe Classics for about a month to recover. Do yourself afavor and spend your [money] somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst one yet - nothing new - Cussler's getting tired","review":"I've read and re-read all of Cussler's stuff. Even the non-fictional material. Love it all. The last several have been major let downs. Valhalla Rising was the worst. While I still love all of the Pitt and Al exploits, and of course one must suspend reality, this one was poorly written.Nothing new, in fact he once again borrows the exact same premises. How many times in all of his books can Pitt rescue a burning ocean liner? Haven't we seen this 1-2-3x before? The main bad guy is weak and not ever developed well. His henchman are also not developed well except for 1-2 characters.It doesn't even really tie together well with the oil development and the high-tech engines.I'm sorry to see it happen but it eventually does to all of the good writers. Clancy is exhibiting the same problem. Growing up it was Alistair MacLean. He was so good but eventually it was horrible.Clive: quit now."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's simply bad","review":"I've read CC since I've been 13. And I enjoyed every one of his books, including the Kurt-Austin-Books. This one is the worst book.

I've listened to most of Cussler's novels on tape - and this is by far the least satisfying. In fact, it was so embarassing, I didn't even finish it. It's like someone else wrote it (maybe a computer). It sounded like the narrator couldn't believe what he was reading (and I couldn't believe what I was hearing). Like his hero, Cussler is getting old. There is so much good literature out there, don't waste your time with \\"Valhalla Rising\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast paced story, but the plot blows!","review":"Clive Cussler generally writes a good fast paced adventure story. A fun read. But the plot of Valhalla Rising strains and breaks credibility.Particularly I didn't care for the author writing himself into the story as a hero at a particularly tight plot point in the story. Sort of a saved by the Gods cameo.If you must read Cussler,read Fire and Ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Get Rid of Dirk Off","review":"Cussler has always had some interesting ideas for plots; too bad that the writing is just getting worse and worse. It goes beyond formulaic; it's just plain BAD. Too many parts of this book just made me cringe, and I can't believe that the author spent any more time writing this book than I did reading it. Maybe he just needed some bucks for a new car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vallhalla Rising","review":"This is the first book I have ever read by Cliver Cussler and probably the last! What potential this book could have had, I was sorely disappointed. I don't often throw away a book when I finish it, but I didn't want this one falling into the hands of a friend. I would just feel so guilty for wasting their time. The best part about this book was the end, not the ending itself, but the fact that it ended. I can't in good conscience recommend this book to anyone. Vallhalla Rising should do itself a favor and sink into the abyss of poorly written books and be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Fun From Cussler","review":"This new novel by Clive Cussler is perfect vacation reading. Anyone interested in things both nautical and historical will find a wealth of fascinating detail woven in with his trademark face-paced plotlines. With innumerable twists and turns to keep you guessing, \\"Valhalla Rising\\" is a compelling thriller. As summer reading goes, I put this novel right up there with \\"Radio Rage\\" at the top of my summer reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep-Six this one","review":"The beginning sequences of ancient norsemen and a 19th century mystery sub seemed interesting, and I was hoping they would tie together later. Unfortunately, the ideas were never really picked up again, and it seemed as if they were thrown in at the end of the book to \\"tie\\" everything together.Dirk Pitt (the superhero NUMA research engineer) has numerous poorly written escapes from death. He doesn't just get attacked by an old biplane while flying over NYC. He doesn't just get attacked by an old biplane while flying a planeload of children over NYC. He gets attacked by an old biplane while flying a planeload of disabled children over NYC. The story quickly degrades from here, if that is at all possible, into one about an Evil MegaOilCorp out to dominate the USA (and secretly paying off over 100 Congressmen&women/govt agents), as well as numerous ridiculous nautical-themed terrorist attacks.I payed $0.27 for the book at a thrift shop, and can plainly see why. Deep-six this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"Full of cheesy dialog and melodrama, this book is populated with people who are the best in the world at what they do, capable of extraordinary daring and able to speak only in cliches. It is as banal as a 1970's tv show.This was my first Clive Cussler book. I'm a great appreciator of sea-faring adventure and I had such hopes for this book (especially with Cussler's real-life past time of finding historical shipwrecks). But I am through with him now. No more will I support his antique car habit. He should use his book profits for writing lessons -- maybe learn how to tell a story.This is very nearly fiction as bad as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirk Drivel","review":"This is my first Clive Cussler book, and I found it to be literary drivel. The book was typical \\"if you can't figure out how to explain an event, make something phenomenal happen to explain away the event\\". The situations in the book are extremely cliche, and predictable. The only subplot in the book that wasn't predictable, was so far fetched, and out of place with the rest of the story it almost made me mad to be treated like a simpleton. Clive Cussler also uses himself in the book as a one-off character who saves the day. This I also found to be hogwash. In all, I was extremely under impressed with the book. I enjoy high adventure in the style of Indiana Jones and any Star Wars novel, I felt this book insulted my intelligence. I may read another Clive Cussler book to see if this particular work was just a bad day. Happy Reading everyone.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe good for pre or young teens","review":"I took this book as a \\"talking book\\" on CD on a road trip.

Trite and Hardy Boys-ish."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid","review":"Another great Dirk Pitt adventure. The modern-day stuff is riveting, but when it delves into the past toward the end, it really gets gripping. Probably the best thriller since Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE.

However, his last few have not been up to the quality of his earlier work. I found the scenes in this book to be repititious of other scenes in his previous works. Plus, anyone who has read any of his previous material knows the descriptions of Dirk, Al, et. al. This to me just seemed to be filler to make the book longer.The editing was a bit shoddy also. Pacific Chimera's name was changed from one chapter to another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long time fan HUGELY DISAPPPOINTED","review":"Unlike some of my fellow reviewers, I am very disappointed in this latest Dirk Pitt novel. I felt like I was reading exerpts from previous books that had been strung together and re-titled. I have faithfully and happily read every book from the very first one and we need either a major injection of new ideas for the next plot or the series needs to stop. I cannot believe that Clive Cussler himself was not bored while writing this one because I was certainly bored while reading it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AM I CRAZY?","review":"I have just finished reading Valhalla Rising and as usual it was very enjoyable even if the plots are getting a bit thin. I actually was getting a bit sqeemish when I began to read about the ship heading to the World Trade Center docks.But to the point about my review.When Zale is discussing his plan to use a ship to come ashore in San Francisco, the ships name is PACIFIC CYBRUES. When the Coast Guard boards the ship it is called PACIFIC TROJAN. I can't find any link to show that Zane gave Sally the wrong ship name.

You have the nice cars, the beautiful women (no sex in this one and the possible future marriages in Atlantis Found just brushed off as not going to happen)the villains with outlandish plots, the technology past & present in advance of what it really was/is, you get it all. I did find the Viking angle interesting, as I also found the real Captain Nemo bit although they could've been better used and developed. The last page or two just seems to have been thrown in for filler, hints of a future plot series?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, I wanted to scream","review":"Valhalla Rising is my first and last Cussler book. I stopped reading about halfway through and have not had any second thoughts. Based on reviews it only gets worse. Writing is cheesy, and predictable, not to mention sexist (e.g. \\"She could dive just as good as any man\\"). And what kind of author writes themselves into their own book?! It was like a cut and paste action movie- from a burning boat, to an airplane chase through NYC, to a trapped submarine. Also, the mundane descriptive details about meaningless things (tell me again how the ropes are aligned on the boat) were just too much. No thanks, it was pure garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This was the first book by Clive Cussler that I read. I found it suspenseful, full of action and just plain brilliant.

It is a very cheesy novel which I found moderately enjoyable. It is pretty much required that you switch off any sense of reality to enjoy it (and this gets pretty damn hard when the author introduces himself into the story. One particular criticism is that he manages to convey no sense of place in the story, which takes you to Wellington New Zealand, the Kermadecs, Tonga, New York and Florida, but doesn't even remotely try and evoke any sense of what those places are like or how they may be any different to Washington. Oh, and he tries to do way too much in the story. The oil plot. The teleporting plot (teleporting!). The Viking plot. The Nemo plot. The threads that link there are tenuous indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I remember why I stopped reading Clive Cussler","review":"How many times does Clive Cussler need to remind us of his love for his hero that should have died 10 books ago....\\"He was a tall man, three inches above six feet, and a lean 185 pounds. His every movement seemed consciously planned. The black hair was wavy, alomst shaggy with a touch of gray beginning to show at the temples. The face was a face that knew the sea above and below. The tanned skin and the craggy features revealed a love of the outdoors. He was obviously someone who spent far more time under sun and sky than under the fluorescent lights of an office.\\"The stories are interesting, the facts melded with fiction capture my interest, but the never ending cavity creating praise for Pitt and constant cliches will prevent me from picking up a Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt novel again."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as a book can get","review":"This book is .... If I could rate it below 1 star, I would. I find it difficult to believe this author gets paid for his work. He's trite beyond belief and has no sense of how people actually talk. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor. It seems like he's getting paid by the word. A solid, serious edit would cut the book in half and improve it immeasuably. Staring at a blank wall would be better than reading this piece of [junk]. Shame, shame on Cussler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really??","review":"While I understand the appeal of formula novels, I was amazed at how bad this one actually is. I am all for suspension of disbelief - I love the ability to delve into unreality on occasion - but here the plot manipulation is pretty silly (though sometimes its fun) while the writing is downright pedantic. Writing oneself into a story is the supreme ego-trip, and to do so in such a strange and useless way just pushes into the absurd. Connecting the mythical/fiction (Jules Verne & Captain Nemo) with the historical (Viking exploration) is fine, but the writing simply doesn't support such an odd pairing. I was so glad to finish the book, just to be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clusser must of lost his orginial story overboard.","review":"I love reading Clusser novels, but this one was a reach. I understood the imagination and ideas Clusser was orchestrating but the symphony was out of tune. Hopefully, this story doesn't tarnish 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea or the great Dirk Pitt stories of the past. Furthermore, did someone edit this story? I found it a dissappointment to read, between the misspelled words and the timeline of events, at the end of the story, that didn't seem to fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Pitt novels","review":"I've read all the Dirk Pitt novels and most of Cussler's other stuff - one of my guilty pleasures. Valhalla Rising has all the familiar elements - tie-ins to the past, a wealthy megalomaniac for a villain, near superhuman escapades. It's been one of my favorite Pitt novels. The initial 100 pages or so are a riveting maritime rescue account. Simply wonderful stuffYes, it's still a Pitt novel. Cussler often uses long, stiff dialog from his main characters to move the story along. I always found this interesting, since he doesn't do that much at all in his other series. But I think he realizes it is a hallmark of the Pitt series.If you're into Cussler, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done Cussler","review":"This is definitely not the best Cussler book, and i really would never consider Dirk Pitt classic litterature, but a book is just an escape, it's not always meant to be disected until nothing is left, and this is a wonderful example of a great escape into fiction. Cussler, although every Pitt book has the same formula (why deviate from a tried and true scheme), has managed to create yet another fantastic adventure. I've read every Pitt novel as well as half the NUMA files novels, and one thing that never changes is that each story is a page turner. I recommend this book to anyone who just wants to relax and enjoy a fun weekend read, but for those who are looking for academia, i suggest you look into Verne or Balzac. And for those of you who think they can pull a better book from out of their a**es, i'd like to see you try."},{"rating":"1","title":"The integrity of a once great series and character.....","review":"Just to qualify, what is about to be said. I have read all the books, I like the series less and less. The first were alive and fresh, an adventure. The new ones are...\\"Oh dear. I think someone was on autopilot writing this. 421 copies available from $0.01. Yep. The plot is too fantastical to even draw you in. The characters are wafer thin. An obsession with details, clothes worn, brands of gadget, etc. instead of eh story...In Sweden, we say 'cake on cake' - not one shipwreck, but 2, then a vintage plane fight over Manhattan, then finding lost viking boats, moored next to Cpt. Nemo's submarine. And an ending, to make you want to puke, it is so saccharin. No, no, no. All very disappointing. This is now the Mills & Boon of adventure. Or the Roger Moore of Bond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valhalla rose to the challenge!","review":"Another Clive Cussler success! Plenty of action, a little romance, and a lot of adventure! This one would have to rate along side Inca Gold, and Floodtide as my favorite Cussler novels. As per his successful formula, Dirk Pitt again gets himself into trouble by helping to save a damsel in distress, and he gets more than his money's worth, and so do we. I particularly enjoyed the aerial battle scene above New York City. He obviously wrote the novel pre-9/11.My only negative comment, is that you get the feeling he retired his major character(Dirk Pitt/Personna of Cussler himself) with this novel. Too bad, cause a lot of older guys, like myself really warmed up to Dirk, and Al, and loved reading of them getting themselves into, and out of perils. I look forward to reading his next novel Fire Ice, but will miss Dirk, and Al."},{"rating":"2","title":"clive cussler at his best","review":"i found this book too be a very good read clives best work yet once i started reading i couldn't put it down dirk pitt is at his best in this i have read every book and this one has more action then any of the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valhalla Rising","review":"Clive Clusser is a great writer and this book is very well done, plot is complicated but easily understandable. Great climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty standard Cussler -- but he's reaching","review":"When I buy the latest Cussler (as I always do), I expect something fun and enjoyable to read, if a bit formulaic. However, this book really started to try my patience. Every Dirk Pitt cliche is overdone in this one. (As for the end, well, Mr. Cussler, are you really planning to drag this out THAT long??) I'll keep reading the Dirk Pitt novels, but I certainly hope that Mr. Cussler injects some new creativity into the series. (And the ending of _Valhalla Rising_ is NOT what I had in mind.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for first timers","review":"This is the first CC book for me and I thought it was great. Quite exciting and its truely a page-turner. However, the other revies seem to suggest that this is the worst CC book. So now I can't wait to read his other books, especially Raise the Titanic because his previous works must be a lot better or else his loyal fans wouldn't be criticising this book. However, I do agree that CC got carried away with using too much vocabulary. His descriptions gets very wordy at times so its better to have a dictionary handy while you read this book. Well, the conclusion is, for CC fans, this may be a 2-3 star book, for compared to many others books of this genre, this is definitely a 4 star book, if not a 5 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This last book by Cussler - who used to be one of my favorite authors for this kind of books - is unfortunately a mere shadow of Dirk Pitt's earlier adventures. Nothing new, and all too much following the usual formula..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book But Not Cussler's Best Work","review":"As with many or my fellow readers I agree that Valhalla Rising is not one of Cusslers's greatest novels. It was still a good read and I was glad I bought it. I did have the honor of meeting Cussler at a book signing and he is a remarkable man who was extremely entertaining. The good news is that a new film based on his book Sahara is being filemd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Valhalla Over the Top","review":"This long-time Cussler fan was disappointed by the latest Dirk Pitt adventure. Although populated by the usual techno-wonders, beautiful/unobtainable women and outstanding adventures (both in the air and undersea), Mr. Cussler was sloppy with distracting and unecessary complications -- most notably, the rescued briefcase that mysteriously refills itself with oil -- which took this novel clear over the top. Watch for a clumsy introduction of new characters at the very end, which promise immortality for Dirk Pitt and possible yawns for Mr. Cussler's faithful readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic","review":"Cussler has written some OK stories. This isn't one of them. The plot is utterly ridiculous, the dialogue ludicrous, the writing filled with factual and grammatic errors.

It was cut and pasted from other works, editing was terrible, the plot predicatable and the ending utterly ridiculous. The Dirk Pitt saga's may continue but I will not be buying them.Mr. Cussler you rave about Jack DuBrulls books, and rightfully so. He writes the type of novel you used to write, interesting and well written.I suggest instead of buying another Cussler yawner, you buy a good book by a fresh author like DuBrull."},{"rating":"1","title":"valhalla rising","review":"Okay am I the only one that missed the point with this book? Is it written intentionally to strain the limits of credibility, ala the old 'boys own adventure' books? This is the first book of Cussler's that I've read, so maybe I need to subject myself to another bout of awfulness to determine if the style is for real. If one considered the inclusion of the author as a character as unbelievable trite, it got even worse with the saccharine ending - the arrival of Pitt's long lost children curiously named..Dirk and Summer, duh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rewriting cosmology","review":"No doubting the popularity of Clive and Dirk, judging by some 150 reviews here. I find this page turner enjoyable, if you don't have expectations of anything other than formula writing on a cartoon level.BUT one major, comical, error Clive makes appears in the first pages, where he describes a cavern being hollowed out twenty BILLION years ago.As the latest [2002] Hubble derived estimations of the age of the universe are 12-14 billion years, and the solar system is generally acknowledged to be less than five billion years old, this is rather a howler. Unless Clive knows something we don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything that's Bad in Fiction","review":"Is in this book. God, it's awful.Cussler's main character, Dirk Pitts, is the perfect superhero. Smart, strong, rich, dedicated, meticulous with so much time on his hands he can personally restore vintage aircraft, head a special projects division of a super-secret government agency, travel the world, develop new technology and carry on several successful relationships - - but he's always in such a hurry that he accomplishes everything at the last minute!Aargh!No flaws . . . he even, singlehandedly, saved a plane full of disabled children from a Red Baron copycat in a dogfight over New York. Blah!America is always right, the hero is always perfect, and the military can do no wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save your money.","review":"This really seems like comic book material stretched into a serious waste of time.

I hope he has a day job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened Clive?","review":"The early Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt novels were fun and exciting. I enjoyed them. Valhalla Rising was BORING. Why does Clive Cussler have to become a character in his own book. He must have an ego the size of the Grand Canyon. This was the most disappointing Cussler novel to date. This book could be labelled \\"SOS\\". Same old stuff. It's as though he put a template over one of the older novels, added some new characters and changed the plot a little. I'm tired of Dirk Pitt. I'm tired of Clive Cussler. The back cover of the book shows Cussler with all the antique cars he owns. Who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirk Pitt taken hostage by ... the author!","review":"Clive Cussler needs to seriously consider what he is doing to the Dirk Pitt series. this novel is absolutely horrible. the characters talk like a bad spy novel and the action is ludicrously predictable. at one point the bad guy tries to take Dirk out by shooting Dirk down -- and yes, the bad guy flies a Fokker tri-plane to do it! in the heat of battle Dirk actually shouts \\"Curse you Red Baron!\\" before saving the day (again). we're quoting Snoopy here?! Dirk & Co. actually meet Clive Cussler in the book as Cussler is sailing around the world. we can only hope that next time he takes his computer with him on that voyage and somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic it falls into the ocean? Dirk has gone from an exciting star to a joke and it's the work of his creator. please Mr. Cussler - stop cranking out farces that are practically satires of the thriller genre. free Dirk, Mr. Cussler! let some other author do something good with him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"","review":"To describe this record as typical death metal would be an affirmative declaration. Picture Deeds of Flesh with their dual vocal attack playing Morbid Angel riffs and you get an impression of what Severe Torture is. The band does manage to inject some variable life into each song, and while you get the same feeling out of every track, the tempo is mixed between fast blasting songs and explorations into mid-tempo territory. But no matter how you slice it, this is brutal death metal and if that's what you're into you might be pleased with this album. As for me, I'd rather listen to 'Domination' or 'Path of the weakening'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Amazon.com editor pick of 2003","review":"Many thanks to the Amazon.com editors for picking this book as one of their top picks for 2003, otherwise I would not have found it. Monkey Dancing is a charming story of a father and his two pre-teen children as they make their way through forming a new family dynamic, all the while touring some of the world's most endangered plants and animals.The author tells about how he and his family were dealt a double upheaval-the death of his brother from breast cancer and his wife decided that she wanted to leave her marriage and family to start a new one with another women. The writing is clear and flows fluently all the while weaving a tale of vanishing forest, eat exotic foods, and dealing with the forming of a new family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring beyond belief","review":"Strictly a travel log!

I love travel writing, I'm a mom and I would love to do a trip like this with my own son someday. I just could not finish it. I'm amazed that it made Amazon's top 50.I didn't find Glick or his kids very appealing.

I couldn't identify with this man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpectedly disturbing","review":"This book, written by a drug-using serial college dropout (and occasional journalist) who arranges a far-reaching trip for himself and his two children after his wife leaves him for another woman, disturbed me on several counts: I was uncomfortable with the sleeping arrangements (his young daughter seemed to often share the author's bed), the invasion of privacy (the book includes lengthy excerpts from his children's private journals), and the generally smug tone used to describe some rather odd family rituals.I'm sure the travel experiences were valuable to the participants, but there was way too much unpleasant information about the author and his family to allow me to enjoy this book---frankly, I didn't like them very much at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monkey Dancing","review":"I read alot of travelogs and found this one kind of boring. Parts of it was good. But then the author goes on and on about his brother and his ex-wife. Plus the fact that he allowed his 13 yr old son to use drugs and drink alcohol on this trip. I just had a hard time finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Feelings, but overall pretty good","review":"This was a pretty neat book, and I found Mr. Glick's willingness to take two very American kids on a trip around the world very brave. The book shed some light on the tragic plights on different endangered species. Species that most of us will never get to see outside of a zoo. I admired the honesty of this book, including the parts about his son's dabbling in drugs-it's life after all, that stuff happens, at least he made a point to show his son the negative effects of the stuff. Not too many parents do that.The parts I enjoyed most were about what they saw on their travels, and how unique each country was. I got sick very early on about him talking on and on about his wife leaving him. Tragic yes, but to write each time he told a person on the trip what had happened between him and his ex, was repetitive and almost pathetic. I wasn't able to connect with the author because of that.Overall, I like the book and would suggest it to friends. It's worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than zero","review":"Chilton's is only useful until you have to physically do something.I needed an electrical schematic at best. Some info at worst.

Many classics I have on vinyl and I wanted to see how this guy handled the mix...doesn't really come through. The Bigod 20 track is actually \\"Body to Body\\" and not \\"The Bog\\". The second Front 242 track is pitched up significantly...I would have worked it into the mix elsewhere.

The author says the quality of the book is bad because he worked hard to maintain the price low. But, personally, I would buy something more visually appealing even if I have to pay 10$ more. Moreover, the author assumes that people know everything about Unix and Gawk, thus for a person like me, it was kinda hard to keep up with the book. However, once you are familiar with the Gawk, this book is kinda good as a reference. If you know Unix and maybe Perl, It can be a good choice.

It was really hyped by many of the people I know, as a must read. I can't see why. The main character was worse then shallow. The book was written as something critical but the line that Camus and his mentor Sartre seem to take, time and time again, is to side with tyranny. This character was a straight and clear clinical psychopath. Why was it that Sartre was completely \\"ok\\" with silencing concetration camp survivors from Russia? Well... If this character was Sartre and Camus' ideal person then there really is no confusion about that, now is there. It appears that in order for Camus to justify his positions on his politics he had to create bad people and then try to make them ideal.

I have read about Terence Blanchard's work but, until this CD, had not heard him. Ivan Lins gives Blanchard marvelous songs to play but Blanchard does virtually nothing of interest with them. In fact, the playing is mind-numbingly, teeth-achingly dull. Too often on the slower material, Blanchard holds notes for what seems like forever because he has no other place he wants to go. Technically proficient, but boring, the CD feels like it lasts for hours. Lins tries adding vocal accompaniment to most tunes, but that usually doesn't work, because again Blanchard shows no understanding of the material that he is working with. Any of Lins own albums is better than this by a wide, wide margin.

Not only that, you get Nelsons take on country, the beautiful 'Big Yellow Moon'. Once you have reached the final track you will have no choice to listen to this collection again! This is as good as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft slicker brush","review":"This is the best brush I have found for brushing my Goldendoodles. Gentle on my dogs and does a great job. Have used it for over 4 years and purchased a new one now that Is a bit bigger brush but does the same wonderful job. The blue version works well too but a little firmer brush. This and a comb is all I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"dog loves it","review":"The brush works great for getting down to the skin surface without hurting the dog.I wish it were a little larger because he is part St Bernard & a few more inches of brush surface would help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cocker Puppy does not like this","review":"It was recommended to have a soft slicker/soft pin brush for my english cocker spaniel. Because I plan on doing my cocker's grooming I wanted to introduce grooming tools in order of what I thought would be the least invasive. I have used this brush on my puppy's dry coat while she was relaxed on my lap. Gently and lightly stroking through fine un-matted fur, my puppy jumped. After praising her for sitting so that I could try again, she allowed me two strokes and started barking. I have tried multiple times since, but my puppy will not have it. Personally I like the grip on the handle it is very comfortable and easy to use. I have done the pin test on my hands and arms and do not have streaks from it. I am hoping this brush works as my puppy gets older, maybe her skin is too sensitive and soft. For now, I have to use the KONG rubber slicker brush which she loves."},{"rating":"2","title":"great supplement","review":"Just don't expect the same questions on the test. I found that some areas that were emphasized in this book (and ACSM's own book) were not as emphasized in the test and some other areas would have been more helpful. But I loved being able to self test with TONS of questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with choice","review":"These stockings are very good quality, The rhinestones are modist and classy! These are fun to wear and really top off my outfit. Very comfortable and stay in place. The seller kept me informed on shipping and the product arrived very quickly. I would not hesitate to but from them again. They even contacted me to make sure I was pleased, with the product and shipment. 5 star!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice idea","review":"This grill cover was purchased as Christmas gift for my son-in-law. He is an avid Gamecocks fan and had the all the usual flags, pennants and car decals. This turned out to be the perfect gift (short of the Gamecocks winning a few more games) since his grill has a prominent place on his pool deck. He was quite pleased with the product. In addition to the logo, the quality of the product appears to be quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea Art","review":"Famous and important sea battles of Western History, illustrated by contemporary paintings, etchings, maps, and--beginning with the Monitor and the Merrimac--photographs. Runs from the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the last major battle in which galleys played a significant role, to Leyte Gulf, where American and Japanese aircraft carriers duked it out near the Philippines in 1944. Almost as much an art book as a history book, things turn a bit dull in the 20th century when full-page color reproductions of paintings are replaced by rather ordinary (with some exceptions) newspaper photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"flawed but essential","review":"Ours just broke- structural failure after three years. I used it all the time for cooking. Extremely handy. Add salt to pasta water, s & p to eggs, etc. etc. etc. all with one hand. One thing I came to appreciate is that the salt grinder worked in humid conditions that caused the shaker to clog. I have become so dependent on having it next to the stove that I'm going to have to get another right away. Worth the money, but they could improve it. Hope they do. Meanwhile, I don't see anything out there to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chef'n Dual Grinder","review":"The concept is understandable, but the purpose is not. If you use this for cooking, good luck getting done with the right amount -- maybe this will finally give you the chance to do finger and foream exercise. If you are obsessed with keeping your cooking counter top or nice dining tablecloth clean, this product is certainly not for you, or maybe it is if you want to keep cleaning all the time. The inlets for refilling are small, you will need some sort of spout or funnel to accomplish refilling the compartments. It's OK for table setting, but that's it. If you cook for more than two people, the rotation grinder is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but unreliable.","review":"The dual grinder is a great idea, and worked well initially. However, the salt portion ceased working only months after purchase leaving this gadget to be only a pepper grinder. Then, after only modest use, the plastic handle snapped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought the mini verson","review":"My wife an I saw this unit in a specialty store, thought is was pretty neat. Then we purchased it on Amazon. We like it for a number of reasons, it has a magnet that was handy for storing it on the bottom of our microwave oven, in reach for that quick launch of ground pepper. However, we hadn't used it more than maybe 10 times and the handle broke off! Now it is kaput! Can't fix it, etc. Piss poor quality control, but a nice idea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The coolest pepper grinder in history!","review":"You get salt and pepper in one grinder! How cool is this! Just squeeze the handles and you can grind your pepper or salt WHILE YOU'RE STIRRING THE POT! Easy to adjust the grind and refill. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't happy with the quality","review":"I didn't buy this for myself, it was a gift. Honestly I doubt I would have purchased it for myself because I wanted a *serious* pepper grinder. I use my grinder every day and I like a lot of pepper. I found this grinder to be a pain because of how light the output was-- I had to sit there squeezing for what felt like ages. In addition, the grind isn't adjustable, although it was supposed to be. Finally, the handle simply broke off one day. I didn't drop it or anything. I guess it's not for serious use."},{"rating":"2","title":"great item","review":"I had one of these for years and it was very worn out and broke on thanksgiving so I ordered an identical one and I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of trash","review":"Worked a week and then the peppercorns jilted the shaft and now I only have a salt grinderWaste of money for poor craftsmanship. And no help at all from the company other than try another one, but we will not only not replace, but not issue any credit.Buy at your own risk, or just use a hammer.Still looking for a simple easy durable mill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The handle broke the first time we used this. We had one previously that lasted 8 years before wearing out. My husband made me hunt down the exact same product since he loved it and we used it daily. This one broke the first time I squeezed the handles. They must have changed something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good image quality poster.","review":"Scrubs is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I loved the look of this poster.The image quality is very crisp and clean looking. All the different colors from their Scrubs make the poster colorful, but at the same time not overbearing.One thing I did notice, is how odd the clean white background of the poster looks against a white wall. When it's on my wall, the fact that one section of my white wall just looks brighter than the rest of my wall looked weird to me. However, the problem can be fixed if you have a lot of other posters to surround this one with.Regardless, I am very satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought as gift","review":"We bought these for our kids vehicle since we have been through several on ours. My husband has a truck that he takes out into the wilds of the west on business. He goes through these almost like tires. The carpets in the truck still look brand new because of the protection they give. A good pressure wash and they are almost as good as new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overpriced","review":"If you are buying this for more than $39.99, you are paying way too much. Lookelsewhere. They have it listed at Toys R Us for $39.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his favorite toys","review":"I had been looking for a small ride on toy my son could learn to push and really enjoy. Of all places this toy jumped out at me at a thrift store. I fell in love, especially for $3! So did he.He pushes and pulls it everywhere, loves to play with the propellers. And they are styrafoam so it doesn't hurt him. We put in a battery and now he dances to the music-it is totally adorable. He is 20 months and fits it fine. His cousin, however is a few inches taller and about 12 or so pounds heavier and seems too big for it. She loves it too, but she's a bit over 2 and has the build of a 3-year-old. We love watching him play with this, and dance to the music. I highly recommend this toy, your child will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 year old+ son loves this","review":"My son got this for his first birthday from grandma and grampa and it's easily his fave toy. The whizzes and lights, the sounds, plus he can ride on it. He can hang out on the floor with this for an hour...crazy. What would we have done without it???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - not suitable for age range","review":"I bought this for my nephew for his 1st birthday. He loved it - that is until he kept getting pinched by the wings and 'owwies' from the propellers. It tipped over a lot too - in the end it was easier to throw it out than to deal with the injuries it caused! He had it less than 2 months - what a waste of money. Wouldn't recommend at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with book","review":"This book was not as good as I expected. Based on previous reviews, I thought it was going to be outstanding. There really is only one, maybe two recipes that I want to try. The others sound too fancy (and I am a pretty experienced cook) or just not interesting. My fiance eats everything and after he looked through the book, he said a lot of the recipes didnt sound very good. Overall, a waste of my money and quite disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully scary in the best possible way","review":"This beautifully written, lyrical book is genuinely scary in a way that puts much modern children's literature well and truly in the shade. Grandmother Oldknowe is protected by all the good things of the earth - stone and water, and all the deep things of nature - in her struggle with the horrible Melanie Powers. Aided by Tolly and Ping, it's a battle for the soul with moments that will make adults draw their breath sharply.Not a book for those who are easily scared, nor for those with strong prejudices against the supernatural - but for the bravehearted reader, an truly thrilling ride awaits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six-Legged Apocalypse Now","review":"Yo straight-up, this is the greatest bugumentary ever made! There are all kinds of crazy camera angles inside this teeming megalopolis of seething insecticism, and at its horripilated core the heaving mass of the queen daily pumps out 30 000 drone-clones to feed the maw of evolution's fangs and claws. Weird purplish lights glint and glimmer inside the queen's body as the war drums that are the abdomens of weaver ants beat against quaking leaves and finally summon ant armageddon. A terrific battle ensues under lightning and rain, and the resultant walls of mud finally carry the dying, damned, and doomed down into the dark recesses of a dirt-and-spit labyrinth. John Cusack's narration is pitch perfect over top of the deathmatch, neither under- nor overstated as the micro is translated into the macro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discoveriffic","review":"If you like watching Discovery channel, this is right up your alley. Definitely too drawn out in certain parts and probably longer than it needs to be but awesome all the same. Who knew that Termites were an advanced society? Kinda joking, but it's seriously amazing. I know one of the other reviews said something about CG, but I think they just sped up some parts and played with lighting effects. After all, if you go stake out a termite nest for 2 years your going to have some crazy wild life epic-ness occur. It's not Hollywood type of drama, it's 'penguins' type of drama. Expect dramatized documentary. Ta da."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with a David Attenborough documentary","review":"Some decent macro photography all set to an insanely dramatic soundtrack and completely monotone whispered narration of an overly emotional and deeply dishonest script. Cusack is quite possibly the worst narrator on the planet. He must have driven the sound engineers batty.In comparison to the brilliant, factual, and informative documentaries such asLife in the Undergrowth, this doesn't play well.Lots and lots of insects were deliberately destroyed for the making of this thing because there's just no way the camera crew just happened to be there when the assorted disasters struck unless they caused them. I know they're just bugs. But it's still not nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"This is a wonderful CD with quality CLASSIC music. Definitely woth every cent!

However, I feel it is a pretty skimpy package, with only 10 songs. If 10 different Stylistics fans listed just one song (from these years in their career), and could put that song on this album, the track listing would probably swell to 20. My particular pet-peeve omission on this album, is \\"Stop, Look, Listen.\\" In my opinion, you'd be better off to buy their first three albums (\\"Stylistics\\" \\"Round 2\\" \\"Rockin' Roll Baby\\") separately. You'll pay more, but you'll be a lot more satisfied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strokes of brilliance.","review":"Wow! They sure don't make music like this anymore. The Stylistics were an incredible group, and they released some of the most romantic (and heartbreaking) songs ever recorded. \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\" is one of those slow jams that can make even the hardest of hearts believe in love, while \\"You Are Everything\\" still sounds gorgeous after all these years. My only gripe? \\"Stop, Look, and Listen to Your Heart\\" is not on this collection, but that's a small inconvenience when you consider the other brilliant tracks that ARE here. Fans of the old school won't need my recommendation to get this disc, and younger listeners should definitely pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't cut songs short!","review":"I bought this CD several years ago, and I knew something didn't sound right. My hunch was confirmed when a couple of months ago I discovered that this album's version of \\"People Make the World Go Round\\" was the 45-rpm version, not the six-plus minute track found on \\"The Original Debut Album\\", the version I often heard in the evenings on soul stations. Although the latter half of the LP version is all instrumental, it highlights the lush orchestration found in those 1970's Philly Sound tracks. The problem with most \\"Best of\\" albums is that they cater to the casual listener, not a true fan. Especially the case w/old school soul. Spend the extra money and buy the full-length versions of the individual songs as singles, or the original album. No need to buy the short versions anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed a Replacement","review":"My original one disapeared and found a good / great condition disk to replace my missing one - Glad I found one cause I missed this oldie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched CD","review":"Bought product a few months ago.

I was completely disappointed! Worked OK for a day or two but then the nylon grinder does not hold up to sea salt crystals. I know salt eats steel but they could use stainless steel and have two GREAT products, not just one."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work","review":"I don't know if the mill I bought is defective or if it simply doesn't work, but the salt comes out at such a tryingly slow rate that I've stopped using it. Turning the grind adjust doesn't change the situation. Seeing as how it costs a great deal of money I was expecting the Rolls Royce of salt grinders, but this is not even a bike with training wheels. On the other hand, I also have the companion pepper mill which works to a tee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best salt grinder we've used","review":"Tried several \\"high quality\\" salt grinders and this one's the winner.

Two songs were recorded just for this CD. They are John Mellencamp's Teddi's Song and Aretha's Joy to the World. U2's New Year's Day is on here too, and you don't hear them on a lot of Christmas CDs. Wynton Marsalis does a nice instrumental of Let it Snow and Aaron Neville's Bells of St. Mary's is good also.There are some familiar tunes. Bruce's Santa Claus is Coming To Town, The Eagles' Come Home For Christmas and Elton's Step Into Christmas are all holiday standards. I have this CD in my house somewhere.

Sadly, if I hadn't been spending the weekend at an isolated cabin with nothing else to read, I wouldn't have finished this book. I didn't learn anything about the fashion industry.

Don't Bother with this Book (or author?)","review":"Every seam between every sentence in this book shows. They are grammatically correct, but that's about it. The plot line is interesting but the book is so badly written, analysis of it helps suggests what good novel writing might be about.For example of excellent early efforts, see Laurell Hamilton's \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" or Brian Haig's \\"Secret Sanction\\". Hamilton writes fantasy/horror/gore (ordinarily I loath that stuff), while Haig writes thrillers, so they may not appeal to fashionistas.Haig really improves his series, especially given he deals, even peripherally, with larger political issues. Gotta love his wise-cracking alter ego, Sean Drummond, \\"The meal was an Army MRE -- Meal, Ready-to-Eat -- proof that the army has a sense of humor, despite what you hear.

It will not hold a charge anymore. You can plug it in to have it say it's charging, let the light turn green (which means it's fully charged), then you unplug the chord and the controller dies instantaneously.I don't recommend this product to anyone.It's more inconvenient but you're much better off with rechargeable AA batteries, they'll at least last you for more than a few months.

You need to have the chargeable pack installed first or the Double A pack installed.

This creates a steady hum from the xbox 360 unit fan (even when the xbox 360 is off) and is only avoidable if you unplug the usb from the xbox 360 (which can become a pain).This however I would recommend to get, but if you're conscious about getting the most out of your xbox 360, I'd recommend unplugging the USB when not using the plug and play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monopoly","review":"Microsoft has the worst batteries of all time and there controllers kill off reg recharables idle there zune 64gb hd charging off usb on my pc it got really hot and then poof it was dead forever same goes for there controller batteries"},{"rating":"1","title":"didnt work","review":"the play and charge kit didint work wouldnt charge and it wasnt the xbox look like new but sure didnt work as one."},{"rating":"1","title":"gives me trouble","review":"The cord started working for a little while and at some point in time it decides to only work when the cord it place in a specific way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not a genuine Microsoft Charger","review":"I should have known from the beginning this wouldn't be a genuine Microsoft product, but I decided to give it a shot anyway.

Most of the production comes from Rick Rock who lay down some tight beats. Also E-A Ski has a couple. The album is just about Smokin', Drinkin', and Havin' Fun. If your a West Coast Fan, add this to your collection. It may not be the best album, but it satisfies.

They arrived within 5 days because I use Amazon Prime. We received many compliments on the story board. We understand that seeing themselves with Bill enjoying life helped them work through their grief. Thank you Performance +"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible book","review":"Have read many RS books. This guy used mostly secondary resources. Very disappointed. All over tone of the book, he's definitely NOT enamored of his subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"some insight","review":"I was required to buy this book for a musicology class focusing on the Rolling Stones at Boston University. We were asked to read pretty much the entire book as supplemental reading along with the class. I like the way the book chronicles the events and feelings of the band throughout their gargantuan career however there are a few things I could have done without. I love the music but the rambling way that Davis describes each album when they released them is not really an easy read. I think that if he had somehow devised a different writing style for these crucial descriptions I would have given the book a full five stars. Nevertheless, its a good read whether you are or are not interested in the Rolling Stones and the pictures are also interesting. Its a good history."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"The early reviews are overly tough, and I'll admit perhaps I'm being too liberal in my praise, but I'm sincere. At the risk of sounding uncool, I have to admit that I found this book impossible to put down. I like the readability - it's got much better flow than most rock histories. Maybe the facts are off, maybe we can take umbrage at the author's concepts, but this is the case with all star biographies (unless we're dealing with a boring star). The fact remains that I missed out on sleep for many nights because I didn't want to stop reading this, and while that doesn't absolutely mean it's a *good* book, it does speak for the book's draw. It's magnetic. While you're reading the book, take a gander at the 2000 DVD reissue of Gimme Shelter if you can - they are good companion pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sympathy for the drivel","review":"One wishes, after 40 years, the Stones would rate a serious history by someone who appreciates what has been a remarkable career. Certainly those of us who are more than casual fans know the true warts in the history. All of which makes this compilation of thrice told tabloid warts all the more distressing. A cut and paste history, poorly told -- not because some of the bad stuff doesn't have some basis in truth, but because most of it is comprised of hoary press legends without any scholarship or understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old God and Stones are comprehensive","review":"A generally well-written and reasonably (2002) up-to-date volume with minor errors here and there.

There's a lot of great things about this book, and a lot of beautiful drawings. If you want to learn to draw good, cartoony action figures, then this is the book for you. It is so much better than any other cartoon or comic book anatomy books on the market, that is isn't even funny.

There are a lot of basic methods that really boost your style, such as using body structure to portray personality, etc.I don't think this is a book for total beginners or someone who doesn't know at least a little bit about anatomy and structure, but the language of the book is easy to follow and very informative.Even more experienced artists can learn something from Mr. Caldwell.

The nylon is drippy after, and it doesn't look professional (I clean tanks.) While this Lee's Cleaning Claw doesn't keep small fry from getting in like the nylon stocking, it does keep regular fish from getting in and looks more professional. It also aerates the returning water a bit more when refilling the tank.As a gravel cleaning attachment, I don't get good results with either a deep bed of Flourish or a thin bed of regular gravel, so I continue to use the tube uncovered.

I have other insulated cups with metal interiors - they work great, but leave an awful metallic taste in my mouth. The MiGO cups are plastic through and through (something I did not see in the description) and work better at keeping my coffee warm than regular ceramic cups (but do not work quite as well as metal insulated cups). They are dishwasher safe and have a lifetime guarantee.I had to adjust the top rack of my dishwasher down to the lowest setting to fit the tall MiGo cup, and that's why I gave it 4 stars out of 5.

These work great in rocky terrains and you can typically just find a rock in the area, and hammer them in. I will note that the top notched area is known to break but it's a small price to pay for having nice stakes in general. They are $2.00 a piece and if you can get a few trips out of them they pay for themselves.One more thing to note, once you have them in the ground often times it's very difficult to remove the stakes, good thing MSR puts the little ropes on the end so you can just pull them out vs digging them out.10/10 rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"foot rippers","review":"The stakes are strong and light, but they have one flaw which is a problem on trips that aren't very cold. The end of the stake that pokes up out of the ground is very sharp, and if you kick it in the dark wearing sandals or barefoot, it will hurt and can really rip away a piece of flesh. This can be a big problem in the back country. It's happened to us! If you're going someplace where for sure there will be no bare feet near the tents, these stakes are great.

More often than not, he tells you about the characters, their traits, and their motives rather than showing them to you. The result is that the text has a forced perspective, like propaganda. He uses anachronistic \\"therapy speak\\" for emotions (\\"your behavior is unhealthy and destructive\\") and has a habit for making all eight main characters to agree en masse (count the times he starts a sentence with the word \\"everyone,\\" \\"immediately\\" or \\"of course.\\" These things may seem petty but they really got on my nerves.

You can buy his CDs from there, or his registered stockist which is Gemini Sun Records in the USA, rather than receive a bad copy from a seller on here.As yet, it seems Amazon will keep on allowing certain sellers to continue with their dud copies because only the artist or a representative that can sign for them is allowed to make a complaint about pirating their CD's which is totally unfair when the artist lives far away and does not speak our language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific tale of tetrapods","review":"If you're a novice when it come to tetrapod evolution you'll love this read.

New fossils are being discovered in the emergence of whales from Mesonychids; limb to fin. Yes it's been an eventful eleven years in understanding the evolution of tetrapods, but for me the clearest presentation of the story of fin to limb and back is still a reread of \\"At the Water's Edge\\".

However, this is all made up for with, you guessed it, FLO MOUNIER, drum machine! Get a load of those blastbeats. You only wished you could drum like that. The guitar work is just outstanding as well. Hard to keep up with, isn't it?This, IMO, is their best album. However, I didn't feel that way months ago. Months ago, I liked \\"Whisper Supremacy\\" the best, with Mike DeSalvo's more clean vocals, and the track \\"White Worms\\". I automatically changed my mind after listening to \\"Slit Your Guts\\" on \\"None So Vile\\".

The photography is beautiful, as are the lush and exotic locations. This is a story of a mature woman remembering her first love, as her niece is visiting with her. It is told in flashbacks. I really don't know if the story is confusing because of the script, or because silent scenes are so long you fall asleep in between them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This is a good CD because all of his hit songs are on 1 cd.

It's like everytime he comes out with a new cd it just get's better and better. I think that all of his cd's are just wonderful. I love the way that he put some of his old songs from his prior cd's in this one. His work is fabulous in every aspect. I am just waiting for the one for March 25, 2003 to come out so that I can add that one to the collection as well. I would like to take this opportunity to compliment Mr. Mcknight on all of his music.

I had never heard of him before except from my firends who like \\"Pure\\" Cajun music. (Whatever THAT is). They thought that his style was less than wonderful. Well now, that is simply a matter of opinion, eh? He is credited, mostly by himself, for having created this style of Zydecajun music. The best description seems to be that he crosses some bluesy and latin influences with the more traditional Cajun sounds and beats. The combination is fantastic to dance to, and great fun! Besides his own pure joy and talent, the additional musicians on this CD make the price of purchase well worth it. Rather than fault him for recording \\"One scotch, one burbon, one beer\\", I'd say that this cut alone is worth the cost of the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"WATCH THE EXTRAS FIRST!","review":"Unless you are already familiar with this film's history and backstory, I would suggest you watch the extra featurette \\"Secrets De Tournage\\" included on the disc before watching the actual film. Watching the film first without this information will be a bit confusing if you do not already know the history between the director and the film's \\"missing\\" actor, Johan.A great period piece that was way ahead of its time. In FRENCH with English Subtitles, but that does not get in the way of enjoying this retro cinematic experience. Explicit in spots but done so more to show DESIRE rather than just a sex act."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johan","review":"an excellent movie or documentary ?? not sure. the extras are justabout better than the movie . this was more of a search for someone toplay johan, than a record of his love for johan.as always, the french really know how to make a movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting, but not to die for","review":"I whs hoping for something more interesting.

Secondly, it's almost a note for note copy of the album versions -- albeit on cheaper equipment and/or with less skill at using it -- right down to the opening laughter of Roxanne. No originality in re-interpreting songs. I anticipated something like the \\"Reggatta Mondatta\\" albums. The 1 star is for the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exact REPLICA of the Police sound!","review":"I could not believe how much this tribute to the Police, sounds EXACTLY like the Police, instrumental and vocally!!!!

This album might be the closest you will ever get to hearing a group that sounds exactly like the Police.

The rubbery material tends to collect all sorts of dust and lint. It's very hard to get it off (unless you wash it with water or use tape to peel it off). The protective cover doesn't fit around the screen too well. Mine tends to be stretched out a little more on the left side than on the right (even if I try and reposition the unit itself). The plastic screen cover (that can be removed) was already scratched due to the way it is packaged. All in all, I am pretty disappointed... mainly because I paid over $33 for it.

The volumn is a little bit lower than when playing CD, but it's understandable due to the way it works. No humming sounds. Compare with CD sounds, I couldn't tell the difference. Maybe it's because of the not-so-sophisticated sound system in my two cars. I did some research and finally picked this one.Ordered on weekends and got it on Wednesday.

Their music is rich, artistic and intelligent in a sort of nihilistic disco where someone set the drum machine on fire and replaced them with an actual artist. They don't always get it right - but this is as wrong as it gets. This really is a travesty. Remarkably bad. Whomever remixed these songs took every tasty bit out of the music and paved it over with rotting, festering. predictable vomit. Do your self a favor - buy something else.

It is cheaply produced and repeats the same song \\"go chicken fat go\\" over and over again. This may appeal to 2-3 year olds but for older kids it is a bore. I would say they may get a total of 5-10 minutes of exercise out of it...lots of introductions and background to the phrase \\"chicken fat\\" upfront. And you'd be better off just doing jumping jacks, sit ups, push ups and running/walking in place 20 times each to your kids' favorite cds. The male leader looks like a leftover fitness man from the 70s. His shorts are too short and his hair is too slick. I also got Richard Simmons (Sweatin' with the Oldies)for my 9 year old daughter. Unfortunately, the movements are a little too much too fast for her, but at least it is better produced and thought out. She would much rather try to keep up with Richard than to move too slowly and like a robot to Chicken Fat. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Video","review":"I really love this video. It really has it all; a great song to sing along to,great exercises and is so much fun.

The children love it. I have used this video with my daycare and with my grandkids, and they are up exercising everytime. They do marching, jumping jacks, situps, arm circles, pushups, waistbends, etc... It's old fashioned, but well worth the money. Did I say they love the song too. Great for children ages 18 months to about 8 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"My children (ages 5 and 8) found nothing worthwhile in this video.

My 3-year-old watches half of it, then starts following along. They do prefer the \\"Fit 4 Kids\\" video, though, or even my \\"Walk Away the Pounds\\" DVD's. I have to wonder, too, if the makers assumed that moms were watching the video with the kids; I'd swear the guy in the movie stuffs his shorts, and it's very distracting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money and time.","review":"This video is just calisthenics.

It says its for 2-12 year olds, but of my 2, 8, and 11 year old sons, only my 2 year old finished it, the other two went to their rooms bored.

The majority of this book discusses how people are divided into three types - visual, auditory or kinesthetic - and how to appeal to or persuade to them accordingly given the language they understand. While \\"see the world through your negotiating partner's eyes\\" is a good concept to know, this book makes far-encompassing claims in unrealistic, idealistic scenarios, does not back up those claims with data, and assumes a stance of \\"this is all you need to know to work magic in a negotiating situation or to get someone to really love you instantly based on communication.I hear Brooks is a communication scientist; I very much hope that his other books contain science to back themselves up, because this one sure doesn't. With some data, I would be more inclined to accept these far-reaching theories as credible - but only slightly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book On Relationships","review":"This book, written by a neuropsychologist, is just what you want when your life needs some assistance.

My wife and I avoided divorce because of Dr. Brooks' book, and I strongly recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instantly getting someone to like you","review":"This book on tape was incredibly brief and I have already forgotten a lot about it. It went on talking about visual people and other kinds of people and then drawing from there in order to find how can we make someone connect with us. It does not take a rocket science to reproduce their analysis, but then why should you care to produce an 'instant' connection. Many times, it takes some time to like a person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like an infomercial","review":"This having been my first look at NLP, I can not comment on how this book compares to others in the field. The one thing that struck me over and over again is that the book could be reduced down to a pamphlet of 20 pages if you took out the success stories, restatements of previously covered material, and enthusiastic assurances that you'll wield the most powerful force on the planet as soon as you finish the next chapter. This book left me wanting more information, and an feeling like even this short book should have provided it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"For all the endorsements, you think there'd be more material than \\"here are some good ideas on how to listen and communicate with others\\". I was disappointed with this book. The author spends a lot of time trying to classify people into 3 different categories, and then trys to define how you can communicate with each category. He provides no DATA on to support this categorization, just \\"hey this seems like a good idea\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Author needs to read his own book","review":"Did anyone else read about Mr. Brooks saying \\"Who the f--- do you think you are?\\" to a flight attendant in an altercation that resulted in the plane having to make an unscheduled landing?

It doesn't give any real solid ways to help improve communication, and it's not even interesting to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Bunch of Copied Tricks","review":"Believe it or not : the first half of the book deals with \\"representational systems\\" alone. The next half elaborates on \\"strategies\\". In every chapter the author promises you heaven and ultimately dishes out a picture of it! The author just seemed to read Tony Robbins' \\"Unlimited Power\\" and copied its contents. I would rather recommend \\"Unlimited Power\\". Atleast Tony appears sincere! Defintely not for anyone with atleast some knowledge of NLP. For beginners : Go through some of the articles online about NLP (Those by Robert Dilts', for example. You will get much better information that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad; reads like an infomercial","review":"Just like the reader from San Diego, I thought this book could have been written in a 20 page pamphlet. And unlike the reader from San Diego, this is not my first NLP book. I have read severals and found this book to be a simple rehash of the deeper stuff on NLP. It seem like Mr. Brooks was trying to stretch representational systems into a book.Nothing too insightful for those who already know NLP, but not a bad starter to get your feet wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this tape.","review":"I was very disappointed with this tape. This tape should contain the same information as the \\"Instant Rapport\\" book. It doesn't. Instead, the tape only covers one aspect of the book's information and is incomplete.While I remain impressed with the information contained in the book, don't waste a penny on the tape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one aspect of rapport covered on the tape.","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer. Forget the audio tape unless you want to be frustrated. I guess I had to learn for myself... The tape takes about 35-45 minutes to explain what a visual, auditory, etc person is like, and is presented in such obvious detail it must have been designed for the second grade level. After a while I found myself wondering if the entire tape was only going to cover the same point, but in the last 5-10 minutes does hit on another point. This is just one aspect of NLP & rapport.

A few months back I needed to rent one for some work I was doing on my basement, breaking up old concrete. After I used it for a couple of days, I went out and bought one for work (I'm a demolition contractor). This is much easier to control than most 60-90lb pneumatic jack hammers. I'm not a very muscular person, but I didn't have any difficulty handling it and it never walked on me. If you need a medium to heavy duty jack hammer, I'd recommend purchasing or renting this over most pneumatic hammers because it's easy to use, it's reliable, the steel bits it uses are widely available and you don't have to lug around a huge compressor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swingin Christmas tunes","review":"We liked MOST of the songs on the CD.

I don't use the Spanish much right now, but it has been a fantastic book for teaching my kids about animals! There is so much variety, so they don't get bored like they do with some other books that have just four or five animals. Both of them can pick out emus, flamingos, starfish, crabs, bison, and a host of other animals that they wouldn't see in most other children's books. It has been great for their creativity too - I have acted out the sound and/or movement for many of these animals, and they, in turn, \\"read\\" the book themselves and act out all of these animal noises and movements!

I had really been looking forward to A Family Daughter but I am just so disappointed! The plot is often ridiculous,and the characters just aren't credible enough to carry the book. Much of it is extremely predictable and reminded me of a soap opera. The dialogue just doesn't make sense. A five year old, for example, can speak in complete sentences in real life. This one, a key character, just keeps saying one word, \\"Dogs!\\" over and over again. I think the difference with this book is that it is completely invented, Half in Love was obviously something she knew from growing up in Montana, and you felt the place and the people resonate through her eyes. This book is just not her best. I am half way through and I can completely understand why other reviewers said they didn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I looked forward to reading A Family Daughter because I thought it would be a continuation of the Santerres family saga.

This book became the 'true' story while the first book became the book that the main character, Abby, wrote. The biggest problem for me was that this 'true' story was far more unbelievable than the first book. While Liars and Saints seemed a bit unreal, this one was totally convuluted. I pushed myself to read the entire thing, but found it hard going. I wanted to see if there was any redeeming qualities to the book, but I found none.

I can find no redemptive value in this book; the characters are not developed, the dialogue feels ridiculous, and situations which require examination, insight, and depth have none. I am having a hard time describing just how bad this book was. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOSERS ALL","review":"This book gets 1 star from me and only because there's nothing less I can give it. \\"A Family Daughter\\" is a total waste of time. The characters are complete and utter LOSERS. They were, like most losers, extremely bored with absolutely everything and that probably had a lot to do with the fact that they were so boring themselves. The characters tried in vain to make themselves interesting by their outlandish behavior, but came off as completely selfish and hopelessly boring. I found absolutely nothing to recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i was disappointed with A Family Daughter!","review":"The reviews on this book were so positive that i was so looking forward to reading A Family Daughter. But, i was nothing short of disappointed... the first half kept me going, but the second half was silly and uninteresting. In a nutshell... don't waste your valuable reading time with this novel- it is sure to be flat and forgettable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Fetched","review":"I finished this book, but only so I could move on to another. While I like the author's prose, I found the story line to be a bit far fetched, and predictable. There's better fiction out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I rarely give up halfway through a book, but...","review":"The author sets up a somewhat interesting universe and sketches out some nice basic story ideas and characters, but then fails to ever mention them again or develop any of them in any way. Gay sci-fi is definitely somewhat of a specialty niche, so I'm more than willing to make allowances, but this book was simply one erotic encounter after another with no regard to establishing any kind of overarching story or theme. Don't get me wrong, even that might not have been so bad if it weren't for the obnoxious and arrogant way the main character is written. You're more likely to want to slap him than sleep with him. If you're a misanthropic, gay, IT geek with a chip on your shoulder, you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, I'd get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last 5 minutes","review":"First of all, this does not hang over a door, it is a flimsy wire bracket that is supposed to hang on the edge of the door frame that has no door in it. It took my cat nothing to pull it down. So, I decided to wedge it in a door from on top and close the door on the wire. I walked away after watching th cat play for a while and the next thing I know, he came to me with the furry critter in his mouth as if he had caught a prize. He snapped the toy right off the elastic. What I can say is that if it had been better made, I am sure he would have loved it. He still pranced around with the critter even though the hanging pieces have been long thrown out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Same","review":"I've ordered this before and it came with gray legs and my cats adored it! They would play with it and try to run away with it. Eventually they tore the legs off it but it took months for that to happen and they still like to bat the body around. I ordered 2 replacements and they are not the same. The body is all black and my kitties ripped the legs in 10 minutes on the first one and tore the body completely off the cord in an hour with the second one. I don't know what they changed but please change it back! I have to find my boys a new favorite toy. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy toys on a string! Very Dangerous!","review":"I am about to leave a negative feedback for all of the stringy toys out there! It is very dangerous! My kitten almost got choked because the string got tangled around his neck! If I wasn't home, he would've choked for sure! Either watch closely when cat is playing or cut the string off ( I threw the string part right there and then) the kitty will play with the toy itself! Because it is a string it will tighten itself and the more kitten is struggling to get out the more pressure it is placing on a part that is tangled! Please spare your kitty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love this line, this design is not good","review":"I love this product, but this particular one (The Octopus) is very flimsy and poorly made.

As you know a wrench set without the 1/2 wrench is almost worthless. Trying to figure out (for an older guy) how to navigate the return process is like trying to castrate a pig, not easy!I would keep the set if it had the 1/2 inch, but I have no idea how to get the wrench without returning the whole set and starting over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality","review":"Really excellent quality for being made in China.

Very happy with purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to read the Afterword? Don't buy Kindle version!","review":"After reading the review of this book, I decided to buy, especially since Grealy's friend, Ann Patchett, wrote the afterword and is one of my favorite authors. Since I don't have much on my Kindle right now, I chose the Kindle version. Lo and behold -- the afterword is not included in the Kindle version. Now that I look back and see the ever-so-slight different in advertising, I see that the paperback version mentions the afterword where the Kindle version does not, but most readers aren't going to see that difference. I'm an editor, and I didn't. BIG FAIL, Amazon. If there's going to be a dramatic difference between the Kindle version and the paperback, you should tell readers. I would have gladly paid 46 cents more and waited two days for the paperback, had I known. It's bad enough to put up with all the typos in the Kindle versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding for the Young","review":"I am twelve. We had to read an autobiography for an assignment in literature, I don't like that kind of book. When I emersed myself in this book I never imagined I wouldn't come up for air. I guess, as a twelve year old, I never understood the effects and after effects of camcer. I thought I would just read it and do the report. But I did not expect to finish the book and to look around a different way. I hope that I don't forget the lessons sealed inside this book, and that through my adolescents I realize beauty isn't everything. I recomend this book for older readers, it was easy to read but tough to understand. Though my understanding reached further than I ever thought possible. Read this Please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best true story I've ever read","review":"I think about this book nearly every day, even though I read it several years ago. It has had a profound impact on my own life. It is a real-life story about a young girl growing up with jaw bone cancer and having to live with multiple surgeries and radiation to try to rid her jaw of cancer. During and after the disfiguring surgeries and radiation, she has difficulties adjusting to society's taunts and stares, beginning with her schoolmates and continuing with adults. There is no ugly duckling to beautiful swan transformation. It's just one girl trying to survive cancer and make it through a difficult life in this beauty obsessed world. This book is a must read for anyone who feels that their appearance makes them unacceptable. It is a story of great personal fortitude coming from a little girl whose family just isn't capable of dealing with the cancer and the emotional pain she must endure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful child","review":"I liked this book very much, it was hard to read about Lucy. I knew her when she was a beautiful little girl. She would come into the Spring Valley Library with her twin sister. One day I told her she had ink marks on her face and she told me that was for the radiation. She went to school with my kids but they never said anything unkind about her, and years later I saw her on the street, terriblydeformed on her face. It is a very sad end for a very brave girl who didnt deserve the hand she was dealt. Read the book and rejoice in your better luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad story.........","review":"This is a very sad compelling story. It is unimaginable what this young girl went through for so many years and how she was treated by those around her. This would be a great book for high school reading - to raise empathy in everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grealy's memoir is exquisite.","review":"I am reviewing a book, not a person, not what happened to this dear, tragic, fellow human being. I believe Lucy (and no, I did not know her personally) would want me and other reviewers to review her story and her words. Like Van Gogh, people cannot always separate the work from its tortured artist's soul. And yet, does the work not deserve to be seen and appreciated? Grealy's phenomenal memoir, Autobiography of a Face is not easy to read. It is never easy to read the tragedies of a child and honest, heartbreaking words. Her story evokes much, much more than sympathy. Her prose is no less than exquisite. Not all of us read to simply be entertained. This tender book is much more than that and has something very important to teach us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is a great book for anyone who has struggled with their appearance in a world full of beautiful people. A must-read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"selfish girl","review":"As seen in Truth & Beauty by Ann Patchett, Lucy Grealy is a selfish spoiled girl. Her main concern in this book is not how to live with the disfigurement from cancer, but how to make people do things to make her happy. She learns to work the system to get what she wants. There's no great introspection in her story. She has no startling insights about life. She just goes along from surgery to surgery begging for attention and love while not giving anything back to others. The most interesting thing in the book was the mention of early drug abuse with painkillers from surgery and how she dismissed it as nothing important.And I also noticed how she never mentioned Ann Patchett in this book. If Ann was such a wonderful friend and the only person to understand Lucy, why did she not appear in this story? Many other people are included, from her first lover to her horse's caretaker. It's fascinating to see how life and memories are rewritten after the fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I felt sorry for Lucy but she made it and atleast she had a loving family and money for the costly operations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Story","review":"Lucy's story is a compelling one. Being faced with cancer at a young age is difficult. Being subjected to the treatments is difficult. Adding to that having your face changed in that manner and being able to work through it was a remarkable feat and took strength.It is a book that helps put many things in our life in perspective in both what we think are events and circumstances that are \\"too much\\" to handle when on reflection they are well within being nothing more than a minor annoyance and how we relate to and judge others. It also shows how strong people can be.The descriptions of what she went through and had to endure are detailed and disturbing and at times extremely unsettling. It still winds up as ultimately being a postive book, albeit sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational, indeed","review":"Lucy's story, itself, is not only inspirational but it is also beautifully written...the language lyrical, quiet, insightful, touching...It is so unfortunate that given Lucy's triumphs and accomplishments over her illness, she would be gone at such an early age, depriving us all of the lovely stories that could have been.A great writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Autobiography of a Face was brilliantly written.","review":"I loved this book and it would be my first recommendation to anyone. The straightforward, blunt approach to writing makes the book and emotional stimulant. The trial and turmoil Lucy Grealy endures makes you appreciate your life, no matter how bad you think it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Lucy Grealy.","review":"I would recommend this book to every young adult. I found this book to be extremely emotional. Lucy Grealy's true life story taught me a lesson about life. I found sharing one's most difficult and unforgettable life's experience with an unknown audience to be both heroic and educational. I wish everyone could read this book before they were born, so that we all could understand that our hearts are but our faces."},{"rating":"1","title":"tell me something i didnt learn in chapter 1","review":"While Grealy showed superior grammar and vocabulary in this book, she lacked a positive attitude. I found this book extremely sorrowful and drowning in self-pity. I dont mean to sound harsh, and I am very grateful that I have not contracted this disease, but I found it rather pig-headed of her to write with such detail about her appearance when she had a 5% chance of living with this disease- and she lived. I took no pleasure in reading something 240 pages long that talked only about how ugly she was and how terrible her life was, because in all honesty, things could have been a lot worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"The demise of the English language","review":"This book is fantastic. It is dark and real, raw and breathtaking. However, the Kindle version of it is so riddled with spelling and grammatical errors I could not finish reading it. This is what happens to the publishing industry when they lay off all of their editors."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems odd","review":"i found the book very well written, but very, very sad. it seemed weird to me, when searching through the reviews, that most everyone discusses her as if she's alive, unfortunately she no longer is. i feel that that part is inextricable from the rest of the story and its message. this is not a story about a woman who overcame cancer and her feelings of insecurities, it is a story of a person who, after undergoing grueling treatments may have conquered the physical illness, but never its emotional consequences.it garnered a lot of sympathy and empathy from me.i felt so sad for her and wished that she had joined support groups, seen a good therapist, and had had a better support system to start out with.shame that the world has lost her."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone who has ever felt ugly.","review":"I, like most other American women, have a constant shadow over myself that I'm not pretty enough and as a result, not good enough. I have some mild disfigurements, though none of the kind that Ms. Grealy expresses. Lucy put these feelings I have had for so long into words I've never been able to put together myself. Her points of view on love, sex, and body image should be read by anyone who has ever felt anything less than beautiful. Reading a stranger's words on paper as if they are your own is better than the most supportive friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album in two halves","review":"There's a lot to like about this album. Ryan Adams' voice is quite appealing, except when he's doing the rock star thing, though it's not that distinctive. There aren't any bad songs. Some are better than others though: \\"I See Monsters\\" is especially unusual and interesting and has one of the more interesting arrangements. The first five songs are quite similar, jangly, mildly raucous affairs, but from track six on, the pace slows and the songs improve, or at least they become more tuneful and varied in construction. \\"Wonderwall\\" is a sparse, acoustic track - a standout track. The others are all pretty good too, yet I feel I should like them more than I actually do. Not sure why. There's something about Ryan Adams that I don't get. I think it's the man himself: I've no idea about who he is, and his personality doesn't seem to come through the music. Maybe I need to listen longer. Well, it would be no hardship."},{"rating":"2","title":"One \\"Hell\\" Of An Album","review":"Although not the first time hearing Adams' music, \\"Love Is Hell\\" was the first album I had the chance to listen to from start to finish (albeit in Parts 1 and 2). A thread of sadness is woven throughout every song, and the music and stories are captivating. \\"Shadowlands\\" is probably the strongest track, a beautiful yet haunting piano song featuring escalating musical accompanyment. \\"World War 24\\" and \\"City Rain, City Streets\\" are melodious tracks that give blatant nods to Morrissey and The Smiths. \\"Afraid Not Scared\\" sounds a little like Radiohead, while \\"Wonderwall\\" is a unique, acoustic interpretation of the Oasis classic. \\"Please Do Not Let Me Go\\" is my personal favorite, a sad track that harkens back to Adams' alt-country roots. Overall, this is a well-rounded album, and Ryan Adams fans alike should still feel right at home after giving this record a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Had no idea who Ryan Adams was until I listened to some samples. This is a fantastic CD (I have the combined 16 track version). I bought Rock and Roll also, but find myself listening to this one constantly. Tracks 2, 3, 7 are favs, and I like the version of \\"Anybody Wanna Take Me Home\\" on this CD much better (its looser, but far more emotional).I went back and checked out some of his Whiskeytown efforts. For the people who say he was great then and is *&^% now, get a grip. This album is far better than anything Whiskeytown did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now was that so hard.","review":"God, record labels can be asses! This is how it was originally concieved, but ofcourse everyone now knows the story about this. Beautiful album, probably his best stuff, and one of my favorite albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the music that counts not the record company","review":"Fantastic progression after the stunning Gold. The music industry is littered with record companies passing on or poorly supporting great and different material. Ryan wanted this released as one disk - cannot blame him for that; there is no trick to encourage purchasers of the EPs to but it again. The songs are great - except for a couple of average tracks. 'Chelsea Nights' is stirring and 'House is not for Sale' is simple and forceful - would have been a good ending song for Eastwood's 'Mystic River' - for it has the same feeling and both remain buried in your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a \\"Heartbreaker\\"","review":"But not quite. But this is his finest work since his first solo record. A fairly sparse and moody album. At first listen I thought the songs sounded dull, but I just wasn't in the right mood at the time for slower songs. Repeated listens have revealed the near masterpiece to me. I give the album 4.5 stars and would round up to 5, but the stupid label made me buy this as 2 EPs last year. With my new burner and the song off of Rock 'N' Roll, I made my own. But minus one star for jerking the fans around like that. If you can't make your own, get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Albums Of The Past 50 Years!","review":"Read it loud and clear! This album is one of the finest musical works to emerge since the advent of rock and roll music. Bare, yet somehow full; pensive, yet uplifting, \\"Love Is Hell\\" is the seminal pop record of the 21st century. Forget Outkast, forget Justin Timberlake, and forget even Radiohead, Dave Matthews, and Wilco.Ryan Adams has created a masterpiece which tells the bleak tale of winter spent in a bitter-cold New York city. Songs like 'Political Scientist,' and the McCartney-esque 'Thank You Louise,' play emotional head games with the listener as each builds up to a peak then, like the characters in each song, lets you down--hard.I can't think of any other album like \\"Love Is Hell,\\" simply because Adams has managed to craft something truly one-of-a-kind.I can't wait to see how he follows it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter music fan","review":"I've been a fan of Ryan Adams because of Whiskeytown but hadn't bought his solo stuff until the Love Is Hell EPs. Now his label gives the finger to fans by combining the EPs into an LP with a bonus track. That's crap. Although I'm morally opposed to burning CDs, I also hold grudges. So, from now on, any CDs I want from Ryan Adams or Lost Highway, I'm burning them, not buying them. I encourage everyone else to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Payback Is Hell, Parts 1 and 2","review":"Leaving the manipulative gestures up to his record company (again), Ryan Adams croons his way through a so-so collection of forgettable post-\\"Gold\\" schmaltz, from which I can hear a glimmer of the genius he once believed himself to be, and apparently believed all too well. Monumental, crushing ego mixes with a desperately nasty record company like gas & fire, and I ain't buyin' it. Lost Highway, \\"Where Artists Go to Die\\", and its overinflated roster of has-beens, can kiss my grits."},{"rating":"1","title":"he freaked out","review":"Ryan's first two albums were so special. Really amazing 5 star affairs. And then his fame and fortune and all the press and Jack White squabbles got to him and he just freaked. He has destroyed what was a brilliant start. Still, I think he can come back, he just needs to go back to where he started and write sincere thoughtful songs and use his talent. And he really needs to stop talking to the press and saying things that make him look like a you know what.I am still rooting for him because he has written some of the best songs of the last 10 years....hands down. I hope he comes through with the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Tasteless!!!!!","review":"I grew up listening to TLC in junior high and high school. I love that group!

Boy, I wasn't even close! I couldn't believe my ears! This is an insult! The singing by this group was horrendous!

The team has basically raised GoW to a whole bigger level. The graphics, for the PS2, are amazing. I would highly suggest getting some component cables to view this game in all its glory with the progressive scan turned on. Everything is left intact and improved upon. The brutality is there, the excellent voice acting, the new combat moves. The levels are huge and very well detailed. For the story, Kratos is basically pissed off at every divine power of Olympus and sides with some rather big allies. The ending only leaves it open to a sequel, which I am eagerly anticipating.

It has an interesting story with great scenes. Despite it being on the PS2, it plays great on the PS3, cutting the load times, etc. And for a PS2 game, it has spectacular views, effects, etc.The game is a mix of battles, puzzles, and mini-games. It is challenging trying to figure out the problem, or trying to get special items. To take down certain enemies it sometimes utilizes a mini-game to accomplish the feat.Only seldom is the lack of camera control a problem. Mostly this occurs when a large enemy blocks your view of Kratos, making it hard to see what you're doing.There are many different elements to this game, making it very enjoyable for repeat plays.

A pity about the American spellings though, being a British marque, and colour photos would have enhanced the book - but probably would have made it more expensive. The authoritative pocket history of each subject appended to the photographs adds considerable interest to the illustrations. My main reason for purchasing the volume is that I am the owner of a 1949 MG YA which I've recently restored. A few more pictures of the Y-type would have been appreciated as it probably has the highest survivor rate of all traditionally-styled MG saloons.A nice addition to any enthusiast's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big \\"E\\" speaks out!","review":"Really Great Scott, The tunes on this CD are just truly fantastic.

I was reading along when suddenly I found I was at the end. I quickly realized that I HAD TO find out what happened next...... so thanks to the way the Kindle is set up there it was..... a suggestion to download other books by this author..... but more important.... there it was the second in the Legion series...... touched on it and downloaded it and seconds later I was back into the world of a Roman Legion.....The characters in this book are very well done.

Have mercy!!","review":"Honestly, I really tried to enjoy Scarrow's books, as I read all the works of historical fiction that's out there. But the Eagle series is just so utterly boring, an insult to the reader's intelligence. There is absolutely no historical detail at all. The characters are straight from Asterix the Gaul. I'm ahead of the reviews, because I've read the third book -not because I enjoy it, I reveiw historical fiction for a book store- and it's just as bland. It's a travesty to read the reviews Scarrow gets, when there is so much more better works out there. Attractive cover art is an enormous facter in book marketing. This whole series is a skeleton surrounded by an Armani suit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This book is bad. After reading well-developed stories about the ancient world written by Bernard Cornwell, Pressfield, Paxson, Whyte, it is impossible to accept this forced story.

It was anything but. My first warning sign should have been \\"a novel in the tradition of Vince Flynn.\\" I don't like Mr. Flynn's work and Mr. Ellis follows in the tradition of overblown plots, fairly weak dialogue, and no character development. This might work for a major motion picture, but for 400 pages it is absurd. There is little to like in the characters, but then again we don't get to know them at all. The story flies along in short bits and nothing seems real. A media consultant hero is a stretch to begin with, but who knows it might have worked. Instead, we get absurd ideas, weak characters, and convoluted stories. Yikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 99 cents","review":"This is one of the worst books I've read. Despite several murders, it's utter devoid of suspense, drama, or interesting characters. The author tells you who the killer is early in the book, and then has him go around shooting various people, but since they are cardboard characters, you don't care as the body count rises. What's more, it was incredibly obvious what the one \\"secret\\" in the book was. My advice--don't waste your money or time on this NON-thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A window into the real politics of Washington","review":"Robert Ellis's first novel is a wide open window into the inner workings of the political machine wrapped around a taut tale of murder, double crosses, and sex. From the Capitol to the monuments to the slums, Ellis shines a light into every corner of the campaign machine. It's obvious from his narrative that Ellis has spent his time in the trenches and he brings a strong realism to every page. Toss in a hit man bent on self improvement with a destroyed candidate bent on revenge, mix well with a Senator's wife who will do anything to win and you have the basis for a great story of politics in our time. Everyone wants to move to the top. Forget Monica, there are far worse doings in Access to Power. Ellis doesn't miss a beat.

I can imagine that many will object that this third installment is a crass commercialization of the glitch genre; but just maybe it is an evolution in form. You'll certainly never hear any of these tracks on your local Clear Channel \\"Urban\\" radio station, so the 'sellout' accusation seems misplaced. If you enjoyed the bracing severity of the first C+C release, you may feel let down by this one.

Sadly the press block inside tends to leak a lot of the garlic juice through the back side so you actually lose a lot of the garlic essence.Even worse is that it's far from air tight so you really can't store garlic in it for any length of time (then again, since it holds so small an amount you end up using it all in one use). Garlic left in it even overnight in the refrigerator will dry out and lose almost all of it's flavor.Lastly, since it leaks you have to take the whole thing apart to clean it. While it's only 4 pieces apart, unwinding the \\"screw\\" on it to clean the back side is rather annoying.It's a neat toy and nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Regretable Purchase","review":"I was so excited to try this product, but my hopes have been crushed.

I have been reading a variety of literature on the topic, and came across Dr. Salter's book. I expected it to be sensationalized and maybe even a little corny, but I was pleasantly surprised. Dr. Salter uses many academic references while she proves facts and debunks popular myths (one of the most famous being that pedophiles were once sexually abused themselves). She is forthcoming about her cynicism and how her work has affected her life negatively. Her down-to-earth writing style drew me in, in spite of the fact that this book is geared towards the layperson, and was not as academic as what I was looking for.

It was a disturbing book on many levels. While it accurately portrayed the darker side of these monsters, it also demonstrated that a clever pedophile can manipulate those around him fairly easy. In short, it showed that these men (the vast majority are men), are good actors. I'd have liked to have seen more on protection against these monsters who are able to slither into lives, into churches, and into homes, but the book was definitely educational.

Unfortunately, her taste for sensationalism trumps logic, scientific method and academic discourse.While no parent including myself would wish to see their children harmed in any way, this book reduces all childhood sexual encounters to being dangerous in the extreme. It avoids the crucial questions surrounding the debate on childhood sexuality and what is truly harmful to children, with the exception of the very rare instances of rape or violence.Therefore this book gets one star, and I would refer anyone who is intelligent, educated and interested in expanding their knowledge of the subject to Judith Levine's work in \\"Harmful to Minors.\\"I would also hope some of the professionals who have reviewed this book would be open minded enough to consider alternate, more academic sources of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a professional's book","review":"As a psychologict, I expected this to be a bit more scholarly, but as the title suggests, it is written for the general public and the protection of their families.

Awkwardly arranged, filled with typos, poorly written (and seemingly not edited at all) and, perhaps worst of all, very narrow minded, this book is a huge disappointment. The authors reveal not only a sensibility so mainstream as to accept poor films because they \\"work,\\" but there is an obvious moral compass applied to their criticism (allusions to sex or any profanity automatically make a film bad).The Svehlas go into ridiculously superfluous detail in delineating the plots of these movies (while giving barely any historical background), then tack on ham handed critiques at the end.

Takes several seconds (on 900MHz P3) between selecting an item and being able to actually drag it across the screen or resize it. The screen doesn't redraw correctly, so sometimes your image is overlaid with other parts of the image, leftover fragments of dialog boxes, or nothing... requiring you to resize a few times to see what your image really looks like. Text editing is buggy, and characters inseerted into the image don't always align with the baseline. Even with the 8.01 bug fixes, it still sometimes loses characters or keeps characters you edited out. Many tools are harder to find than in previous versions.That said, this version does have some powerful features. If they can get the bugs worked out, it could become a good product again.

In my opinion, PSP 8 is the only software the average person would need for photo enhancements and/or web graphics. Most of my use is for enhancing my photos from my 2 digital cameras. This new version makes many of my tasks much easier than before."},{"rating":"1","title":"each version is lower quality than previous","review":"They have no idea about software design.It is jam packed with features few will ever need and fewer still will get to work. Example you could associate PSP with a file extension Ex jpg and click on the file and have it show up in psp. The newer less useful version pops you into a browser with a window full of files almost no one would use, you then have to select the file you clicked on all over again. It had to be designed by a marketing pea brain looking for a big list of features and no concept of usefulness. Features are preventing usability and reliability. Look for earlier versions and buy them instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing easy about it","review":"Don't waste your time with this product or paint shop pro 9.

Strange error messages are shown while working with PSP8 that do not make any sense. Saving GIF files doesn't really work, looks like there are bugs in save routine.

Fortunately, I found a copy of the book at his play group and was able to read it first. Pig Wont is shown bare-bottomed getting a spanking from his father for not listening, is called a \\"Bad Pig!\\" for not following directions, and is treated in a very unsympathetic way. This kind of stern, un-understanding way of disciplining a child is unappealing to me and (I believe) unhelpful for the child. The book came across as very negative to me; instead of focusing on why a child would WANT to behave, it focuses on the bad things that will happen to him if he doesn't. That's not the message I want to send to my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly essential","review":"The album hardly includes the greatest hits from the Atlantic years and from the ABC-Paramount years.

They should have stayed with the Ben Kinglsey character as he hunted down killer after killer...They didn't. Their biggest goof.And the ending? Falls apart--like so many Hollywood serial killer flicks...because they are always trying to cover their sorry behinds by covering all the basis.

Especially Ben Kingsley who does his normal fantastic job of acting. The cinematography needs some work, or perhaps I just did not understand what the director was going for.This dark thriller has Kingsley character as a serial killer, and we see what he goes through before he kills. And he starts sending clues of murders and missing children to a FBI agent who has broken the law apprehending a serial killer; and therefore the killer was set free. And the agent seems to have the same types of headaches as Kingsley character.I found it best to watch this movie without knowing anything about it. Some of these reviews and the cover of the DVD gives too much information away. If you have not read any other reviews on this movie, stop! And go watch it. It will give you a richer viewing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kingsly is ok","review":"Suspect Zero, even with Ben, is still a weak movie. It tries to be cool and gory (kinda like Seven), but it comes off a less than what it wants to be. It's gory and there's a plot line, but the line is a little weak. It eventually goes into the sappy emotional territory and loses its way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pray for the prey!","review":"The agent Thomas Mackelway (Aaron Eckart) who works in Dallas, is called from Albuquerque in order to investigate a set of mysterious murders which seem to be related with an enigmatic Benjamin O' Ryan (Ben Kingsley) who was trained by a special unity of F.B.I. in a secret government program that enables them to telepathically get into the minds of killers. So, the initial clues seem to point him as the main suspect.From his personal operation center, he has designed this agent to follow the traces about what it really happens. Weird visions will take place in Mackelway's mind to find out the true nature of these murders.Prisoner and victim of this experiment, O' Ryan will experience in live flesh, the sequels of such uninterrupted state of psychical tension that will lead this script an unexpected twist of fate.Don't miss this interesting and tense thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish Serial-Killer Movie","review":"I very much enjoyed the stylish way this serial-killer movie was presented. It also gets high points for keeping ones interest all the way.Aaron Eckhart and Ben Kingsley are very good. Kinslgey, unfortunately, doesn't appear until over halfway through but made up for his lack of screen time with an intense performance. He's good at that sort of thing (see \\"Sexy Beast\\" for another recent example.)The story, claimed to be a true one out of U.S. military files, is still a bit \\"suspect\\" to me. Maybe I am bit skeptical about these ESP-type stories which the film world loves to promote. Nonetheless, this is a very interesting film, nicely shot and an underrated one since it never got much publicity.If you like crime movies, this is one to check out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth About This Movie","review":"I stumbled onto this movie over a year ago but could not get the concept behind the film out of my mind. The movie itself is ok a little slow and the acting is just basically ok. But the plot is exciting and that is what keeps you watching. In addition with a child missing every 40 seconds in the Unites State something might be to this plot????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted potential","review":"An FBI agent with a troubled past hunts a serial killer. Or so it seems. An interesting idea an a good cast, Aaron Eckhart, Ben Kingsley and Carrie Anne Moss, are wasted on a boring, uninspired screenplay and unappealing characters. There are only a few interesting scenes with a lot of time in between them. The director has managed to create a dark atmosphere, but it doesn't keep the movie from being boring. It feels much longer than its 99 minute running time. I wanted to like it but I didn't. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original story in classic genre - A good choice","review":"The good guys and girls will like this movie, which is raising its middle finger to all the bad people out there.Flawless acting and superbly eerie music support the story, which starts in a classic way. The tense filming builds on your nerves until you figure out who is doing what to whom. You then get your pom poms out and you root for the hero. You end the movie feeling good in a bittersweet way.The female police partner was too much of an accessory to the hero's emotions, though. This line of acting is cliché and it needs to be modernized. That would be the only flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring ...","review":"A stalwart actor like Ben Kingsley is truly wasted in this movie.Sir Ben Kingsley plays the role of a Benjamin O'Ryan, a clairvoyant undercover out-of-service FBI agent who is following a serial killer across the country. En route, Benjamin uncovers other serial killers using clairvoyance and murders them. Sursprisingly, Benjamin leaves a signature (a zero with a stroke) after every murder. This trait confuses the in-service FBI agents Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart) & his partner (Carrie-Anne Moss) to believe that Benjamin is the actual killer on the prowl. The story meanders along slowly and Mackelway eventually (after getting lots of confusing hints from Benjamin) figures out Benjamin is actually leading them to the killer. Visuals of Benjamin getting clairvoyance are dark and disturbing. The graphic images just add to the darkness.All in all a boring fare that will give you a bad taste.I think actors like Ben Kingsley and Carrie-Anne Moss have been wasted in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most suspense movies of recent times!!!","review":"If I could give this movie 4.5 stars I would. In a day when very few thrillers thrill, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I have been repeatedly let down recently by the \\"thriller\\" label.

[...]","review":"Movies like this absolutely kill me! The story they have to work with is top notch, the cast is terrific, and the movie sucked. The movie is all about tracking down this infamous serial killer with a horrible and gruesome reputation. They don't show what led to this reputation, any of his crimes, or what got them to that point. It's like jumping into a crappy direct to video sequel, after missing the blockbuster film that led to it. Nothing significant ever happens in this movie!

So, when I heard about a movie about a murderer w/ psychic abilities who preys on serial killers, I began drooling immediately! SUSPECT ZERO is an intriguing story w/ some nice twists, shocks, and jaw-yankers. Ben Kingsley (SPECIES, HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG) is very convincing as O'Ryan, the man driven to hunt down the demons in his head. Aaron Eckhart (THE DARK KNIGHT) plays Tom Mackelway, the FBI agent who must find O'Ryan and discover his secrets. If you enjoy dark thrillers w/ a definite paranormal angle, then SZ should make your night! My only complaint is that Carrie-Anne Moss (MATRIX 1-3, MEMENTO, FIDO) had so little to do in her role as Mackelway's partner.

I had heard that this was prevalent so I simply popped it back in and continued. 20 or so moves later all of the sudden 4 or 5 pieces popped out and before I knew it the entire cube was in pieces. I was angry for sure so that night I spent an hour re-assembling the cube. I had successfully done and lubricated the cube so now I could turn it quite nicely. I scrambled and began to solve. This time about 45 moves into it 6 or 7 pieces popped out without warning and the cube was destroyed yet again.

You have to twist back or twist other layers to get it back to work. This cube is NOT recommended for speed cubing.It pops , A LOT. The piece come off all the time. I didn't have one solve where one piece didn't come off.I recommend this cube for beginners. Those who never had any experience with a 4x4.

Amazon has way better 4x4s for way cheaper. This thing locks up so badly that it is almost impossible to solve. It also pops occasionally. I would say this cube is definitely not worth the buy. Shop around on here and find a better one. This is the worst 4x4 on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I recieved this cube quickly and in good shape. After playing with the cube for less than 10 minutes, it broke. Complete Rip-Off.

We have the smaller version of this which is very durable. This one is not. Too much of a hassle and shipping cost to return. Perhaps this item should not be made if it can't hold up to 5 min."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicate fingers, please!","review":"While this is a fun and challenging toy, one must be very careful not to twist even a little too hard. My six year old twisted it just a little and ended up breaking it. My husband had to take it completely apart (i.e. snap all of the pieces off) and put it back together, which took nearly two hours.Fun toy, just be careful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fell apart, got replacement, it fell apart as well","review":"The fun of the cube is solving the puzzle and then doing it fast, but it won't hold up to much movement at all.Not worth the time/money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quaite a bad cube broke and not my fault:/","review":"Not a very good cube not satisfied not what i was expecting from a rubiks brand and its one of the most expensive 4x4x4's out there really not worth it(especially when my cube was faulty) good seller got the refund, so yeah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try another brand - quality is too low with this one","review":"It weorks but it is hard to move the cube around. Price was low but you get what you pay for. I would not buy this brand again. hard to move the cube."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"For those of you who are just getting into cubing, I'm sure you have a positive opinion of the Rubik's company, the first, largest, and most famous of the companies that make these puzzly cubes.Unfortunately, by this point the company has gotten fat, lazy, and complacent. Their cubes blow.In particular, with this one, the 4x4x4, the stickers will come off before long, meaning the puzzle won't be solvable because you'll have too many white cubes. It's also not very well put together mechanically and will likely come apart. I know the 4x4x4 and anything larger is not recommended for speedcubing for this reason, but still.By this point, you should get your cubes from companies like Lanlan and Eastsheen. Even though you may not recognize their names, they still put out better products that last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too fragile for any real use.","review":"Thinking that this would be a more challenging toy than the 3x3 I purchased it. However within a few hours I noticed a few of the stickers were already coming off. This by itself was annoying, but within the next day or two, the whole thing became disassembled in my hands. Even knowing that they were going to be fragile from other reviews I managed to break it. If you buy this, I recommend making sure you're very gentle with it, and make sure all the pieces are lined up before you try to turn a section. Or just keep it as a desk piece for conversation.In conclusion, I would not recommend this for someone who's looking to get any real use out of it.(As a side note, I also purchased the 5x5, and had the same sticker problem, however, when the 4x4 broke I didn't try to use the 5x5 and it just sits on my desk looking pretty)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After thoroughly enjoying the 3X3, I thought my family would like the 4X4, but it falls apart very easily and won't stay together...kind of difficult as you twist it and try to solve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Mind-game, Bad Quality","review":"A 4x4 is quite more interesting than a 3x3. This particular cube falls apart before the stickers would peel, as in my case. The inner workings of the cube are loose and jam easily. So if you have much patience and a lot of time, this cube would be fine. However, if you wish for a better quality one, I have heard that Meffert's are quite good, although not currently being sold on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"With the resurgance of the Rubik's cube over the past several years, it brought me back and with kids elementary and high school age I wanted to re-experience the fun of 25 years ago with the new generation so I purchased some Rubik's brand cubes. 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 to share with my kids. They have been a lot of fun. The Rubik's 3x3 is just as I remembered it. A bit stiff at first but with time (and a little silicon lubricant) it loosens up nicely. My 11 year old has already mastered that one! The 4x4 is a real disappointment though. Very sticky and jams up a lot, even with a liberal dose of silicon lubricant. Also, the 4x4 is very prone to popping cubies when you go too fast. Simply put, the Rubik's brand 4x4 makes me tired. The Rubik's 5x5 performs better. In my opinion, don't waste your money on the Rubik's brand 4x4. Instead, get a much better value from purchasing an Eastsheen 4x4."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"I bought this on a whim while on amazon, just to satisfy my 80's kid inside me, but only really played it a handful of times (was never really good at it. never got the full colors on each side). Both of my kids have played with it, and i understand that it is a pretty basic piece of plastic, but after only a couple weeks, the pieces were loose, and the stickers had begun to peel (this is from normal play use, not from us throwing it at a wall or anything).So, as much as i wanted to give this a great review, I would think that there are other Rubix Cubes by other manufacturers that won't fall apart as this one has. Give them a try instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT GET !!","review":"I love the Rubik's 3x3 it's durable. & after a while it starts to spin like a speed cube. But the second I pulled the 4x4 out of the box i was so excited.

He checked the mail for almost a week and rejoiced when it finally arrived. Within minutes of play it fell apart a was broken beyond repair. Amazon has a lovely policy of honoring returns in unopened packages in origianl condition. How nice of them! Not only did we waste our money but my son is heartbroken. Wish I had read the other 1 star reviews before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme pops","review":"When i got this puzzle the pops and turning weren't to good. After i lubed the puzzle the turning improved alot. But the pieces poped more often. One time it poped so much i had to completely take it apart. when i got to the last center piece i found out that it was missing. when i noticed that i contated Billy hansen and got a replaced it. If i had to recomend the rubiks 4x4 i would tell them to get the eastsheen 4x4 due to the better overall quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The 4x4x4 Rubik's Cube is awesome.

Not at all what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book Review","review":"This book is shipped from America, so there is a bit of a wait for it (standard post).This book is mostly written based on the experiences of Karen Marshall, so you might find yourself thinking you are more ill than you are. Bear in mind that symptoms can vary to a more or a less degree.If you are looking for a cure you will not find it in this book. I did gain a better understanding of myself.

Much of this book is self-serving. The multiple author shares intersting anecdotal information, but the psychologist author is not an expert, has published nothing on the disorder, and contradicts much of the known information about DID. This book could be very harmful."},{"rating":"2","title":"demonic demos !","review":"This is for everybody, not just the die-hards.

Of course they have grown into a monstrous entity, but you can still hear a bunch of musicians oozing creativity. With all the line-up changes people should enjoy every variation of the V.R.

'Mean Genes' is your guide. For instance, to go grocery shopping, hungry, is to invoke a mean gene from our hunter/gatherer ancestry. A primal instinct directs me to devour immediately and pack on the fat. But what happens is that I end up buying more food than I need. It's not that I am a bad shopper, it's that I lost a battle with a mean gene. Not much fun, but now, thanks to 'Mean Genes' I know that the prudent grocery-goer tricks the impulse and just says \\"no\\" by shopping on a full stomach!This book is a must-read!

But covering so many topics in just 250 pages must lead to trivializing science in truly barbarian style. If you are unconvinced of validity of evolutionary approach to understanding human nature: keep away, this book will only outrage you. If you are interested, or are an 'intelectually sophisticated' person, take Buss' 'Evolutionary psychology', 'Adapted mind' or 'Evolution of desire' for easier approach. Those who know already some ev-psych, will by simply bored, as they will find almost nothing new in 'mean genes', nothing that they couldn't think of themselves. Only truly open minded readers, who haven't got in touch with the field, and want to have some fun would really love that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudoscience in bullet points","review":"This book offers a dumbed-down, sound-bite approach, via its collection of vaguely interrelated paragraph-long observations, to an assortment of topics. Some of it seems like checkstand reading. In the (successful) effort to supply readers with an avalanche of factoids suitable for chitchat, any scholarship that might have been utilized is, instead, sacrificed. Arguments (the existence, for example of DNA testing to determine paternity) that would contradict some of its silliness is left out. Pop culture, advertising, rumors, humorous bits, and a mishmash of anecdotal evidence combine and bubble in this stew. It's more of an idea for a board game, really - than a thoughtful study. Instead of citing their references, the authors add a note asserting that their book has been \\"assidiously researched and documented.\\" They name their fact-checkers, and the reader is then invited to visit the \\"Mean Genes\\" website. A cynical and disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not relevant now or then","review":"A juvenile self-help manual, by two PhD's who shouldn't be, serves to confirm a lack of erudition when written that is even more irrelevant now."},{"rating":"1","title":"lean spleens","review":"A pathetic mish-mash of unsatisfying and poorly-connected material.

Recommend to look elsewhere if you enjoy reading new, insightful information."},{"rating":"1","title":"third rate repitition","review":"Though easy to read, this book is devoid of any true scholarship and skews the fragments of information that it reports. Basically, Burnham and Phelan strung random theories together into conclusive pop psychology/self-help by ignoring contextual parameters on the theories themselves and counter-theories. Their narratives appear to be correct because they were initally structured to conform to observation. The only things were undeniably correct were neurobiological (such as their section on the science of addiction) rather than about evolutionary psychology. For the given subject matter, I would find less dictorial books that present competing theories and their evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much useful or usless info !!!!","review":"If you enjoy reading a book that starts off discusing a topic as if the entire chapter will be devoted to this subject, this is not the book for you.The problem with this book is they starting off talking about x substance and the next thing you know a million other subjects are brought up.

In this excellent thriller from Robert Ellis, you will be reminded of the best of Thomas Harris and even Michael Crichton. Having read Ellis' first novel, \\"Access to Power,\\" I am amazed at the breadth of his writing skills. The first book was a taut political thriller about a cynical veteran campaign consultant enmeshed in a murder.

That said we thank Varese for the new release of a \\"remastered\\" recording of the original soundtrack. The technical production is wonderful, and the new packaging is solid. It is a five star effort. But, we are still waiting for what another label claimed as the \\"definitive\\" recording. The only problem here is that this recording is less than thirty-five minutes long. Sadly, there were a number of other cues that could have been \\"restored\\" to a true definitive recording. Still, this is a great edition of a truly great score."},{"rating":"2","title":"all about the mitfords","review":"this book is (almost) \\"the holy grail\\" of the mitford family history. it is a great read and so fascinating. it is everything the reader wants to know and is written by a close family member. author jonathan guinness is diana mitford's son.i recommend this book highly as a \\"starter\\" book for those who are interested in learning about this unusual family. i would also add,to check out other books by other authors. this gives a more,broad perspective of the mitfords and would be written by someone who can see the family in a different light,so to speak...still a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TO THE MANOR BORN","review":"Really a fascinating study on one of the British Upper Class's most contriversial families. It really is the limit though, how the author tries to excuse the support of some of the sister's for the Third Reich, granted this was the feeling of most of the Upper Class at the time, they loved the idea that some people, namely themselves, were naturally superior to the rable. You see this in such films as Gosford Park and Remains of the Day. Having said that, this book is very good, it really lets you in to the lives of the British Aristocracy of this era. These woman are to the manor born and never let anyone forget it. They chose different paths, but I really don't think deep down they are all that different, as an American this is all so foreign, but fascinating non the less, though it makes me appreciate the Revolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely not \\"feed the cat\\"","review":"don't buy this CD if you are not a DJ. I recently bought Agent K's \\"Feed the Cat\\" which is a very pleasant mix of nujazz/electronica/neosoul/house. Easy a 5 star CD, in fact, one of the best CD's period. Being that i don't know much about Agent K, I assumed that this would be the same or close..............WRONG.This is a fast paced, aggressive, eletronic/synthesized CD -- now, all this on steroids. Now you get the picture.If you are not ready to sweat and take your ears on an acidic trip, please don't bother.Its not a bad CD, thats why I gave it 3 stars, but mos def not \\"Feed the Cat\\" !!peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"The classical book on Turkish archery","review":"First, this book consists of two sections, one about Turkish archery, by Klopsteg, and another \\"Modern Methods in Archery\\".For me the second part is not worth the book, it is just curious, not very informative, so I'll skip my comments and concentrate on the part about Turkish archery.It makes a complete overview on the different aspects of Turkish archery, it is not a \\"how to\\" book, if you want a how to, better to try Thomas Douvernay's video about Korean Archery or Jeff Schmidt video about Asiatic composite bows. The second can be ordered at Amazon, and both are available at Three Rivers Archery.There are different chapters describing bows, arrows, the strings, performances, and also a \\"recent addenda\\" that is more helpful to who is willing to build his own bow.It is the best book about the most fascinating bow.

For some reason, I was just drawn to this book. I have to say, the stories inside were well written and exemplified John Edward's supposable abitilies but I just didn't buy it. That is, until I saw his program on the Sci-Fi channel. That made all the difference in the world. As I watched each day, I was amazed as to the validations he was able to give. Only if this were a MAJOR scam with a wide-array of people could this be anything other than real!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting reading","review":"I bought this book after seeing John on TV and I think he is very good at what he does and I was a fan of Sylvia Brownes work. But I really think John has one up on her, I'm not sure if it's because he's younger and can communicate with us easier but he's just great. I now stay up a half an hour past my bed time to watch him on the Sci-Fi channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the beginning for John!","review":"It's time we started understanding the psychic/ metaphysical world, and John Edward's book is definitely a great way to start. I thought the book was wonderful. It took courage to tell all the details of his journey of enlightenment as well as his fears that many religions might not approve. It was honest and sincere, and I enjoyed it. It got me hooked on reading all manner of books on this topic. Non-fiction books by Brian Weiss and Bruce Goldberg, as well as fiction books such as Speak of the Dead by H. Van Horne. I hope John continues to explore his gift and write more books!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Opener","review":"As a fan of John Edwards \\"Crossing Over\\", reading his book was a natural step for me. He so named this book because of the sadness of losing a loved one, and he thought \\"Wouldnt it be nice to talk to your loved one One Last Time?\\" In this book he tells of his youth and how he came to be a medium, then on into the beginnings of his career, and it includes many sessions that he has had. For the curious, the skeptic, and the believer alike, this book will open your eyes to the possibilities that you never thought existed. Had I had the choice I would have rated this book ten stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good book about loss","review":"It's interesting how these demo mediums know so much about death and loss, how do they do it that's a good question. Is it that they play a sort of guessing game? Well the real answer is found on the pages of another book here at amazon Signals an inspiring story of life after life that's the true story not by a fake medium, walk don't run to the page , you can read enough excerpts to resonate with the real thing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish they would teach us some of this in medical school.","review":"What can I say. I am no longer a sceptic in this area. If your curiuos about life after death, read this book. I did not want to put this book down. Highly recommended for anyone desiring a deeper look into how God works through us."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Edward's integrity & compassion moved me to tears!","review":"Beautiful! A convincing testimony to the integrity and credibilty of the profession of Psychic Medium. But, that's not all! It's a story of love and family- not just Mr.Edward's incredible family- the families of his clients and his own compassion, dedication and enthusiasm for his God-given gift and his service to his clients. I am a believer now and a big fan of Mr.Edward. I hope he is writing more, he is a superb writer along with his other talents. I could not put this book down until the very last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"an echo of other reviews: a great book whether you believe it or not","review":"I have not seen Crossing Over, so I did not have any preconceived ideas about him. He is an excellent story teller and this book leaves me with a lot of hope. John comes across as a nice, intelligent, and sincere person just trying to use his gift in the right way as well as make a living from it. He makes a valiant effort to answer our questions (as best he can) instead of brushing past them. Very convincing and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL WRITTEN!

John Edward is too good. He makes life after death so simple and beautiful. Waiting to read other books by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Last Time","review":"At one time I was completely skeptical of those among us who talk to the dead, or see the future. I am a Christian and was raised in a Christian home, so I ignored these types. However, one day I came across John Edward on television and was impressed. I bought this book and found the answers to some questions I had following the (accidental) death of my brother. Many examples are given in the book of those we have lost communicating with us. I had searched and searched for a sign from my brother that he was OK, even though I knew he was in a better place, I just had to know. I have talked with many people who go through the same thing. John helped me to see the things I was missing, and now I am more at ease, knowing he has communicated with me. It's like the old saying \\"You can't see the forest for the trees\\". I would recommended this book and the others by John Edward to those who are heartbroken over the loss of a love one. It WILL give you hope, and peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Last Time","review":"Totally incredible book. If you've watched Crossing Over with John Edward, this book explains the tragedies and triumphs in John's life and his struggles and acceptance of his truly enormous gift. Heartbreaking, breath-taking and funny. John's personality shines throughout the book. Definitely not a book to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoy \\"Crossing Over\\"","review":"Anyone who really enjoys and follows John Edward's show Crossing Over will enjoy and learn from this book. You will gain insight into the history and personality of John Edward, as well as understand more about the connections you may be receiving in your own life. John's book is direct and honest, and his very genuine style is apparent in every page. This book is a must for anyone who can't miss his show. God Bless."},{"rating":"2","title":"not only did he make me believe, it brought me peace","review":"wow.that just about sums it up. i've been a sylvia browne reader for quite sometime, and have recently been introduced to john edward.....being a catholic myself, i was brought up to believe in heaven and hell. I personally believed, once you died that - that was it. Reading this book opened my mind, my heart, my soul to new ideas, and new understandings. If you don't believe in this kind of 'stuff' read this book, its so incredible. I've never read anything so powerful and intense. Not only did he make me believe life is never over, it brought me inner peace which i've been longing for... for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"'A Beautiful Soul'","review":"John Edward has a powerful message to deliver. I love the authenticity of his work.\\"One Last Time\\" reminds me of Jenny Crawford's book \\"Through the Eyes of Spirit\\". I would dearly love to see these mediums work together - they both radiate love and healing within the realms of their work. It is comforting to read books by mediums who appear to have a true and honest connection with the spirit world.Keep up the great work - I am sure that you are both empowered by the Light of God!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading - believable and dynamic","review":"I bought this book after seeing John Edward on the Larry King Live show. He impressed me as he didn't come off as being \\"above\\" the rest of us. I found his book to be almost just like you were sitting in the room with him and discussing the subject. I found him to be a fascinating person - and at such a young age; he has many years to go and to assist people who have lost loved ones suddenly to give them the peace of mind that they have reached the other side and are fine. I alsofound his experiences with his mother here and beyond to be interesting. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is interested in psychics to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW OUTLOOK","review":"This book is amazing!!! I could not put the book down! I can't believe the communication that people can have with loved ones that have passed. I now know that when my time comes to pass, I will still be able to watch my children and in some sort of way still be a part of their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish this was a more focused book","review":"I purchased this book hoping it would be a great story about the fascinating world of mediumship, but it seems that everyone in this field feels the need to resort to the same stale \\"new age\\" and \\"psycic fair\\" mumbo jumbo rather than tell about how the world can benefit from what mediums have to say. This book is another in a long line of \\"you too can be a psychic\\" books, but many of us want the real dope about what really goes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should be","review":"As one who is very interested in the other side (my son is there), I have found much more comfort and satisfaction from other books of the same genre - primarily George Anderson's books. I tend to be skeptical and critical of medium abilities and was not at all impressed by the readings described in One Last Time. I've been reading at it for two months and still haven't finished the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you doubt \\"afterlife\\", this book will make you think","review":"I got this book as a gift. It was very uplifting. I am not one who really does alot of thinking on the paranormal, but this really set the wheels-a-rollin in my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book - Written with Humor","review":"John Edward, the fast-talking Psychic Medium, slows down a bit in the audio version with his narration of some of his readings along with some personal information thrown in. Whether you believe he actually does have the \\"ability\\" as he calls it, is beside the point. I found myself smiling many times at the way he comes across with little dabs of humor. Unlike other Mediums such as Allison Dubois, he says everyone has the \\"ability\\" to some degree, but it may not be developed. Mrs. Dubois, on the other hand, with her pious and arrogant attitude, calls this \\"talent\\" and says it is inherited. In my opinion, John sounds so much more real and genuine, hasn't tarnished is reputation with obnoxious and drunken appearances on TV shows like Dubois has, and is much more believable. The audio-version is great and really shows his sincerity and wit."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Edward is the real deal!","review":"I've watched Crossing Over for as long as it has been on TV, although I can't seem to find it on TV any more. There are only three mediums that I have seen that seem to be gifted mediums and they are John Edward, Char Margolis and Lisa Williams. There may be others but I don't know of them. I do not find Syliva Brown or James Von Prague to be legit...their readings have always been too vague...I just find them to be phony. The others have been very specific so that there is no mistaking that they are actually communicating with someone on the other side because they repeat things to the person having the reading that no one else could possibly know.This book was a compilation of readings he's done and how he receives his messages from the other side. Always fasinating to read about and will buy some more of his books in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I am a fan of John Edward's new show on the Sci Fi Channel, so I was eager to read this book. While I was hoping to hear more about how to develop one's own ability to \\"tune into\\" messages from the Other Side, I couldn't put this book down until I had read every page. The stories are very compelling and I was completely engrossed in this book. I look forward to reading Mr. Edward's other book and also want to have a reading of my own now."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY LIFE'S BIGGEST INSPIRATION","review":"Most all my life I have known that there was so much more to life and afterlife than I was taught while growing up. I saw things much differt than others. Somehow I have never feared death.John Edward and his book ONE LAST TIME helped me tie all the loose ends together. He explained piece by piece how we live and die with love always holding on, even from the other side. I do not have to hope there is life after death,I know it.Thank you John Edward, for all the comfort you have given to so many.For all those who think John isn't for real,I truly feel a loss for you.Thank you John.You have made my life a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PRIMER FOR UNDERSTANDING THE MEDIUMSHIP PHENOMENON","review":"ONE LAST TIME comes the closest in the genre of recent books by mediums to describe what it is like to be a medium. The skeptics' favorite challenge to mediums is that they engage in cold reading of a gullible, bereaved clientele. I believe that ONE LAST TIME is an honest attempt on Edward's part to set the record straight, and he accomplishes this in an entertaining mix of anecdotal evidence and honest confession. That John Edward is currently participating as a research subject at the University of Arizona at the Human Energy Systems Laboratory under the auspices of Gary E.R. Schwartz, Ph. D., speaks volumes for Edward's credibility.For those who want to understand what it is like to be a medium, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must read this with an open mind","review":"I am a skeptic. I have always believed that when you are gone... you are gone. In seeing John Edward on TV, he was so convincing that I had to find out more. After reading One Last Time, I am beginning to question some of my beliefs... or at least reconsider them. John tells stories of his readings in a light-hearted way, similar to his TV show. The latter chapters were the most interesting where he describes what is going through his head during the readings. The book would have been even better if there was more of this. This book is much better than his most recent book, Crossing Over, which was more of a biography and was not nearly as interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pitiful Scam","review":"It seems quite unbelievable with the good, credible information offered by science that people are still taken by those such as Edward, who make a living by preying on the grieving and the gullible. I do not blame his followers, as the vulnerability of the bereaved is apparent. But to claim to channel even pets! Please! Such obvious pandering is a scam, pure and simple. Edward does tricks that are easy to understand, and even perform. Look, for example, at the work of James Randi. Edward will claim that he is only offering comfort through the use of his \\"gift.\\" In reality, he is practicing the worst sort of opportunism to coldly separate the grieving and the gullible from their money. If this is a \\"gift,\\" why does he charge for it? And how have Americans gotten so far from critical thinking that they cannot see through the most transparent huckster?"},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW GULLIBLE CAN HUMANS BE???","review":"Having seen Edward on Sci-fi one time and heard about him I decided to buy the book. I found him to be a good writer, but the problem is, HIS STORIES ARE TRANSPARENT FABRICATIONS. It is so evident how he sucks people into thinking he can actually talk to dead people and animals. How can anyone not see through his cold reading? (AND HE IS NOT EVEN THAT GOOD AT IT) SO... WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP BUYING THIS BOOK AND WATCHING HIM? Because his book and \\"readings\\" just reinforce what some people keep hoping will be true. MANY RECENT ARTICLES, INCLUDING ONE IN TIME, HAVE EXPOSED HIS DECEPTIONS. If you read his book with a CRITICAL MIND it's right there in front of you...ONE MORE SCAM."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEEDS TRAINING IN HIS WORK!","review":"I FEEL JOHN EDWARD'S BOOK \\"ONE LAST TIME\\" DIDN'T CUT IT FOR ME.I'VE ALSO WATCHED HIS LIVE PERFORMANCES ON TELEVISION AND FIND HE RUSHES HIS CLAIRVOYANCE WHEN GIVING PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS.

HE ALSO ASKS FAR TOO MANY QUESTIONS -NOT GOOD FOR THE SCEPTICS THAT LINE UP IN THE WINGS TO TRY AND DISPROVE A PYSCHIC'S WORK.I'D LIKE TO SEE JENNY CRAWFORD - AUTHOR OF \\"THROUGH THE EYES OF SPIRIT\\", WORK WITH JOHN EDWARD - SHE WOULD SOFTEN HIS ACT A BIT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally absurd","review":"Mr. Edwards is just another guru for the gullible, a la Shirley Maclaine.

And considering everything I've seen and heard about in the course of writing some of my books, I think that's saying a lot.

As a result I became hooked on his show & watched it at every opportunity. I began to notice John's technique & became very disappointed. He begins very vague & then narrows it down by people's responses & facial expressions. To see if I was right I got together some of my neighbors whom I do not know their \\"deceased\\" family/friend backgrounds. I began just as John did very vague. \\"I'm getting a mother figure over here somewhere\\" etc... I amazed my neighbors. They thought I was physic by the end of our \\"session\\".

The mix is so poorly done that all of the power of the music is lost. Zakk's guitar is mixed dead center, while the second guitist is buried in the backround. The drums also have no punch.BLS's excellent live DVD (Boozed Bruised and Broken-Boned) solved this problem by using the AC/DC guitar mix of having each guitarist hard mixed to the right and left channel with well recorded drums.

The only good thing being; that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of \\"All For You\\" and \\"13 Years Of Grief\\" sound much better and immediate than their studio counterparts. A new heavier version of \\"No More Tears\\" tries to please, but fails by showing Zakk Wylde's gruff vocals don't always work. Unexpectedly, the bonus acoustic EP is the far better attraction. \\"Like A Bird\\" is the best song Neil Young never wrote and \\"Blood In The Well\\" shows Zakk's soloing chops in full form.

Second Sebesta please non one programs in Ada or PL1 anymore we can stop referencing them that are legacy languages .

For example, he doesn't even touch on the ideas of follow sets and predictive parsing. His coverage of BNF and EBNF is light, at best, and it seems this topical coverage permiates the whole book.As any CS student or educator knows, \\"Concepts of\\" books tend to be dense and difficult to read. This author attempts to make the material more readable at the cost of detail. Unfortunatley, the detail he leaves out is necessary.I would also argue that the author doesn't have a strong understanding of PLs. The concepts he presents toward the begining on PL evaluation are incomplete. He doesn't fully express all of the important criteria in language evaluation.Overall, if you are looking for a brief, topical INTRODUCTION to programming languages, this may be the book for you.

(Sorry for my english mistakes)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much Ada and Pascal","review":"The concepts were described pretty well but there was too much emphasis on useless programmming languages. Although I realize this is a book on computer programming, they could have tried to make it a little more colorful. A mug shot of dorky computer scientists at the beginning of each chapter is not my idea of effective visual aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an introductory text","review":"I used this book for a introductory course to graduate students that had no programming experience. This book was not set up for introductory students. You really need to have expericence with programming languages, especially C and Pascal to make heads or tails of this book.I didn't like the layout...spending the first part of the book telling you what it is going to talk about, and then spending the second part retelling you. In some cases, in exactly the same words....the organization needs some work and the index and glossary were not thorough enough to be of help. I ended up buying two other books on programming languages to help explain this one to me so I could finish the course.The review questions did nothing to prepare you for the problem sets at the end of each chapter and the problem sets didn't really have examples in the text that you could refer back to. Like I said, it seemed that the book expected you to know more than introductory level."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!","review":"I used this in school for my PLs class and it was great. The breadth in the content is excellent and the historical points that are made provide a context to understand why exactly certain languages have evolved the way they have today. Great reference even today at my job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one...","review":"this textbook was required for my programing languages class... I would say that it is pretty good in terms of breaking things down and I was able to get a better grasp on things and how different language handles different situations. It was definetely useful to me as a hardcore Java developer to get some exposure to different programming languages and to appreciate something that they have and Java lacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderately useful....","review":"I am using this book for a programming languages course and find it only slightly useful. It places rather too much emphasis on high-level explanations and history of programming languages, and may be of limited use to people who want to get a deeper understanding of the mechanics of designing a language/compiler. The book is clearly sectioned but each section seems to ramble on without a clear focus of where the discussion will lead. Some exercises, especially the ones on evolution of programming languages, seem contrived. There is also a conspicuous absence of regular expressions/automata which is also important to understanding programming languages"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spongebob: There are better Wii titles.","review":"Fortunately, we rented this one before we bought it. The concept behind the game is fine. Plenty of non-violent puzzle solving activities, but it did not peg our fun meter. The Wii interface developed for this game is pretty flawed. For instance, there is a critical task where you have to activate a wench by twirling the Wii-mote in the air. Spongebob is told to crank hard and fast, which his animated character does. However, it only works if the player twirls it very slowly. Driving games feel pretty awkward too. Animation and graphics are only so-so. As a whole, the game lacks polish. I think most adults would be bored by the game and it won't maintain the attention of a younger audience for long, it certainly did not capture the interest of my kids who are fans of the cartoon. I considered giving this three-stars, but for the price, I think we should expect more from the game developers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a 6 year old","review":"My daughter wanted a box from Amazon so much that I found this game and got it for her. Its ok. For a 6 year old it great. A few tough spots but that is why dad is here to help her and I just tell her I dont know how to play video games (not much of a lie). I would get it for a kid again."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd rate chase game with SpongBob painted on","review":"My 8-yr-old son and I played it. (We both have played a lot on the Wii with the standard games that came free with the Wii which my son and I have mastered).He spent 20 minutes trying to get control of the vehicle in this SpongeBob game. Very difficult to get through course without crashing. Felt like car randomly crashed. Weak graphics. Felt like a basic cheap game with SpongeBob stuck on top of it sloppily to make it sell.After 20 minutes of boredom and frustration, we went back to games that came with the Wii free of charge which we both felt were far superior.This SpongeBob game lets the Wii down. Both my son and I were very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like there is potential, but really hard start up","review":"This game is really, really hard to start up. It seems that you have to move from game to game in \\"story mode\\" in order to get access to each game. My 8 year old - a very experienced gamer, who has spent hours on the wii sports games - was in tears several times trying to make his way through the first two games. The driving part in the first game \\"Diesel Dreams\\" is frankly beyond the skill base of a child. I finally took over and got us through that. As I write he is trying to \\"find Spongebob's license\\" and having lots of difficulty executing the jumps, etc.This is not a game for a child..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Game Ever","review":"When I picked this game up, I expected little value. But as the time went by I began to like it. Eventually, I gave this game a 5 star rating. So anyone who sees this game, PICK IT UP. I cannot recommend this game enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"This was a gift so I am not sure I can rate it properly. I am sure my nephew will love it though since he loves spongebob"},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be a good game if it worked with the wii remote","review":"This game is not worth the money. There is something wrong with how the game was set up where it takes a long time to recognize the Wii remote. Not worth time spent being frustrated by trying to make it work, or the money. My son was really upset because he loves Spongebob. I can't be the only one that experienced this defect, unless I got a bad copy. I'll be throwing this in the trash because it's useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"I bought this game for my 7 year old son. He likes it. It's fun and mostly easy for him to play. There are few spots where he gets frustrated and I have to help him."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 5 year old son likes it, except for the driving","review":"My 5 year old son really likes this game, except for the driving, which I have to do for him. Unfortunately, 1/3 or so of the game involves driving. I'd say that's the only negative about the game. We've gotten through the entire story mode and my son loves going back to previous levels in the freeplay mode. If I let him, he would play it all day long. It's not my favorite game, but it's for kids and my kid likes it a lot. Only four stars due to the difficult driving parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SONG","review":"After I heard \\"I Quit\\" on the Buffy CD I thought it was the best.

The fact that he sings a song about him self on a \\"gospel\\" CD and that he has his picture on the front and back of the case is self promoting. If the CD were truly about the Lord and his Word, one would think that he would not promote himself. To me, that one song taints the album making this neither completely a gosped CD, yet it's still not a secular CD--it's something like lukewarm. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can End Up In Hell Singing a Lie","review":"This young man has been deceived by Satan. For Satan knows that God does NOT hear a sinners prayer. His song may sound nice and fancy and make you want to clap your hands and snap your fingers, but the words are deceptive. Same goes for the song WE FALL DOWN BUT WE GET UP. In these lyrics, he states \\"for a saint is just a sinner who fell down.\\" A lie from the pit of hell. A saint is NOT a sinner. A sinner is a sinner. A saint is a child of God. If a saint falls into a sin, you can rest assured that he/she will repent immediately and TURN away from that sin and commit it to more. A sinner will continuously commit the same sin.Please people, for the sake of your soul, you must be careful what you allow into your spiritual ears and into your soul. Satan can look good and sound good, but he can't live right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a God Gifted Talent","review":"This was one of the best CD's that I have purchased. It is real and ministers to my soul. He brings out some things that hit close to home. I like every single cut he has recorded.

In this novel, Braverman continues to assert her unique view of modern life, especially in Los Angeles, which becomes a metaphor for greater latitudes. Her prose is rich and evocative, haunting at times. That this novel and others of her writings are out of print testifies to the indifference of publishers today to fulfilling their function to perpetuate fine writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Master Craftswoman","review":"Braverman's writing is so beautiful, so packed with imagery, so multi-leveled that it almost overwhelms her story line. For those of us who love the language, her every sentence, every paragraph is like a trip to a fine dessert bar. This is a book in which to luxuriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspirational","review":"i am in an architecture program and i used this book to inspire a school project for housing. i was totally engrossed in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"These forks are amazing. Really good for the adult riders out there. The installation manual that comes with it is really easy to understand. No problem installing them. Highly recommend"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date at this moment","review":"At this moment this book is a way a out of time, simply because it covers narrowband technologies like GSM, IS-95 and others that are no longer interesting for fixed wireless access systems realization. More attractive standard as IEEE 802.16 have been covered on 2 pages, and WiMAX Forum has not been mentioned at all. Also, there is no mathematical background or practical FWA system planning background. This is completely introductory book that could not be interested to anyone with high or moderate involvement in field of telecommunications. If you are a part of a management and you are trying just to get an idea about fixed wireless access this book can be interesting, in all other cases not very much. I believe that for engineers Harry Andersons book about fixed wireless access is much more valuable, and for managers William Webbs book about wireless local loops."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"well its extreemley old at this point soo buying wud b pointless it has a slow framerate and is just bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it - never got it","review":"They said there were two cameras (that I paid for) in the box, but they only shipped one.

I have to admit, they don't play with them as much as I'd hoped, and I think that I got the dolls more out of sentimental value - remembering them from my childhood - than anything else. Part of the fun of a Cabbage Patch Doll is the name that they come with, so I was a little wary of buying them online since some of the names are downright weird, but the CPK website allows you to change the doll's name and print a new birth certificate, so that helps a lot. Amazingly, one of the dolls came with the same first name as one of my daughters! The dolls are made the same way, with a hard plastic head, soft body, yarn hair, outie belly button and tatooed backside, but the facial expressions are cuter than the older version, and the hairstyles have been updated, thankfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated","review":"I first bought this CD back in 1996.

It is interesting to me that even though she seemed to \\"have everything\\" the mental, physical and emotional anquish is so much like my own and many people I have talked to who have MS. It is well worth the purchase for it is so full of information and suggestions for the \\"have-nots or the haves\\" to follow.

Probably most of us, if there was a cure for MS, someone on the internet would know about it. They prey on our fears and in our situation we are so desperate we will try or do anything, only to feel more desperate and helpless for this dreaded thing they call MS, however when we hear something new or there is a new book or protocol out that we haven't heard about by someone who claims to have cured themselves, we will jump right in and the vicious cruel cycle will start over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the most irresponsible book on MS I've ever read","review":"This book starts with the author's self-aggrandizing about the medical knowledge she possesses as a chiropractor and nturionist. But the book is riddled with inaccuracies, uneducated statements and pseudo-scientific myth. I would HATE for anyone newly diagnosed with MS to read this book and draw any conclusions from it. I cannot believe no one from her publishing house saw fit to do any actual fact checking on this book. Some of the unsafe and unscienfitic methods she espouses - bee sting therapy and removing the fillings from your teeth.

She uses fairly short sentences. It pulls the reader in at times, but, with equal energy, it pushes or repulses you away. i was quite disappointed overall with the book, hoping that it would be both more descriptive and scholarly. i would not recommend this book for use in the classroom, for \\"primary care providers\\", or for those with MS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not realistic","review":"Halfway through the book I gave up - I don't need to read about how everyone thought she looked wonderful and how did she have MS ?? - I've been living with it for 35 years - this book is for those newly diagnosed who are going through the denial phase - not relevant for me although I should have realized that before I purchased it - there is no reversing MS - there are remissions but no reversals and to think that there are is a fallacy -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reversing Multiple Sclerosis: 9 Effective Steps to Recover Your Health","review":"First, I must mention that I was unable to finish this book as a result of the glaring inconsistencies I found. I made it through Chapter 9, but do not want to waste my time with the rest of it. I'm not sure how much of this book is untrue but there are two things the author discusses repeatedly that I know to be false.Betaseron is not a betablocker and is not even in the same family of drugs. Betaseron and all the other MS injectables the author mentions are interferon therapies. Huge difference.The author completely misrepresents the Swank Diet. Anyone interested in learning more about this alternative treatment to multiple sclerosis, should buy Dr. Roy Swank's book \\"The Multiple Sclerosis Diet Book: A Low Fat Diet for the Treatment of MS.\\" It is no where near as restrictive as Ms. Pepe makes it sound. Dr. Swank also provides years of research to back up his claims which this author does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book on the subject ever!","review":"All I have to say is that this book is the worst book on the subject of MS ever written! The only thing it succeeds in doing is engorging \\"Dr\\" Pepe's already huge ego and relaying idiotic advice from a woman who has self-proclaimed that she \\"healed\\" herself from this disease and then in turn makes fun of people with actual symptoms who looked to her for help.I am a big believer in alternative and complementary therapies but this woman is exactly the type of person who gives CAM therapies a bad reputation.After suffering through her long-winded self-love affair with herself, the only thing I took away from this book is that she has too much money and not enough ways to spend it.As someone who has MS and has to deal with that reality on a daily basis I find this book to be insulting, deplorable, and detrimental to the education of others about this desease.This book is awful and full of s**t.

Learned the hard way that it is a bit too old for SDHD cards; SD only, but I managed to get one in the electronics department of a local grocery store for $10. So, all in all, a steal on the camera!I am still learning how to change various settings to accommodate the environment I am shooting in, but thus far, the camera is perfect for me.

I need a camera that is dependable, simple to use, and durable. I have now owned this camera for 5 years with no problems. I never use a case, just slip it into a pocket and GO.

A bad one complained of easily damaged LCD screen. Another reviewer indicated where to buy a plastic shield made by 'da products', which I did. I have used this small camera several weeks now. I carry it in my pants pocket on the job. No complaints, save one. Why can they not make a small camera with a decent lens and resolution simple, easy.

Make sure you plan on buying an additional, much larger memory card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft Focus, Disappointing Results","review":"As a digital photography enthusiast and a fan of Canon cameras, I had high hopes for the SD-400, hoping it might be a smaller and lighter weight replacement for my Canon S-50, one of three Canons I own. What I discovered was that the SD-400 (that I ordered from Amazon) is incapable of capturing sharply focused photo. Every photo -- wide angles from distance, medium-range, head and shoulders, close-up, macro -- everything was every-so-slightly out of focus. It's best described as soft focus. Out of fairness to Canon, perhaps it could be chalked up to a bad lens on this particular camera, which I returned. But the picture quality was also consistently washed-out and no where near accurate or realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little camera, but useless in low light conditions","review":"I bought one of these after a friend of mine showed me the excellent pictures she took with her SD300 on a recent trip. I was amazed that such a tiny camera can take such good photos. And while I'm not getting rid of my much larger Canon S1 IS with its 10x zoom lens, the SD400 is terrific for just carrying around in my pocket. You never know when a great photo-op will arise on a trip or with kids, so I like always having it handy without taking up much space. The main reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that I get bad red eye in a lot of my pictures and, much more importantly, it is completely useless in low-light conditions (something I've found to be true of other Canon cameras as well). I have seen wonderful low-light photos taken by cheaper cameras than this, so I don't know why Canon can't figure out how to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely, with a major defect looming","review":"I love the design of the Elph digitals, and have used mine with much pleasure for a year. As much as I have enjoyed it, mine has ceased to function, due to the very common issue with some of these cameras around a \\"memory card error\\" which is actually a camera malfunction. A noticable number of digital elphs seem to fail between one and two years of ownership with this error. Cannon has been unsupportive. I should note that mine is the 4MP version...but I direct you to do a search on problems with the SX00 series. It's heartbreaking to enjoy and recommend a little camera like this, and then have it leave you without a financially viable alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"The LCD screen is very delicate","review":"I was over all very please with this product. The images, the camera size, the battery life etc.. were all satisfactory if not slightly above. I had the camera not more than 2 1/2 months before I had a problem. The camera was in a Lowpro rezo 10 camera case on my hip when the screen broke. It wasn't dropped and I didn't sit on it. My mistake was to sit too close to someone on a bus. I am told Canon classifies it as \\"impact damage\\" and will probably (I am in the midst of dealing with Canon customer service) do nothing for me. The camera still functions but most of the features are not accesable to me now. All I can say to date is what a waste!! I was a repeat customer (I owned a powershot 30) and quite satisfied up until now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Awesome! :)","review":"The NEW Canon SD400 Camera is such a great little camera. It is so tiny that you can take it wherever you go without worrying about a huge case with a huge camera in it.

Combining Native American rhythms with naturistic compositions and soft, mellow themes, The Scarlet Letter soundtrack, composed by John Barry, is a breathtaking mix of beauty. Native American influences can be heard in numerous tracks throughout, most significantly in the beginning song and the dark themes related to Roger Chillingworth. Nature's beauty can be felt in track three, entitled \\"The Bird-The Swimmer,\\" as the composer uses percussion instruments, strings, and a boy's choir to bring the forest to life. The more suspenseful music, evident in tracks nineteen and twenty-one, use forceful drums, horns and strings to accompany the ending scenes.

It's not scouts, they're not girl scouts..., it's senshi, sailor soilders... soilders! You want to read a real sailor moon book? then go buy the real Japanese manga, so what if you can't read it, there are translations on the internet! Another thing... what's up with the young adult catagory? It's made for 7 year olds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Different than the anime","review":"First of all, they put in americanized expressions such as \\"you got it chick\\". And wasn't Tuxedo Kamen supposed to come at the end of the Sailor Mars episode? WAIT A MINUTE! TUXEDO KAMEN DIDN'T COME IN ANY OF THE THREE EPISODES IN THIS BOOK (when he was really supposed to)! Usagi was supposed to use her Luna Pen to get on the cruise ship to become a camera woman! Plus, they changed the endings a lot. They also put in too many americanized names. Scouts? Champion of justice? SERENA????? But worst of all... Negaverse. EWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!Anyway, since I am a huge Sailor Moon (ehem, JAPANESE NOT DUB!) fan. Cuz, the DIC messed Sailor Moon up BIG TIME! So don't watch the dub or read the americanized books. Instead, watch the sub and read the manga. In other words, WATCH AND READ SAILOR MOON THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE SEEN!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What I thought of this book","review":"I felt that this book was pretty helpful. However, I didn'tlike Ms. Sentar putting in all that romantic stuff that didn't happenin the televised American version, and I'm pretty sure not the Japanese version either. I think this book was well-written and funny. I paticularly enjoyed the fights between Serena and Raye and I am looking forward to read more about them. I just hope in future books the romantic parts (not occuring in the series) are minimized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"The Tweeny Witches is a good little goofy series, so if you love the original series, this one is right up your alley to continue all the fun you was having!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

They are what 16ish? Theyre voices do not sound great, and they barely harmonize. It's like a reject of spice girls. Other girl groups with more talent ie:PYT, have been around and have unfortunatly not gotten their talent showcased due to poor record labels.Now they are nothing. If No Secrets gets far in their career, then that will be a miracle...cause these chicks, aren't somehing special!As for Play, they are like 13 but they still harmonize and have a belty singer...I dont hear any belty singers from No Secrets..theyre all average singers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, but where is the perfect tune?","review":"CD is sorta awsome.In realistic life goes, this is bogus for adults.

If it had a perfect tune it would range in the middle like \\"5 out of 10\\". OK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicole...Pretty good songs.","review":"I think No Secrets is not a bad CD. They have pretty much no talent so far as their singing goes[like most pop artists] but I think there beats are good, repetitive but catchy and the lyrics fit them.

Uh, NO! A few songs are okay, but for the most part they're teh next girl-group to break up. Unfortunately, my little sisters are the next teenage idols, so they insist on buying every poor-sounding girl group known to man. Most songs are the same as every Britney song-\\"I'm my own woman, blah blah\\" except they don't have sillicone...yet.I'm not saying they're not talented-they have okay voices-but they need to practice or something before they record a bunch of repetitive songs. It's No Secret that No Secrets need to shape up or quit before they embarass themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Honestly, on the whole I would have to say that this album was not that good. There is only one singer who really carries the group through, and the rest are high pitched and nothing special. The songs are superficial and aren't really relatable.

There is no powerful, outrageous woman figure like Mrs. Proudie of \\"Barchester Towers\\"-Mrs. Proudie does get a one-line mention in the novel, however! There are some wonderful minor characters here-Archie, Sophie, and Boodles are wickedly fun. If you are a Trollope addict not yet familiar with this novel, I'd say this is a sort of happy \\"Small House at Allington.\\" If you are familiar with Rousseau, you will recognize the main character Julie is Trollope's variation on \\"Julie ou La Nouvelle Heloise\\" sans the premarital or adulterous sex.

It is what it claims to be on the cover, a book about cheating at cards. The book starts out with an introduction by Penn Jillette who basically apologizes for putting his name on this book.Penn tells how he owes the real author ( who's given the nom de plum Dickie Richard ) an enormous favor for helping Penn get started in his career. The terms of this favor repayment were that Penn put his name on this book so people buy. It worked at least once because I bought the book thinking it was something it is not.The BOOK IS ABOUT CHEATING AT CARDS. Not magic, not humor, not funny anecdotes or tricks ; cheating at cards. It is not written be Penn or Teller and has nothing to do with either of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think before buying","review":"As a fan of Penn & Teller's other books, I was going to buy this, but in reading parts of it in a bookstore, I discovered that it's not the fun, clever, amusing book about tricks you could use to cheat at cards or even ways to have fun with your friends at a poker night.This book is a dark and seedy account about the life of a professional (and possibly fictional) poker cheater. There's nothing wrong with that, but it wasn't the book I thought it was going to be so I wanted to post a warning to make sure you knew what you were getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential read for home group poker players","review":"The book is all of the above -- but I feel that it is an essential read for anyone hosting a home poker group. The host can't possibly know everyone who shows up every week and the number of available cheating techniques is so vast that simply \\"cutting the cards\\" to prevent cheating is nothing short of delusional. For that reason, I rate it highly and could care less if Dickie is fictional or not. The cheating techniques are real enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing portrait of a sociopath","review":"Warning - if you like Penn & Teller, or poker, or both, and you think the cutesy title sounds like fun - do not pick up this book. It's a fictional(?) first person account of a sociopath.\\"Dickie\\" cheats at poker, but many of his techniques aren't clever or interesting at all. Announce a bet of 500 but only splash the pot with 400? Swipe chips when making change with the pot? Grab someone's chips when they aren't looking? That isn't too much fun to read about.He's beyond a cheat, though - he's really a complete sociopath who sees other human beings as things to exploit. He suggests swiping a wallet, or the cash box, or kidnapping a pet so he can \\"find\\" it and build a relationship with a mark. Ugh. Repulsive.If it's fiction, I'd say Mr. Jillette should stick to magic. If it's non-fiction, I hope Dickie gets some help. He's as disturbed and dangerous as any terrorist, and no benefit comes of reading his twisted words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this book for?","review":"If you are a non-medical researcher, comparing Western and classical Chinese Urology, then this book is for you!

He asked her father for her hand in marriage, and her father agreed.The museum in Athens holds not only the treasures he unearthed at Troy, but he found the mask of Agamemnon, and other treasures (the Lion's Gate) showering Sophia with these treasures.

There is NO noise cancelling evident at all with these compared to my normal passive Sony in ear buds. The like for like sound level is about half compared to the Sony for the same volume setting on CD player, despite the 'active' box and battery. Although the sound quality is acceptable they are worse at keeping noise down than a good fitting pair of passive ear buds. The buds are big and uncomfortable and unless you are huge, will not fit comfortably. I tried them in a car (passenger), on flights, local bus and generaly walking around and there was NO noise cancelling I could tell and no bass. Save for the Bose or Shure etc. These are useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Garbage","review":"Don't waste your money on these. They not only fail in the noise-cancellation aspect - they also fail in comfort (the earbuds are about the size of a nickel), and they fail in volume control. I couldn't believe the poor quality put out by such a traditionally good quality company. This has jaded my view of Panasonic completely, and I'm unlikely to purchase anything with their label now. This was a complete waste of my money. Buy these, and you'll STILL need to find some noise-cancelling headphones. I purchased the low-cost Audiobahn 103NC headphones and they work excellently (although they're not earbuds)...Panasonic should take a lesson from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance of Noise Cancelling Earbuds","review":"These do not perform - a waste of money! Panasonic will not provide a refund after these are bought. The noise cancellation is negligble in actual use and the worst of all the several type of headphones that I have bought. I bought them and now use them only as standard earbuds with the inconvenience of the additional noiose cancelling electronics. Panasonic has produced and sold very good products - these earbuds are totally pathetic regarding noise cancellation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"As the other reviewers have noted: It offers very little noise cancellation, and it is all the worse because it won't fit properly in most ears. The ear buds are too large and are hard and uncomfortable. For me, they fall out of place almost immediately. Any noise-cancelling unit that uses ear buds will have to have an exceptional fit. Another thing about noise cancellation in general, and this includes high-end ones I've tried, is that they do a poor job of cancelling higher frequencies, such as paper shuffling and most of the human vocal range. I encourage you never to buy a noise cancellation product that you haven't tried for yourself in an environment with a full range of sound frequencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mostly disposable remix album","review":"Originally released as Re-enter the Abyss, Empyre and Fall is only slightly more relevant than the latter-day remix album, Pop Up. Most of these mixes are only different from the original mixes in that they're slightly worse.The extended version of Into the Abyss and the instrumental version of Draconian Dream are the only significantly altered tracks on this disc. While I find the former to be only somewhat interesting, I really like the later. You'll hear jazzy piano flourishes not unlike Mike Garson has dropped on many a Bowie recording.In summary, I would recommend Empyre and Fall only for the Sex Gang Children fan who has to have it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best polly pocket set ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this hotel is awsome!!! it has a check-out place and a pull out cafe and a table and 2 chairs, a store,a bedroom with a pull out closet,a longe with a couch,tv, and a magazine rack. and alot more!!!!! my favorie part is the roller coster and the ferris wheel!!!!you turn the wheel and the ferris wheel picks up the cars and you keep on turning it and the cars go down the track it's really cool!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, and still played with a year later","review":"I bought this for my daughters last Christmas, and they are still playing with it this Christmas.

This is the only one I found at the time that was close to a doll house. I am not really impressed with this toy. It is pretty small for all the accessories it comes with. There isn't hardly any room to actually play with the dolls in the house by the time you put in all the chairs,beds, etc. It is also a little pricey. I paid $40 and prob should sell for more like $20. As for the rollercoaster part my daughter doesn't even use it b/c she can't keep it together. It constantly falls apart. Hopefully they can come up with something a little roomier that will actually stay together while children are playing with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome fun!","review":"My daughter loved this toy from the moment I opened the box (barely got it together before she started playing). the roller coaster is tons of fun, it closes up relatively nice and easy, and is just the usual polly pocket fun.

The real story of adolescent life is not always pretty and the author relates an intriguing story, though fiction is not a stretch from what could be a real life situation. He tastefully weaves in to the novel the work of caring adults, a not-for-profit organization and the church working together to combat the negative influences of gangs and drugs on youth.Once I got into the book I did not want to put it down for fear that I would miss something. A good read, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet Story","review":"I found this story of a poverty-stricken school-teacher and her quest to fulfill the terms of a inheritance to be charming and effective, and fun to read, but it does have some flaws. The pacing is uneven, and although I enjoyed the lengthy beginning, it speeds up considerably after that; I would have liked the journey more detailed in places, and not all the characters are well-developed. Still, it's an effortless read, rather like a gothic romance, and if you like the lighter fantasies, give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"was excited about getting it..disappionted when i read it","review":"since master of many treasures left me unsure of what had REALLY happened to the heroine i was hoping some of that would be reveiled. i agree with the others that the characters werent well developed (i really only read this book to see what happened to the egg.) i was happy when Ky-Lin was reintroduced cause it was a familiar character like summer and growch were. and cried at the very end because of what happened to the dog :( (im lame arent i) but anyways the book was okay enough just didnt like that she didnt have a direct link to the egg she just happened to be someone who was related to the person that bought it off an auction and was marveling at it.. i wanted someone more caring of the egg or more related to it..book really disappointed me...maybe there will be a next one with ky-lin and the twin hatchling hopefully"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS NOW","review":"If you like this song but don't care for 702's R&B you should buy this.

I think that having a convenient way to adjust the fan oscillation and speed will keep me from adjusting the thermostat on the Air Conditioner this Summer, and that will add up to real savings. The design is very efficient, giving a powerful and versatile fan the same footprint as a small desk fan.

After finding an error right away on page 2, I found it hard to know what was fact and what was not. It does not present the sources of the numbers it quotes, so you can't judge if the information is any more valid than the studies it criticizes.

The retractable cord appealed to me, because I could iron without the baby reaching up and yanking the cord, by retracting the slack. The retract never really worked very well. It constantly jammed.

Although it is not the most pricey iron on the market, it should last for more than one year! This is the last Panasonic brand iron I purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Iron - Performs like One","review":"I used this iron for a couple years.

The plastic mechanism the cord reels into adds extra weight to the product and makes it awkward to use, and it also causes the iron to be imbalanced when upright such that it tips: I've had to catch it a few times from falling over. The cord hangs low and catches on the iron and the ironing board. The convenience of a retractable cord is NOT worth it. Also, the temperature dial is so close to your fingers you end up hitting it often, causing it to dial down in temperature. This is just a terrible, terrible design.

None of these schools are accredited by National education agencies. They have big names but considered bogus education.Why wouldn't one go to a 'real' school and university and obtain valid credentials?

Names we associate with currency and county names aregiven breath and life, warts and all. You learn how SamuelAdams manipulated events in his local paper to make a minor skirmishin Boston the infamous Boston Massacre. You also learn aboutBen Franklin's relatively late start in spearheading theindependence movement and what a youngster Thomas Jeffersonwas considered by the Continental Congress. If you idolizethese great men and their acts of heroism and think theyspoke only for Barlett's Book of Quotations, you will be surprisedhow human they actually were.

I spent many nights staying up late as I could not put it down. It reads almost like a novel of characters you know a little about. I'm not much of a reviewer, but I'd highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start","review":"I would recommend this as a superb introduction to one who is intent on reading multiple volumes on the American Revolution. Its main fault, as I see it, is that even for its length, it can only be a survey. It absolutely picks up on many of the elements of discontent (on both sides of the ocean) that lead up to the Revolution proper, and includes deft character portraits of many of the well-known actors. However, I was annoyed by a few omissions, such as the dismissal of Greene's Southern campaign in one sentence. Again, I do recognize that the author was probably not intent on producing a definitive tome. I have just finished this and I intend to read the Oxford volume next, to flesh out my knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterful story telling","review":"This book reflects the strengths and weaknesses of Langguth's background in journalism. It is an eminently readable, one-volume account of the Revolution. But it is less a narrative, like Shelby Foote's Civil War, and more a series of set pieces that focus on one event and several characters per event. Moreover, he is not looking to plow any new theoretical ground here. It's just straightforward storytelling.That said, I liked the book very much.GRADE: B"},{"rating":"2","title":"History Page-turner? Yes indeed","review":"Fiction Schmiction, this book brings history to life. If you have a short attention span like me, but you enjoy history this is a great book.

Samual Adams role with more depth. Their Moms would have been proud of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Fire Until You See The Mettle Of The Man","review":"This is a great book, well maybe almost great. It does get a little hard to read at certain points in the book, but that is about the only flaw. Many histories of the American Revolution exist, but few provide as much depth into the motivations facing many would-be Patriots as this book does. In those other works one finds a few shining examples of notable patriots, but nothing of the forgotten patriots. Langguth corrects that deficiency within the literature by shedding light on why many people decided to join a hopeless-looking cause. In the process, he helps the reader develop an awareness of the complexity in reasons why people joined the fight. Still, it is a little boring at points, but worth a read if you are feeling spry."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best History Book on The Revolution I've Ever Read","review":"A fantastic book. This is the way history should be told. History is not about a lot of facts and dates and political documents. It's about the people who make history happen. This book brings the founders of this great nation alive, and shows them as real honest-to-goodness people. Not the idolized and romanticized versions you see in school texts and museums, but real fallible people. People who not only exhibit courage, and bravery, but fear, anger and indecision as well.After reading this work, I have more pride than ever in our country. Frankly, I'm amazed what those people were able to accomplish in the face of the odds that were against them, and challenges they had to overcome. Now if someone could write a similar work about the soldiers who actually served in the continental army and fought the battles, that would be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This author writes as if he is writing for the National Enquirer.

Reading it, however, soon became drudgery, as I waded through confusing sentence structure, grammatical inadequacies, and interrupted narratives.

Rebels and Redcoats by Scheer and Rankin is what you are looking for if HISTORY is what you are after!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect!","review":"Probably one of the best books I've read on the Revolution. It really gave a lot of information on the people, the times, and the war itself. One of the best features was the discussion of James Otis, who is way too often overlooked. The only problem with the book was its lack of focus on the Southern theater of the war...King's Mountain and Cowpens are barely mentioned! The book redeems itself with the description of Yorktown and the battle of the Capes. All in all, one of the best books out there on the War for Independence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bjork?

The book is 45 pages so it is an easy read that tends to be more readily available though other book selling sites.Freud groups dreams into those with obvious meanings, those with latent meanings, and those that are incoherent. He goes on to explain how dreams can be interpreted. A section is even devoted specifically to interpreting the dreams of children.

It's now on my Tivo's Season Pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refined Intelligence","review":"I do believe that Life is the most well-written, entertaining, uplifting show I've ever seen. The characters are so perfectly lovable with their smirky, sarcastic demeanor where communication occurs often without words. Dani, Charlie, and Bobby are so supportive of each other. You know they've got each other's back. I've never seen \\"passive communication\\" done so well. Little details that that normally get ignored are embraced and used to create the realistic, detailed atmosphere in Life. It's hard to explain. Refining a show to such an extent must take real skill and dedication.This show has high re-watch value because you miss the characters and the atmosphere they create. You get personally involved in the plots, and every time you watch an episode again you learn something new. I think this show gives other show writers a higher standard to strive for in script writing. The fact that season 3 was cancelled was my biggest letdown in TV ever :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"Movie\\"","review":"This show reminded me of one very long movie .

I'm usually happy with anything that's not Reality TV. But this show leaves you craving more. Even though the Second Season wraps up some of the answers of Charlie Crew's conspiracy theory, there are still a lot left. I'm hoping NBC lets USA pick up a new person for their 'Characters Welcome' add. I can't imagine not seeing this show for a few more seasons. I would love to see Charlie and his first partner, Bobby, work together on some more cases. And now that Shahi has had her baby, she can get back to work as Charlie's best partner, Dani. Regardless, Season Two is great to watch over and over. If you haven't got Season One yet, make it a dual purchase. It's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, but don't pay!!","review":"Life is a great show - full of drama yet witty at the same time.

I think this book may have been a premium for subscribing. It was around our house while I was growing up and I eventually read all of the short stories in it. Many of the stories staid with me for years. I later found out my two younger brothers shared the same love for the stories in this book. Dad passed away back in the 1970's and nobody knew what happened to his original copy. But I bought this one and two more copies for my brothers.

Since their release 4 albums back, \\"One Chord To Another\\", they've shown they're not afraid to think outside the alt-box. I fail to see their similarities to Big Star, but that's who always gets name-checked in reviews. If AM singles radio still ruled our airwaves, these guys could be massive, because there are a handful of singles here. Hey England, time to one-up the States again: you should embrace them emphatically and make them millionaire stars.

At first I skipped around to tracks that were more appealing to pop sensiblitiy, but then I quickly started to listen all the way through, letting the arrangement of the songs carry me through without ever being antsy or bored. This was a great intro to Sloan, so if you're new to the band I totally recommend buying this CD. It's good, clean, classic fun and in this day that's hard to find. Plus when I bought the CD, I got props from the checkout girl for actually buying \\"good music\\". I felt so proud. So now I'm trying to make converts out of my friends. I don't think it will be that hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCK AND ROLL BLOODBATH","review":"Although this record is not nearly as great as Meatloaf's magnum opus \\"Bat Out of Hell II\\" it still has some redeeming qualities. For instance, how can you resist the Sloan boys' off-key caterwauling in the chorus of the song \\"Losing California?\\" Or Jay's pip squeak girlie-man vocal stylings in \\"Waiting for Slow Songs?\\" This band continues to grow and conquer new musical horizons. This record is a machine gun paced tour-de-force hauntingly reminiscent of Kreator's masterpiece \\"Flag of Hate.\\" If you're into late night, drug-induced sessions of air guitar and devil worship you'll be pleasantly surprised by these four Canadian guys with cool hair and an insatiable hunger for all out, mind-numbing, unadulterated rock carnage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sloan are originally Canadian, like moi :)","review":"Losing California is an addictive song, I've listened to it more times than I care to admit!

Not a stinker in the dozen songs. Kind of 70s rock with a contemporary sensibility. Good vocals, crunchy guitars, electric pianos, catchy tunes. I have trouble thinking of individual songs on this disc, 'cause they all fit together so well.

I'm biased toward Sloan, so I think the two bonus tracks are quite good (especially the lyrics in the first).

I found myself under the erroneous impression that this album was a rushed affair and that it wasn't as strong as previous Sloan releases. Then I began to stick with it and listen to it until I came to the realization that this is a great album. This one really grows on you. Now, I am certainly impressed with Between the Bridges' prevailing complexity and diverse and attractive sound. In consequence, I am inclined to say that this album is a strong effort by this Canadian band. i've had the opportunity of seeing them live and I was thoroughly impressed with the way the played together and carried themselves off. Sloan is one of the best bands out there these days. I'm a long time fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From a convert","review":"Okay, I'll admit it -- I'm from Halifax, Sloan's homebase, and yet I've never been a fan. Sure, I've heard their earlier recordings, but it took \\"Between the Bridges\\" and my leaving Nova Scotia to make me realize that this band is terrific. This disc in particular oozes melodious, intoxicating songs. Highly recommended, even for the classical music clan members. A must for Haligonians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check out, and keep watching","review":"Dirty on Purpose's first album is really a sweet record, with noticable Yo La Tengo stylings, but ultimately not derivitive and finding their own sound and style on the fabulous pop songs \\"Light Pollution,\\" \\"No Radio,\\" and \\"Always Looking.\\" Deeper and more complex than their EP, Sleep Late for a Better Tomorrow, Dirty on Purpose is in no danger of being mistaken for Keats; it's the very best kind of indie-pop, fuzzy, a little vague, just subtle enough, and catchy as hell. The 2008 EP Like Bees is better yet, and points the way to a grand future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Overdue!!!","review":"I have waited years upon years to see a re-release of It.

Elements of the plot resemble Peckinpah's \\"Straw Dogs\\" which I believe predate this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The shuttered room should be sold by itself","review":"I have bought alot of old classic movies even sets combine with other old movies because they were good selections but,I don't see why they put the shuttered room with It which, I've never seen and don't want to. I too have been waiting for the shuttered room to be put on dvd. I saw it as a teen once and really liked it and I'm a Carol Lynley fan,she was in Under the yum yum tree and the poseidon adventure.I just don't see why it can't be sold by itself plus being sold alone would make it a much much better price for a old movie. Nineteen is too much for one wanna see movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"Saw this movie when it was first released. Waited a long time for it to come to DVD, as it was on my wish list. Happy to finally be able to purchase the DVD to add to my library.

Would recommend to any fans of Carol Lynley and/or Gig Young."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE LAKE TAHOE!!","review":"I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THIS SONG EXISTED....LAKE TAHOE IS A VERY SPECIAL PLACE ON THIS EARTH, AND THEY GOT IT DOWN, AS FAR AS SKIING AT HEAVENLY, JUMPING IN THE LAKE, AND HOW COOL THE SOUTH SHORE IS......I LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Schiller does \\"Chill Out\\"","review":"This ambient album sounds similar to \\"Chill Out\\" by the KLF. Unlike most Schiller albums, there aren't any dance beats or big symphonic melodies- but it still has the distinct Schiller sound. \\"Prologue\\" could be more original, and big fans of Schiller like me might be disappointed. But there are worthwhile tracks here, full of chirping crickets and melancholy synthesizers.The album was recorded in surround sound and I don't have that kind of stereo. If you are set up for surround sound, this would be an exquisite immersive experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recipes that are interesting and taste good.","review":"This is a good book.

You'll be dancing in the street."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comment dit-on \\"fierce!\\" en francais?","review":"The whole \\"My House\\" series from Distance Records presents some of the best house music ever. Don't get me started on how much I love these CDs! This volume does not disappoint. My guess is that most folk like continuous mixes. However, when almost every song is great, it doesn't matter that a DJ hasn't laid one on top of the other. This CD has few vocals and is more for househeads that don't care for powerful-singing divas. However, the best cuts here are those that take a phrase and repeat it ad infinitum. This CD is backloaded as far as I'm concerned: the best cuts are toward the end. Find this CD! You will love it! I promise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to store, economical, works fine","review":"I guess these aren't space-age with all sorts of fancy features (mute, volume control, slicer, dicer, ice cream maker, etc), but they are foldable, which is great for storing them in the kitchen drawer, the headset is comfortable and you can hear with no problem, and the people on the other end have always been able to hear me with no problem. Considering the price of some of the other models, this one is a best buy, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I have tried a few headsets and this one far exceeds the others I have tried. Sound quality is very good, durability is excellent, and it is comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"works but barely","review":"After using the headset for 2 weeks I've come to the conclusion it's simply poor quality. I've tried the set on two different phones and they both yield the same results, poor muffled sound quality. It appears the person being talked to hears me alright so I can only assume the microphone works properly. I would not recommend this to anyone that might have the slightest hearing problem at all. Might be good for a young person without any hearing issues or frequencey response deficiencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and excellent headset","review":"I bought 2 of these for my Panasonic office phones and they work flawlessly. I'm very pleased with the sound quality, and in testing, they sound great on the other end of the call. Why pay more when these work well. Note: On a couple of our Panasonic 4-line phones (model KX-TS4100) they just emitted a buzzing sound but that was a problem with the phone, not the headset (need to get those repaired). Highly recommended for Panasonic phones. I haven't tried the headsets with a mobile phone so I can't comment here. These are recommended for many different office and home phones with a 2.5mm jack."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Comfortable","review":"The plastic over-the-head head-band of this headset provides the tension to keep it on, but unless perhaps you have a particularly small head, I would caution that the pressure against the head is rather uncomfortable. The earpiece is not so bad but the opposite \\"gripping\\" side, which is made of HARD grooved rubber, presses uncomfortably above the opposite ear. (Sound quality is adequate.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but dose not work good","review":"Had another headset before but the headband broke. My fault as I am a bit tuff on things. I like the looks and fit, however every time I have used this headphone with my Panasonic phone ( I have 2 units and have tried both), people can't hear me very well and say I am breaking up, whereas I can hear them just fine Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it would be","review":"I was looking to replace an older style Panasonic headset that I have been buying and replacing as need since the 90's. I purchased that headset from a seller here on Amazon and received this headset instead. I was skeptical but once I used it, I was surprised and I am glad I got it. I really like it, more than I thought I would. I was used to my old style. But I like that you can adjust the mic anyway you want (close to your face, far from your face) as well as up and down and the basic option for left or right ear. I would recommend it to you if you were looking for a headset for your phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headset saves hands!!","review":"Very efficient & works well, fits nicely & frees the hands for other things. One gripe, seems that the headset speaker distorts slightly. Contacted seller & they invited me to send it back but told me they have no more in stock, so i decided to live with it. All in all good product, quick delivery & good customer response."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic Headset","review":"My wife loves this option. I would have rated 5 star, but it is not wireless.

I am not alone in the house, and we have 2 computers - one upstairs, the other downstairs. I used the MS LifeChat w/o a problem because it has a USB connection. But the Panasonic KX-TCA86 I could not try because its 2.5mm connection is too small incompatible w/ the computers' or monitor's plug in connectors.However, the Panasonic has a more comfortable & lightweight fit than the MS LifeChat. I can leave it on my head much longer than the LifeChat."},{"rating":"2","title":"the only one I'll use!","review":"I love this headset!

Thiswas very tiring, so I bought this headset. It makes it much easier to have necessarylong conversations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headset review.","review":"I love the audio quality and the mute option.

Since I store my bike by hanging it from the front wheel, I put grommets along the base of the cover and use bungee cords to keep it from flying away on a windy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider this disposable","review":"This bike cover is sufficient at first, but, after owning it for a while, I see that it has some major flaws. It doesn't cover the wheels entirely, it doesn't fit back into the zipper pouch once opened, and it tears like crazy after a while. I've considered duct-taping the inside where all the holes are, but then I ask myself: why don't I just buy a better quality bike cover?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves its purpose","review":"This works on smaller bikes. I have a comfort crusier and it is kind of difficult for the plastic cover to cover both wheels. I don't want to strech it to much because I don't want it to tear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted a year","review":"Ar first I really liked this cover as it fit my bike well. I ordered a second one when I bought a new bike from AMZN. It last about a year before it rotted and tore. For this price I think it should have lasted at least 2 years. I will not purchase another one, so if anyone has found a durable cover in this price range please let me know. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I had listened to other reviews","review":"The basic gist of my experience is that I wish I had listened to other reviews highlighting that it only claims to be water RESISTANT, not waterPROOF. I keep my bike outside and wanted the protection from water that a tarp offers, but with the snug fit of this cover. It looks pretty, fit my bike well, but could barely be called water resistant.I'd say this cover is probably great if you plan on keeping your bike on a porch, or if you live in a very dry climate, but otherwise you may be better off just using a tarp."},{"rating":"1","title":"too short & too thin","review":"Basically the cover is too short and does not cover the entire wheels of the bike properly. The material of the cover is also a lot thinner than I had imagined. It is almost paper thin and it feels very fragile and weak. I'm not sure how long can this material can withstand the outdoor weather of sun and rain exposure. I'd expected a higher quality product from Topeak, considering the amount paid for a mere sheet of fabric. And also, folding the cover in its bag is like mission impossible, so don't even bother trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for money","review":"The product is exactly as it is described. It fits my bike just as i had hoped. It is also easy to use and folds up nicely for travelling. Good quality material and construction. Would definately look here again for any future bike needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome,","review":"Awesome,love it. The only thing is that I keep mine turned inside out because I want the black on the outside so its less conspicuous. Great product though, couldnt buy one anywhere in the stores"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done","review":"We don't have bike storage yet and my last bike fell victim to the elements. This cover does a good job of covering the important elements of the bike. It's pretty easy to put on and take off, though it can get caught up on the pedals or rear derailleur. Material looks like it's thin and I was afraid it would rip, but seems to hold up quite well. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a little difficult to roll the cover up and secure it in the pocket. I had to hold it between my legs to help compress it as I pulled the zipper. I still need to play with it so see if I can find an easier way of rolling it up. And yes, you will get dirty rolling it up. But it's better then a dirty or rusted bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"From some of the comments I thought I would have a size problem. I got a mountain bike cover for my road bike and it covers it well. All the way over the pedals. Is also holding up so far in the inclement weather we have had of late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted One Year, Then Disintegrated","review":"Nice design in terms of the fit of the cover over the bicycle. However, the VERY light weight of this cover can make it a little challenging to use in anything over a light breeze. It really blows all over the place.Worse, this cover only lasted one year of everyday use (in Southern California, plenty of sun, little rain and no snow). The fabric has now reached a level of disintegration such that ordinary handling of the cover results in tearing. My cover is now a sieve.I expect significantly better longevity for the price we are asked to pay for this, particularly as we can purchase similar (if not more feature-filled) designs with much more durable fabric, for considerably less cash. I suppose for long-distance road bikers, the light weight would appeal, and this cover might be acceptable if used occasionally on road trips. But, this one is marketed for Mountain Bikes as well. \\"The Sieve\\" gets only one star from this rider..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wind blown","review":"The bike cover seems fairly well made but will not stay on the bike if there is any wind. There is no way to fasten it down. It blows off the bike and was of no use. Is only good in a controlled environment with no wind. Was not suitable for my use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Fit","review":"After seeing a lot of complaints about the size, I still decided to try my luck with these. But I must say that the size is indeed problematic.I have a 2012 Specialized Sirrus hybrid in XL, which is more of a road bike, but I decided to get this mountain cover since from the specified measurements it seemed to be larger and fit my bike better. However, even the chain wouldn't be properly covered with this. It just wasn't large enough, and perhaps my bike being XL worsened the problem.It might still work for smaller bikes if you want to try your own luck though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotted out in the sun after a year. Try the Avenir here for less $$","review":"I must say, like LUCYPYE that mine basically rotted out all its strength in the sun after a year. I try to duct tape around the rips and it tears again around the tape. I am replacing it with the blackAvenir Nylon Bicycle Cover (Mountain Bike)cover for only $21 + free Prime shipping. That one should have rotted out even worse in the sun because it's black, but mine is great after several years outside. I think the Mt. bike Avenir is more generous, because reviews said the road version was sized pretty small. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing product","review":"This is a great bike cover if you own a really small frame bike with narrow width handlebars. I have five bikes and sadly this cover would not fit any of them. This is unfortunate inasmuch as Topeak makes quality bicycle assessories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive, Tight Fit","review":"This isn't a terrible bike cover, but it is expensive and comes with several caveats. First, I have a 17.5\\" MTB and it barely fits over it. The front portion only covers about 1/2 the front tire and it's the same with the rear tire. If you're hoping it will protect against anything other than dust, you're kidding yourself. Second, since it is such a tight fit, it takes too long to fit over your bike. It's like trying to fit 30\\" jeans on a 36\\" waist. Good luck with that. Finally, if you plan on putting any after market accessories on your bike, such as a fender, rack, or mirror--you can forget about this cover. It barely fits a bike without any accessories. It's worth about $12, costs $30, and doesn't cover well at all. I actually bought an inexpensive motorcycle cover to fit over my MTB with accessories. Half the price of this and double the coverage.

It eventually tore the length of the bike, rendering it mostly useless.Reccommedation: no good for prolonged outdoor storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"neck head for president","review":"how can you not like a band that tries so hard to be the worst band ever?

You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"POETIC CHAMPION EXCELS!","review":"In The Days Before RnR is a tour de force, an intelligent but eccentric reflection on his musical heroes which lasts almost 9 minutes - very enlightening to hear Van as Fan. Real Real Gone has a hummable, irresistible riff, See Me Through is a tender gospel song, while the bouncy Youth Of a 1000 Summers is a serenade of the \\"sweet bird of youth.\\" Soothing & evocative album, with tasteful excursions into jazzy realms adding a special touch. Certainly amongst his top 10 best albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critics d'ont like it ...I Do","review":"There is more to this album then real real gone. Its a Tao album written in Van's Buddhist period. Van is the best music writer in the world bar none. Memories is my favourite track here. It reminds me of a old lost love.

The title by the way is based on one of many surveys I have seen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening !","review":"This is a record I listen to from start to finish. No desire or need to mess with it all. Just put it on, and take the journey. Another thing about this wonderful cd-it never loses its juice. I've heard it literally dozens of times now, and it still shines as bright as it ever did. Great production, tight, polished musicianship, and terrific songwriting; you can't go wrong with this Morrison release. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's so much Van it's easy to get lost","review":"To anybody not familiar with Van's non-radio repertoire, his immense catalog of material would easily overwhelm you. To the casual fan, releases like Moondance and Astral Weeks are certainly a no-brainer. Unfortunately, two or three Van albums still hardly captures the tip of the iceberg. So let's say you have a best-of or two or maybe you own a few of the better known classics and want to expose yourself to more. Is Enlightenment a good choice? Let me answer that question with a more appropriate question. When exposing yourself to Van, is there ever a bad choice? I can't think of any, personally.Enlightenment is simply more of what Van is famous for. Introspective lyrics, brilliant musicianship and Van's incredible voice. Don't bother yourself with the fact that you've possibly never heard of it. You absolutely cannot go wrong with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Van Morrison!","review":"This album might seem a little odd at first to those who aren't die-hard Van Morrison fans- that's how it was when I first heard the album six years ago. It grows on you - even hearing him whisper about \\"Justin...gently...on Radio Luxembourg\\" in \\"In The Days Before Rock 'N' Roll.\\" \\"So quiet in here\\" is the perfect song to listen to when you just want to feel at peace with yourself and the world around you. This album has a sort of meditative spirit to it- go figure, its title is \\"Enlightenment.\\" As with all of his other albums, this is a wonderful one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Title","review":"This album is a masterpeice. Morrison's music is a spiritually enlightening experience. Honestly, I cannot imagine a person who would not be affected by his music.

It's simply fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky, mystical","review":"This album is great for many reasons, none of them terribly formulaic. Once again Morrison has chosen to experiment with different musical forms and the result is an excellent, albiet quirky, album.

No doubt the author, Mark Anderson, benefited greatly from writing this engaging memoir (slightly disguised as a novel), but the magic of Black Cloud is in its therapeutic value for readers. Anderson's story is felt at multiple levels --- ranging from simple \\"good reading\\" to a poignant testimony that our families' \\"craziness\\" does not have to do us in.

A tad bit big for my 5 pound dog. Her paw comes out of the sleeve when she sleeps but it fits great when she's running around. I think the XS would be too small for her. They fit my 6 pound dog like a glove! I don't mean tight, I mean perfectly. I was going to purchase two more pair to have on hand when these wear out but they are out of smalls. Ugh!

While Stormcrowfleet seems weak in comparison with their later albums, one cannot fail to notice the warmth and the overabundance of emotion running throught the album. The guitars form a slow pattern on to which beautifully layered ambient passages are layed by the keyboards and the church organ (be it real or not). The vocals add to this mystery as they are not comprehensible in any sort but are mainly whispers. Friends of Funeral doom already own this masterpiece, the rest of you who want to get into the genre should pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush (Strife)","review":"This is a great CD and shows the talent of Eric Clapton to the fullest.

The iAudioX5 will not be recognized or music files(DRM)will not play. Even when the firmware is upgraded to 2.11_b1. Also if you have Windows XP the drive has to be formatted in FAT32 and the max partition is 32G leaving a wasted partition that the iAudioX5 firmware will not use for file storage because it is designed for a single partition. So if you need to \\"wipe\\" the iAudioX5 drive Windows 98(SE)can do this upto 2T in FAT32 or a third party software on Windows XP OS (although it needs to port through USB2.0 as well). NTFS formatting will not work! as the firmware is written to look at FAT32 sectors.

Second impression, after I opened it, wasn't great either. It feels extremely flimsy. That is my biggest problem with it, it doesnt feel like it can handle much stress. The box itself is study enough, its the hinge. I'm pretty sure it's going to break. Can't say when or how, but if the lid twist for any reason this thing is done for.

It would throw off light for 2 hours or more.However, the battery has really poor charge/discharge cycle limits... After 6 months or so the battery life really degraded to the point that I can only get 20 minutes of light out of it. And in fairness to the manufacturer, they state in their literature that the battery is only good for 180 charge/discharge cycles. That's 6 months of commuting. PLUS... I can't figure out how to get a replacement battery. I've never seen a time when Planet Bike has had them in stock.So... if you want to use this thing for 6 months... great... that's a pricey way to go but each of us has our threshold of financial pain.... but if you want something that is going to last longer do not buy this product.I'd buy another one in a heartbeat if they get the battery charge/discharge cycle count issue fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper than gasoline or a trip to the ER","review":"I've owned this light for 3 years now.Cons:I'm on my 2nd battery, my 4th bulb, and my 3rd mounting bracket.

You can add all that up, it is about $800 over 3 years.Pros:The only other way I know to get a headlight this bright is to drive a car. I haven't broken a spoke (by hitting a pothole) since I got this thing. If I put the kind of mileage on a car that I've put on this headlight, I'd have to spend more than that on gasoline.

You have two of the greatest guitarists of all time jamming together. The alternate versions of \\"Have you ever loved a woman\\" & \\"Tell the truth\\" are amazing. The real find here is the disc containing \\"The Jams\\". A couple of these jams have Dicky Betts joining in with the band. Clapton's guitar is searing throughout, and if anyone wants to know just how great a guitar player Duane Allman was, this is the album to listen to. The version of \\"Little Wing\\" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. If you are a classic rock fan this album is a must. You won't stop playing it. You can keep your Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Zakk Wylde & yes, even Eddie Van Halen. These two blow them all away!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An ideal complement to.....","review":"If you currently own Live at the Fillmore East or In Concert, then the jams sessions is the ideal complement to either performance. I'd recommend going the used CD route since you can get about 75 minutes of the Dominoes along with some Dickey Betts and Duane Allman jamming for about $6 (including shipping). Money well spent on this 5-song jam session.

Some of the graphics look real, and others you can tell are animation. Kind of like when you played video games at a young age, and you can tell the cars aren't real, cause they have a strange color to them, but that was only at a couple parts. Also the Nissan rolled a few times, yet they where able to restore it, which is definately fake. I know its a movie, but doesn't come close to how real fast and furious looks. Also when he got pulled over by the police he just got his body slammed against the police car a few times, and let go without a fine or jail time for doing 160mph.I would've given this movie 5 stars if the cars looked more realistic.

However, what exists is a choppy, extremely opinionated, narrow minded repetition of all the same facts that are better found in other sources. He mentions that Callas \\"mistakes artfullness for artistry\\" about 100 times too. He basically feels that the deepening of her interpretation as her voice grew weaker was not real, and that her lyric and dramatic interpretation became more false as time went on. As the book plods on rehashing the same old information we have read over and over again elsewhere.I own almost all the Callas biographies that have appeared in English, and I hated this book so much that I pulled out the photo section in the center to keep the pictures, and sent the book to the recycling center the day after I had the misfortune to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Say what?","review":"I must admit I understand very little of what Bob says in the interview.

All of the protagonists are well-behaved at the end of the story, and good things come to little children who control their emotions, are polite, and don't throw temper tantrums or complain.

They wish to spit, would rather trample. Sara lives in the attic of Miss Minchin's boarding school because she can't pay.My family was renting a special house on nine acre property. In front of my ground-level bay window hung a crystal prism. Small rainbows flurried across white carpet in the afternoon. The backyard was forest and meadow, with a pond where fish died in the winter. The homeowners were mask collectors, so faces were faces nailed to the trees. Ferns sprouted through the asphalt driveway. Dad showed me: plants were strong.In the book there's another girl, too. She's even more starved than Sara. The girl is lost in the snow, she'd do anything for a sweet roll! If only the book could deprive her of something more than shelter or food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"I thought A Little Princess was quite touching, the way Sara was very kind to everyone. It suprised me when she gave a beggar five hotbuns! A Little Princess was a quite enjoyable book. I think you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"A Little Princess is the best classic I've ever read! The story is very moving and inspirational. It always motivates me, and makes me think of how my problems shrink in perspective, next to hers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I really liked this book it fun to read and you will learn how to pretend things like being a princess"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every girl should read this.","review":"This book is one of my personal favorites. You immediately become attached to the little princess, cry for her through her struggles and rejoice in her strength of character and determination to be more than she appears."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Classic","review":"I discovered this book on a library shelf when I was about 9 years old. This book as well as The Secret Garden have since gained permanent shelf space in my library. What a wonderful book this is. It gently handles the inequities of the British class system of the Victorian/Edwardian period and creates a classic heroine in the process. It's a fairy tale and a parable all rolled into one. Considering the story was nearly a century old when I read it, this book will still be entertaining to any pre-teen girl you know who likes romanticism. A great gift for the girl in your life who has a vivid imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"OnE oF mY FaVoRiTe BoOk","review":"it is one of the best book i ever read. i really like sarah because she's really nice and a very good storyteller. i wish i could see the movie.tHe bEsT BoOk eVeR"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"If you think ME illustrated this great book (you can't look inside because it is still sealed in plastic in the bookstore) you're wrong. Only the cover is illustrated. What a rip-off"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired a Veggie-Tales video","review":"I wanted to read this book after learning that the recent Veggie-Tales video, \\"The Penniless Princess,\\" was an adaptation of it. It is a riches-to-rags-to-riches story, very sad in places, but with a very happy ending. The story involves friendship, the power of imagination to rise above adversity, and the keeping of promises. It's an enjoyable read for all ages. I didn't discover this book until I was an adult, but I would have loved it at 10, and I would have enjoyed reading it to and with my children, and I enjoyed it at 60-something. I highly recommend it. Note: This author also wrote \\"The Secret Garden,\\" another favorite that I discovered late in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story of childhood resilience","review":"This was my very first book I ever remembering receiving, so the story is very special to me, and very identifiable at the target age. It's an especially great story for kids growing up in somewhat dysfunctional home situation I think. It has a lot of childhood characters you will meet everywhere, and very clear values about what is good and bad. It's a great story of resilience and finding inner strength in a period of hopelessness, teaching the power of positive thinking and not letting your circumstances alter your humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful","review":"such a wonderful story full of adventure and fun....great read but then again i loved the secret garden so....and im in my 30s and cant wait to read more of her books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not receive the product pictured","review":"I received a different book than pictured. different publisher, different illustrator and an abridged version...very disapointing to receive something that is not exactly like what is pictured."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Princess","review":"I was very disappointed as I thought it was the complete edition of The Little Princess.

Then a few years later my uncle and his family gave me the Shirley Temple movie \\"The Little Princess\\".

I loved this great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This book is simply a masterpiece. I first read this book when I was 13 years old. It made me cry thinking of Sara Crewe's miserable life. But it became my favourite book. I have read this book over and over again in the past 20 yrs. And it never bores me. Now i find a different kind of pleasure in reading this book,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Burnett is a Gem!","review":"Frances Hodgson Burnett has written dozens of books, and The Little Princess is perhaps one of my most favorite. Burnett is a true children's author and I have loved every version of the book I have read and every movie I have seen. No little girl should grow up without reading this book at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book about hope","review":"This famous, wonderful book is about Sara Crewe, a seven-year-old girl sent to an English school, where she got all the riches, dolls, and dresses she wanted. Her friends started calling her the \\"little princess,\\" when she not only gave them her stories, imagination, and games, but also her kind heart and love. When Sara's father died and she was moved to the attic and became a scullery maid, the only thing that kept her going was her imagination. I think this marvelous book is for readers aged 7 to 152. It is about how there is always hope in even the worst of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"A Little Princess, by Francess Hodgsen Burnett is a must read for all ages. At the beginning, Sara is a rich girl and is the model student of her boarding school. When her father dies, she is left with no money and is turned into a scullery maid. Sara has to pretend her way out of her miserable life in the attic. In the end she woke up and saw her desires in her room. She found out who the person was that did it. She moved in with him because he was the friend of her father. He took care of her and she turned back into a little princess. This is a suspencfull and exiting book. You won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite childhood book!!","review":"Both the shirley temple movie and the recent one do not do this book credit at ALL! I have read this book over 20 times since the age of seven, and im now 20. I still think of it and smile. Neither actress is Sara, Sara is this solemn, introspective little girl, who creates a world for herself full of goodness and 'the magic' because she is so good herself. Neither actress conveyed that, but on to the book. A Little Princess is one of the greaest chldren's stories ever written, I still feel sad when I remember how she says, \\"and I was right next door all this time\\", and excited when I think about the dimaond mines. Its just a book that stays with you like that. I adored it and I reccomend it to any little (or big) girl. If you want to see a movie that actually reflects the TRUE story rent the BBC version, it isnt flashy, or a big budget movie or anything but it is the EXACT story with the perfect actress as Sara."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good edition.","review":"Well set out. Easily readable. A few drawings. Very nice. Written in 1907, it is still readable and applicable today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great childhood classic","review":"This was one of my favorites when I was a kid and I cherish it as an adult. A must have for little girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, bad book","review":"We were buying this book for my adult daughter to keep on her bookshelf to treasure as this is one of her favorite stories. We wanted hard copy but couldn't find it. were upset to see it wasn't the type of paperback we expected. It appears more like a workbook and doesn't fit well on a shelf. The font size is too large."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book always warms my heart.","review":"I could read it again and again. One of the great classics. Sara Crewe will make you want to act like a princess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I hated this book, and it's a classic. Sue me.Now don't think it's because I'm too old and cynical. I read this book at the age of about nine, and I still hated it. Why? Because Sara Crewe is the Original Mary Sue. She was so sweet and speshul and wonderful and flawless that she made me gag. She never does anything wrong, anyone who doesn't like her is TEH EVOL!!!11!!, and everyone else thinks she's the best thing since silk stockings. Even at such a young age I was revolted by this one-dimensional character who was obviously being held up for our adulation. And I don't give a damn about it being an old novel. It still blows chunks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought Jesus Lizard broke up","review":"I wish I could come up with a more interesting description, but every time I listen to this, I think of the Jesus Lizard. The woman's \\"singing\\" style is very David Yow-like. (I couldn't believe it was a woman; I assumed deranged man until reading the liner notes.) It's not only the singer -- the music is often similar to JL. Think slow JL with keyboards thrown in on some tracks. I'm usually very put-off with bands that sound like other bands, but not so in this case, as I doubt it was their intention. Worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"great CD","review":"This CD is really good. Fiona's voice has a lot of strength. Songs like Sleep to Dream, Shadowboxer, Criminal, and my personal favorite, Never is a Promise, show off her talent. Some songs are bitter, but they exhibit her vocal power. Upon the release of her new CD I must ask, Why have you waited so long to buy this CD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiona is addictive","review":"I first bought Fiona's CD with many others and neglected to listen to it for years. Big mistake! When I finally put it in my CD player, I was amazed... I fell in love with the CD after a few times of listening to it. I can't part with this album for more than a day or so because I have to listen to it... Positively addictive. She reminds me of Joni Mitchell with a modern twist. Her use of instruments (not to mention her voice) is absolutly incredible. Her voice is smooth and sultry and sings of hitting rock bottom and redemption. She is often reminiscent, sometimes brash but always beautiful. You will be missing an incredible artist if you don't buy her CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique and seductive voice that draws you in","review":"Fiona Apple has a unique and seductive voice that will draw in a listener to her unique sound. This CD highlights her low, earthy unique singing voice and is delightful to listen to. My favorite on this CD is \\"Criminal\\" in which she confesses that she has been a \\"bad bad girl\\" and another great song is \\"The First Taste\\", when reading the verses of her songs, the listener can tell that she writes about her own experiences and her emotion in these are evident.Fiona Apple has been accused of being to serious about things and for creating a stir at public events, well I can neither praise her or condemn her, all I can do is enjoy her songs and the way she presents herself, and I believe she does quite well in both."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful freshman album from the talented Miss Apple","review":"Fiona Apple's \\"Tidal\\" is the soundtrack to my life. Every song on the CD is beautiful. Apple's sultry voice brings life to lyrics that read like Keats. One can't help but sing along to \\"Criminal;\\" after all, aren't all us girls \\"bad, bad girls\\" every once in a while? It's incredible that these songs were written and performed by a nineteen-year-old. Apple brings a very adult wisdom and worldliness to her songwriting, and the end result is a CD which you will listen to all the way through and applaud at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic, Metaphoric, Dark, Amazing","review":"All of her cds are amazing. It's as if she's ripping out a piece of her life and showing her bare soul in each song. She's so open with her emotions and honest about her vulnerabilities. I've seen her interviewed and she's a lot like myself. Unable to express herself verbally but on paper she's a mastermind. Her music forces you to open your mind and not take her words as they come surface wise. She's deep and you have to dig for the meaning through her clever metaphors. For the people who asked does she play piano, yes she does. On youtube there is a video of her at 6 or 7 playing the piano for her father. She's always been very talented, different and wise beyond her years.If you love poetry, you'll love all of her albums. She writes every song and is NOT manufactured."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Didn't Leave My CD Player for 3 Months","review":"fiona apple went through a lot in her life for such a young person, and you can hear it in her music & lyrics, which is nothing but depressing. her piano skills are AMAZING, to say the least and her voice is deep a soulful as well as high and poigent. she is one of the best female artists out there, & very under appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing & Taunting, Sexy & Sultry","review":"Can't believe this album was her first. Undoubtedly wise beyond her years, Apple's rhythmic melodies and smooth velvety voice are a joy to behold. And her lyrics? Bold, brutal and honest to the core, but the jazzy overtones set for a more mature message than a rant. I'm a late bloomer to her music, but happy to say, better late than never."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not that craked up as it was made to be!","review":"i found four songs that i liked on the whole cd. maybe i am just too picky but doesn't seem like she sings over the same things?i don't know but if your thinking about buying this cd...save your money and buy her singles. don't waist $15.00 like i did...if i had known i would have just bought the single of shadowboxer, criminal, sleep to dream and maybe sullen girl. please hear the cd on amazon before you waist your precious money.because i gave the cd two stars is that i like four songs on it and i must give Ms. Apple that credit. she is very talented but i think she should have thought about the music she was putting on her record first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I ordered this because I just love Fiona Apple! It came on time and it was in great condition. This is an amazing purchase and I love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahh! Bliss.....","review":"Tidal is a lovely album, and for me can only be likened to the sensation of lying on a settee in that near sleep stage, warmed by an autumn sun streaming through the window. It is that post-lunch satisfaction, the lazy smoke off a fire of piled leaves on a still evening. It is all of these and more. The songs that particularly stand out for me are 'Slow Like Honey' and 'A Child is Gone'. I must admit that I love this moment in her musical life, for, in my humble opinion, 'Tidal' and 'When The Pawn' show acres of raw awareness that 'Extraordinary Machine' unfortunately appears to have lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sultry and soulful","review":"Powerful piano pieces and sultry vocals dominate this album as soon as you press play. Apple's supple voice carries the thoughful lyrics for each track. There is much to read between the lines of this songstress' (then) 18 yr old offerings. The simplicity of her ensambles meld the instruments used without drowing out the emotion packed vocals. Long after listening to this album the lucious voice and songs will stay with you with an intensity begging to be listened to again.This is a good album to pop in to mellow the mood. The songs flow well from one track to another. Sparks of her maturity and musicianship come and go but this is definitely a wise choice to add to any collection that embraces classy offerings. It's an album that stays with you as I have had this in my collection for many years and was inspired while listening to it again to offer my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"lush, dreamy, & atmospheric with furious sorrow.","review":"what an amazing album this is. it's gotten me through a lot. there is a certain undeniable beauty to these songs that rolls over you like waves. & fiona is such an amazing writer of meaningful & honest lyrics without being over the top. anyone with good taste will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album - maybe the best new singer around.","review":"I love this album. Fiona's voice is beautiful, the lyrics are great and the music is fabulous (amazing if you realize Fiona was 18 year old when she wrote Tidal).Filled with emotion and contained range, this is a great album, wich I recomend to everyone who has feelings... about the 'corny sound' in some reviews, well it depends on the way you hear the music. These are intimate, personal songs and the lyrics are not pretty and lovely - they are about sad experiences and dark moods. I just love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Criminal' my favorite","review":"This entire cd is excellent, but I must admit that 'Criminal' stands out as especially good. Can admitting your wrong, and even beating yourself up about it, be sexy? She obviously thinks so, and after listening to this song I can't help but agree. All around a great listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing first work","review":"This is Fiona's first album. Although not yet fully developed, her talent was already impressive here.Criminal was a big hit, but the album is great all the way, with nice and easy listening songs all through it. Her voice blends so perfectly with the piano chords and Brion's producing is high quality. The band that plays on it is also extremely professioanl.And let's face it, how many real talented women do we have nowadays singing rock? By far my favourite female voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She was how old when this was recorded?","review":"This album is highly listenable. Fiona shows a remarkable amount of range in both her singing and the mastery of style. It boggles the mind to think an album this complex and mature came from a girl who had not yet turned 18. Her voice is haunting, and her lyrics are chilling. In fact, if there is one shortcoming of this record, it is that the lyrics, undoubtably sincere though they may be, sound affected because the themes explored are so engrained in every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd rate it higher if this went more than 5 *'s!","review":"This c.d is the best c.d!I have never heard anyone write such beautiful words and music in my life!!!This woman is a musical genius-she expresses herself in her songs none of us thought was possible.I don't think I will ever meet anyone that can express their thoughts,feelings,and emotions as well as Ms. Apple.You have to buy this especially for the song\\"Never is a Promise\\"-that song is defintely a masterpeice by all means!I have owned this c.d for years and I have never ever gotten tired of it because I like every single song on this album-she is awesome!Like I said-no one can express themselves in more beautiful words,this is a must have.....There aren't words to describe this c.d and how beautifully it is written and composed-Thank you Ms. Apple for providing such a moving album......."},{"rating":"2","title":"A talented lyracist with a lot of pain...","review":"I really love this album for it's lyrics, but I think Fiona's singing could use a little help. She often sings flat. However, a lot of these songs are smooth, sexy and an overall delight to listen to. It's definitely worth the eleven bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgy, Angry, and Blue","review":"The girl has a *great* voice, the best lyrics around, and some out-and-out fabulous songs. She is edgy and Blue-sy and can rock as well. Many of her songs are in the Blues tradition and she sings them skillfully and soulfully. My favories, however, are the angry ones that she belts out with everything she's got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I am completely in love with Fiona Apple's voice. She could probably be the most talented singer in this world. Her voice is amazing. It's so powerful and amazing. Her songwriting is amazing as well. I bought her second CD first. But I can say I like this one better. No matter what, I will always love this girl's voice. I can't wait til she makes more music!This CD is just amazing. Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful fiona","review":"tidal has to be one of the best albums to come out in years.fiona apple just amazes with her beautiful voice and piano skills.in her debut album,she has a mature voice that makes you think she's a veteran and not a young 19-year old.this is an essential cd to add to your collection.recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tidal","review":"Overall a boring album. Fiona Apple writes good lyrics and okay music. Musically it is not very compelling and she tries to be a bit jazzy, bit rockish and poppish and even though she manages to be that all she doesn't do it very well. Her voice is irritating and constant moaning doesn't help either. Her Piano playing is overlooked by the mass production which often distract the listners from the music. Obviously talented but this album isn't very good in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Performance","review":"Although Fiona Apple's Tidal is not a new release, it is a solid record. It has a little something for everyone. Even my mom (almost 80 yrs old) likes portions of it. My impression whenever I listen to Fiona's music is that it is fresh, (even after 5 years of listening to it) very well produced and the arrangements still team me up! This keyboard oriented music and deep lyrics make this a great CD for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!","review":"i THOUGHT this album was going to be one of my favorites when i bought it, but when i listened to it, i found that it was just way too BORING. and what is with her voice in \\"never is a promise\\"? she needs to seriously take the money she is making from this album and invest it into some singing lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not perfect....","review":"Almost every song on this CD is a rock ballad. It's cool how they're not dumb BSB lyrics, but sung with real passion, and REAL emotion. I think the best part of this CD is that Apple wrote all of the lyrics when she was only 17. (Most sugar-pop groups, like N Sync are much older and don't at all) and that's why she impresses me so much. Yet sometimes her soulful ballads can get a little tedious, since they're one right after another. But if you're in the mood for those kinds of songs, or if you just dig them in general, then this CD is your saving grace. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"What can I say about this album? Fiona has an amazing voice, writes beautiful music and has some of the best lyrics I've ever heard. She has a style all on her own and does NOT sound like Alanis Morissette! Get this album! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD in the universe . . .","review":"Fiona Apple is my all-time favorite artist. She has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard in my life, and her songs and lyrics are amazing. I think that everyone who gave her bad reviews should get their head out of their Britney Spears obsession and listen to some REAL music . . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant talent from such a young girl","review":"A great CD if you like unique and intelligent lyrics (rare in most pop music today) and an overall great sound, but some of the songs really put you to sleep..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something about that song...","review":"I've had the song \\"Criminal\\" running through my head for days now. Something about it perfectly captures the way you can feel sometimes -- like a crazy combination of rage and ennui in relationships. Anyway, the song was so constant in my head that I had to run out today and buy this CD. Listening to it and the rest of the songs has been somewhat cathartic. A great emotional experience through the music. What else can you ask for from a CD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tidal","review":"I bought this disc back in 1996 after hearing a lot of buzz & hype about Fiona Apple. After my first listen and now 10 years later, I still had the same reaction, \\"Wow - she's only 18 writing songs like this!?\\" Even today it is so refreshing to hear such poetically beautiful lyrics set to original composition. Her smoky voice is haunting and while she is not the best vocalist I've ever heard; like another great singer/songwriter, Laura Nyro, Fiona sings HER songs with such passion & conviction that eclipses the fact that she's not a vocal powerhouse. I also love the fact that she so successfully mixed different genres of music to create own sound.My favorite tracks: THE FIRST TASTE, SLOW LIKE HONEY, CRIMINAL, PALE SEPTEMBER & NEVER IS A PROMISE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiona Apple - Tidal","review":"Fiona is an amazing artist! She writtes great lyrics, she has a beautiful and strong voice and she plays piano very well!Sleep to dream is a great song, i love the start and she sounds angry!Sullen Girl is a beautiful song with great lyrics, fiona sounds sad, this is about her rape!Shadowboxer is a very jazzy song, good lyrics!Criminal is porbably the rockest song on the album, the piano gives this amazing feeling to the song! great lyrics once gain!Slow like Honey, is a slow song and has a jazz feeling!The First Taste has this beat that you just can't help but start dancing!Never is a promise has amazing lyrics, very beautiful!!!The Child is gone has again a jazz feeling...very good!Pale September is absolutely beautiful, she sounds calm and sad.Carrion finishes well the album, the chorus part is amazing!All this album is stunning, but when the pawn...is better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great debut from that wacky fiona girl :)","review":"this is a very beatuiful & underated album right here from that wacky fiona apple girl. sadly fiona had to go thru what alot of young talented music makers have to go thru. i.e. being throw into the spotlight and hyped to the moon. this can hurt an artist no doubt (and i see it happen all the time). fiona is cool thou. and the singles and videos on here were a great change of pace from what was getting heavy mtv play at the time. it's a great piece of music from start to finish. she has an amazing voice!!! and lets face it she's a nutcase and that's always cool :) people with problems seem to make the best music but sadly they also seem to get burned :("},{"rating":"2","title":"I love every song","review":"I love this album it is thoughtful and fun and i find that Idon't have to skip songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?","review":"I must have had a brain cramp the day I bought this c.d. Usually I wait until I hear a few songs from and album before I purchase it. Unfortunately I liked \\"Criminal\\" for about 2 seconds, and I shelled out the bucks. It's not that this is exactly a bad c.d., it just fails to strike the right chords. Every song on it is sooooo close to likeable that I have listened to the c.d. more than once, in an attempt to enjoy the music. Sadly, this is the only c.d. I have ever regretted buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two and a half, actually","review":"When I first heard Fiona Apple's voice it stopped me dead in my tracks. She really does have a beautiful and captivating voice. Unfortunately, her song writing doesn't follow suit. Most of her lyrics are pretentious and trite. Although her voice betrays her age, her songwriting and arranging completely give it away. It might be worth it to buy it used, but let's put it this way; I lent this CD out to a fellow employee who quit shortly thereafter and of course, took my CD with him. I found I didn't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"So, I first heard Ms. Apple performing \\"Slow Like Honey\\" on a radio program called 'Acoustic Cafe' late in 1996. I was intrigued--had never heard of her before--so I wrote the name down and kept an eye out for a CD.Months later, I found \\"Tidal\\" at my local record store. A bit concerned about buying a CD on the strength of one live song, I hesitantly made my purchase. BIG MISTAKE......This is, without a doubt, the WORST CD purchase I have made in years!Some of the more off-key crooning makes my stomach churn in agony. (\\"Shadow Boxer\\" should come with the same warnings that are printed on bottles of Syrup of Ipecac.)Hopefully, now that she's a mega-star, dear Fiona will invest in singing lessons.Needless to say, I sold this disc to back to the shop immediately. I'm just glad to have gotten six bucks back.Save YOUR money......buy a Sarah Vaughn disc if you want some genuine emotive soul crooning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I received this album as a gift over a year ago. The only listenable songs were \\"Shadowboxer\\" and \\"Criminal,\\" and even those weren't so great. I already had \\"Criminal\\" on the 1998 Grammy Nominees album, so why did I need to have it on two albums? It just wasn't worth my time. I only had this album for a week and a half before I sold it to a used CD store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I thought the music was murky. Perhaps not my style. Tried to trade it in but it ws politely shunted aside by the guy buying discs. That told me alot. She must have a loyal following it did nothing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"the pawn hasn't hit yet","review":"I have a lot of respect for Ms. Fiona. However.. I was very disappointed over Tidal after hearing the magnificient When the Pawn. It is clear how much Fiona has evolved between those two albums, because on Tidal she can barely form a tangible melody--her voice tends to jump.The only song that is fully enjoyable is Criminal, with it's light-hearted jazz-rock beat and Fiona's voice gliding across the melody. She performs it very well. On the other hand, \\"Sleep to Dream,\\" the opener of the album, sounds like an experimental hip-hop track. \\"Never is a Promise\\" is earnest but too self-righteous to touch listener's minds. \\"Carrion,\\" the closer, is really jazzy but does not hit an emotional note.If you want to enjoy Fiona Apple at her best, I reccommend When the Pawn Instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"very mature for her age just an all around good CD","review":"Her voice is very mature and the music has an element of jazz It is a slower CD, her voice is calming and the lyrics are great. You can tell she has passion in what she talks about without her screaming or whining about things. She seems like she has been hurt in life and love. All the songs are great!! You can feel the music. It's just to bad she only had one real hit. She deserves more."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The First Taste\\" of a \\"Sullen Girl\\".","review":"Whenever I think of this album, besides thinking that it's amazing, I think how of how deep \\"Fiona Apple\\" is beyond her years. She was 18 when this came out! The smoothness of this album, the musicianship, and of course that voice, all simply stunning. The first track \\"Sleep To Dream\\" has one of my favorite lyrics: \\"You say love is a hell and you cannot bare, and I say give me mine back, and then go there for all I care\\". The hit here is \\"Criminal\\", but other songs like \\"Shadowboxer\\" and \\"Never Is A Promise\\" are just as good. I highly suggest getting this album. It'll go great with your \\"Tori Amos\\" and \\"Maxwell\\" cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Taste of the Darker Side","review":"I love this album because it is not \\"Britney Spears,\\" get up and dance, snap your fingers music. \\"Tidal\\" represents the part of life that makes you sit down and hold your head in your hands, and it is a much needed breath of smokey air in a bubblegum society. Songs such as \\"Sleep to Dream\\" and the wonderful \\"Shadowboxer\\" show that this young woman has much to offer in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could anyone question the greatness of this CD?","review":"This CD is one of the best ever created.

This is really awful music. I can't believe anyone actually LIKES this stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressive, even for an 18 year old.","review":"Although I won't say that she's trying to be Tori Amos, no one could acheive that, she definetely is not doing anything so impressive. Her lyrics sound even more self-obsessed than Tori's. It's like she's trying to be philosophical, but it's not quite working. I feel the same anger and guilt she does, but I want a singer who demands and includes me at the same time, whereas Fiona Apple just seems to be venting her anger towards me. I want you to understand my pain and make me feel better, not to feel guilty for your pain! If she got some singing lessons, actually played the piano (does she just say she plays the piano, 'cause I've never seen her do so), and didn't try to solve her problems with rage but with understanding, she would be a much better artist. I respect her though for trying. Good luck Fiona in discovering you might actually have more talent than you show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiona Made A Fool Out Of Herself","review":"Fiona sounds ridiculously stupid singing these songs in her low, monotone, dragging voice.

That's all I could say when I first listened to this cd. I have had it for at least a year and a half, and had to buy a new one because the old one was so played that it wouldn't work in my cd player. Fiona's voice is strong, smoky and makes you want to sing with her. This cd has changed my life, as pathetic as that sounds. I have always loved singing, and this cd made me realize that it's something that I want to do for the rest of my life. I laugh at the few people who dare to say that her singing is flat at times. They just can't hear the background notes that she's harmonizing with. It's okay. To those people I recommend that they stick with simple artists like LeAnn Rimes or Joan Osbourne. They are obviously not ready to appreciate what Fiona sings and the ways she makes the music melt together. Nothing's better than harmonizing with your favorite song, and that's what this cd lets me do. Looking forward to more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just heard 'Fast as you can!'","review":"MAN!

You'll probably tighten the banjo bolt down until the whole piece is somewhat stable. That's where you will go wrong. Gas spews all over the place and those delicate little plastic washers are warped and wont seal anymore. Too bad they dont throw in another pair. So you postpone your project until Ace Hardware opens so you can buy some copper crush washers and try to salvage the 15 bucks you're already in the hole; and just to ensure you make progress on you spend some extra cash on a 5/8-20 hose barb connection in case you have to scrap everything and go back to the basics. It's a shame, because the metal part is actually built better than I expected. I was really afraid it was chromed plastic.

The first was purchased about 4 years ago, and is the best scale we've ever owned. Amazingly accurate. This one is not on the same level. It reads within 1-3 lbs. of true weight, which is better than most. The first was manufactured in Europe; this one is made in China. Perhaps their QC is not yet fully in place... We'd gladly pay more for better accuracy, but know of no other (other than a doctor's scale) that's even this good, so we'll be keeping it. But it does look beautiful, and we've had no other problems with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erratic Readings","review":"The scale looks great! But if you are looking for consistent readings, look elsewhere. It will read within a couple of pound of your weight, but for most people such accuracy is inadequate. Their spec is .2 pounds. Their quality control was sleeping at the wheels when they shipped my unit out. Also, I would not recommend you weigh anything less than 20 pounds. The inconsistency goes off the scale!The position of the feet on the scale appears to make a difference in reading. The scale was supposedly designed to correct for such imbalance, but I sure did not notice it.All their printed material comes in every language in the world except ENGLISH! I guess they assumed that all English readers intuitively know how to use the scale.One of the reasons I purchased this scale was to weigh my luggage for airline checkin. Positioning the bags on the scale is cumbersome and again the reading was unreliable.

After the batteries are removed the unit resets itself and operates normally for awhile then reverts to the low battery power warning. I would assume the scale has some software issues and falsely defaults to the an erroneous battery warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronic Scale","review":"Scale appears to be somewhat accurate but has recently given false messages about a low battery condition. Although a volt meter tested the lithium cells batteries to be fine, you may need to remove and reinsert batteries to stop this false reading by the scale several times. This leads me to believe the electronics on this precision instrument may not be up to par when it comes to weight measurement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent readouts","review":"I've owned this scale for 2 years. It is stylish, the digital display is easy to read. It continues to work, in the sense that it continues to display something when you step on it. However the problem is that the measurements are inconsistent. They can vary by 6 to 8 pounds in successful measurements.This morning I stepped on it and got the exact same reading 4 times in a row. Then I stepped on it a fifth time and it read 4 pounds heavier. It then held that reading two more times. On the 8th time, it went back to the first measurement.A couple of days ago I stepped on it 6 times and got 4 different measurements, with a difference of 7 pounds between the lightest and heaviest.So it only gives me a rough idea of what I weigh. If that is all you seek, then it does a good job. But if you are trying to determine if you are gaining or losing weight from day to day, from week to week, it is almost worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last a year","review":"This scale has died after less than a year of use.I figured that a scale manufactured by such a reputable company would be reliable.

Don't get me wrong, I love Kid 606, Autechre, Fennesz, and their ilk as much as the next cat.

No accessories, especially memory cards, work with the system that worked with the old xbox. The system is loud, with an annoying \\"whine\\" when the DVD spins up. The D pad is very poorly designed. The old white and black buttons have been replaced with shoulder buttons (some games this may be a plus). I bought several of the top games, and they are just prettier than the old xbox games, not better. Same old crap under the pretty wrapping. There is no \\"Wow!\\" factor with this system.

After seeing a commercial for Resistence: Fall of Man for the PS3, in my opinion, the 360 graphics looked better. The reason is because of lighting and detail. The 3 main factors you should look for in a game is: the framerate, character detail, and lighting. I think that currently, the Xbox 360 is the better console ovarall.

It stopped working within several days. We have returned it to the manufacturer several times and each time another defective system has been sent to us. I would not recommend anyone purchasing this product. We have been very disappointed. I would have rated this item with zero stars but the program would not allow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"XBOX 360 Has Serious Problems","review":"We bought an XBOX 360 in April. The graphics are great, and the games are fun. But don't ever download updates and make sure you buy the extended warranty. In order to continue playing XBOX live, the system required us to download an update. Shortly thereafter, the system began locking up regularly. As the problem got worse, it locked up while playing Gears of War and the DVD head hit the disk while it was spinning and put a big scratch all the way around the disk - rendering it useless. A day later, the system would no longer even start. Microsoft won't admit responsibility and forced us to pay $140 to get our game system fixed. So, the XBOX 360 didn't really cost $399, it cost $539 plus shipping. Perhaps Playstation 3 or Wii will be more reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great system!","review":"I've been out of gaming for many years until I went to my friend's house and saw him playing COD3 on the 360 in HD. I was in awe. The next week I went out and bought one. I have not regretted it once. The only problem I have with the 360 is that EVERYTHING that you need costs extra. The HD-DVD player ($179), the wireless adapter ($99), extra controller ($40), XBox Live ($50/yr). As far as available games and game play goes though, I love it and would buy one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior gaming experience","review":"I purchased the Xbox 360 for my teenage son. He already has the original Xbox system and wanted to try the new experience with the internet included.

Only this time when I went to reset the system I had 3 red flashing lights go on and the console was no longer responding. Fortunatly although my waranty is over this is common problem and microsoft is going to repair it. I am somewhat annoyed about it because it will take 3-4 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE! Buy the warranty.....or you'll be so sorry...","review":"We have had our 360 for a few months now and were relatively pleased with it. Although there really arent that many great games out for it right now. Really should have waited for more. Our system is dead now, it locked up with the notorious \\"Ring of Death\\" after freezing a few times. Of course, Microsoft will gladly repair it for 129 dollars but even thats not guaranteed. Check out the XBOX forum, this is a common problem that they will not address. If you buy this machine you are in for a lot of hassles. Plan on buying the warranty and on having to contact microsoft repeatedly to get your system fixed, not to mention the down time while waiting for them to \\"refurbish\\" it.

The tech support was not helpful. I have had trouble with the games freezing during play and now none of my five games will play at all. I have had to return my console to microsoft for repair. When I took the console to UPS, the staff said they have seen tons of returns of these systems. I find the length of the warranty (six months) to be alarming as I won't have much (if any) time to insure proper play once it is returned from repair. I would not recommend this system to anyone. The price is too steep for such a poorly developed product with such little support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Counsel EVER!","review":"I love this thing some much more than my Xbox, it's unreal.

The games have a high definition but the gameplay is not as good. The console get crashes in the middle of a lot of games and need to be restart it. Anyway this is not what I expect for the prize. I'm still waiting for the always stable console, Playstation 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"ps3 vs xbox 360","review":"the success of PS2 proved one thing, you dont have to have superior technonogy or graphics to be on top in the console buisiness. What matters is getting a better selection of games and releasing your system at a critical time. This generation, sony and microsoft appear to have switched roles; microsoft releasing a system early with over 20 games available at release, and sony releasing an (apparently) superior system way later.I believe that the PS3 will outsell the 360 for two reasons: first, those looking for the best features (previously xbox customers) will find a more powerful system in the PS3. 2nd, most casual gamers will want to be able to play their old games on their new console, leading most back to sony (but myself back to microsoft). thusfar, the 360 is sold out about everywhere, so it is possible that yet again, the release date will triumph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it worth the price","review":"While the Xbox is great technically, you need games that are engaging to make the hardware useful. Are the racing games that much better than what's available on the PS2? So far I don't think so. However there are a lot of unique features that the developers haven't completely taken advantage of. The true test is whether or not there will be a lot of choices one year from now. The life span should be at least 5 years for this unit. For now I have a few games I play but I'll reserve judgement until there is another bunch of games on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after six months","review":"I bought the XBOX 360 and had a pretty good time with it. Unfortunately it died after six months (red ring of death). Given the sheer number of people having problems with the unit, my guess is that there is something systematically wrong with it. I'd suggest waiting until there is a full hardware revision before buying.If you're going to buy, buy somewhere with a good return policy. I was able to return mine after six months of use to Costco for a full refund!

Microsoft just told me that the replacement 360 is out of the warranty period as I purchased the original 360 more than a year ago. I replied that the replacement 360 has a warranty of its own that is separate and apart from the original 360 as it is a completely different console.

The update was meant to crash modded 360's, which would need to be sent in for repairs. Then Microsoft would tell the modifiers that they had no obligation to repair the systems because of a breach of liability. The only problem is that the update is bricking 360's that aren't modded, leaving honest gamers with a $400 paperweight. Their solution is to charge $140 to ship the system for repairs.This is horrible business practice and I have nothing but anger towards Microsoft for ruining my system (they have admitted fault even) and asking for my hard earned money to fix it.

First of all, with all the people that will sit in lines even if it is below freezing, will get the system. Secondly, the system is being overpriced on online retailers. I am not going to buy the Xbox 360 for $5,000 dollars on Ebay, or $1,000 dollars right here on Amazon. For god sakes, you could get a stinkin Plasma tv for that money. Third, almost all the games currently on Xbox 360 suck. There are no blockbusters like Halo out. Fourth, all the people that bought the xbox 360 the first day were Ebay freaks who wanted to amp up their profits a bit. None of them wanted to play the thing. Lastly, people are even filing lawsuits cause the Xbox 360 is so called not doing what it says it is supposed to do.

However, I recently received the \\"red ring of death\\", just before they announced the 3 year warranty. As fun as the system is, 4-6 weeks of down time being repaired is just not my idea of normal operating for a product. There are estimates of 25% and 33% hardware failure rate. This is sad. I have a hard time shelling out for more games I may not be able to play in the future. If you decide to buy this product, I would strongly recommend buying a product replacement plan from your store. I know some stores offer them, but it's going to cost you another $60 to $100 dollars.

Anyone considering getting this system NEEDS to get the extended warranty. They are notorious for breaking down. I know three other people that own a 360. Out of the 4 of us 3 of our systems have broken down all within months of owning one. MS will replace it for free as many times as needed for 1 year (And yes if you look on the web there are plenty of people who claim they are on their 3rd or 4th 360). After that one year it will cost you roughly $160 for repair and shipping.

I purchased a 360 about a month ago because I kept hearing how good the system is and how great the games play and I just got tired of waiting for some of the premium ps3 games to come out. Rented some games and they played great. I could definitely understand why folks are fans of the system and I was on the edge of becoming a convert, until....I got the rings of death. You can say I was not happy and had some choice words. Talked to the MS customer service (which was not very fun at all) and they offered to send me a box to ship it out and I declined it because I did not want to deal with the reliability issues of the system. I ended up taking it back to the store for a refund. I will stick w my ps3 that I have not had any problems with at all. I may pick up another 360 later down the road when MS fixes whatever problems the current system has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tips!!!!!!","review":"Ok. Here are some tips! Now. If you put your power box, the thing connected for the power of the 360, hang it up, like have the side that is already attached to the box, and hang it up, or sit it over or on top of a box vertical, it should not overheat. But then, one time i left my 360 on for like, 5 days straight. and it overheated. so then, i took some celansafe dust remover, and b;ew it into the back of the 360's holes, and bam, it started! It was a micacle. try this and it will work!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What undeserved hype!!!!","review":"A little prelude to my review. One of my neighbors is a game developer who works for a company that makes games for the Xbox, Xbox 360 and MSN network (mostly downloadable content). He told me that his company currently has 4 Xbox 360s and he warned that I should wait until all the bugs are ironed out before I buy one myself.Ok, now onto my review. I don't understand why people would buy this system at this moment. There are no must play game for the 360 and that's the bottom line. Also, one of the reasons why you can't find one is that people are buying these things to solely to sell, thus creating an entirely new class of middlemen who you can find on ebay and craigslist. This in turn makes the people who are forking over $400 to get this system actually believe that they are getting a great \\"bargain\\" when compared to what people are paying on ebay.Trust me folks. Just wait 'til spring when some more games come out or wait for the PS3. You really aren't missing much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful gaming system","review":"I actually just got this system recently so I wouldn't know about all the problems that many are having with overheating and other issues. However I have quite a number of friends who own the xbox 360. Two of my friends had their xbox360 break post 2005. Coincidentally both of them had their xbox set up vertically. Correct me if I'm wrong but aren't those holes on the side to vent the air so the xbox360 keeps cool? If you set it up vertically doesn't that block air from getting in and out? Just a thought.But the system itself is really awesome. I own a 40\\" Sony Bravia LCD TV and the graphics are mind blowing. I only have two games now since I just purchased my system. Gears of War and Madden 2007, both are truly amazing. You need a HDTV to fully enjoy everything that this system offers.

However after 5 months of owning the X-Box 360 the hard drive crashed and after talking to someone in India, I realized I have a paperweight on my hands.Needless to say, they do burn real nice and give off alot of magnificent flames, that's about the only thing good I can say about the Microsoft product X-Box 360.Stay with Sony or get a Wii, but please don't invest in an X-Box 360.

Eventually you can argue with them to fix your Xbox but they will not replace the game that it burns. They make you pay for shipping to their repair shop which takes 2 weeks.

If you like giving knew author's a try why not this one? My advice is that you go to the Library or borrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiffany, this story is about you! You Are The Hottest Summer","review":"This is a true story about a woman in Detroit named Tiffany. She was the hottest firecracker you'd ever want to see but she didn't have no morals. She would mess around with anybody's man until one of them gave her A.I.D.S. Then her A.I.D.S doctor started having a affair with her and he died of A.I.D.S but she is still living. Its an ok book but the real life story is a mess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SIZZLE!","review":"KUDOS TO MS. WILLIAMS ON HER DEBUT BOOK! EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT! EXCELLENT. THE SUBJECT MATTER IS TIMELY AND MUST BE ADDRESSED IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.

It was suggested and selected, by our book club 'Sista's In Books' and we actually reside here in Detroit. I know we will have a LOT to discuss at our monthly meeting. If you want a book full of drama and suspense, I recommend The Hottest Summer Ever Known. You will NOT be disappointed. Great job Ms. Valencia Williams!!!By the way, my husband was upset because I could'nt turn the nite-lite out and read until 5 a.m. one night. LOL!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Read!!","review":"I hated this book from moment I started the first page. Ms. Williams' characters are one-dimensional and the whole story reads like a week's worth of Jerry Springer episodes. I understand that Ms. Williams believes this book to be a cautionary tale about sex and relationships, but it is not successful in the least bit. There are also many errors in word usage and several forms of punctuation are used improperly throughout the book.There is no \\"word craft\\" to this story -- no metaphors, descriptive language, turn of phrase, anything to make this book a piece of prose or literature. It is just a raunchy tale of sex, deception, and stereotypes with characters that have no redeeming qualities. I tried to get into this book because Ms. Williams is a fellow Detroiter who did have the guts and tenacity to see her book through to the published stage, however, I cannot recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra special treatment for your dog!","review":"I have purchased (2) of these now!

I was a little skeptical, but it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business","review":"I love this book. Actually I read it a few years ago and gave it away and decided I wanted to read it again and keep it forever. Dolly is so awesome and so honest, very very good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dolly a Disappointment!","review":"Shucks, I was hopin' for so much more. This book is just too sanitary for me. This gal has been around and seen a lot more than she talks about, and I am not talkin' jest sex here. This woman has more talent than half of Hollywood put together. She is a hurricane, but she comes off like a mouse in this tome. She is the most beautiful woman in the world over 50, I am sure of it, both inside and out. I'll wait 'til she's 80 and writes her REAL memoirs. Dolly, you have the greatest lips in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a rip off","review":"The information contained in this so-called \\"biography'is available on the internet free of charge and certainly not worth the price I paid to download it. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read.","review":"I read this in my teen years and saw it as a used sale on amazon. It was fun to reread this book. Martin Caidin has written a really fun story, action, adventure and drama. What more can you ask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful flute!","review":"This flute is beautiful. It does not look \\"tarnished\\" as some people are putting it. It is actually prettier than my current flute. The tone is also amazing. I bought this because my flute recently broke at Marching Band practice, so I thought I might as well upgrade to an intermediate instrument since I am at the peak of my High School band career. It is packaged very well. You guys get a great deal for a modest price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book to Understand Emotions","review":"This book simply gives us the best self-help method to cure depression and anxiety. The author shows a step-by-step approach to use our emotional wounds to our benefits. He tells us honestly how we can integrate our mind and body to gain emotional power. I found this book very helpful and believe you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call that black???","review":"I don't know what black means to Dataproducts. But this ink is no where near black. It's between a deep shade of navy blue and a dark grey color. FAR from the real solid black you get from the original HP cartridges. What's worst, the ink bleeds alot on regular paper, even the ones with minimal fibers. Like the other user said, get a pair of gloves, and ALOT of paper towels, and even more patience. It proves to me again that refill is never as reliable and good of quality as the OEM inks. Think of this, the photo or glossy inkjet paper you buy for a sheet... They are chemically treated to react well with certain OEM ink. Its chemical does not react optimally with some aftermarket bulk ink that isn't precisely formulated. I guess this is not too bad of an idea, if you just print alot of junk that quality isn't your priority."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Interpretation!","review":"This isn't imitation, but remarkable interpretation....Mary Lee takes Bob Dylan's songs and puts something of herself into each one of them. And that's what makes this record so compelling. She's really FEELING these somgs, the way anybody who loved the original Dylan album felt them, and she manages to give them new life, new emotion. Listening to this album, we can all reconsider, relearn, and relive this classic together. Thanks, Mary Lee, for being brave enough to take on the challenge. I'm impressed. I bet Bob Dylan is too."},{"rating":"1","title":"tribute or mimicry?","review":"There's no point in slavishly mimicking every note in the original. Dylan did it already, and in every concert today, he does it differently; his reinventions are often surprising and even shocking. None of that in this respectful album.For good tributes, see the 'This ain't no tribute' series, e.g. Taj Mahal's version of \\"It takes a lot to laugh...\\". But Mary Lee ain't no Taj Mahal. And she certainly ain't no Big Bob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of my favourites...","review":"Parker managed to capture some real magic with this disc, the musicians meshed seamlessly to create some amazing grooves. The interplay of Parker's drumming, the piano and saxophone on the first track alone makes this album worth the low low price.Lots of innovative tunes here for those looking for something outside the \\"standards\\". Lively and interesting with some great vocal treatments to treat the listener to wonderful journey.Buy and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This disc is nothing special","review":"Ritual starts out strong with a pumping, grooving track -- spanish archer vs. tilt \\"beautiful inside\\". The rest of the set doesn't measure up. There's no continuity, no imagination, and the tracks themselves aren't strong. Overall, I was quite disappointed with this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"I bought these as baby spoons for my daughter.

It would seem that these guys had an old A-C day on a farm, then got a camera and decided to take pictures and make a book. There are alot of colorful pictures of reconditioned tractors, but I was looking for a more data based and historical account of A-C."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not bother","review":"The earpiece was very flimsy, and did not stay on your ear very well. It always felt like it was about to fall off. I returned it for a headset that had the clamp on top of your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, poor volume","review":"Bought this after my Plantronics headset broke (that had volume problems also anyway). With this headset, the person can hardly hear you and you must keep repeating yourself no matter how close your mouth is to the headset (unless its touching of course). By the way, I used it with a Panasonic phone and it was a recommended headset on Panasonic's website. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, bad reception","review":"I liked the look of this to replace my well-worn Jensen JTH940 headset. The cushioned earpiece looked comfortable enough. However, it's tough to hook the plastic ring around either ear and secure it. Once I get it on, the headset tends to hang or swings back and forth if I shake my head lightly. So if you don't move you'll be fine. The people on the other line sound very far away, and they can't understand what I'm saying on my end. I tried this both on a cordless AT&T home phone and my cell phone with the same results. It's possible it could work well with other brands but I'm returning this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"This was a replacement to a damaged one. Since it was used daily, I was so happy to finde the exact headset again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"I definately like dark and sinister, however, I really liked this compilation for something different.

I was trying to find a way to allow my baby girl to share my love for the Eagles, and this product hit right on the mark. It is a cute addition to our bathtime collection, and is so soft and comfy she loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Clean Best album of the Seventies!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have the original LP and the remastered CD copies of this album--but it sounds like a whole new album with the SACD process. The sound is crisp and the separation is great--you can truly hear Clapton and Allman in separate speakers-- music heaven--the vocals are clear and the drums by Jim Gordon sound great--the guitars and organ are fantastic--if you have the CD or LP--I suggest you spend the money for this SACD copy--it sounds like a whole new album--This is definitely Claptons best album..Also look forward to the Cream reunion in January 2005--hope they tour--Clapton will wail---"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clapton + Allman = timeless","review":"I absolutely love this album. It sounds as good today as it did over 30 years ago! Clapton has always worn his heart on his sleeve in his songs and never does it better than this....his voice and guitar filled with angst and passion mixed up with Allman's guitar and vocals is the best. Revisiting it gave me chills."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the top alltime...","review":"I cannot add much that has already been said, except that since this double LP was released, it has probably been on my record player, 8 track, cassette player and cd player more than any other album. Not a dud track here, and this album has aged oh so gracefully well. \\"Layla\\" has great guitar tension between E.C. and Duane Allman, and they seemed to push each other to greater heights, and the same with the vocals of E.C. and Bobby Whitlock who never was this good again. If you don't like this music, then you don't have a heart. One of the top 5 of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Ever","review":"This tour de force is unstoppable. My favourite album of all time, this baby has everything that a blues guitar geek is looking for. Packing two of the greatist guitarists to ever set foot on Earth, this album rules. Eric Clapton and Duane Allman feeding off of each others energy with amazing solos and leads, it's truely magic. Some of the most amazing bottleneck work EVER. It can't even be argued that this is Clapton's best album ever. The emotion in the album is so amazing. The emotion felt in this album can never be matched by anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine was damaged as well.","review":"Got mine today, and yes there was damage. The 3D pop up was ripped, and 3 disks were out of the pockets, all 3 had scratches, one real bad. The 2 that stayed in the pockets were ok. One folded ticket, the book cover has mars.Does anyone know how to contact Universal directly? I looked through their web site, and there is no way to contact any type of customer service.The music great, of course.However, the DTS layer on the DVD is only 48/16. How lame! They couldn't do it in 96/24? LAME! You can defintely hear the difference!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst package of ever","review":"10 stars for the music 0 for the packageI received it this morning, it was sealed, i opened it and i discovered:- 2 cd (in concert) were missing- the remaining 3 had dropped and were loose in the box, and they were full of scratches of course- the badge \\"derek is eric\\" was broken, completely crushed- the book had a big crease on the coverI don't understand why \\"UNIVERSALS\\" box are packaged in a such rough way, given the high price!!! (actually the who live at leeds 40th anniversary was similar)I'm going to return it to amazon of course and wait for a new one to replace it, even if amazon doesn't have any fault!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good","review":"As I my only previous experience of Clapton was Disraeli Gears, expected power chord rock with screaming solos. When I heard Layla.., I obviously knew the title song was excellent but the rest of the album is also very strong. D&D play the blues so well. If you needed any reason to buy this CD, the reason lies with the first two tracks alone as these stand out. I couldn't believe how beautiful Bell Bottom Blues was. I can see how Counting Crows developed their sound. In short, a solid album and a good record of 70's rock/blues"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - a missed opportunity","review":"The music sounds good, but I have only played it through a computer, so I can't speak to any marked improvements in sound quality. I'm sure there are Clapton audiophiles out there who have specific opinions about the quality of this new edition. Unfortunately, the packaging on this edition is a mess. All the pieces are loose in the box. The discs are placed in envelope openings with no bottom, so they slide down into the package and are almost impossible to extract without inflicting some damage. I will be very surprised if my discs are not damaged. What an embarrassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated","review":"Other than Layla, there isn't much of interest here, just more British white boy blues, I'd stick to the comps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Tripe","review":"When this first came out I thought it was embarrassing crap. Imagine someone ripping off Delaney and Bonnie! Now the passage of years confirms it. Sentimental, adolescent, heart-on-sleeve stupidity with pretty lousy guitar work -- all unmelodic fills w/ Clapton's new-found Stratocaster fixation. Yuk. There's more filler here -- crummy versions of blues classics -- than a rusted out Chevy. Everyone who knows anything knows that BLUES BREAKERS and the 1st CREAM were, essentially, IT for Clapton. Well, w/ the Arabic origins of LAYLA we now know that if Clapton's God, he must serve Allah, right? I thought that was Cat Stevens, in whose class Clapton must be considered. One of the records that ushered in the sickening indulgences of 70s rock and stomped on the legacy of the 60s. Oh, the rhythm section's pretty good. Rock and roll for those who don't rock and roll, hence selection as one of the GREATS. Thank you ROLLING STONE, or whoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed out, buyer beware!!!","review":"I was totally looking forward to this arriving, I was quickly disappointed when this arrived today and I opened the package. When I opened the box the contents were strewn all over. But the biggest bummer of all was being deceived that this included a custom Layla artwork Fender stratch plate/pick guard. It's not a pickguard at all, just a cheap sticker to place over the pick guard. LAME!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The studio was on fire.","review":"Duane Allman was the fuel that powered these sessions and the slide playing on this session is as powerful now as when it was recorded. A fantastic collection played with the raw fire that ignited when Clapton and Allman tore into these songs. You can see Eric Clapton playing a number of these songs in 2007 with Derrick Trucks playing the slide parts which is excellent, but Duane had a soulfulness in his playing here that is timeless. A great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"One of the best rock albums of all time. \\"Key to The Highway\\" and \\"Have you Ever Loved a woman\\" are Two of the best songs of all time. A classic for All people to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to be buried with this album...","review":"Eric Clapton at his absolute zenith! I believe this to be the greatest record ever made...there isn't a bad tune on it and his supporting cast on this album were the best muscians playing at the time. The singing, songwriting, and music made Derek & the Dominos one of the tightest groups of all time. Anyone that knows anything about music will agree..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layla","review":"Layla, is actully one amazing song. It is a classic. Layla hasa great ending to the song. Worth the money to get this sinceI havent heard this CD yet. Highly recommended for Layla."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the SACD","review":"You want a \\"deluxe\\" edition? Go for superior quality and buy the SACD edition. It's incredible. CDs are low-fi crap no matter what you add to the song list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Layla","review":"Clapton's best moments were, undoubtfully, the ones he spent with Ginger and Jack. By then he had freshness and promissed to really change things for better in the music field. After that, all he did was just repetitive, full of keyboards and boring. Listen to what he did here with Little Wing and tell me sincerely: Don't u think he had potential to have done MUCH BETTER than that with this song?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most over-rated rock albums of all time","review":"Derek and the Dominoes were, of course, a one-album band for Eric Clapton and \\"guest\\" musicians. The title song and \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" notwithstanding, the album is, in a word, B-O-R-I-N-G. While the virtuoso guitar soloing between Clapton and Allman may enthrall some, this album is guaranteed to otherwise put to sleep the vast majority of the listening public. This is definitely NOT an album to play while driving down the highway late at night. ZZZZZZZZZ....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I have never been a Clapton fan, but I feel compelled to speak up here because this is one of the most truly overrated albums of all time. Take the title track - this would be decent guitar pop if it didn't have Eric's disgraceful vocals dumped on top of it.I don't really have a cohesive viewpoint to state. Just that this record stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"25 years, 1000+ CD's, and this is my favorite ...","review":"I bought these LP's, as an angst ridden, teenage girl. I'm now very settled and happy but I continue to love music. I have over a 1000 CD's (that are ripped of course) in the blues/rock/alternative genre and actively seek out new artists to add to my collection every year.It occurred to me recently, that out of all the music I own, this is my favorite. I have listened to it countless times, yet it still moves me. So many other reviews have detailed what's so great about this music, that I won't repeat, but something magic happened during these sessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layla","review":"This is one of the few albums that can be classed as a masterpiece. From the perfectly crafted album opener 'I Looked Away' to the evocative 'Bell Bottom Blues', the powerful blues of 'Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out' to the great riff on 'Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad', the masterly Hendrix cover 'Little Wing' and of course the song that never loses it's power 'Layla', this album has so many gems and brilliant tracks it is hard to know where to begin. 'Layla' sounds so powerful, especially sitting amidst the other tracks on this album, and on reflection it really does adhere to the 'timeless' label heaped on lesser songs. This songs till ignites after all these years. This albums shows EC playing at his height and most creative and although he has played as well since, this album stands out as a highlight of his career. One not to be missed and highly recommended.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing else like it","review":"Classic all the way. Good pressing, top notch sound quality, one of the best albums of all time, and on vinyl. It doesn't get much better then this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, You Do Need This","review":"I'm not sure how I avoided this blues-rock masterpiece for so long. Maybe it was Clapton's catalog over the past two decades that turned me off.Glad I got on board, for this is a non-stop, through and through, dyed in wool amazing album. Everyone's already gone into the Duane Allman accolades so I won't get into that. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the greatest Rock album ever.","review":"Since I first heard this album almost 30 years ago, it has remaned one of my favorites. I think it represents some of the best musicianship ever recorded in the blues rock genre. With out a doubt Clapton's finest record. Teamed up with Duane Allman, The two great guitarist drive each other too brilliance on every track. I have listened to this record probably a couple of hundred times and it is always great.This is a must have record for anyone who loves the blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAOALS deserves all the stars in the sky... plus some","review":"This is the only album I've ever heard that, the first time I heard it, I had to stop everything I was doing the moment the first note was played. Even now, I try not to listen to this album if I have a lot to do, because I never know what mood I'll be in after hearing it. Sometimes it soothes me as no other music can, other times my heart wrenches painfully. This music is exquisite and involving. For once in history, everything came together perfectly to create an album beyond perfection. I agree with whomever it was that said, \\"I want to be buried with this album...\\" I've been saying that for years...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Packaging","review":"Worst packageing design I've ever seen. At first I thought I only got 4 discs because one was wedged so far downin the packaging. It was covered with glue from stem to stern. Another disc also has glue on it.Needless to say, I'm sending it back for a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!","review":"I received my box today and it was in perfect condition. Absolutely no problems!! I won't review the music here because we all know how great it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The SACD recording of Derek and the Domino's Layla is a disappointment to say the least. I have recently begun listening to several SACD and DVD-Audio recordings and this sound mix offers nothing new to the previous recordings. This is one of rock's best offerings and the sound on this SACD offers no improvement to the mix of Eric Clapton and Duane Allman's guitar work. A major letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clapton rips it up blues style","review":"EC was not messin around here. He starts off with a few songs written by both himself and Bobby Whitlock and jumps right into another Clapton REMASTERED with \\"Nobody Knows You When Your Down and Out.\\" An excellent new version of a song originally written by James Cox. Among his other remastered songs on Layla is \\"Little Wing\\" written by the late great left handed guitarist Jimi Hendrix. Which is personally my favorite track on this album. Maybe I'm just too big of a Hendrix fan but he knows how to write blues songs and Clapton and Duane Allman certainally knows his blues guitar solos. That's pretty much what this album comes down to, BLUES GUITAR SOLOS. Great ones, especially on the opening track, \\"I Looked Away\\" and one of Claptons distictive riffs with \\"Layla\\". Yep if you love blues style guitar solos you will definetly not be disappointed at all. Blues...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The legendary Slowhand","review":"Although I prefer Clapton's earlier guitar driven works like \\"Stepping Out\\", \\"Hideaway\\", \\"Have You Heard\\" from the legendary \\"Beano\\" album and \\"Crossroads\\" from Cream, this album was what would become a stepping stone to his more laid-back experimental works like the classic \\"Slowhand\\" album. My favourite tracks included Big Bill Bronzy's \\"Key to th Highway\\" and Jimmie Cox's \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out\\". A supreme transformation, true to Clapton's innovative improvisation. I was a bit dissapointed that \\"Blues Power\\" was not in the album but it won't do justice to the album if it did since this is a love album. This is an album for circa 70s Clapton's fan. An ultra-supreme album, well-deserved to be a classic of its genre and era."},{"rating":"2","title":"The band was transitory but blessed","review":"It is rumored that Duane Allman challenged EC to be more aggressive on the guitar than he would otherwise have been. The result is magnificent. Clapton's songwriting skills come to fruition here and he is starting to emerge as a well-rounded performer and not just a guitar slinger. A nice combination of blues with a gospel touch. EC makes us feel his pain, even 30 yrs. later, it still hurts. Standouts: I looked Away, Bell Bottom Blues, Little Wing, Anyday and of course the title track. A round of applause for Bobby Whitlock. A \\"must\\" buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"My only Review 10 years on amazon...","review":"The Music Gets 5 StarsThe Packaging is just retarded, I went to an indie record store just to buy *and shake it* myself and still managed to get bad discs...

Horrible packaging","review":"I would like to get my hands on the 'orrible, 'orrible lit-tle man who thought up the packaging for this album. Two of the CDs were scratched on receipt because of the way they were stuffed in the cardboard pockets in the set. i managed to clean them up by performing a CD wash using eye glasses cleaner but that's not the point. The packaging sucks. Recommendation; if you buy this set, go out and purchase 5 CD sleeves to store them. Other than that a great set. However, where is the \\"video\\" which is advertised. My DVD has only audio. Whoever kaboshed the design of such a monumental set should be fired. I gave it 2 stars because such great music can oversome even the odds presented here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame, shame, shame.","review":"Well you heard most of it before, two discs loose in box and one hidden. However I was lucky, no scratches and no glue. What nobody mentioned was the packaging of the vinyl in paper sleeves. High quality vinyl in a high priced set deserves rice sleeves. That's where mine went instantly. I would also like to take Amazon to task as I purchased from them. I know they always state that discs may come loose during shipment in multiple disc sets. Well the box set is plastic wrapped to a piece of cardboard. This in turn was placed in a box three times larger and shipped. No other packing material. I am not a shipper by trade but I think common sense would tell you that the box set would slide all around loosely in the larger box. Mine came with a nice big ding in the box set. Guess I will have to live with this for fear of getting scratched or glued discs upon an exchange."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Layla,\\" say the,...best of all time","review":"As I write this, it's interesting to note that, out of 30reviewers, only one has seen fit to give \\"Layla\\" less thanfive stars (one star off for recording quality). There's not much I can add to what's been so well said by so many reviewers-- --Layla is probably the greatest all-time blues-rock guitar album; --This was the peak of Clapton's recording career (anything he's done since, pales in comparison); --there are a great many unheralded songs on this record including, Anyday, I am Yours, Tell the Truth, Key to the Highway, Why Does Love got to be So Sad? and Thorn Tree. There are no bad songs; --Duane Allman, like Clapton, is brillant; the contrast between his soaring, emotive slide and Clapton's fiery leads, is unsurpassed by any recording I know of; --Topping off these extraordinary riffs are the soulful vocals of Clapton and Bobby Whitlock; -- Anyone who likes the blues, or who has ever felt the pain of a lost love, should have this recording. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Album","review":"This is Clapton's most classic works. He and the Domino's wrote it right before his heroin habit, which in my opinion, greatly affected the content of all the work he produced afterwords. A must have for any mild to major Clapton fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layla","review":"Layla is another one of those must have albums for your collection if this is a genre of love for you. It, like Live At The Fillmore is made up of wonderfully composed and performed music. On this album however there is an added pleasure and that is Duane Allman on guitar. There is a lot of the same songs on this as is on Live AT The Fillmore but instead of being a live performance, Layla is a studio production and that is the only reason I gave this four out of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this Album","review":"There are so many high points to this album. It's blues and upbeat, it's empathic and cold, it's love and lost love and love that can never be. I'm a big fan of Psychadelic rock, so I happen to listen to Cream, another of Clapton's bands in the '60s. That is how I became aware of this album. Don't be put off by it's \\"lovey-mushy\\" cover. This album is rock/blues at its best. This album is a must. The song \\"Layla\\" is on the list of \\"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\\" as voted by the readers of \\"Guitar World\\" magazine. There are other significant tracks like \\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\\" which is heavily bluesy, and \\"Why Does Love have to be So Sad\\" which is a more fast-paced song like \\"Layla\\". If you're a fan of Clapton, or Psychadelic rock, or blues, or rock at ALL, you need this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top ten rock recording of All time","review":"Layla and other assorted Love Songs is one of my all time favorite Rock recordings. The 40th Anniversary edition is a GREAT set, the first disc is the complete remaster and just sounds fantastic. The second disc includes live tracks, alt master recordings, and will bring a big smile and fond memories of your/our past. The Domino's lineup is timeless and these songs are as STRONG as ever and will always stand the test of time. Fire this recording up at your next party/gathering and really get things jumping. Listen, ENJOY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful howl of pain","review":"This is music of almost violent intensity. Clapton sings as though his soul were being dragged across rain-soaked pavement. And his band-mates are right there with him. An all-time classic of gut-shot, unrequited love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clampton and The Blues","review":"This is really a fine album. I originally purchased this album in 1972 before I went off to Thailand while stationed at Homestead Air Force Base as a Sergeant. My roommate and I played this album over and over and really enjoyed it! It is definitely blues with some rock thrown in. I would not say that I enjoyed each song on it but gave it 4 stars as I believe that there is something in it for everyone to enjoy. This album is now truly classic and well worth buying!! I would recommend this album. Layla and Key To The Highway I feel are what holds this ablum together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vinyl Album","review":"I expected my order to be a record. It was a CD.

This album ranks next to some of the best Allman Brothers albums of the 70's. A classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointing remaster","review":"I bought the 2011 remaster of Layla based on the Amazon reviews, which suggested an improvement over the 20th Anniversary remix/remaster. I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps it is true that this remaster is closer in balance to the original album, but the sound quality is poor - and amazingly so. There is an audible high frequency hiss throughout the disc, most easily identifiable at the end and beginnings of tracks, which colors the entire production. Add the overall muddiness and low-end thump, and (believe me) you don't want to listen to this. I don't know which version of Layla on disc is best, but, for me, this isn't it. I'll stick with the more pristine sound of the 20th Anniversary edition - remix or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a huge disappointment.","review":"I don't like this author's writing style at all. It's confusing and while the book is a very small book, its actually verbose. The story had a great deal of potential but it was a downer. Nothing uplifting or enjoyable about this at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luminous, Specific, Evocative","review":"I read this collection in college 25 years ago, and it's never left me. Voigt's way with metaphor, physical description, the *feel* of emotions, is unique. Time and again, she chooses a simple adjective which somehow illuminates a physical sensation perfectly (like in the opening poem, foreshadowing the coming of Fall, \\"before the heavy drop of the apples\\", or the sense of being a middle child, writing to her mother, who \\"grew in the shady places, rootbound, without blossoms\\"). For years, I've read passages of these to friends, who typically react \\"Who IS this woman... and why have I not heard of her?\\" I know Voigt's other books, but this one remains a favorite for its clarity, intimacy and subtle profundity. I thank her for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong image for discription","review":"Image is a 5-in. fruit plate of the Johnson Bros. \\"Merry Christmes\\" pattern, not \\"Friendly Village\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immensly enjoyable","review":"I love it. Great little book, filled with illustrations, recipies, and Alice quotes. An enchanting treat for any Alice fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring people and an inferior story","review":"This book was recommended to me by someone who loved it. The people in the story are boring. Who cares about a guy who ran away from home and is one-dimensional? Who cares about a broken down alcoholic woman who's a shadow of her potential and former self? I couldn't care about these characters. I could see that they acted stupidly. After reading 75% of the book, I didn't finish it. It was an inferior DaVinci Code. The religious and historical significance of the story was presented in a dull fashion rather than being fascinating like Da Vinci Code."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For Any Tricky Fan","review":"The two previously unreleased tracks, Pop Musik and Bombing Bastards, are perfect examples of Tricky's ambient and melencholic style. Pop Musik a fun up beat song and Bombing Bastards a slower more soothing song, both show Tricky's talent and genius that he brings to the recording studio.

I thought not long ago I would revisit his music after seeing his new cd on the shelves. Man what a singer. His voice is rich and full and in complete control. A wonderful production, great choice of songs, musicians and sung as only Ray can do it. My favorite is \\"I'm Not Leaving, I'm Just Getting Out Of The Way\\". POWERFUL. That song alone is worth the price of the cd. Thank you Amazon.com for making avialable all the Ray Price cd's at great prices. I will be back for more. Don't let this one slip through your fingers, its music, country music, at its best. Sung by the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"eh,ben!

Beautifully shot, carefully directed and well cast, this makes for some first-rate entertainment. Is it about feminisim? Chauvanism? The quest for perfection? Any and all really. Goldman did a great job scripting Levin's novel. It is mysterious, creepy, sometimes languid and it still manages a great number of tongue-in-cheek moments. Ultimately, it's not WHAT is happening to these women (how many clues and winks can they give you) rather it's about whether our heroine will succumb to the same fate. The final shot is the ultimate gasp and chuckle moment. Ross, O'Neal and Masterson are fine. Paula Prentiss is the perfect wiseass who keeps it in check just enough so that she herself does not become a joke. The film holds up well and the DVD looks great. A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stepford Wives Silver Anniversary Edition DVD","review":"I've read several complaints about this version of The stepford Wives won't play on dvd players. When I first got mine it wouldn't play either. Then I discovered that when you have the cursor over what you want to watch, you have to press AND hold the enter button and what you want to watch will begin playing. I was also extremely frustrated but it will play. The extras aren't that great but at least its a little more than just the film. The widescreen appears to be in more of a true widescreen than the previously released dvd version. I have to wonder why Anchor Bay has released so many different versions so recent to each other. Whatever the reason, I'm glad they released the film. Brilliantly written and executed, it was one of the creepiest/chiller type movies from that era.No blood, guts or gore. It plays with your mind and makes you think and thats when the true horror reveals itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story!","review":"I just watched The Stepford Wives on VHS and was surprised. I didn't think it would be as good as it was! The story is as important today as it was in 1975, when the movie was released. Katherine Ross is a very good actress and Paula Prentiss also gave an interesting performance as her best friend. Patrick O'Neal's heavy was more than appropiate. The evil lurking in Stepford is chilling. I also enjoyed glimpses of one of my favorite cities (New York) as it was in the 1970s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but shoddy digital transfer.","review":"Overall this movie was great, but I do have to say that the digital transfer for the DVD is very poor, in fact the porest I've seen in a long time. The black parts (night time shots) in the picture have heavy pixelization. So do not buy the DVD you will be disapointed, especially if you are a heavy dvdphile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"After watching the newest Stepford Wives, we wanted to see the original. I'm still not sure, but I don't think that this is the original. The new one had pictures of the original at the beginning and this isn't it. This one was a real dissappointment after watching the newewst one. It moved very slowly. I'm still hunting for the original it looked more upbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"well made but...","review":"If you have any inkling as to what this movies about your in for a long slow trip through seventies suburbia. I heard a rumor that Tim Burton is planning a remake (Hope its better than Planet of the Apes.) so I checked this flick out. I also heard that it's tense and scary, and it could be unless you figure out what indeed is going down in Stepford. And it's not too tough to guess believe me.This film is more like a really, really long episode of the Twilight Zone. It does have a decent payoff at the very end but it sure takes an awful long time getting there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trouble With the Stepford Wife Prototype...","review":"....was that the ideal mate did not/does not exist and if you did body snatch and convert your mate to these soulless, catatonic androids who look like women....wouldn't 'that' also be chipped beef HELL on toast? I thought it would be a fun thing if a bunch of women here in town had started to run around in those full-eye/aminal-eye contact lens and those flower print chiffon dresses, talking about running home to cook a pot roast for their husbands. That would definitely cause quite a stir, here. Or, maybe not. Anyhoo, Ira Levin was one of my favorite authors--\\"Rosemary's Baby\\", \\"Boys from Brazil\\" and the like--and this is a fine moovy adaptation of a chilling novel. A bit dated, but as I read in another reviewer's work below will be remade in the very near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stepford Wives Rarely Shown On TV","review":"and that's a shame because this is an excellent movie. It should be required viewing for every liberal feminist in this country. Katherine Ross, Paula Prentiss, Tina Louise, and Patrick O'Neal all give fine performances. The climactic scene is unforgettable when Katherine Ross confronts herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD of The Stepford Wives does not work in U.S. DVD players","review":"I have bought this item (and returned it) from Borders and an online company. Neither DVD will work in my DVD player or any other machine it has been tried in. (Note: my DVD player has never before rejected any DVD.)This is obviously a flawed issue. I believe ALL of the DVDs are unworkable.Has anyone else purchased this item?

It was highly believeable even though it was made in the 70's. It did not end as expected making it worth waiting for. Casting was good. In short, if you have never seen this version (original) you should buy it. It was remade in 2004 by a lot of well know actors who seemed to try and outdo each other and it was nothing like this original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic thriller","review":"I saw this, for the first time, within thelast 2 years, and I agree: It is a well doneshocker. Katharine Ross and Paula Prentissare excellent in the lead actress roles.I thought Patrick O'Neal as the head of the'men's association' and the actress who playsthe psychiatrist who Ross has an appointmentwith are also standouts. Nanette Newman,Peter Masterson, Franklin Cover (who alsoplayed a character in \\"The Jeffersons\\" TVseries) and the rest of the cast all givegood performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stepford Wives - The classic on the dangers of conformity","review":"The Stepford Wives is one of those movies that really seems to be of its time as a period piece, but still contains themes that are worth noting. Although its primarily a study on the importance of the individual and the importance of feminist ideology in the 70's as opposed to the house frau ideology of the 1950's patriarchy, it serves as an example of why individuality and non conformity are values to be treasured, not buried to keep up a facade of subservience. Paula Prentiss and Katherine Ross turn in solid performances as well. Ross' usurption by her soulless doppleganger at the end is a priceless scene. Plus, with a remake in the works due in 2003 by Frank Oz, this will be required viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Stars for movie, but zero stars for DVD!

I have a Home Theater system and at the loudest level, I couldn't really hear the speeches well. the soundtrack has been remasterd at very low peak volume and there is no captions or subtitles too. so if you want too watch this movie with family you probably miss so much of speeches and if you want to watch it alone, it can make you nervous! This is a great movie but with such a big problem in DVD, I suggest you don't buy it for your own good!at the other hand maybe if you use regular TV speakers instead of home theater system, the problem got fixed but what's the benefit for owning an special edition DVD and use it without a Home Theater system?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest exploration of Mormonism","review":"This film is an honest exploration of the Mormom cult. Softly covered up as a tale of brain-washed cookie-makers... \\"The Stepford Wives\\" is an obvious, honest and effective early warning of the sickness of the Mormon cult. I rate this film 5 stars. It can only be seen to be belived. Its widescreen grandeur is now restored as well. (Mildly amusing as most modern day Mormon women could not fit into any widescreen view.)jared"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stepford Feminists","review":"I must admit to never having read the book, but from its reviews, the movie manages to follow it closely enough. The plot would work much better if more men were actually like the men of Stepford. Some reviewers obviously think that MOST men are like the men of Stepford, or at least most men were until this movie came out. This says more about some people's fear and loathing of healthy masculinity than it does about anything else. Seriously, ladies, stop judging all men by \\"The Man Show,\\" unless you want us to judge all women by \\"Oprah.\\"That having been said, this film is an interesting caricature of a certain SMALL segment of the male population. Or perhaps it is an unintentional parody of '70s feminist paranoia. If only the feminazis who blast women who don't follow in their own jack-booted footsteps were as tolerant of other women's choices as they demand others to be accepting and approving of there own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stepford Feminists","review":"I was too young to see this when it originally came out, but finally saw it on cable. This is a movie whose themes have not aged well, but it is a very campy little time-capsule of a film.The politics of the 1970's equal-rights movement are really perplexing viewed through a post-feminist lens. The women in this movie all whine because their husbands want them to actually stay home, cook, clean, and raise the children. Horrors!Frankly, with such selfish, self-absorbed, whiny creatures as depicted in that movie, I found myself rooting for the husbands for turning them into robots. Thankfully, the Battle of the Sexes is fading into the shadows of pop-culture history, and I think (hope) men and women are re-learning to value and respect each other and the complementary roles we play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no! The big bad MALE is going to get me!!!!","review":"As a feminist, I hate movies that portray women as victims who struggle futile against the big bad evil MAN.There are no good men in this movie. There are no evil women.Such portrayals of women are demeaning. We are human beings, just like men. We are capable of evil. Men are capable of good.Yes, some men would turn their wives into robots if they could, but so would some women! And I find it ridiculous that not one man stood up for his beloved partner. I find it ridiculous that not one woman was capable of true evil. Are we puppets?It also bothers me that if these women are so strong and powerful, that they are helpless against the big bad men. The message seems to be that we can't save ourselves. We are just doomed to be what men want us to be.I hate this attitude. Men are not all powerful. Women are human beings, not saints.Two stars, though, for capturing the fears of women everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of my time...","review":"This movie was so bad! It was very slow moving, and I kept waiting for something to happen. And then the ending! It really made me angry, what was the point of having this character Joanna go through the movie hoping she can do something to change what is going on in Stepford? Everyone is saying what a great campy classic film this is, but i just felt it was boring and didn't go anywhere. This movie is far to boring to be a horror/camp classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect horror story for the 70's","review":"After all the drugs of the 60's had strung out the hippies to the point that thier minds stopped functioning.

The little carnage is halted after everyone learns this and a *chuckles* conversation with the plants leads to a sacrifice. No, I'm sorry to tell you this is not the killer plant book one expects.

I have never been driven more astray. To call this book anything other than juvenile is a misrepresentation.Engines of Dawn lives in a poorly disguised \\"Star Trek Next Generation\\" universe. Which in and of itself would be forgivable if the character development and plot lines were better, they aren't.It's really so poor that I nearly didn't finish it. I didn't care about the characters, the plot is full of holes and the silly Star Trekness of it all is just a mess.A compelling idea for a novel that just went all wrong.Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading - very disappointing","review":"This is an appallingly weak book. The character development is pathetic, and the plot is juvenile. None of the action is believable, nor is the science, politics or dialogue. Paul Cook can't write very well at all. He writes as if he were a below average high school student doing his creative writing homework assignment while watching TV. Every few pages there was something bogus, arbitrarily concocted, inexplicable or logically flawed. I wouldn't bother reading it if I were you. I am sorry that my girlfriend wasted her money buying this book (for some reason I had put it on my wishlist).Contrast this with the SF book I read just before \\"The Engines of Dawn\\" which was \\"Red Mars\\" by Kim Stanley Robinson - Red Mars gives you fully developed, believable characters and dialogue, lots of real science, politics and human drama, and it is written very well indeed. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy (Green Mars and Blue Mars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal House Saves the Universe","review":"In the Engines of Dawn by Paul Cook, frat boy-cum-physics-instructor Ben Bennett and his three drop-out buddies liberate humanity from the evil aliens slowly, methodically, sapping all humans of their intelligence and sex drive.I'd give the actual story concept at least 3 stars, but the execution is terrible. For some reason, Cook has to give every character a complete dossier after mentioning their name. For instance: Bob Jones, a large, muscular, redheaded man, turned on the lights. Childish sexual innuendo is all over the place, really distracting from the seriousness of the story.Don't get me wrong, this book can be entertaining, in that cheezy, late night B-movie kind of way, but if you want thought-provoking literature, don't waste any time with the Engines of Dawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book--well plotted, well-written.","review":"A captivating read filled with believable characters and fascinating scenarios successfully woven into a great adventure story. The characters are far from one-dimensional and their reactions and attitudes engage the reader in a very thought-provoking manner that continues even after the story ends.

The writing is smug, self-congratulatory, and juvenile.

More mature readers are better off spending their time and money on something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Ok, so the plot has some holes you could drive a space cruiser through, and the delivery is a bit chaotic. Still, I cannot in conscience give this book anything less than five stars. It's basic _premise_ is sound, and the story engaging.What really does for me in this book is seeing man face a mortal enemy, who could well turn into the species nemesis, and having as main obstacle their own political infighting and quest for power. _That_ is rendered perfectly in this book.Also, I must admit that the university background setting is familiar and comfortable to me. It's not every time humanity is saved in a university campus, and very rarely as convincingly as in this book. :-)If you are put off by plot holes, stay away from this one. If the way personal agendas and egos can get in the way of our own good does it for you, though, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended, Entertaining Read.","review":"Paul Cooks's novels are always entertaining, with Engines of Dawn easily his best. It most resembles his earlier novel, Halo, for its adventure and its inspired moments of humor. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read","review":"Ok, so it's not a grand classic of sci-fi, but it's a fun quick read. Some of the reader reviews above have some valid points but are unnecessarily harsh. I recently read Hamilton's space opera, so I couldn't expect it to compare, but it has enough suspense and some interesting twists and light comedy with enough future astrophysics to satisfy most sci-fi readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Era For Queens","review":"I've listened to the cd 5 full times and these boys are all over the map.The biggest thing lacking is the drive on all but one song (sick,sick,sick). The rest is a jumble of misc. garbage. Not worth the price or time and makes lullabies sound like a 5 star album. Maybe the loss of Nick Oliveri is catching up with the band in the song writing department on the second release since his firing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step up from Lullabies","review":"Being a big fan of R and Songs for the Deaf, I was a bit disappointed with the direction they took with Lullabies which started off strong but then faded after Little Sister. With the exception of a few filler tracks this record is strong all the way through. My only complaint is the lousy production. There are alot of golden nuggets on this record but you have to dig through the mud of the production to get to them. Lullabies had the same issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Era Mediocritus","review":"For the past 10 years or so, the Queens have consistently released some of the best rock music to be found anywhere. Though invariably loud and abrasive, their songs ranged from the eerie and ominous to tightly structured pop classics that were never derivative. Coupled with decent lyrics and great musicianship, they stood distinctly apart from and far above their peers. Unfortunately, none of this is evident on the new release. The songs meander and are reminiscent, to me at least, of a style personified by the Greatful Dead...much harder, of course, but just as uninspiring. Sick, sick, sick a supposed standout here, reminds me of another clunker of theirs, the repetitive and just plain stupid song, Feelgood Hit of the Summer (an anthem for brain dead meatheads). Every good band delivers a clunker on occasion and they have risen (or stumbled?) to the occasion on this CD.P.S. After repeated listenings, it gets much worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been alot better","review":"Needed more Mark Lanagan. Needed more Nick. Needed more dave.

Josh is a baby and is even on probation for breaking a bottle over the lead singer of the dwarfs head. Why did he do it? cause josh was pissed that they let nick tour with them. What a child.

Not an easy listen at first...but for those who give it a chance there's some really great tunes here - 3's and 7's, Suture Up Your Future, Turning On the Screw, Misfit Love to name a few.I'd have to say my only disappointment is with I wanna make it wit chu. Unlike In My Head on Lullabies which was screaming for a remake... the original make it wit chu is already pretty great...and this new version doesn't really improve much on it.And the 3's and 7's acoustic version really should have been included as a bonus track too... better than the electric version by far..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best in My Opinion","review":"I really think this is their most complete and well thought out album.

Plus, you can really here them moving towards that Them Crooked Vultures album as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS VERSION INSTEAD!!!","review":"You are missing out on TWO excellent songs if you do not purchase the European version of Era Vulgaris. I've heard bands will do this, release hidden tracks on overseas (especially japanese) versions, to discourage bootlegging. The songs included are \\"Running Joke\\" and, oddly enough, the title track. The first is a slower song, most reminding me of \\"Mosquito Song\\" from Songs For The Deaf. It's also a shorter song, at only 2:58. The import-version's final track is \\"Era Vulgaris\\", which definitely (and obviously) sounds like it belongs on the album. It is vaguely reminiscent of the album's opener, \\"Turnin' On The Screw\\", were it faster and lower.If you don't own Era Vulgaris, buy this version. If you do, it's probably more worthwhile to convince a friend to buy this instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queens Of The Stone Age?

It's not horrible, but it really doesn't do anything for me. And \\"Make It Witchu\\" sounds like a failed attempt at a pop single and sticks out from the rest of the album like a sore thumb.

I don't understand what they were shooting for when making this, nor do I understand why critics are saying that this album is so good. Sick sick sick is the only good song on this album.

Nothing to do with his voice just the lyric content turned me completely off. \\"I Tried\\" the Angela Bofil classic leaves no comparison when Will's smooth lush vocals delicatley lay on those words.

I purchased this product because Image is listed as as the studio for release.. The history of digitally remastered old filmsby Image has been very good such as those from the Hal Roach studios, etc. but this set is a disaster. Several of the films are unwatchable due to the quality. Some have been remastered from poor vidoe tape. Image does put the Madacy name on the box with their name but have done nothing to redo this old garbage tin set originally released by Madacy, I found out, and did not even have their name mentioned in the viewing credits on the discs.

Gillespie, Mingus, The Bird, Powell and Roach each make up the ultimate representatives of their chosen instruments and they show just why on this live, mono recording. Parker's and for me especially Dizzie's solos are extremely memorable on tracks like \\"Salt Peanuts\\" and \\"Night in Tunisia\\".This Japanese, mini-lp sleeve version has a nicely-designed packaging although the remastering job isn't that great. The bass is too overpowering and you'll have to turn your bass controls down quite a bit to bring this to a tolerable listening level.

Jacobs has read widely and deeply across disciplines to produce an extraordinary account of the intersection of visual technologies and literary production.

Her reading of Zora Neale Hurston, for example, draws on anthropological history to demonstrate the way ethnography helped to establish what we \\"see\\" as the Other. She applies this insight to Hurston, who trained with anthropologist Franz Boas in the participant-observer method, a method, Jacobs argues, that produced literary results for Hurston that were both productive and limiting.

I knew little about the politics of the Department, and was a big fan of John Lehman. I grew to despise him over the years. He never earned his Naval Flight Officer's Wings. He is the only citizen that I know of who was ever authorized to wear such an insignia and joy ride in the right seat of an A-6. His vision for a 600 ship Navy, and the information provived to Congress to get it, was based on lies. John Lehman ultimately weakened the United States. As a result of John Lehman, tens of billions were spent on worthless weapons systems. We are still paying for it. Vistica's book is right on target. In the 1980s, the U.S. Navy was an authority unto itself. Its real mission had little to do with national security, but rather advancing its own selfish interests. Our leaders were a bunch of gutless, and spineless self promoters who would stab their mothers in the back rather than take personal responsibility for their disasters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, thought provoking","review":"A revealing look at the corruption in the US Navy. While this corruption predates Mr. Vistica's book, Under the Regan administration in general, and Mr. Lehman's tenure as SecNav in particular, corruption ran rampant. While Mr. Lehman had some very good ideas, his implementation was so flawed as to sow the seeds of the modernization debacle we have in the military today. What this book depicts best, outside of the infantile behavior of the Navy's top leaders, is what happens when billions of dollars are given to people who have no vision or idea of what to do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could have saved a lot of time and money...","review":"...if I had found this book before I found and bought and read a whole bunch of other self-help books related to this topic.

The album was rushed and unpolished, and my guess is the execs pushed it into stores sooner than they should have. There is some respectable material which works great for them live, but this album doesn't even come CLOSE to the work of the first three albums - and to suggest that Ten and Vs. are softer than No Code is preposterous.Thankfully, the albums that follow are a clear sign Eddie and the boys still have their chops (but with all due respect to Matt, we miss Dave)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krista's review","review":"I have no idea what they did with this one. All the songs on this C.D are either slow blues type or trying to be on the verge of pop punk.

The Cover art is different and unique as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word: Underrated","review":"This album was dumped on by all the fair weather Pearl Jam fans. It is by far one of the most daring rock releases since In Utero. A release where the band didn't want to do what was hip at the time, but did what they wanted to do, create honest to goodness rock n roll. All in all, I think VS was the weakest Pearl Jam release to date. Songs on this album have been sort of a soundtrack to my life like \\"I'm Open\\" and \\"Off He Goes\\".

This album may not have Pearl Jam's biggest hits, but pop it in and you will be surprised how well it flows as a cohesive work. There is not a single skip worthy song.

I love Pearl Jam, but I'll be the first to admit that their albums tend to slow down and lose momentum as they go on, but this album is probably the most solid album they've made yet. It starts out with an eery and beautiful \\"Sometimes\\" and goes on into some rock and acoustics songs, with gems like \\"Off He Goes\\".

With a CD library boasting eight studio releases and hundreds of live bootlegs, these guys give you a reason to own every one, because no single album can even be compared to another.A definite stand-out in the Pearl Jam catalog. Listeners who enjoyed \\"Vitalogy\\" and \\"Binaural\\" will enjoy this happy medium. This is an album where the bands' influences weigh heavy on their sound. To any real Pearl Jam fan, I say pick this one up, but as mentioned above: it sounds nothing like previous (more mainstream) releases, so anyone only familiar with popular radio staples such as \\"Alive\\", \\"Even Flow\\", or \\"Elderly Woman...\\", maybe give it a listen first. Although it is great music, the mainstream audience won't recognize it as the Pearl Jam that they're familiar with, but to any hardcore fan, this is the one that will sit atop the shrine."},{"rating":"2","title":"a turning point","review":"They're not much remembered for No Code, but it's the strongest of the Pearl Jam record because they followed their muse wherever it took them, and in this case, it was to diverse soundscapes. \\"Who You Are\\" is all over the map musically, but it's moving on a level they'd never aimed for before. Same goes for the unconventionally astonishing \\"Red Mosquito\\" and \\"Hail Hail.\\" The most conventional song on here, \\"Off He Goes,\\" and the most experimental, the spoken word \\"I'm Open\\" act as separate ends for Pearl Jam's capabilities, and both are majestic statements of adulthood. It's no surprise this album is such a turning point in their career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best PJ ever","review":"This is definatly not the Pearl Jam most know.

I have never heard of anyting quite like this, an while songs like \\"Hail, Hail\\" and \\"In My Tree\\" are quite good, the goodness stops there. Almost all of the other songs are very mellow, something that I'm not used to hearing from PJ. If they had done more songs like \\"Hail, Hail\\", it would have been a much better CD. Pearl Jam has always meant, to me, to be a full-steam-ahead kind of band, and their futile attempt to deviate from that has proven fatal to their usual kind of music. Sorry, PJ, but stick with what works."},{"rating":"1","title":"the downfall of what once a great band","review":"I can remember years ago when I first got into Pearl Jam when 10 was their only album. That album was filled with energy and inspiration that I have rarely heard on an album. Songs like Once convey a sense of raw power while songs like Alive and Jeremy have a strong emotional attachments to them. Vs continued this tradition with songs like animal and go having that raw power and W.M.A and elderly women have that emotional attachments. However with vitology, the band began try things which is good but sadley the execution of that expirementation did not sound as good as their previous works. No Code sadley follows that tradition. It is difficult to listen to because of its unfinished sound. Songs like Hail Hail seem like they would have been good if Pearl Jam had worked more on the song. In the end, No Code fails to make a connectin that is strong with listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"about as different as an album can be","review":"pearl jam really surprised me when they released this one/ i shelfed it like alot of people did but shouldnt of done/ 2 years later i gave it another chance and fell in love with its weirdness/ bravo pearl jam"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest successful experiments ever","review":"the most diverse Pearl Jam album, a great album altogetherI agree with Pearl Jams Lion who compared it to the Velvet UndergroundIts one of Pearl Jams greatest, its classic, & has to be added to your collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Jam's Best","review":"Most people point to Ten as Pearl Jam's best album, though I will argue wholeheartedly that this honor should instead go to No Code.No Code is Pearl Jam's most diverse album, with punky rockers like Hail Hail, Lukin, Habit, and Mankind, thoughtful introspectives like Sometimes and Off He Goes, Eastern-tinged songs like Who You Are and In My Tree, and classic rockers like Present Tense, Smile, and Red Mosquito.IMHO, In My Tree is the real gem, with Jack Irons at his best--this song exemplifies the contribution he made to PJ in his 3 short years in the band.Aside from the music, No Code's album art and design was revolutionary.Truly amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Pearl Jam, it's time for a break, or a kick in the nutz.","review":"While flashes of \\"Ten\\" slendor are evident, the staple of the Seattle bands is loosening with each CD released.

Like other reviewers I will also add to their voice my voice and state that this album is the missing link in the evolution of this great American band. It is very enjoyable to listen to the rock riffs and the small amount of grunge and funk in this album - a mixture that is used so well in many of their albums.Pearl Jam's popularity is not diminishing even after all this time. They have messages in all their songs and their lyrics are pure and true to heart. Their music transcends to fans' heart and souls for one reason, and because they are so real in delivery and execution.All the songs on this release are great. There is none lacking but my three favourites are; 'Lukin', 'Off He Goes' and 'Sometimes'.Well worth getting for old Pearl Jam fans. They will truly appreciate this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail, Hail! PJ's Four album Stands Out","review":"Sure, it's no \\"Ten\\" or \\"VS\\", and it didn't stand up to \\"Vitalogy\\", but \\"No Code\\" is still a great album. It might be a little slow but listen to it more than once and it'll grow on you. It reminds me of \\"Led Zeppelin III\\". Sure everyone was expecting \\"Whole Lotta Love Part II\\" (or \\"Spin the Black Circle II\\" in this case) but instead you got hit upside the head with songs like \\"Tangerine\\" (or, in the case of PJ \\"Who Are You\\"). It's the kind of insightful music that doesn't get produced in this world of corperate rock. It's an effort by PJ to do something that no one expected them to do, and I applaud that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.. Hail Hail is awesome!","review":"Normally i would give ANY Pearl Jam album 5 stars (I think they are by far the best band of the 90s) because they always consistently provide great albums with INNOVATION which a lot of bands lack these days. The reason why i give this one 4 is that although this album is very very solid (ie all tracks are listenable) their are not many exellent tracks.. no Betterman, Alive, Black, Elderly Woman, Daughter, Given to fly's. Sure Hail Hail, Lukin, Sometimes and Smile are gooood but only Hail Hail is really in the same league as those songs mentioned above. DEFINITELY worth the cash though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the place to start with PJ","review":"If you're looking for the Pearl Jam CD to buy first, this isn't it. This is easily the weakest of their 5 LP's. None of these songs stand out. They all seem to be underdeveloped ideas or jams. There are a few worthwhile tracks however. \\"Off He Goes\\" is a nice ballad, in the spirit of the Vitalogy ballads. \\"Mankind\\" is interesting, but doesn't sound like Pearl Jam - Stone Gossard sings. \\"Smile\\" also stands out. It sounds very influenced by Neil Young, which is probably a decent prediction, as No Code was PJ's first album after recording Mirrorball with Young.Anyway, PJ neophytes will be well served to get any other PJ album first, as they are much more focused and consistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason why this album didn't do well!","review":"The first and only time I heard this album was in a Border's book store, when the album was first released. They had a listening station and \\"No Code\\" was one of the choices. I put the headphones on and expected to be musically satisfied! I was never more wrong! It's not like I didn't give the songs a chance. I listened to each track until I couldn't stand it anymore. As I advanced from one track to another, it only got worse. Then, I came to a conclusion. I would spend my money elsewhere and forget this album. The thought that kept popping up in my head was, \\"I'm glad I heard it first before I bought it!\\". As a Pearl Jam fan, this was a scary thing. I thought the band had taken a turn for the worst. Then came the album \\"Yield\\" and all was better!If you like the obscure, you might like this one. But, if you like music you can listen to, skip \\"No Code\\" and move on to their other albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just wasted 15 bucks","review":"This is the worst thing I've every heard and I love Pearl Jam. How Sad. It only gets 1 star cause I have to give it something."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Vedder show. Pearl Sham.","review":"This bands sucks beyond words. After TEN the band became Eddie VEdders solo act of pop rock radio trash. Every album after this has been even worse and Backspacer is the worst yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This album is ok at best, there are a few good songs, but it just doesn't rock as much as the first 3 albums. This cd lulls you to sleep by the 5th song. I probly won't listen to this album again, unless i can't sleep. Ten is still the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets' face it -- No Code is better left undeciphered","review":"I love PJ, but here's the truth about \\"No Code\\"... First the positives: The concept is facsinating and the packaging is the most impressive of any CD I've seen -- The fold-out case even comes with trading cards. The lyrics are perhaps their most engaging yet, including bits af poetry read aloud by EV. Problem is, No Code fails musically. There are two reasons for this; 1) It is a poor representation of the talent evident eveywhere else in the production, and; 2) It sounds nothing like the Pearl Jam we've come to know. The brilliance is gone -- The music is s l o w, dull and downright boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"i had to review this","review":"ok this has to have been the worst cd i ever owned. i bought it a long time ago and i havent listened to it since. now iam more into rap and r & b but yeah i dont even know this is a stupid post. but this cd was awful., i didnt like one song"},{"rating":"1","title":"Experimental music","review":"In this album, Pearl Jam has exagerated on their tendency to make experimental music.

It's just for die-hard fans of the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"No songwriting talent.","review":"Jawn Jawn the Jawny Jawn Jawn actually believes a piece of crap song like Off He Goes is better than When The Music's Over by The Doors.

Wright has, by his own admission, eliminated most of the poetic language from the original poem. The poetic, metaphor-like kennings seemed to him puzzles and word games which barred the reader from the real meanings of the narrative. The appositives used in place of actual names and pronouns he found \\"long-winded,\\" and the poetic descriptions pretentious. Wright, apparently believing readers not intelligent enough to understand creative language, has given us a translation of Beowulf in the form of highly simplified prose, with few poetic descriptions or language that will \\"distract the reader\\" from the narrative. What remains is a clumsy, awkwardly worded translation which offers little to replace the poetry Wright has hacked out of it. Any lover of language will be deeply disappointed by this translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I thought this would be the perfect gift for my very artistic daughter.

This one finds D.W. trying to get to sleep, but coming up with all sorts of reasons why she can't.D.W. really wants to get to sleep, but just doesn't seem to be tired. Furthermre, the wind is making noise outside, and so is Baby Kate. Arthur and his parents come in and try to give her some things to help her out. But all of these things don't seem to help and only make her more awake.\\"Good Night, D.W.\\" is very cutely and lushly illustrated. One of the best things is the detail. Because this a book, the illustrations can include much more detail than what you usually see on the show. The best part is that D.W.'s normal pink sleeping jumpsuit is now adorned with images of herself, stars, Arthur and a crescent moon wearing a cap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fit, great look!!","review":"Easy install and adds a great look to the bike!!

Ernie was my favorite:) About a year back, my older brother brought home the cd, he felt like \\"reliving\\" his childhood. After I listened to it, i realized how many old memories it brought back to me. I realized that I knew the words to each and every song! In no time I was singing and learning the songs to play on my guitar. I have spiced the songs up a bit, but I hope that someday I will be playing these timeless classics to my own children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the favorite cd","review":"This has some cute songs, but is not our most requested Sesame Street cd.

Amazon delivers it quickly and they're always in good shape. GET THE OFFICE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera","review":"As with season four, in season five, the show's humorous moments are outweighed by the \\"this is just too stupid\\" moments.Too many characters - Michael, Dwight, Angela, Andy - come across as grossly exagerrated caricatures rather than believable people. They act so demented that, too often, the show is painfully stupid.During season five, THE OFFICE was sometimes funny, but it was mainly just a soap opera. The soap opera actualy is interesting for a few episodes when Micheal Scott leaves Dunder Mifflin to start his own paper company. Aside from that, watching season five is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Office!","review":"It's the Office, how could I not be satisfied?

The themes for each episode lets the viewer appreciate that week's main characters' quirky personnas that leads you to think what will he/she do next.

No other show can make me laugh, and squirm and root for the characters like the Office can. Seasons two and three were the best, but season 5 is an improvement over season 4, for sure, and worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius. Maybe less genius than prior seasons. But still genius.","review":"I don't even watch the show on TV any more. I just wait for the DVDs to be released, and watch the whole season over a week or two. And the deleted scenes. And commentaries. To me, The Office is on par with a movie, where you want to know the background information, how decisions were made, etc. It is a very rich, concentrated and satisfying blend of humor and character development. I actually think some of the plot lines take away from the humor, but I guess they are a necessary evil, giving the show a good deal of momentum. To anyone who appreciates dry humor but doesn't 'get' this show, I recommend starting from Season One and really paying attention to the subtleties. I had to do that (thought it was boring at first, jumping into one of the later episodes). Now it is my favorite show of all time, supplanting MASH, Cheers, etc. Although not perfect, it comes very close."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Magic is Gone","review":"What happened to this show? The Office used to be an amazingly funny show. But halfway through the fifth season it became terrible! The comedy was bland, the antics, rather than clever, were just stupid, and characters were acting differently than they have used to. Are the writers/producers doing double duty with another show? My wife and I purchased seasons 1-4 and have enjoyed watched them over and over. The first half of this season was good, but my wife and I have only produced a mild chuckle during the last half of this season. We will not be purchasing this season at all or maybe when it goes on sale. I hope the writers/produers turn back the clock to when this was funny or ax the show at the end of season 6. If you are new to the series, don't start by buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Office Season Five","review":"I love watching the show so it is great to watch a whole season (without commercials!) at my convenience.

As each season comes along, it just gets funnier and funnier. It's full of very weird - but very likeable characters. Season 5 is the best so far. The special features are a bonus. A bargain for anyone who likes to laugh.The Office - Season Five"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Office","review":"I only give this a four because I think Season 2 and 3 are better, however I'm a huge fan of the Office and think that you should start with Season 2 before 1. Season 1 has a lot of the British version of the origial Office and isn't necessarily American humor. Renting Season 2 then going back to 1 or bearing Season 1 (it does get better in 2 I promise) prior to spending you money would be better than buying Season 5 to start.Of course if you have seen all the other Office Seasons and need to know if Season Five is a good purchase you should base that decision on your past experiences of watching the show and not the reviews of individuals. This purchase completes my collection and I can't wait for more of Season 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"great dvd product","review":"I love The Office!!
