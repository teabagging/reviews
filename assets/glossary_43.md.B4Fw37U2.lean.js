Sorry, chaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillarious! Gut-busting! The greatest movie EVER!","review":"South Park is my all-time fav. show, and this movie was the best one I saw in 99, period. I saw this 2 times in theaters and both times I almost choked on my popcorn! Whether or not u like South Park, u should give this movie a try. If it doesn't get you dying on the floor, you're not from this Earth! But beware: Never in my 15 years on this planet have I heard the F word so many times in a single animated movie. If any parents out there are reading this, I highly reccomend not letting any kid under 13 seeing this- Belive me, you will NOT want your kids saying these phrases around the house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"After being disappointed by some of the episodes I had seen at the time on Comedy Central, I was quite reluctant to see the movie. I'm glad I did see the movie when it was in the theaters. I have never laughed so hard in my life for any movie. My eyes and ears have never been the same since I've seen South Park:Bigger, Longer & Uncut. Now I own this movie on tape. I would never, ever let any kid under the age of 15 see this movie. I couldn't and still can't believe that Trey Parker and Matt Stone got away with murder literally with all the explicit language and graphic imagery that flooded the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAHAHA Laughs all the way through!!","review":"If you like South Park the series then this movie will be no different. You will be laughing even if you don't get all the subtle jokes. If you havent already purchased this DVD then you should definetely get it. Eventhough it was real funny, there are still 2 or 3 regular episodes that are actually funnier than the movie. And also the DVD doesnt have any special features, and thats the main reason I can't give it higher than 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I am not a South Part fan.

I have watched it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Movie, Decent DVD","review":"What is there to say about South Park? The movie is absolutely brilliant--deliciously dirty and an incredibly smart satire. The first viewing is, of course, the funniest, but the movie holds up well under repeated viewings--especially for a movie that derives many of its laughs from shock.This DVD presents the movie very well, in anamorphic widescreen. And it includes trailers, which is nice. However, I have to take one star off for this DVD not being as good a presentation as it could have. I would love to see a Trey Parker/Matt Stone commentary. Furthermore, I would have absolutely loved to see this DVD include the feature from Boogie Nights in which you can jump directly to a song's scene. One click access to Uncle F**ka, What Would Brian Boitano Do?, La Resistance, etc. would have been perfect.Still, this DVD is currently the best way to experience the movie, so pick it up if you're a fan. But I still want my Special Edition, Paramount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some more Friggin' Funnie!","review":"Alright, now too start I had made another comment about another movie being Friggin' Funnie but this movie as well holds claim to that title.

I don't care for musicals much, but I am a huge South Park fan and I absolutely loves this movie. The music is well-written and very very funny, as to be expected from the minds behind South Park. It came out during the beginning of the 3rd season (1999) so don't expect a lot of cameo appearances by recent characters.If you have Blu Ray player, pick up the Blu copy of the movie. The newly released Blu copy has the creator commentary. For fans, the commentary is reason enough to own the disc. Many of you are probably familiar with the mini-commentaries Trey and Matt provided on most of the South Park Season DVDs, but this time it's feature-length and even has some of the other crew members share whatever they can remember making the movie, and as always is very funny and full of inside jokes and stories.Let's hope the \\"Team America\\" Blu Ray Release is not far away."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST OF THE BEST","review":"I saw South Park, and I loved the humor and stuff. But this movie is far beyond the TV show. It's great! It has a crappy story, but hey, it's sill funny. I reccomend you get this NOW and order the fastest shipping to see this jewel in film history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Musical Comedy","review":"\\"South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut\\" is extremely funny and it's one of the few musicals I can actually stand. Although the movie is not as funny as the best \\"South Park\\" episodes, it stands up pretty well against most any other movie I've ever seen. The writers deal with a pretty weighty issue (censorship) while dishing out some incredible humor. If you like this movie, you might also enjoy listening to \\"Joe's Garage\\" by Frank Zappa. Both deal with similar issues in a humorous, irreverent manner. In fact, there is a certain amount of irony in this comparison due to Isaac Hayes' recent departure from the show: \\"Joe's Garage\\" features something called \\"The First Church of Appliantology\\" which is obviously a reference to Scientology. BTW: \\"Joe's Garage\\" is also, obviously, a musical, but it hasn't been made into a movie that I know of."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best musical of alll time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this movie is a hilarious movie,..,but the thing is it doesn't really have any special features.Only 2 trailers and a teaser. i was expecting commentary or a behind the scenes, or something like that. but the movie still covers it. it is genious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant original musical satire","review":"This is extremely clever and very funny. It contains an original song score that should have earned an Oscar nomination - instead it had to settle for a Best Song nom. The satire is outrageous and right on. Not for children - the animation is truly bad - but one of the most original adult satires to hit the screen since DR. STRANGELOVE. Not for everyone but it definitely hits its mark. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best animated films ever made.","review":"If you have not heard of South Park, you must be from another planet. Cartman, Kyle, Kenny and Stan are the coolest dudes around on TV and now on the big screen!Well, I suppose the boys have gone just a little bit too far this time. When they saw the full-of-swearing Terrane and Philip movie, they become bad-mouthed boys and cause a war! Uh-oh is right indeed.If you are regilous or Canadian and you are sensitive to your feelings, don't see this! But anynother people out there who are looking for a cool, hilarious and unforgettable animated feature film, see this by all means!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never OVER-estimate the taste of the American public.","review":"I'm embarrassed to have rented South Park. I'm not a prude by any stretch; in fact I knew what to expect going in. But this film was so far over the top that it didn't even approach being funny after the first few fountains of profanity and obscenity. Parents of teens, beware. This movie will warp their fragile little minds. Let them watch good ol' fashioned graphic sex and violence instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE END IS NEAR","review":"I can't honestly give any of the episodes on TV five stars except the Hunting episode, \\"BIRD!\\", and this movie certainly isn't going to get 5 either. In my own opinion this movie is nowhere near Blazing Saddles, AIRPLANE!, or The Blues Brothers. I am somewhat in awe it has the high ratings it does. Have you people seen Blazing Saddles, AIRPLANE! or The Blues Brothers? How can you put it in the same category? Anyway, to dissect it. The intro song is good, I will give it that. Cartman has a few good lines throughout as usual. Saddam and Satan are funny. But for the most part .... for the most part the vulgarity is simply another aspect of a degenerate culture. You guys can do better and you know it. Remember the script for AIRPLANE! was written and rewritten for years before it was made into a full fledged B movie. Please take your time on the next one. I assume you have enough cash now that you will do it for artistic license and not simply to cash in"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"This movie is really terrible. It captures nothing of what made the TV show such a hit. The humor mainly depends on foul language. It feels as if these guys are running short of imagination. There is too much singing; it seems like they sing so much just to take up time. Don't bother with the movie. Get the video of the episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Chance","review":"What a chance they had,what a mistake they made. I still don't know how a show so good could produce a movie so mind numbingly stupid,do yourself a favor if you like the show,stay away from the movie-it sucks real bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was I Thinking?","review":"I'm not quite sure what made me buy this movie because I am no fan of the show, but I can tell you I very much regretted wasting my money on it.I knew it would be vulgar, and it was. But I thought it might also have something close to humor somewhere in the movie, and that it did NOT have. Nor did it have any special features that you would expect to get on a dvd.I sure must be missing something that most other people who have reviewed this movie saw in it.My advice, do not waste your money on this thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly","review":"Not so long ago, it was considered hilarious and great humor to belittle and degrade minorities. \\"South Park\\" appeals to the identical ugliness in human nature; it has just switched topics and targets so as to be allowed in public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I think this movie had to much swearing. I'm geusing that about 50% of the words they say are swears. I used to like Them but I don't know why. I don't even know why I saw this stupid movie. The boy who smoked ciggaretts said really bad things about god. The first time I saw it, I thought that it was funny, but now I realize that it is the biggest piece of gargage in the world. So if you're into to toilet humor, you could buy it, but if you're accualy a decent person, don't"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjectives, I need adjectives... someone get me a thesaurus!","review":"Apart from being a vehicle to bring the South Park kids to the big screen, the creaters of this film wanted to make a statement about free speech and censorship; thus, they intentionally attempted to make the film disgusting, perverted, obscene, profane, blasphemous, offensive, crude, and naughty. They succeeded.It is also, at times, very, very funny. But consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much singing... not enough Cartman","review":"The only reason to watch South Park is to see Cartman get ... off. He does so in \\"Bigger, Longer and Uncut\\" but not enough for my taste. Too much time is spent on stupid muscial numbers and a hopelessly unfunny plot. Sadaam Hussein and Satan are lovers? Oooohh... tee-hee!! Big Gay Al is big and ... and does a Broadway number at the end? What a kneeslapper! Gimme a break. It's humor for twelve-year olds.Aside from Cartman getting zapped everytime he swears, there's nothing funny here (well, I admit.... making fun of how Canadians talk is pretty funny). Nothing satirical (unless Parker and Stone are satirizing how South Park pushed the limits of animated foul-mouthed kids... If so... whatever guys. Nice waste of celluloid). Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stunk m'kay................","review":"Being an avid fan of the weekly Comedy Central show, I found this movie from the gross out kings Parker and Stone to be a major disappointment. The constant profanity and singing was so annoying I lost interest in the movie. The movie had some moments such as Cartman's theme about Kyle's mom and the farting duo Terrence and Phillip. If you hate profanity, sexism, and political incorrectness stay away from this movie m'kay......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigger, Longer & Even less talent","review":"Don't get me wrong; I have enjoyed watching the show on more than one occasion. However, this movie is just not theatre material. Its just one long drawn out episode with none of the magnificence a television to theatre film should include! trey parker & matt stone totally take advantage of the viewer (in my respective opinion) by constantly indulging in their ability to 'do movie stuff' i.e. language.. Totally an immature comedy. If that's your bag, then by all means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep the kids away","review":"Crude ,rude, socially unacceptable.Somewhat funny if bathroom humor is your thing. Foul language and flatulance for all. As the title says KEEP THE KIDS AWAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone and silly.","review":"Definitely over the top...too much so. Watching this silly movie feels more like watching a couple of immature kids wreaking an equally immature form of vengeance once given the smallest ability to do so. The swearing and off-color humor is so overdone that it borders on ridiculous, and it doesn't have to offend your sensibilities for you to think so. I agree with an earlier review; I think the twins have run out of steam, and more specifically, out of things to say. This movie seemed to be an hour-and-a-half snub at the ratings boards.And I have to say that the music is nothing special either, unless you're into novelty/off-color songs.This is a pretty silly movie that, while it does still display some of the subtle, witty social commentary I used to enjoy in the tv show, still buries itself with its own attempts at shock value. Disappointing overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny for about ten minutes...","review":"then it gets old fast. Hearing these kids swear for 90 minutes isn't all that entertaining.

It's said in the Guiness Book Of world records that this movie holds the record for \\"Most Swear Words Ever Said In An Animated Film\\" with 179 uses of the F bomb, and.......I forgot how many of the other words were said, but anyways this movie is probobly not for children under like, 14 years of age. The movie is not just a movie, but a musical, with some pretty good numbers in it, that you wouldn't expect from South Park, plus like every single South Park episode the movie teaches you something, about polotics and war, and censorship.....and Kenny's true identity. Any way's, this movie is for anyone who is looking for good down & dirty comedy, and should not be seen by kids......it can currupt their fragile little minds. 5/5!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I love this movie.

But when it started the first thing i did was laugh! Emedietly they started off with stan singing a song about the town. (Its a musical.) Then the hole theater started cracking up too. It was full of songs, and horror, and commity. And near the end they showed Kenny whith out his hood on. I went back to see it 2 more times. I would sudjest this movie to true South Park fans.

Definitely not for those who are offended easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Apparently there are some confused people out there. South Park, the television show, is based from an animated short which no such thing as \\"delicately skirted the edges of acceptability\\".. and coming from the creator of \\"Cannibal: The Musical\\" it's no suprise that the humor is heavily rooted in the movie's musical nature.To put it bluntly this is one of the most amazing satires I've ever seen (apparently some people don't know what a satire is), and makes a briliant social commentary on itself, mocking the readiness of society to find someone other than themselves to blame for their own shortcomings. Watch this movie, over and over again, if you fail to see the humor, don't worry, it's probably just you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Film I've Ever Seen!","review":"I haven't laughed out loud at any movie as much as I did this one.

Anyone who doesn't think this movie is funny needs to lighten up. The US at war with Canada, if the blood of Terrance and Phillip is spilled on US soil Satan(w/ Saddam) will rule. It focus's on how uptight people in our country can be when it comes to \\"indecency\\". I give 2 thumbs WAY WAY up. Fans of South Park, it is a viewing must; Religious Conservatives need not apply.

(Even if thy're all RETARDs and under AGE) I saw some South Park cartoons 5-6 years back in Taiwan. The cartoon's art is based on the original way, but I'm hoping that the graphics that they are using these days have greatly advanced. I'm also very shocked about how people (Even this kid around 8 that wrote a reveiw for it and actually saw it!) actually think that all this cussing is funny! I don't really think so because I think that there should be anything that the creators want to put into their crazy movies and cartoons except for too many cuss words. A few cussing don't bother me, but once it gets out of hands, the whole movie is ruined by all the cussing.Well, the musical better be good, and not so cussy.

The movie is not witty. The whole movie is just trash! They must have used the f-word over one hundred times and it never generates a laugh. They were going purely for shock value of the f-word. It seems the script was written by a bunch of 10-year-olds that just learned how to swear. C'mon, I know these guys can do better.I am not one of those people that are hyper-sensitive about everything. I am just calling it as I see it. This movie is stupid. I really don't understand what other people see in this movie. I think people just like the excessive vulgarity. This movie will seem very dated over time as the next \\"Elvis\\" becomes popular.The story is OK but slow moving because of all of the lame songs. I would recommend getting any of the season DVDs before getting the movie.PS ...or get the newer Primus DVD... highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor movie.","review":"It's not that I completely dislike South Park. I think that some intelligence is behind the humour, and, in spite of the crudeness and profanity, would rather my children watch this than many of the movies and TV shows out there now.But I honestly can't rate this baseness, this shock humor, with more than a single star. I am not in favor of censorship, I am quite liberal, and I don't have any objections to this being out there. But the language and the meanness are blunt, and not delicate or unsubtle. I would call this out-and-out mean and crude, and not define it as satire. Satire implies a dryness, a cleverness. This movie didn't have it. So I cannot say that this is a movie of good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest movies ever!","review":"South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, if not the funniest.

The plotline was basically a collage of anything and everything objectionable that the producers could think up --- and everything they thought up made it in.

Simple as pie.The jokes are definitely more vulgar then the series but you won't be able to stop yourself from laughing at them.

If you are a South Park fan or someone who is not easily offended and looking for some laughs then rent this movie before you buy it. The movie is different than the tv show{which is good}.

This movie is about Stan, Cartman, Kyle, and kenny sneaking into an R rated movie about their beloved Canidian duo Terrance & Phillip. The movie has foul language and the boys begian to repeat it. Their overprotective mothers declair war on anada as a result of this. At the same time Saddam Hussien and the Devil are having relationship problems.

The prose style is incredibly simple, told almost without emotion, reflecting the routine simplicity of Isaku's life. Yet instead of coming off as dry or clinical, the narrative is harrowing.

My son actually touched the prongs to see if it was shocking and it was working but my cat seemed to like it. He would lay next to it whenever he had the collar on.

Once the cat figured out that getting near the tree was a bad idea, she never went there again and it wasn't long before we didn't even need the collar....just took longer for her to learn this than a dog. As well, heavy hair around the neckline can prevent them from feeling the \\"correction, so you may have to change it.

Then I wanted to see for myself..ouch..on the lowest setting this is painful and I have been through 3 cancer surgeries.DO NOT BUY THIS ! There are much more humane ways to protect your pet like a large indoor fence....just deal with it if you can't watch your puppy every minute you need some kind of protection for him/her until he learns what is ok and what isn't.

One of my main concerns was that the battery life on the collar would be short and I'd have to replace the (expensive?) battery often. But, we have used the battery included and left the collar on for nearly 3 weeks solid and it's still ticking!

They collars are not cruel (zap yourself first, and you will see it is like a strong static pop you get on a dry, cold day when you touch a piece of metal or something after walking across a shag carpet), but it gets the message across.

I also recommend taking a Myers-Briggs test (MBTI) and seeing if the results of the MBTI match up with what you find in this book.

All our candles, extra table settings, and etcetera have stayed dry in the severest of rain storms, and with the fold-down sides it remains a small footprint on the deck. Assembly was as easy and required mainly the ability to follow the english alphabet as all parts are easily labeled. Some parts required a bit of strength to snap into place, but most individuals can do alone or it's easily accomplished by two. The unit was delivered as promised and tracked easily from start to finish. It's made of sturdy plastic and we were suprised that doors and hinges work easily and well.

Sounds great for movies, good low end punch, and nice for music too.-Only con might be size; however, after having gone from much smaller speakers & a Bose center channel, I will not go back due to the increase in sound, detail, & power you get from a larger speaker.

A frail ten-year-old girl named Carol (because she was born on Christmas Day and her mother heard the carols from the church next door) plans a memorable Christmas for a poor family of 9 children who live in the back alley. Carol wants nothing for herself this year, since she feels already blessed by the riches of love from her own family.Quaintly narrated with occasional old-fashioned words to remind us of its century-old setting, this book may not appeal to hardcore 90's school kids, who prefer action and popular slang. But the messages of family unity, bravery in the face of hopelessness, and cheerful self-sacrifice provide inspiration, especially during the holiday season. Perfect to be read aloud a chapter at a time--promoting intergenerational literary pleasure and special family memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition is a travesty","review":"This looks like a workbook with the text taking up 18 pages and the rest of the book filled with fifteen 8.5 x 11 blank pages.

This version is supposed to provide you with a text version for you to read from your computer, but with the added feature of being able to turn on the professional reader so you can listen to him. The CD took at least 10 minutes ( no exaggeration) to boot up, after which I had multiple copies show up on the task bar.

Much of it reads like a speech, with a sweeping, poetic presentation of very cold hard realities. It is a painful but inspiring story.

The detail accounts of torture and abuse directly from the mind, mouth and written hand of a man that experienced them first hand is insightful. The wisdom and strength that Fredrick Douglas exhibited as a child was impressive. The endurance that he possessed was admirable to say the least. Men are often revered for their ability to inflict great pain on a large group of people.

Frederick Douglass' first hand account of the cruelty and inhumane institution that is slavery puts you in the narrative, where you can feel the brunt of the rods on your back and the deep personal humiliation in your psyche.

What I found was a profound, thought-provoking narrative about Douglass' life as a slave. The language is not verbose but rather clear and cogent. I find that the phrase \\"a must-read\\" has become somewhat of a cliché when used today but this book is truly that in every sense. It is \\"a must-read\\" because it gives an idea of the horror it was to be a slave from someone with first-hand experience. Yet Douglass writes to educate, not to shock. It isn't necessary to have a special interest in slavery to appreciate this book; rather one must have an interest in identity. Before you do anything else, read this book. It will change your perception of America's past and America's present."},{"rating":"2","title":"A firsthand view of the worst part of American history","review":"Excellent; an essential read for anyone seeking an understanding of America's history (or present, for that matter).

It impacted me then and even more so today. It gives an inside look at slavery in a way that the book \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" never could. I wish I could meet Mister Douglass. I wish he could see the progress that he and others like him initiated so long ago. The crime of slavery has left it's mark on our country along with the dreadful scars of bigotry.

I began reading and could not put is down until the last page was finished. I was amazed by Mr. Douglass' tenacity. No matter what obstacle barred his path, he managed to keep a glimpse os his goal.His main theme throughout the book is to illuminate the atrocities of slavery to the world. This is a hard subject for some to face as we tend to conveniently \\"forget\\" the ugly parts of our history.Reading about this extraordinary man's life should encourage any person who had faced difficult situations in their lifetime. As impossible as a problem may seem to be, it can be surmounted. Success can be obtained. My hardships are nothing compared to the problems faced by Mr. Douglass.

I believe it is the first written by a former slave in the U.S., and it clearly outlines the disputes surrounding the anti-slavery movement and the movement for the then status quo.Though slavery is long gone in the U.S., it is useful to reflect on the process that lasted for many centuries before it was successful. In his case, we see how his masters, who were often considered more benign than other masters, tried to prevent Frederick from learning how to read, arguing that reading was beyond their needs.Aside from the historical importance of this book, we also have a very interesting character in Frederick, as he is not resentful but rather fair and refined, which I believed added much to his reputation as a leader of the anti-slavery movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"For everyone","review":"'Narrative' is a wonderful work in two different ways. First, it portrays the life of the American slave with brutal honesty, putting the reader alongside the slave laboring in the fields, the slave being whipped, and the slave running away. Second, it is a story of a growth and acquistion of personal autonomy. Douglass outlines his early life in such a way that the reader observes the development of his conscience from a young boy into a young man.Simple and powerful prose coupled with vivid detail make this a truly great work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of friends would you win by reading this?","review":"Russell's slim volume is a jaded, cynical whirlwind of hackneyed metaphors (\\"Isn't that what Xena would do?\\") and knee-jerk advice for those who want to reduce people to quick, sound-byte sized definitions. I don't believe that \\"all women are questioning the very definition of love\\" (p. 149), just those that have finished reading this book and want to pattern themselves on the author. And can anyone, male or female, take seriously Russell's pigeonholing of personality types?

The vast majority of the recipes are slight variations of one another. (This is because the book features sausage recipes from various regions of France-so the spice mixtures etc are only going to change so much).Its a neat book but the complete lack of pictures makes this a bad book for a novice. Unless you simply want a book on sausage to read and not to use-I would not buy this book.

His book is about differential equations with discontinuous righthand sides; a subject that you will not find in regular text books on differential equations. Filippov starts the discution stablishing a new concept of what a solution is in the context of discontinuities and states the main theorems on existence and uniqueness of these solutions. This book requires from the reader a deep mathematical background. Topics such as nonlinear systems, bifurcation theory and differential inclusions are addressed. Despite the fact that this is a math book, it is a highly recomended fundamental reading for every control engineer interested in nonlinear systems, especially in sliding mode control. The only bad thing about this book is that almost all bibliographical references are in Russian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best performance","review":"Faure's Requiem is one of my favorite pieces.

I enthusiastically recommend it.If you like Faure, also try Pelleas & Melisande. The Deutsche Grammophon version with Seiji Ozawa is very good.

The Big Red One central focus is the bitter irony of war . War is insane, and the longer you are in war, the more insane the average person becomes, yet at the same time there are moments of absolute beauty and peace. As far as stunning battle sequences, the opening 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan beats this movie but the rest of SPR basically sucks. Big Red One on the other hand concentrates on a central theme of survival. The tag line at the beginning \\"This is a fictional story about factual death.\\" says all there is to say about war movies. Are there flaws? Yes, just like any movie there are rough spots and inconsistancies. But unlike SPR, the director is more interested in telling a story than patting himself on the back. Watch this movie with an open mind and you too will be moved, shaken, stirred and drained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great War Show","review":"Watched this movie a long time ago and wanted to see it again so I ordered it. I really like this movie with Lee Marvin. I would suggust anyone who would like to see a great war show get this one. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is better than Pvt. Ryan","review":"This film is probly the best war film ever. Its takes you through the grunts view through his thoughts, and it shows how they really felt when they were alone with no officer around. Lee Marvin plays his greatest role here as the gutty SGT. I really liked the cigar smoking book writer who naration through out the movie. Also the solider who was siclian was great too. Basicaly the whole thing was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-movie hokum","review":"I loved Lee Marvin in \\"The Iceman Cometh\\", \\"Point Blank\\", \\"The Killers\\", and \\"Cat Ballou\\", and I can understand how he was picked, as former Marine, to play the lead in \\"The Big Red One\\". Sadly, though based on Fuller's experiences, the script and direction substitute cliches for reality. Compounded by poor cinematography, it has all the feel of a cheap, '60s, TV production. If you appreciate, great military films like \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", \\"Das Boot\\", and \\"Paths of Glory\\", \\"Twelve O'Clock High\\", then you will not be rewarded by \\"The Big Red One\\". (I donated my copy to the library.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Liked The Original Better","review":"I heard lots of hype for this when it came out which caused me to purchase this one instead of the original. Theres a short homosexual scene when The Sgt is in the German hospital and he is kissed on the lips by the medic or doctor. Did that go on that much that theres a need to portray it. I'm surprised in 1980 this was filmed or even thought of since gay was not in back then. Also the scene of him spanking the Hitler youth who shot the G.I. was stupid. The scenes added I could have done without, not too much substance in them. The editors were right the first time when they did this without Fullers permission. I liked it before when there was a sense of honor and pride that I got from the movie, without the sex and useless characters added."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best war movies of all time","review":"1.

I've seen it several times over the years. I can still sit and watch it even though I know most of the scenes.At times, it's a little slow, but overall, it is worth the time to sit and watch. At this price, it's a no brainer to add to your movie collection (if you are collecting films on war).Compared to similar films of the time. Tora! Tora! Tora! and Midway are slightly better.A good film to watch. Plenty of authentic scenery and equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes its best to leave things alone","review":"I always liked this film and felt that it did a good job showing how things might have been. But it turns out that the writer/director couldn't leave well enough alone and had to go back and add a bunch of things that were cut from the original. All he did was make it longer and harder to watch. I would rather see this on tv than sit thru this long boring re-do. Too bad the original was pretty good.

Duh!!See Sam Peckinpah's \\"Cross of Iron\\" (1977) starring James Coburn for an excellent WWII B-movie. Coburn tears Marvin to shreds.Fuller, you should be ashamed of yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another overrated Sam Fuller film","review":"Saw this extended version in a theatre recently.While it looks better than before due to remastering nothing can be done to improve the low budget and pedestrian dialogue.Lee Marvin is very good but the rest of the cast is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worse war movie I have ever seen.","review":"Words cannot do justice to how bad of a portrayal of war this movie is. Even comparing it to other war movies made around the time of this one and before it is bad. The action is horrible and unrealistic the acting is a let down and most importantly a sixty year old Lee Marvin as the leader. Bad...Bad...Bad...Get Patton, all quiet on the western front, The longest day, A bridge to far. Hell any war movie but this one.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Borrrring One","review":"This movie SUCKED Lee Marvin leading a bunch dopey looking GIs ! It was confusing to follow . The Longest Day was cool but this movie with Marvin dressed as a arab in a German hospial .

Didn't think so. And the really odd thing is that Marvin doesn't object until at least the second kiss. Was his character undecided whether he liked it?I guess this is Fuller's idea of a good war movie or at least a good joke on the rest of us. If war is hell, then watching this movie is the closest thing to hell. And I don't mean that in a \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" way.If you make the mistake of buying this movie and watch the first few scenes, don't torture yourself by hoping it will get better. Hit eject and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst war film ever?","review":"This film is a disgrace, the combat is unrealistic and i'm sure the tanks in it are all the same for americans and germans alike. The narration is very annoying and quite pointless. I know the film is trying to put across an important message but it could have done it better; better actors for a start, Lee Marvin is not exactly my favourite. Overall leave this film alone, if you want to see a good war film watch Patton, A Bridge too Far or The Longest Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wrong disc too!","review":"I'm glad I read A.

A few days ago I purchased the same DVD from Walmart's $5 Bargain Bin and read his complaint when I got home. I immediately opened it and yep I too got only the second disc. It does have a good documentary about Sam Fuller's career but I'm returning it tomorrow for a refund and will order the two disc set. Had I waited too long, I might have not been able to return it. I don't understand how anyone at the company didn't notice this mistake when it was packaged. So much for Quality Control!

The only problem is that Sam FULLER's movie originally lasts MORE THAN 4 HOURS, it was cut by the studio and this copy you're so amazed about is unfortunately a clip of THE BIG RED ONE, the movie that you can only READ fully (check at the books). It still remains a good movie but we must hope to see one day on DVD edition the original movie wich is sometimes shown at the french \\"cinématheque\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better than the Theatrical Release!","review":"I think they added in about forty minutes of film.

A good movie and history lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Red One Has Not Aged Well","review":"I really enjoy war films and purchased this \\"reconstruction\\" with great anticipation, but it was not worth it. In comparison with some very fine, more recent films - Gettysburg, Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan and the like - Big Red One comes across as a little melodramatic and the combat footage often seems unrealistic. It is simply not as sophisticated as some more current films on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"War Classic -HORRIBLE PACKAGING MATERIALS!","review":"Great film, DVD done right, package LOOKS good, but when I went to open it up it took ALMOST A HALF AN HOUR AND EVEN THEN THE LOW-GRADE SUPER-STICKY TAPE ON ALL EDGES OF THE CASE RUINED THE COVER! Whoever made choices contributing to this fiasco needs to be shot! Or at least fired and drummed out of the industry. Didn't help matters that on the fancy black slip cover Best Buy had slapped a big ugly price sticker that wouldn't come off all the way, even after I heated the glue up with a hair dryer.

Cliche-ridden, wooden acting, unbelievable (in a bad way) scenery, just general yuck. The storyline is so episodic as to be almost incomprehensible, other than that Lee Marvin's platoon was first st everything in WWII. There's a sequence at an insane asylum that is so laughably bad that I had to stop watching for a while. Would not recommend to anyone who wants a good war movie, or even a bad one. A complete and total waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gobs and Gobs of Hot Glue?","review":"The castle people look great, but the horses have gobs and gobs of hot glue dripping from their legs and felt saddles. The glue makes the toy look like something that no care or craftsmanship when into - a disappointment for a name so great as Melissa and Doug. I hope a Melissa and Doug rep contacts me about this problem. UPDATE: My son just put a castle guy in his mouth - the one with the black hood. When I took it away from him, his lips, tongue, and around his mouth were all dyed black. When I touched the hood - the part he had in his mouth - it dyed my fingers black. I will be looking for new castle people and will be waiting for a Melissa and Doug rep. to contact me ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money you save","review":"I bought these for my son and they are falling apart after only being played with for a short while. We have other bendable people from Plan Toys and though they are more expensive the quality is superior to the Melisa and Doug products."},{"rating":"2","title":"castle dolls","review":"We purchased these dolls to go with the castle, knowing they would be the correct height for the castle. As others have stated, they are very basic and don't seem to be the nicest dolls. But our 3 year old still plays with them and seems to enjoy them. So far (3 months of play) they have held up but it will be interesting to see how they hold up with two boys playing with them. The joints are held together with a dab of glue and within a few weeks the horses legs were so flexible it is hard to get them to stand on their own. But I would still purchase these over other dolls that are plastic. Definitely better quality than plastic and Melissa and Doug is a name to trust for toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for the kids","review":"Similar to the Plan Toys figures...these dolls work well with the folding castle set. The Plan toy dolls seem a little more put together, but my six year old didn't seem to notice any difference. She loves princesses, so these have replaced the doll house along with all the other things that go in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Castle Dolls","review":"I got this set to go with the Melissa and Doug Folding Castle. The kids love to play with them along with other dolls that fit the castle nicely (Disney, Polly Pocket).

It doesn't bother me, and certainly doesn't bother the kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned them","review":"Well, they are sort of poorly made.

The clothing is a bit unappealing but he does not seem to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down.","review":"I ordered this book in hopes of understanding what exactly the author meant when he asked the question \\"Are you a unicorn?\\". It's poorly put together and the text inside is in larger than normal print so it makes the book \\"appear\\" to have more pages. Unfortunately, this book is no doubt written from a christian point of view so if you don't know the mythology don't expect to get very far in understanding this book. In truth I found the book just to be a summary recap of the movie 'The Last Unicorn'. He didn't really answer any of my questions which had to do with recognizing and communicating with \\"unicorns\\". He talks about how unicorns and lions will come together at the end of days to fight the \\"evil\\" dragons/red bull. (A normal reaction from a typical fear based religion) All in all, if you're not a christian or you don't think that the end of the world is coming at the start of the new millennium, I'm quite sure you will not benifit from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life changer.","review":"I thought that this book was well written and completely UNBIASED! It changed my life. It awakend feelings in me that I had long forgotten. A must read for all people who feel lost in the world or just love unicorns."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely misleading","review":"What century are we living in? This isn't the middle ages, unicorns don't exist and why would anyone want to believe in folk tales? The author is misleading people with false beliefs. If you're into weird beliefs and freaky cults then this is the book for you, but for those of us who want reality then skip this one. We live in the 21st century and we're highly advanced in math, science, technology, the arts, psychology, etc. We don't need to fall back on medieval beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not what I'd hoped for","review":"I bought this book because of how interesting I found the website when I stumbled accross it. I was curious as to how he was going to explain this most bizarre theory, that unicorns are among us in human form. As I began reading it, I realised that I needed to stop waiting for him to give me a scientific basis for his claims about unicorn people being in the world, and just enjoy it for what it actually is - interesting reading, but not something backed up with solid evidence and grounding as I had expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing ideas for the new age.","review":"I found many of the points raised in this book regarding human interaction and purpose to be thought provoking. Unfortunately (depending on your point of view) the author relies heavily on intuitive insights and paterns they have observed in thier own lives. There really is not enough refference to concrete research to substantiate many claims. It really is a book that can either be taken with a grain of salt or weighed with a measure of faith. It is Christian oriented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept, Bad Execution","review":"I was probably disappointed in this book because I expected something else. Basically, it can be compared to someone typing up a blog entry on anything and everything they can think of relating to Unicorns in book form. The book seems to be of low-budget printing (which the price suggests otherwise compared to the other books I bought that were better and $5). I would not recommend this book, even as a reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh!","review":"Unicorns and their goal. I found it a little superficial and bad planed. Unicorns exist; they are not only the vision of the author (strongly based in the film 'The last Unicorn'); the magic around them is real. Unicorns are more than lost people.If the author wanted help (as the book says), he could explains deeply (for example) why they really got lost. In conclusion, a book only to be readed if you have nothing better to read (well, at least is a little entertaining)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !!!","review":"I purchased this sign for my 12 yr old grandson, and he immediately put it up in his room and was so happy about receiving it.

It's a great view of all the hysteria and behind the scenes stuff that at the time no one really got to see except for a select few. The performances are taken from the Ed Sullivan shows of 1964, but the addition of the Washington, D.C. concert is an added bonus, as well as the hotel stay in Miami Beach.

I sat down to watch it with my 12-year-old daughter, to proudly show her that the fab-four were, yes, much bigger than the Backstreet Boys. I was anticipating an energetic, fast-paced video. Boy, was I wrong. In a word, Yawn. This is one slow video, folks. The film-makers apparently felt that having inside-the-hotel access was too priceless to cut a second of footage. The result is endless sequences of the Beatles in rooms, and backseats of limos...on and on like the home-videos of people who don't know when to stop and move to the next scene. It was also a bit jarring, I'm afraid, to watch my heroes suck down what appeared to be about a pack an hour of cigarettes, though I suppose that's neither here nor there. Bottom line is that I wanted badly to like this movie, and revisit wonderful times, but it just dragged. Too bad. I shoulda bought Hard Day's Night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely worth buying","review":"It has been mentioned if you have purchased the \\"Anthology\\" on dvd as well as the \\"Ed Sullivan Shows\\" than you need not buy this....not so.

It appears I'm in the minority here, but I don't agree that this is a complex psychological drama. After repeated viewings, I don't think I learned anything about bipolar disorder, and the subject criticized the film for overblaming his father. Also, I disagree with the view that the movie wasn't melodramatic. Climbing the backstop while shrieking is overemotional unless it really happened, which it didn't. Take way the psychological drama and you're left with the baseball scenes, which Jimmy Piersall said were laughable. The theme of fathers trying to live out their dreams in their kids is an important one, but I don't think time or real life have been kind to the way this movie deals with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"Pride of the Yankees\\"","review":"Starring Tony Perkins perfectly miscast as a major league ballplayer.

Other than this avoid this movie at all cost and I regret giving my hard earned money to watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lara should take some Lessons in Humility","review":"There is such a pile of macho manure in this film that you need a snorkel. Arrogance runs so rampant across the screen that you can't tell the good guys from the bad in this movie. I remember when heroes had a little humility. That's what gave them staying power. Look at the likeable Indiana Jones that Harrison Ford created. Even look at the characters in the MUMMY. In that film even the villain had his moment of pathos and he even got to come back in the sequel! I'll tell you, that mummy was no dummy. Lara, you are out of your league. It was great to see Richard Johnson on the big screen once again on this film's theatrical release. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Thanks Richard."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Angelina Jolie was perfect for this movie","review":"To be completely honest, Angelina Jolie was the best part of this movie. It would have been nothing without her. But she is so intriguing to watch and so she made the movie. I gave it four stars because it was what it was. It was a great interpretation of the video game. She is the epidemy of Lara Croft. It is what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"It [stinks].","review":"First off, I just wanted to say that this movie [stinks]. Maybe it was all the bad reviews that I read that detered me from liking it, but I stopped watching it 30 minutes through. That's how bad it was. Stay away from it and if you must, rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"I so wanted to like this...","review":"It is a shame, but this was so bad it makes you want to cringe. I even think that the heroine might have some talent, but one does like plot, and to be quite honest mid-way through this drivel, I did not care what was going to happen next.The good news for the producers is that the sequel cannot be worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, you can tell this was a Summer movie.","review":"This movie is definitely not trying to win any awards or trying to be taking seriously. If you want to watch something exciting and stylish knock yourself out but you won't be thinking about this movie much afterwards because of two main reasons. One, there's barely any character development at all through out this picture. The only character that gets a little and I mean little focus throughout the whole film is Lara and even that's minimal. Second, is the fact that this movie runs essential on the standard save the world from an ancient object bit. If they make a sequel it will have to be about something more involving next time to get my money. In conclusion, Tomb Raider is your average action movie with pretty woman and an established name attached to it. Worth a rental but not much more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Late Night Sinamax Is Better","review":"I watched this at the movies. I've played all of the Tomb Raider games. The games were new and innovative for their time, even though they became repetitive with each new installment. This movie should be called \\"Angelina Jolie - Tomb Raider\\". I like Angelina Jolie don't get me wrong, but most the production money must have been spent on Angelina Jolie and the FX. Then they picked up some B-rated cheap-o guy to write it. Buy a better movie like one of the Indiana Jones or The Mummy. At least those movies have a better plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelina","review":"This was made when Angelina was still nuts, I'm just not sure if she was still blood in a vial nuts. Fun movie, don't be looking for anything deep, but some solid research done on the mythological ideas. Oh, Angelina looks outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tomb Raider","review":"Apart from Angelina's knockers, this film is a complete bore. Did anyone mention plot? Didn't think so. Did anyone mention acting? Nope. Did anyone mention good action? And that's the shocker of all shockers, they could of at least thrown in some cool action set-pieces, but what's on show here rarely passes mediocrity. Major dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film is fun to watch and it is sexy","review":"This is a delightful film, jam packed with excitement. In addition, Angelina Jolie moves about in a tight t-shirt in virtually all the scenes, except the last few minutes, even in the freezing arctic, showing what appears to be, but may not be, artificially extended breasts. She is portrayed in the film as a virtual superwoman, what the disc cover calls the \\"ultimate superhero,\\" with amazing intellect, strength, and agility. In fact, we see her training frequently in remarkable ways to maintain her skills.The plot is sci-fi. Nine planets will line up once every 5,000 years. This is an opportunity to combine certain items and gain enormous powers over time and space. Laura's now dead father trained her for this event. She is determined to do what her father requested. But there is a group of illuminati who also want this power, and their henchman who wants it for himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can you expect?","review":"I guess you can't really expect much from a movie based on a video-game. There are plenty of fanciful actions scenes (how do they always seem to miss point-blank with automatic weapons?...) but not much of a plot to speak of. Silly story; sub-par movie.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie","review":"When I went to see this movie, I was expecting a Indiana Jones type thriller but instead got a very boring and very bad movie. I watched it one more time after this to see if it was any better but it just got worse. I dont recommend seeing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my nominees for worst film of 2001","review":"Action movies are allowed to be dumb. Action movies based on videogames are allowed to be dumber. But no courtesy can allow anyone to enjoy that cinematic dropping that is Tomb Raider.This is a bad movie through and through.To think, all they had to is make something like Indiana Jones. They had ~80-100 million dollars, a solid actress in the lead, and no intent to make a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like (...) Raider","review":"Rather than create a legitimate action/adventure film, Simon West gave movie-goers the softest form of porn available. Why is there a shower scene in there? Is he selling shampoo?I think the same pre-teen gameboy nerdboys that go to see this movie were actually the same people the made the movie. Could they never get enough of watching silicone jiggling? \\"Hey guys, let's put another slow-motion running shot of Angelina running into the camera.\\" I bet they're working on the Tomb Raider swimsuit edition right now.To everyone who bought this DVD... do us a big favor and place it under a nice fat elephant (...). That's where you'll find Simon West working up his next big hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, boring, and a waste of time","review":"This movie starts out bad and never gets better. I could not take Angelina Jolie's gaze that she did throughout the movie. All she did was stand around.... do the gaze... and kick some butt. I guess I could say they matched the video game perfectly. But I expected more out of her. Boring, don't rent it and don't think of buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped trash","review":"What is there to say? A ridiculously bad script paired with the muggings and poutiness of Jolie make this a really bad movie. Action fans rejoice - if you want things to explode every two seconds then this is your flick. If you want anything else (like dialogue, character development, you know...general things that make a movie good) go see another movie. I can see kids really liking this movie, but other than that just rent it and save your hard-earned money for a better DVD purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"She did it again...","review":"After months of different trainigs as: yoga, kick boxing, boxing, gymnastics, bungee ballet etc... and a strict diet with no sugars Angelina Jolie became Lara Croft, she did lots of sacrifices to please us and then she became Lara Croft. She again did a hell of a job! Filling the big screen with sexiness and good acting as always! If you like action, special efects, and the most sexy woman on earth being the hottest cyber babe then you should check out Tomb Raider. Congratulations Angelina Jolie!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great work","review":"i love this movie. It just works. Jolie did a good job and i love the end where shes visit her father's grave in the end wearing a cute white dress and hate. It's like mad max meets wonderwoman."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Female Indiana Jones","review":"Angeline Jolie, gives us the female version of \\"Indiana Jones\\" in this wild cartoon-like adventure story, which is fun to watch. Being a mentally lightweight action film with no credibility (no villain ever harms Jolie in this film despite firepower that would take out some Third World countries) but our heroine is there to save the day, of course!Jolie mainly is there to show off her chest in tight tee-shirts and perform near-impossible stunts. To her credit, she went to extreme lengths to get herself physically-fit for the role.Audio-wise, this is a one of the better DVDs you will ever hear, with excellent use of the surround speakers. Nice scenery, a sharp picture and low profanity also are pluses. Yes, the action is a little much and too loud in spots but otherwise \\"Tomb Raider\\" is a fun adventure that is recommended to all.p.s. Skip the sequel; it's a weak one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelina is aweosme","review":"I recommend this dvd to anyone who is a fan of Angelina, you are not supposed to take this movie seriously, its just a fun chill out movie. The picture quality is amazing and its packed full of extras. If you love Angie buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much resemblance to the video game character","review":"Tomb Raider the movie failed to be hardly anything like Tomb Raider the video game. Lara Croft in the video game is dressed in brown and green clothes, Lara Croft in the movie is dressed in all black.Also, in the video game, she's just about always in tombs. In the movie, she hardly ever was in any tombs, and that movement of manuvers she did at the beggining of the movie in the tomb to make it seem as if it's the video game come to life expect for her black clothes, that was quickly over after only a few minutes and it was only in her backyard in her mansion where she practices.She is a very sexy woman, though. (...)Angelina Jolie's sexieness was the only good thing about Tomb Raider the movie, and again, if they were trying to make it as resembling to the video game as possible, then like that older movie Super Mario Bros., they didn't do so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 1/2 Star Average? Moral: T&A can disguise a bad movie","review":"A friend brought this movie over the other day. Let me sum this movie up.1) Angelina Jolie gets in a new outfit and slinks around to techno music for 5 minutes.2) Rinse, repeat.Throw in a shower scene to distract the audience from the fact that if they cut out all of the slow motion catwalk clothes modeling the movie would be 30 minutes shorter.The best part was when they do the same slow motion techno blah blah when they are showing the tomb raiding convoy drive across a frozen tundra in their jeeps."},{"rating":"2","title":"an action film that works","review":"While I'm certainly not a fan of the Tomb Raider video games (because they're horribly designed and endlessly frustrating) I couldn't believe my sees at the sight of a really good Tomb Raider action movie. Sure, some of the lines were pretty silly and cheesy, and the action scenes were pretty predictable because you KNEW Lara would always escape danger is highly unbelievable ways. It doesn't matter though, because I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of this film. Good watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dare I say it? Tons of fun...","review":"Fans of video-game-movies look no further. \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\" is the best of its kind. Loaded with nonstop action and thrilling fun, Angelina Jolie plays the very sexy Lara Croft, a british chick with an attitude. She uncovers the secret of an ancient legend hidden in a mysterious clock. Now it's a race against time as she must go against fellow archaeologists to find an all-powerful triangle. Great special effects, great direction from Simon West, and some high-flyin' explosive action mixed with the seductiveness of Jolie make this film an adventure-fans weapon of choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angelina Jolie, great actress...","review":"she is definitely perfect for the role of Lara Croft, and she did a fantastic job in the movie...and I'm not even a fan of hers.BUT, BUT, BUT...all the other actors in this movie just couldn't keep up with her. They fail to support her role. In the end, I was dissappointed with the movie because coz of all the bad acting from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Waste of Jolie's Talent","review":"Angelina Jolie was absolutely fabulous in \\"Girl Interrupted\\" and \\"Gia.\\" She's an absolutely gorgeous woman with acting talent to match--quite a combination. Why she wasted her talent on this film, an overblown cartoon about an Englishwoman type superhero, is what I can't understand. Jolie enters the action adventure genre with this film and I hope she doesn't intend to do more films in that genre. If you like fight sequences, you might like this film. If you like looking at Jolie, you also might like it. That's not enough for me though and this film offered nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I saw it expecting another bad video-game movie. I left it stunned by how much worse a movie can actually be. Save your brain cells, don't see this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Bad Creation!!","review":"This movie is a very bad representation of a very good video game! When the original Tomb Raider video game was released, it revolutionized the gaming industry. Never before had a game possessed such excellent 3-D graphics and gameplay. Combined with a solid storyline that involves deceit, treachery, and a hint of supernatural, and you've literally got the video game equivalent to Raiders of the lost Ark, one of the greatest movies of all time!The Tomb Raider movie is far less dynamic. It doesn't have a good storyline like the game and lacks the cleverness and whit of an Indiana Jones movie so, instead, you get a rip-off of both! The action is far too fast-paced to be even remotely believable. Furthermore, the end of the movie is EXTREMELY anti-climactic (nuff said). Anyone who is a fan of the excellent video game or of Spielberg's superb Indian Jones movies will be very (I stress very) disappointed with the Tomb Raider movie. Not even worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viewing this film took 5 minutes!!","review":"Five minutes into this [...]is all it took to see how badly the film companies are trying to set up a new franchise picture.But this was unwatchable... and what's with the English accent, Angelina.?Forgeddabout it.....don't even rent it, it's so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This movie it's a moust have.I have seen it so many times and this blu-ray version is awesomeThanks a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I have ever seen, bar none","review":"I have only one thing to say about this movie: It stunk on ice. Character development? None. Plot? Almost non-existent. Special effects and action? Snooze-fest 2001.Do yourself a favor. Don't rent it, don't buy it. I wouldn't even steal it given the opportunity.I just hope that they learned their lessons from this one, and the sequel will be better.But I'm not holding my breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad All the Way Around","review":"Obviously, this movie served no purpose other than to capitalize on the success of the video game and to excite prepubescent males who find Angelina Jolie attractive. The fact that much of the publicity surrounding this movie involved the need for Jolie to wear breast enhancements in order to look more like the unrealistically-endowed Lara Croft - and that those enhancements made it more difficult for her to do stuntwork - says it all. The script was awful; Jolie's acting (particularly her accent and sneering demeanor) was awful; the movie was awful. If you're a fan of the game or have the hots for Jolie, this movie probably is worth renting, but it's certainly not worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things should stay Video Games","review":"I found Tomb Raider most dissipointing, but then I didn't expect too much either.This movie made the Mummy look like very good Non-Fiction... The single bright spot was the sound.

This movie rates at the bottom of all the movies I have seen in quite a while. It appears that even the people making this movie realized how bad this movie was and decided to aim the camera more at her nice figure rather than try to make the movie any good. Nice graphics if you like video games. Go out and play Unreal Tournament if that is what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"More butchery from Hollywood","review":"It's obvious from the get go that whoever owns the creative rights to Tomb Raider the game, had no say so in what went into the movie. I don't know everything about the game, but what I do know is that in Lara Croft's bio for the game, she was raised by a rich family, and put through finishing school. So, she IS a lady, unlike the movie makes her butch and tomboyish. Next, she was disowned and made her own fortune. So on and so forth. Angelina Jolie is a great actress, but this movie had just plain bad direction. Even great athletes need good coaches. The other performances are on par for a free-for-all cheese fest. All I can say is I hope these aren't the same people doing Resident Evil, or that they're not planning to do a Duke Nukem movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"if i could give less than 1 star, i would've...","review":"WOW, what an awful this movie was! Albeit, Angelina pulled through as foxy as ever .. the only reason to see this movie if you're a fan of hers.The game has more compassion and feel than this movie. The characters are dull and quite honestly all expendable. The plot is far from evolved and the climax -- wait, no, there was no climax.Three thumbs up for Angelina .. as for absolutely everything else in and about this movie, if you could hear a sound this is where'd I'd fart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game Over","review":"I should make it clear that I do not play video games though I can't imagine players ever fall asleep in the middle of play. The same cannot be said for this film. Actually I wish I had slept through parts because the end result was the same. Missing a crucial plot point or scene would have explained my confusion during and in the end. Instead I left scratching my head and tired wondering what happened and why.Angelina Jolie probably offers up a great personification of Lara Croft and the action is interesting at times.

I know i am late on the review, but since the sequel is coming out this summer, i thought i would put my two cents in. First off, i went to see this in the movie theatre, thinking this was gonna be a great, especially when i heard Angelina was playing Lara Croft, but boy was i wrong, i think everyone in the theatre dozed off, including myself. It was dark, and air conditioned in that theatre and since the movie was boring, i guess everyone thought \\"what a great place to take a nap\\". There was very little action, and when there was action, you thought to yourself, who cares. A very weak plot, if i remembered what it was about, i would explain it too.

Even the incredible special effects are wasted in a hodge-podge of slice-n-dice editing that makes it impossible for all but those with ADD to follow.

Is that what they wanted me to do? I hope not. Another thing, in Indiana Jones, no matter which one you pick, almost every 15 minutes he's running into another problem... Stay away from this, do yourself a favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk - but at least it is pure and genuine junk","review":"If anything would prove that most films based on comic book or computer game characters are rarely worth a jot of concentration, this one should. This film is terrible on every level - wooden acting, silly stunts that are obviously computer-enhanced, and the most flaccid plot you could imagine, just pure formula garbage. The worst.Don't bother, unless you want to vegatate and wallow in mindless pap. There is nothing to recommend this film, not even you-know-who's computer exaggerated chest."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the blu-ray release","review":"When the Lara Croft video game was released it was so ahead of its time, it influenced and changed the video game industry.It would have been nice if the Lara Croft series could continue its revelutionary approach by producing a crystal clear version of this 7 year old movie. But seeing the way how they prepared the title for HD, its apparent that the producers dont have big expectancies from this old lady.The movie is very much grainy, there are even scratches and glares. I am not impressed with the audio as well.The HD version has absolutely Zero upgrade value.There are many extras but as i dont have the DVD im not sure if they are special for this version or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't make the cut.","review":"I have played all the games (including Angel of Darkness-yuck), and I am a big fan of Tomb Raider and hottie Angelina Jolie. So when I went to the theatre I was excited. But now...First of all, this has nothing to do with any Tomb Raider storyline, and never should have anything to do with it. A clock and poor Laura's daddy? Who cares??? This is not the Laura that fans know! Although Angelina makes a good Laura, she would be way better if not based on a video game. The only good fighting scene is the mansion. The rest...sucks.I have this on VHS. I was gonna get in on DVD but...Why Bother?A good movie to...Pass time.Oh, and another good scene is...Shower Scene.When there is an unrated version released...I'll buy it.Until that day, though...screw it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing blu-ray release","review":"this is my 10th blu-ray movie, and it is one of the worst one I have seen, there is grain everywhere and colors are so saturated it made the picture look flat and plain. Definitely not for showing off your HD equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Before typing this, I'd just like to make one thing clear: I generally like action movies. I generally like Angelina Jolie. I even think the Lara Croft games are fantastic. But, nonetheless, this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life.The movie starts off well with the introduction of Lara, but once she goes off on her adventure, it becomes a completely incoherent babblefest. It's pure stupidity at it's worst and I'd avoid it like the plague. However, because there is an interestingly campy quality about the acting that allows you to relish in the sheer complexity of its badness, I will give it another half-star.Oh wait, you can't give half-stars here. I guess I'll just have to leave it at one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great action-adventure movie.","review":"Tomb Raider is based on a famous video game. Lara Croft is the famous herione in the game and movie. Lara Croft is played by (Angelina Jolie). Angelina is really great in the movie, she is a role model for all girls. Angelina Jolie looks like the Tomb Raider herself.In the movie Lara Croft is exploring lost empires, finding treasure, and punishing villians. To get The Triangle of Light. The Triangle of Light is the power to alter space and time. It is up to Lara to stop the villians who want the Triangle.Tomb Raider is an action packed movie that you must see. On the DVD, it has games, 4 deleted scenes, and a music video by U2. The music video is called \\"Elevation\\". So this movie is great and the video game also great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Effects...Lousy Story","review":"That about sums it up...I think we are seeing WAY too many of these post-Indiana Jones movies..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Excluding some rather cool special effects, the whole of this movie was DULL and BORING. The plot was confusing -- a hodgepodge of standard pseudo-mystical elements brought out of some attic trunk.Unless you're just turned on by a rather busty Angelina Jolie, I suggest you save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Would of Given it Only 2 Stars, But Agelina Jolie Is HOT!!","review":"I didn't bother to go see this movie in the theaters because I wasn't expecting it to be good and I can't pause or rewind the shower scene there either. So I rented it instead. The first scence with the robot thing turned out to be a pleasent surprise. It was a pretty cool action sequence. Same with the part when those GI guys come it trying to steal the clock. But after that the movie was really boring, I don't play the video games so I guess I should have been expecting more of an adventerous movie than an action packed movie. Oh well, at least Angelina Jolie looks awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment...","review":"Ah yes, Angelina Jolie...well, this film did not do much for me -in spite of her presence. The effects and action were okay, but the characters were paper-thin, the plot was murky (if you could call it a plot at all), and the overall of the film was uninspiring. One gets the feeling that any one of several so-called action stars could have substituted for Ms. Jolie (and I don't think much of any of them, either). Angelina does have some pretty good acting chops (\\"Girl Interrupted\\", for example), but hardly showcases them here..."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a difference between good and enjoyable...","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as it was visually appealing and had an, uh, interesting plot. I did find myself laughing at some of the more predictable scenes though. However the cheesy accents, horrible script, and a very cliched villain are just a few of the good many things wrong with this movie. All in all, I think this a really bad movie, but nonetheless enjoyable. A screenplay like this sounds good in theory, but video game-to-movie transfers take more than just a large budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right up there with attack of the killer tomatoes","review":"Geez, aren't there any negative stars I can give this movie? The train of logic through this movie is non-existent, the character development is non-existent and things blow up for no obvious reason other than that an explosion would be cool. Battle robots have armor you can peel up with your hands. She looks like Lara Croft and is very attractive in this movie, unfortunately she also has as much personality as your average video game character. I love action adventure, stupid comedies, etc. I wasn't looking for Shakespeare here, just some diversion from life for a couple of hours. However, ...you will be seriously disappointed. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Seeing again.","review":"I loved the action in this moivie. No one could make a better Tomb Raider than Angelina Jolie. I mean there was action and some funny parts in this movie. I can't wait for Tomb Raider and the Cradle of Life to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"The action scenes were okay at best but the plot is awful. Overhyped movie. Rent it at Blockbuster Video only if your friend is paying."},{"rating":"2","title":"It wasn't that bad!","review":"I avoided this movie when it was released in the cineplex last summer. I love action movies but this seemed to be just Angelina Jolie running around in spandex. A guy's movie only.I rented it out of boredom recently and I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. Angelina is very likeable as Lara Croft, an adventurous archeologist in the tradition of Indiana Jones. There isn't too much of a story line but the locations and special effects are fantastic.Angelina is also supported by a great cast! Chris Barrie is great as her caring Butler. Iain Glenn is sexy and scary at the same time. Daniel Craig is adorable as Lara's wayward boyfriend, she stops time to save. Her scenes with Jon Voight (her real life dad) are very tender.The DVD is also packed with great features and commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope The Cradle of Life is better...","review":"This movie is sad. The action is cool but farfetched, the woman is attractive, and the story is alright. But not the overall movie. For one, it is too short. The story is about an archaeologist Lora Craft (the feminine Indiana Jones) who discovers a clock that when put in a special tomb during the planetary alignment gives man the power to control time. Croft must beat any evil force to it for it could be used for destruction. She also wants to see her father again. But when she does, he tells her not to use the device anymore. YAWN! No twists, no turns, and the movie heavily lacks gore. I can't take too much blood, but this is another RoboCop 3! Rent it before buying or even better see it on HBO or SHO or whatever movie channel you have. You'll be doing yourself a favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment for Tomb Raider fans","review":"If you play tomb raider video games, then this movie will be a disappointment for you. They had Lara Croft together all the way in look, but failed to work on script and plot. This movie had the potential to be good, but didn't come out that way.It seemed like it was thrown together. Should of been longer.If you like tomb raider video games, then don't except this movie to be really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like the video game, do not watch the movie","review":"It's disappointing movie with a silly story. Most of the movie based on the 3rd series of the Tomb Raider video game, which is the worst in the Tomb Raider video game series.If you really like Tomb Raider video game, do not watch the movie because you will hate the video game and you will not play any Tomb Raider video games ever after.Well, if you still want to buy this movie rent it first and you will see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lara Croft - Tomb Raider","review":"This is one of the best movies out!!

I knew what I expected when I saw the trailer: Indiana Jones in a D-cup. Problem is, there's no real story here. The writing is horrible, and the directing is pathetic. About the only thing going for it is Angelina Jolie, who at least looks interesting. Unfortunately, nothing she did could save the movie, and I felt embarrassed for her when watching it. You might want to see this one before buying it. Don't say you weren't warned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain and simple... I did not like this movie...","review":"It captures the feel of the game... and if that right there doesn't tell you that the... thing is boring, I don't know what else to tell you... the supporting cast needs all the support they can get, and the only thing that Joile excels at is LOOKING like Lara Croft. How bout some feeling in your performance next time, lady? And when I say she LOOKS like Croft, I'm not kidding.. I heard rumors that she was \\"enhanced\\" for the role, if you know what I mean... Lack of a good plot also makes my head hurt. Paper-thin adversaries seem one-dimensional, and we learn little to nothing about her father to make us even care about that little reunion in the movie. I stopped the DVD and looked at Trigun..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"There's something odd about a transition from a video game to a movie, and whereas it is often compared to comic book characters one would assume (after seeing this movie) it is much more difficult to carry off convincingly. Angeline Jolie is sultry, sexy and certainly focuses your attention, but the plot is thin, predictable and very silly in places. In trying to add suspense to a weak script the viewer is left with a comic depiction. The movie never intends to take itself seriuosly, and shouldn't considering that upon which it is based, but what starts out with such promise, ends in a contrived mess. One for a rainy day only"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lara Croft - You Know You Liked It","review":"Everyone told me this movie was B.A.D. That there was no plot, and AJ changed clothes as often as possible.Well, they were right about her changing clothes a lot. However, this film was no worse the any Indiana Jones film, the only difference being a female lead. It was a video game to start with, emeshed in fantasy and si-fi. Why anyone was surprised by the results eludes me.First of all, AJ certainly became Lara Croft. You see it not only the extras but in the film. She is probably the only actress in Hollywood who could have carried the additude off alone, much less the physical techniques.This movie is a visual delight of special effects, Girl Power in your faces magnitism, and a blantant mix of every adventure film out there.If you don't buy it, I at least recommend you rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the last \\"Batman\\" film!","review":"Amazing! This film is worse than \\"Batman Forever\\", one of the few films that had me running from the theatre. Bad casting (the \\"super-weirdo\\" Jolie as Lara Croft?? What were they thinking?), pedestrian action sequences, a bad \\"script\\" and a large budget mixed into an unwatchable mess. Did'nt the producers of this sewage watch any \\"Indiana Jones\\" films to see how Tomb Raider should have been made; or even play the game?To quote Leonard Pinth Garnell: \\"Simply awful, could'nt have been worse..\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It's boring.","review":"The film is boring.

In many scenes, I can see clearly that the settings are fake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bouncing breasts","review":"Not a bad movie but not very good either. The accents are bad and the plot worse. If you want to see plenty of bouncing breast then you won't be disappointed. But if you expect more from a movie then watch something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lara should still take some Lessons in Humility","review":"Lighten up Lara. There is such a pile of macho manure in this film that you need a snorkel.Arrogance runs so rampant across the screen that you can't tell the good guys from the bad in this movie. I remember when heroes had a little humility. That's what gave them staying power. Look at the likeable Indiana Jones that Harrison Ford created. Even look at the characters in the MUMMY. In that film even the villain had his moment of pathos and he even got to come back in the sequel! I'll tell you, that mummy was no dummy. Lara, you are out of your league. It was great to see Richard Johnson on the big screen once again on this film's theatrical release. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Thanks Richard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average Chick Flick","review":"I've never played the Tomb Raider games so I haven't a clue of what Lara Croft is really supposed to be like except she's a chick with big guns and other features. Let's face it. Despite the somewhat simplistic and rushed plot, people love adventure movies with danger, excitement and cool stunts, especially when girls are in it.And I personally like Jolie's rendition of Croft. She's sexy yet sensual. Athletic yet Composed. Wryly coy at times, and to top it off...she's English. With the looks, lips and soft English accent, Jolie creates a very attractive Lara Croft with adventurous elegance and style...and it certainly helps that she's filthy rich. Comes in handy when supporting her expensive hobby.I thought this was an enjoyable film despite the weak plot. Definitely worth the viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful","review":"This movie was exploitive [junk]. I'm sure the DVD will continue in the tradition. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!

Check.Deep romantic entanglements and thought-provoking ideas that make you wonder \\"What really is my purpose in life? Am I everything I should be?\\" Um, no. Thank goodness.Lara Croft does pretty much what she does in the videogames, she goes on a QUEST to find a THING that has great POWER or VALUE. It works in the games and has worked in the movies for about 80 years now, so does it break new ground? Nope. It's basically \\"Indiana Jones 4\\" with Angelina Jolie as Indy. And that's perfectly fine with me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just play the game, it has a better story","review":"Sexy, trigger-happy archaeologist Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) who likes to excavate tombs in a dare-devil fashion sets on a quest to recover ancient artefacts that have the ability to control time. This is somehow linked to the end of the world...or something. Big, dumb, Indiana Jones wannabe adventure parade (based on the video game) tries to blend confusing and tedious plot with flamboyant action yet typically fails miserably. Silly and no fun at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 Stars","review":"For a long time I wanted to see this movie and two nights ago I watched it on DVD... and I was terribly disappointed!This movie lacks all elements of a movie. I see they only used Angelina Jolie to attract audience. The over use of action & CGI is very poor and insulting. The story is very shallow and weak and everything else is as bad.I thought this movie would be \\"Indiana Jones\\" of 2001. But it is not! This movie was rated for audience above 13 years old. I am afraid they made a mistake, it should be for audience less than 13 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"angelina, angelina, angelina....","review":"what were you thinking? It is becoming consistent that the winner of best supporting actress at the Oscars, comes out with a really bad movie.

Maybe you need to be a fan of the game, and totally obsessed with it or her to appreciate this movie. I thought it was really lame, and it put me to sleep in about twenty minutes.While there may be alot of great action sequences in this movie, there is no plot. Just Jolie in some sexy lingerie.Only for fans of game..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...","review":"The movie has absolutely no tie to the video game besides the title. The script is horrible, special effects are cheesy, the only thing that attracted people to watch this movie is Jolie's figure.I was really looking forward to this movie, but I ended up sleeping for about 25 minutes during the movie. There were about 2 good action scenes, and thats about it.Never the less, I'm going to buy this movie anyway, only because Jolie looks awsome is the movie, in any movie for that sake.For everyone else, I suggest to rent the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could, I'd give it 0 stars","review":"I still can't believe I waited a month in agony for it to come out!! I was hoping for an Indiana Jones type movie where you can actually learn a little about some distant culture, but with a female star. Instead, I got an incredibly stupid movie full of ridiculous action scenes and very little actual excitement. It didn't even make sense. She should have brought her father back; she was selfish enough to not destroy the first triangle while she had it. I mean, she went through all that trouble to not even finish what she started. This was such a big disappointment; I wanted to leave after the second scene. Maybe I would like it if I was a teenage guy, but it was a waste of time. Don't waste your money on this and go rent the Mummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality","review":"I had the VHS version of this movie.I liked this movie because Angelina was in her peak years at that time.But buying this bluday was a mistake somehow.The quality is really really bad. Even worse than DVD.What can I say.IT's cheap and I can live with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back To Your Tomb","review":"When I saw the previews to this movie I was not sure if I would like it or not. Anjelina Jolie is good looking yet the movie looked corny. I was right. After seeing this movie my friend and I were outside the theater making fun of Tomb Raider when a couple of people came up to us and said we were right about the movie and that it was stupid.Tomb Raider is just about Angelina Jolie finding stuff and racing some guy to get to tombs first. One scene she fights off some intruders by shooting some form of wood out of a power drill. That scene is where I decided that Tomb Raider was a horrible movie and that nobody should be in its presence. There was also a scene in which a little girl kept disappearing and reappearing in the woods. Throughout the whole movie I waited for an explanation to this scene but was not surprised when one never came. I swear the people who made this movie were too lazy to actually watch the monster they have created and that is probably why it is so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the action?","review":"I was looking forward to seeing an exciting action film, maybe with not much plot, but at least some kick [bottom] action scenes. Instead, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider graced me with nothing much more than excessive [breast] shots of Angelina Jolie's stuffed bra. The story was just not interesting, weak at best, and there was nowhere near enough action scenes to keep me hooked into this movie. Even Lara Croft's semi-romance interest was nothing much to look at. I can't believe they're making a sequel of this non movie. I would much rather play the video game. Watch the Indiana Jones movies for great action, or even more recent films like the Matrix. At least they don't disappoint. The only really good thing about this movie was the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the???","review":"I have never been so underwhelmed by a film. I'm glad I didn't fork over the cash to see it at the theater, because I'm sure I would have fallen asleep. At no point in this movie did I care one whit about Lara Croft or any other character. The \\"action\\" scenes seemed like they were in slow motion -- and not cool-effect slow motion, just not-at-all-exciting, I-can't-do-this-any-faster slow motion. I was really looking forward to Angelina Jolie as a tough action-heoine chick, but all I saw was a bunch of one-dimensional cartoon characters. Oh, and an overstuffed bra..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelina Jolie Rocks!","review":"Bringing a video game character to the big screen was seemingly a difficult task.

As long as I wasn't expecting anything Shakespearean, it might be entertaining, right?Wrong.The plot ... the plot ... the pain. In the abrupt climax, the villains, the fabled Illuminati, turn out to be chumps. And talk about abrupt! You don't realize that was actually the big finish (so to speak) until the credits roll and ... wait, that was it?Lara Croft also dispatches huge stone monsters with ridiculous ease, and bullets from her little guns.Is this review incoherent? Yes, have some. Well, that's the feeling you get after seeing this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tomb Raider digging it's own grave?","review":"I saw this movie on home DVD and I am glad to say I didn't waste 7.50 to see it in the theaters. First off it's lack of real plot is very frustrating and seems just to be an excuse for action sequences for Angelina Jolie. Many who see and enjoy this movie will be men drooling over Ms.Jolie as Lara Croft. This is somewhat of a waste of cinema. The picture quality was great and supplemental features were slightly above average. But I'm afraid for the intelligent avid film lover and moviegoer, this will be predictably disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So | Another game movie down the drain.","review":"Let me think of how to say this. If Tomb Raider was never a game but this movie was made then the movie would have been awesome and bad games would have followed. When there is a good game then bad movies follow. This is the basic plot that is followed by gaming movies. The only movie ever coming close to breaking this disatrous trend was Final Fantasy, which also was sort of a bomb. This movie is basically a Indy Jones rip off, but with a girl with a stuffed bra. The story is awful, at least the indy movies were somewhat believable this is unbelievably far-fetched with big statues coming alive and a clock that makes the planets align. All controlled by the illuminati a secret society. Whoo im getting goosebumps now! Phew yea right. If you want to see a action flick that has a hot chick ( hey that rymes) then check it out but if you are a smart person than you will avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame!","review":"I was excited to see it and even bought it, my duaghter thought it was good and, well she is 4 so there you have it! I thought Angelina looked great but the character was very dull, not mysterious. We just kept waiting for it to have some content. Some okay action scenes but no Indiana Jones quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angelina Jolie looks great but...","review":"Unfortunately, the movie does not. I didn't much care for Lara Croft. She seems to be somewhat of a rich spoiled girl who always gets her way no matter what. Like I said, Joile looks great, but her character so lifeless. You never get a sense a fear or aguish in Lara. Absolutely emotionless.Also there is really no originally in this movie. It borrows heavily from INDIANA JONES series as well as Ray Harryhausen's THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD. (Both feature a six-armed kali that comes to life).Joile is a great actress and I truly hope that she won't be making a whole series of Lara Croft movies in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, don't listen to these obsessive mouthbreathers","review":"(...)Well, I liked it. There I said it and I'll say it again. I LOVED Tomb Raider, in fact. Angelina was the perfect choice to be Lara, and although I could have done with more character development, I liked all the wacky planetary/time stuff and definitly loved the action sequences. The best part is the bungee ballet, in my opinion. And I'm definitly glad that they cast Chris Barrie (from Red Dwarf, check it out sometime... one of my fave shows) as her butler and not some flatulant old man. ^_^ Bryce was cool too, and that Adam West guy was definitly hunky. Lara would probably kick his bum though. Heh heh. Just watch it and see for yourself to find out if it's good. The only way to know for sure is to make your own opinion. Don't take my word for it, or these other (...). Just check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to be Lara!","review":"This movie had the ultimate female character.

And no blood, imagin that....well, a lil, but not enough for me to count. Jolie and her Father(voit) did a good job together. It a few funny scenes in it as well. Of course it is full running fiction...but I like a movie that i can watch for pure entertainment reasons. There is no reason to get a movie if you are going to worry about how unrealistic it was later. And of course it was unrealistic....it's scfi/fiction...it is suspose to be that way. If you would like to entertained for the purpose of being entertained...then get this movie. It is a good family movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh... it's a rental","review":"In short, it's a watchable movie, but it only gets two stars because I wouldn't buy it.As far as the movie itself, ummm... what's going on again? Triangle pieces, time-control, boulder monsters, pet robots, etc... I felt like I was watching Wild Wild West again (oh, the horror!!!)I liked Jolie's barbie-exaggerated proportions, but not necessarily the Lara Croft character. What could be mistaken for strong will and independence in \\"Lady\\" Lara Croft, I found more to be attitude smug, physically inhuman, and emotionally unreachable; except for the one large crack in her padded armor - that \\"mysterious\\" death of her father (the Father will be with you... always) Funny thing about this movie is you rarely see the lighting directly on Jolie's face - instead focus is shifted to other areas as evidenced by the cover of the box). Prepubescent teenagers should get a thrill but I'll stick with Raiders of the Lost Ark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dang that was sad","review":"This is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. I;m not sure why but the plot just never hooked me and it was waaayyyy to un-realistic. Take MI2 for exaple.

You come out of this great journey into Aaron's life with a realization that he was far better than Babe Ruth.

To gain knowledge of his life in an entertaining way has been a light in my otherwise dark and dreary life. Also, I found the fact that there are other records which The Hammer set that he is more proud of interesting. As my personal compliment to Hank Aaron I won't mention the record or the man who some people can't resist mentioning when speaking of Hank Aaron. Hank Aaron would be a great man without the record, just not one who we remember. Afterall the record didn't make the man, the man made the record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Read If You Are A Fan","review":"I Had a Hammer is a wonderful book if you are a fan of Hank Aaron or of baseball in general. Aaron gives insights into what it was like to come out of Alabama during the Jim Crow era from his days as a boy, to playing in the Negro Leagues, signing with the Braves, all the way up until his retirement from baseball.That's the good part. As a life-long, Aaron fan I loved it. Unfortunately, the book lacks much of the passion and drive that led Aaron to breaking Ruth's unbreakable career home run record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy unless you understand Chinese","review":"I rented this video from Amazon.

The packaging is really nice but lets talk about the music.After \\"Shadows On The Sun\\", one might deem it \\"impossible\\" for Ali to come back with anything as strong/critically acclaimed.... Well then prepare for the \\"impossible\\". As Ali spits about variety of issues [his divorce, his family, being broke and homeless, the war, his race, social issues, etc] and of course the battle raps Ali fans have grown to love,you will notice that there isn't one weak/mediocre song on the album. It also doesn't hurt that the beats are being supplied by Ant of Atmosphere.Considering the current saturation of mainstream hip hop with the usual(Money, Women, Cars, Rims, Guns, Diamonds...) and songs with nice beats, catchy hooks and of course a dance (sometimes a guilty pleasure of mine), \\"The Undisputed Truth\\" is definitely a breath of fresh air...GO COP THAT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really feelin it.","review":"Brother Ali is a good lyricist. If you reminise back to Scribble Jam, it shows him battling pretty well. But him as an MC droppin an album, it doesn't fit him. I guess everybody has their own perspective taste in hip hop. He brings up good concepts but his rhythm attraction really lacks. His beats is just terrible. You don't have to have a phat beat to have a good song but I don't think anybody would sound good spitting to these beats. If you're that type looking for the deep ill rhythm blending in real soul instrumentals, this album is not for you. Rhymesayers is full of talented emcees but this one im not feeling.

The reader is recommended to consult Trefil and Morowitz's work to see how Aristotlean anti-abortion arguments collapse before an elaborated scientific framework."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kreeft v Science","review":"Kreeft's so-called socratic argument does not find it neccessary to include scientfic propositional content in his work on abortion, yet surely it is science that proves that anti-abortionists have no factual basis for their claims that the embryo or foetus is an autonomous organism. A shallow display of Aristotlean a priori reasoning, debatable essences not based on scientific fact, and an argument that doesn't work in real life. Hypatia, break Socrates out of there!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Unmartyred Hypatia Replies...","review":"Kreeft's book is responsible for a second-generation neo-Aristotlean piece entitled Politically Correct Death, but his own book lacks any empirical or scientific referents to prove his points.That is where his book falls down,as Aristotlean philosophy was never dependent on rigorous scientific evidence to begin with, and replete with a priori assumptions that led to its abandonment after the Renaissance. I agree with other pro-choice reviewers who argue that Kreeft's book is not a proper socratic dialogue, but a repetitious monocausal set of Aristotlean syllogisms. I think feminists should write our rebuttal of this book and use our own classical philosopher of note, Hypatia, to counter its flawed arguments. Would the next anti-abortion reviewer please respond through epistemology, and not through personal invective, thank you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Zealanders Aren't the Only Ones Who Have Problems Here","review":"The previous reviewer argued that the book in question caused people to re-evaluate their views on abortion. According to the New Zealand reviewers,the book in question screens out womens bodies and narratives about the consequences of abortion for them and their own self-interest. I thought socratic dialogue involved critical assessment of both sides of an epistemological case? This book does not do that. I also find it fascinating that the book deals with a dialogue between two men on this issue, but I suppose that is the anti-abortion argument for you- abstract deontological axioms that have no reference to women's lives or empirical scientific facts about abortion. Hypatia and her other friend are right- feminists need to author our own rebuttal to this and argue our own consequentialist ethics of abortion"},{"rating":"2","title":"A PERFECT ARGUMENT","review":"Peter Kreeft shows takes just about every argument for abortion and completely refutes it perfectly. A must read for people on both sides. Some people said he lacked scientific info. He's a philosopher, not a scientist and scientific info shows TONS of risks for women's bodies when they have abortions: ectopic pregnancies, breast cancer, infertility, depression, etc. etc. I should know because my sister's life was saved by giving birth to her son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read, even if you disagree with the conclusions","review":"Despite the New Zealand trashing of this book, I found it very worthwhile. As a previous review pointed out, if nothing else, the book makes one examine his or her life and beliefs about abortion.I love the book and the dialogue was very intreging. I felt the author had a good handle on how Socrates operates.

The book is pretty farfetched (Abraham Lincoln ends up in the African desert?, they just happen to come upon a vanished flyer's plane?), but I liked it much more than the video. I can see why the author would be upset with the film. Too much Penelope Cruise (her character's hardly in the book and ends up in a wheelchair in the end - not in a bikini on the beach) and where the heck did she get a different outfit for every scene out of a small carry on bag? The villians aren't too villanous, the whole section about the old fort is missing, and there was no gold left on the ship (carted out by tribesmen after all the original shipmates died - a much more believeable premise). I guess it makes an OK straight to video release, but if you're looking for the book on film, this sure isn't it.

We all love the mindless excitement of films such as Armageddon, Top Gun, Gone in 60 Seconds and other high concept, high camp action adventures. Films that give us nothing but explosions, tension, the occasional laugh, all wrapped up in a neat package after 100 minutes.This film does not achieve any of that.If people think that this film (set a good couple of hundred kilometres away from the Sahara?) is the dawning of a new Indiana Jones then they are sorely mistaken. It's not escapism, it's not fun, it's just dull, totally far fetched and unfortunately, not funny or witty in any way.I'd have to classify this film by saying it's two hours of my life that I'll never get back, and for that I am truly regretful."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"The sidekick whats-his-name is pretty funny, but the movie just sucks. If you have to even ask about the story, it's the same movie with a different name.

(Don't even ask how this could happen!) He borrows his boss's boat and aided by his faithful sidekick (played perfectly by Steve Zahn) he sets out on his search. Coincidentally he crosses paths with a beautiful doctor from the World Health Organization (Penelope Cruz) and soon her quest to find the source of a mysterious disease combines with his search for the boat. This movie is totally predictable, but it is slick and quite entertaining.

This movie doesn't mess around with heavy drama or annoying romance. The romance was the part I was most worried about and I was happily suprised to find that they didn't hate each other, that the female didn't have to dominate the male, and that they didn't have to try to hide their emotions or make a lip-lock in every scene(in fact there's only one). Steve Z ws perfect - great lines and facial expressions. Sure, alot is improbable, but in this movie its not so tedious. I highly recomend this movie - and hey!

I was hoping to have fun watching this film, and did for a little bit, but it turned into a barf fest with a poor plot. The hidden messages from hollywood is beating a dead horse and very predictible. Corporations are evil and will poison the environment. No one cares about Africa. Bush sucks. America sucks. It is not worth fighting for your country. Give your money to the poor.

It's not a classic and it won't win any awards but it will entertain you. Dirk Pitt and his pal Al Giordano are treasure hunters looking for an ironclad ship from the American Civil War that may have somehow ended up in Africa. Penelope Cruz plays a doctor from the WHO investigating a new illness spreading from an African country. They cross paths and together find the source of the disease and eventually find the Civil War ship.

I thought it would be like an advanced version of National Treasure (which I loved).The truth is folks, it is dull, degrated, and just boring.The main plot is that 2 guys are looking for a treasure lost in the civil war.At many times the movie gets slow and you already know what will happen next.Another thing is: I'm sure all third world country rersidents speak fluent English.If you want a better movie that you won't be dissapointed about, rent XXX: State Of The Union or National Treasure.Last Word:Not as good as it looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halarious and good for whole family.","review":"Background: After 90-95% of movies I watch, my comment is, \\"that's an hour and half of my life I will never have back.\\" Not with this movie. It is one of the best we have watched and has some of the most halarious and creative moments. They are not cookie cutter one liners like so many movies now. I have to admit some of the plot is pretty ridiculous but is an adventure that is fun and the whole family can watch. It is my kids (girls 10 and 7) favorite movie as well. Every trip we take, they want it in the car. I am suprised we have not worn it out and will buy it again if we do. Definitely worth watching at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enough","review":"Sahara is great fun, with lots of historical aspects added in to the present day adventure. I found a few problems compared to Cussler's book, but that is okay. Overall the character of Dirk Pitt being played by Matthew McConaughey to be pretty spot on. Zahn as Al Giordino was not cast well, however, as he looks nothing like Cussler's character from the several books Al has been in. Besides that, the story is great and the \\"thrill of the chase\\" is always done right. The scenes in the desert were fun and remind you of Indiana Jones movies perhaps. I have learned that many more of Cussler's adventures will be made into films so I look forward to seeing Dirk Pitt in lights soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous movie!","review":"Where are all these bad reviews coming from?? Sahara is better than the Indiana Jones adventures...better filmed, more plausible (but REALLY, when was storyline plausibility necessary to enjoy a movie), better directed, etc. The chemistry was great between Matthew McConaughy and his sidekick, Steve Zahn, as ex-military divers for treasure. Just a pleasure to watch again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed out on what gave the book three stars.","review":"Finding lost relics & gold, saving the world from destruction, mysterious history, remote settings, non-stop action. This movie had the fun glitz of the novel, but lacked in much of what made the book a more intelligent read. Not that Cussler's books are provocative for my mental neurons, I read them when I am in the mood for surrealistic action typical to James Bond. However, this movie went over the top, to the point of being preposterous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and action packed","review":"I enjoyed this movie, even though it was a VERY loose adaptation of Clive Cussler's book (by the way, Sahara is one of my favorites of Cussler's books, although most of his books are great!) However, that said, the movie was fun with lots of action, and humor. It's not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but then, what is? Definitely worth watching, and if you're into this type of movie, worth owning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT follow the book","review":"If I were not a Dirk Pitt/Clive Cussler fan, I might have thought otherwise, but this movie does not portray the characters as they are in the Dirk Pitt novels. A great deal of the book has been eliminated entirely, and what has been left has been altered to the point that it might as well have been left out. The only things the book and movie have in common are the name and the names of the characters. It's an adequate adventure-type movie if that's all you are looking for, but for fans of Dirk Pitt, prepare to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A funny entertainment for kids!","review":"This is a typical movie of easy evasion; it deals with a ingenious script that pitifully was wasted, due its actual relevance. The well known of stunts and special effects weighed much more than any other circumstance.What it could have been a full and rounded off movie with major dimensions, a serious ecologic warning, simply vanished packaged by a sand torment.But, if you overlook that premise and let your neurones rest, you will obtain a gratifying pop corn movie than will be forgotten very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is going on here...","review":"The action was good in this movie, but everything else was crap.The plot isn't anything special. They go to Africa for some coins and they end up having to stop a virus from destroying everything. It's really not that original.The characters are weak. Steve Zahn does a good job, but his antics have grown old. Matthew Mccounaghey(does anyone know how to spell this?) is cool. Penelope Cruz deserves an academy award. Just kidding, she sucked.As for anything I didn't mention, assume it was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"After Reading the Book.......Trash","review":"I am a fairly big fan of Clive Cussler, the author of Sahara, and have really enjoyed his novels. Sahara was one of my favorites, so I eagerly anticipated this movie. Within the first 15 minutes, I had to turn the movie off. It's absolute trash. The characters (Dirk Pitt, Al Giordino, and Admiral Sandecker) are EXTREMELY poorly cast, which is my primary gripe. The casting is so poor as to be the equivalent of casting David Spade as Rocky, or the Rock as Michael Corleone in the Godfather. Nothing against the actors themselves, but they simply do not fit the roles. It's as if the director never read the book, and had only heard the plot through word of mouth. I beg you to read the novel, which is more of an adventure than this movie could ever dream of being."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only.....","review":"Had the movie been as exciting and tension filled as the attack on and the disappearance of the CSA's ironclad Texas this film would have been great. Matthew M, a graduate of the Keanu Reeves school of acting, really is quite poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been left in the Sahara","review":"Well, this won't take very long. Warning! Spoiler here!Leading characters find themselves in a deadly, hopeless situation. Characters find some ludicrously unbelievable way out of said deadly, hopeless situation. One character makes a stupid joke, gives the others the high five and then Magic Carpet Ride starts playing. Repeat 10 times, and there you have Sahara. Wacky fun...if you play Little League and had less than 13 candles on your last birthday cake.Really, I usually put a lot of time in my reviews, but this one doesn't even deserve that. Dumbest movie I've seen in quite some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"Don't mistake this film \\"Sahara\\" with the excellent 1943 film starring Humphrey Bogart. Instead, this is a pathetic waste of money in a film that has poor acting, and a ridiculous script. It stars Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz, two actors that have yet to produce any memorable performances, in a failed attempt to reach the \\"Indiana Jones\\" franchise fans. Of course everyone's reaction to films is a personal issue, but it can be noted that the film received no major awards or even nominations for awards in a year (2005) that didn't exactly produce an outstanding list of films. Bottom line - give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak plot, weak ending","review":"Warning, this contains somewhat of a spoilerYou have 2 big stars and one up and comer, and enough money to do just about anything with the movie within reason.So why then, end the friggen movie with a lame fight scene and a predictable defusing of a bomb?A typical script is 110 pages long. I would imagine the script for Sahara went something like thispages 1-80 build up of something good to come80-110 insert cheesy fight scene and defusing of a bomb here.If it was a Jackie chan movie, ok, end the movie with a big fight scene, but last I checked Matthew Mcconaughey is not known for his martial arts (and with good reason).WRITE AN ACTUAL ENDING"},{"rating":"1","title":"did they read any of the books before picking the cast??","review":"I've only made it through about 20 minutes so far, but my disappointment in the casting of Al Giordino will sour the rest of the movie. The actor they cast as 'Al' couldn't be much further from the character in the novels. He's a swarthy, swashbuckler who has an eye and a way with the ladies. Steve Zahn does not fit the profile at all..........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sahara","review":"I found this Dvd to be excellent. Received in good time and in excellent condition.

When I heard the book was being made into a movie, I was excited. Who wouldn't, Dirk Pitt on the silver screen a second time in a better vehicle. I am a Cliver Cussler fan and I was severely disappointed. Dirk obsessed with a Civil War Ironclad? Rudy portrayed as a bumbling stooge? No Abraham Lincoln or mention of Kitty Mannock, who's plane Dirk and Al make into a sail racer? It's like Raise the Titanic, half the book, missing the other half. And to the producers, Dirk was a Major in the US Air Force before Sandecker recruited him for NUMA, not the US Navy, get it right. Now I really don't blame Cussler if he decides not to have any more of his books turned into movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sahara","review":"Explorer Dirk Pitt, a modernday Indiana Jones, joins a U.N. science expedition in the Sahara to search for a toxin that is killing marine life.

After renting it I liked it enough to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just for fun","review":"This movie is what it is: an A- or B+ movie that is a load of fun! It's not meant to be serious. We don't watch these movies to be historiclly correct! We watch them because they are fun, action adventure movies that take us away from our day-to-day grinds, to a wishful-thinking, daydreaming 2-hours of a kick-back moment in our hectic lives. It's a Grand Adventure! A great flick with a bowl of popcorn and some great eye-candy for those who like Matt and Penelope! Perfect for a Saturday afternoon movie!Ciao! Make life grand adventures!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly Entertaining but Silly...the Book is Better!","review":"Hollywood moguls should be required to actually READ the books they turn into movies. This is not a bad interpretation of \\"Sahara\\" but it could be so much BETTER. Dirk Pitt, Clive Cussler's sophisticated, clear-thinking hero..sweaty, grubby and smelly looking with a Texas twang?? Pahleeze!! Loyal, sturdy, reliable Al Giordino reduced to being a goofy sidekick?? No, No, No! And Rudi Gunn, a brilliant scientist and 2nd in command at NUMA as - what? - a college sophomore on spring break?? Just when fans think it couldn't get worse..Admiral James Sandecker, a man of power and authority, turned into a somewhat befuddled mid-management type!! EGADS!! The travesty of it all!! I implore people with intelligence and imagination to read the book. It's WAY better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for teenage boys.","review":"I, along with my 13 and 15 year old boys, enjoyed this action movie that moved quick. The characters covered a lot of ground and the plot educated while providing intrigue and excitement. The sound might scare away some with all the shooting and explosions."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need a good nap go see this movie","review":"I thought it looked like a bunch of men running around in circles trying to look like they were acting and trying to make a movie. But then don't rely on me cuz I fell asleep during the first third of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely entertaining...","review":"...as the story (however stupid) drags on (into nowhere). Ah, I wanted to like this movie, I didn't expect it to be in the league of Indiana Jones, but at least somewhere near National Treasure. But no. While watching I almost forgot about the entire ship, the advertising of Sahara says \\"The hunt for the gold begins here\\" and \\"The search for the mysterious ship\\" blablabla, but the filmmakers were too hung up in the action and special effects (yeah, so what's new right?) -I love adventure movies, they don't even have to be realistic, it's all about fun and exitment. Sahara is a failure, lacks charm and story, and will soon be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adaquate, derivative, action movie.","review":"As a long-time fan I was pleased by this adaptation, sure there were parts that upset me, but all-in-all I thought it was pretty good. I hope that true fans of the series will get behind the release of the DVD so that hopefully a franchise can be started. Hopefully the producers may ask fans for some input next time. Overall, a relatively bloodless action film suitable for families who liked National Treasure, Raiders, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere between craptacular and fartastic","review":"First let me say how happy I am that the widescreen edition has finally arrived. I've never actually seen a visual turd stretched to such dimensions. I saw this as an in flight movie and I almost walked out. If you are presented with the same choice I was, forego the headphones and opt for the parachute. If you actually saw this movie and found a shred of believability in Penelope Cruz playing a Dr. for the World Health Organization than I'd like to introduce you to my Albino cousin Faye who enjoys books on tape, regurgitating food, and long walks on the beach (albeit under a tarp).

Heck, the dvd even says a mix of Indiana Jones and James Bond. Yeah, right! This wasn't anywhere near Indiana Jones. It seemed to me that the treasure-hunting was just a backdrop for the rest of the events in the movie.The cast was great but the characters were too weak. They had some cheezy lines. I thought the script was pretty bad. In the end, it seemed to me that the bad guy had a good idea to start with, that just went wrong. Given time, he would have fixed it.I had high hopes for this movie and was sorely disappointed. It's a good action movie that you can watch to pass the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENTERTAINMENT - ENTERTAINMENT - WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT","review":"Seeing as how I have never read Clive Cussler - I will admit that I enjoyed Sahara. It is great entertainment.I got a better understanding of the movie after watching the commentaries and makings thereof.I enjoyed the humor - the action - and the gorgeous color - so who is Dirk? I didn't find too much wrong with him. The voyage of the Ironclad was a bit far fetched but enjoyable as a hunt - I surely would like to have seen some of that gold.And no book ever gets translated perfectly into a movie. Ah, well, we live to be entertained.Enjoy it for what it is worth - It was a lot better than some of the far-fetched trash that the movie makers offer us.Definitely recommended -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining, but ultimately lacking","review":"The upside is that the movie has an interesting plot and non-stereotypical events & action scenes. It keeps you interested as the plot about the coins, ironclad and plague unfolds and you begin to put it together. However, the movie lacked character chemistry - it's supposed to be a \\"buddy\\" movie with the main characters friends since kindergarten. But the way they interact is more like annoyed co-workers. Of course there's also the romance angle, but that lacked chemistry too. Normally you look for the hero & girl to shack up by the end because you feel they're made for each other (or at least would be a nice couple), but in this movie I just didn't care. The ending was pretty unsatisfying as well - one expects that everything eventually gets artfully tied together to make sense to the viewer, but instead it is hastily slapped together. In the end, it's not a horrible movie and does have some redeeming qualities, but is lacking in several ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howse 5 ft. mower","review":"This mower cuts well and does not scalp the ground excessively. It seems to work well as long as there are no rocks or debri that the blades will strike. The blades are heavy and well built with a dish mount and has a tapered splined hub to the gearbox. This hub has a tendency to become loose and the mower needs to be overturned to check it.The weakest part of the mower is the sheet-metal. The welds at the rear corners are weak and appear to be faulty weld joints as the joints separate without the metal breaking.Overall, it is a fair mower for medium use, but is not suited for heavy, long-term mowing. It will not withstand rocks, etc. as the side metal plates are too thin and the welds are not strong enough for commercial use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, But Guitar Mix a Little Meek!","review":"I am a big fan of Dio Sabbath, so I am very familiar with the few releases they did. Dio still has the magic in this performance! (RIP) The song selection is good and Appice on the drums is still solid.

This book is difficult at best. It's definitely scientific in it's language which at times is hard to follow but the author also creates many abbreviations for terms that make reading it without having to look back virtually impossible. The second thing I find extremely inappropriate is the author's advocacy of leash jerks, shock collars and ear pinches. There is plenty of new research out there that offers ways to train your dog without doing irreparable damage to your relationship or exercising animal abuse as a sound way to exhibit control. Patricia McConnell, Stanley Coren and Turid Rugaas offer but better advice and write in a way that us mere mortals can understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not plain english","review":"This book bogs one down in the words and explanations.

It is certainly not in plain English, focused way too much on theories and makes it not very approachable. I was hoping to find practical solutions, not some professor talk.

At first, you think you're reading a typical S.E. Hinton novel...troubled young man, rough childhood, etc.. Then suddenly, you're reading a ridiculous VAMPIRE story! Yes, you heard me - VAMPIRE. The craziest thing about this book is that the vampire actually gets \\"cured\\" - of course, the author never lets the reader in on how this amazing little feat occurs - but, suddenly the man that has been tortured by the vampire is now all buddy-buddy with him. Again, a very bizarre book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised but not in a good way","review":"I was so swept into the story, and the first hundred pages were fantastic. The character of Jaime Sommers is wonderful but as soon as I realized the Vampire thing was inteded to be \\"real\\" and not in Jaime's mind, I lost faith. I guess I was hoping for a \\"serious\\" adult book but this rapidly turned into a farce. The writing was excellent throughout, but in the end I wound up thinking it was still a book for a younger, less sophisticated reader. Could not recommend except as a novelty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Hawkes Harbor was an uninspiring, bland, boring read with characters that did not connect nor inspire sympathy, empathy, or any other response. I thought the premise of the book sounded promising; however, I finished the book feeling empty and cheated for spending the time and effort to read this drivel. It was interesting to read many of the other reviews, especially the information that this was a Dark Shadows tie-in, or was meant to be. I have never watched that show, so maybe this book could have been a little better had I been familiar with Dark Shadows.I cannot in good faith recommend this awful novel to anyone. I know that Ms. Hinton is rather popular. This was my first go at one of her books, so I will not base my overall impression/opinion of her writing style until I have tried one of her other works. As for Hawkes Harbor, I want my time invested back."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"It's hard to believe that this book was published. I suggest that future books by Hinton have a collaborator or ghost writer assigned. This story is unbelievable and I don't mean as a fantasy; so awful that I'm embarrassed for the author. The characters are less than one dimensional; I found it impossible to care about anyone in this story.Quite unlike the Outsiders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst vampire novel ever","review":"I don't claim to have read every vampire novel ever written, but I'd definitely like to nominate this one for the award. What starts out as an entertaining tale of bad boy Jamie Sommers quickly degenerates into an abyss of disjointed attempts at a plot.

Hinton fan when I was in my pre-teens, I was excited to find this adult book written by her. However, I was greatly disappointed that the language was very strong and honestly made me, as an adult, uncomfortable. I really hope Amazon will remove this book from being listed under any category for teens or children, as the language is not appropriate for this age group. The words used in the book would make a movie rated R. Just a warning to parents out there, and any adults who do not appreciate foul language in novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nearly As Good As Her Other Books","review":"When you think of S.E. Hinton, the Outsiders comes to mind. That was a wonderfully written book, with strong characters who you grew to love by the end of the story. I did not feel this with Hawkes Harbor. I didn't really like the characters and by the end of the book, I was thoroughly bored. I didn't want vampires out of an S.E. Hinton book. Though I knew I had to read it because she had written it, I was a little worried that I wouldn't like it and I was right. So, if you're looking for a S.E. Hinton book to read, pick up either The Outsiders or That Was Then, This is Now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh??","review":"The first third of the novel captured my attention, a compelling story about a mental hospital patient.

Hinton couldn't make up her mind about what kind of story to tell, so she combined a number of genres and create literary crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a really stupid book.","review":"I too, loved S.E.Hinton's books as a kid, so I thought I was in for a treat when I picked this book up. I was shocked that is was not very good, the characters were half there, the plot had many holes in it, and the ending was beyond trite. I can't believe I actually finished it, after finding out it was about a vampire, I found it ridiculous that this was the so called horrifying secret.Maybe S.E. Hinton needed the cash. There could be no other reason that she would put forth such a pathetic story line and call it a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This book is bad-too bad to detail all the ways it is bad. I picked it up, I imagine, for the same reason most other did, because S.E. Hinton rocked our teenage worlds with her early novels. I wish I had left it alone. Like Barry from High Fidelity wonders, \\"Is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter day sins . . . ?\\" In this case, the answer is a loud yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best By Far","review":"I have grown up reading S.E Hinton and this book is by far the best she has written. I love that it seems to be a book for adults, rather than for adolescents. The main character is real and I was quite surprised by the turn of events in the cave. I didn't see that coming. The ending was a surprise as well, and I am not one who is surprised by much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to a new book from S.E. Hinton, until I read part of the book. I could not believe all the profanity and explict sexual content in Hawkes Harbor. The story line was additonaly weak and unrealistic. I wish I had never purchased the book. I love her other books and used them in a classroom setting for reading remediation and the students never had to be be reminded to read. Hawkes Harbor has tainted my feelings for the author and her works. I will think twice before recommending her books for fear the student would do as I and think Hawkes Harbor was of the same caliber as her earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan Fiction","review":"I initially bought this book b/c I was excited that a Dark Shadows fan fiction had actually been published in mainstream. The onlyreason why I liked it in the slightest was b/c this story contains a favorite character of mine: Willie Loomis. Oops. I mean \\"Jamie Sommers\\". *wink* :p I think this was very poorly written and very anti-climactic. Just when I found a certain part exciting, she revealed it's outcome before reaching the ending. That alone was like watching a movie with someone who leans over and tells you what happens at the end when you're right smack in the middle of that movie. I would NOT recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time on this book.","review":"I read this book as part of a reading group of which I am a member. Base on the preson who picked this book, I was looking forward to an enjoyable read. However, this was a very very disappointing book. Simply put the story line is silly and a waste of time. It appears to be the author's goal to have the story broken into three parts but there is no flow and very little connection between the parts of the story. For example, the last 30 pages do not connect with the rest of the story at all and looks like an ending that one sees when the author does not know how to end a book. Also, there graps in the story line. Such as, what does the Vampire do to address the curse? It seems to get better but how? The bottomline is that if you want a story on a Vampire, go rent a video of Dark Shadows."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wit & Wisdom of Archie Bunker on Political Issues","review":"Archie Bunker's take on politics is front and center in this trio of episodes from \\"All in the Family.\\" In \\"Archie and the Editorial\\" (Episode #38 September 16, 1972), Archie is incensed by a local station's position on gun control and tapes a rebuttal editorial of his own. Archie clashes with Mike in \\"Writing the President\\" (#2 January 19, 1971), when he refuses to let a Commie Pinko letter attacking the Vietnam War be sent from his house. Finally, in \\"Man in the Street\\" (#24 December 4, 1971), Archie's views on the world are again going to be aired for the enlightenment of his fellow citizens, but his beloved television set is not working. As always, the performances by the late Carroll O'Connor show us why Archie Bunker was one of the greatest characters in television history. His gun control editorial alone is worth the price of this tape. The episodes remind us why \\"All in the Family\\" was one of the most influential shows as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also my first science book, highly recommended.","review":"Like another reviewer, I recently found this on my shelf and was curious to see whether it was in print. I'm 22 now and must've been around 8 when I got it.I'm in University now, studying software engineering, and I have to say that this book really spurred my interest in science. It comes with so many cool things, a magnet, agar, diffraction grating, and a fresnel lens.Highly recommend this to parents, aunts, and uncles looking for an awesome gift for a youngster in the family.

It is not nearly as bright as the 4 watt standard ones you buy. We wanted them for use throughout the house but did not want them to be very bright. These are perfect for our use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright, durable","review":"These night lights have 2 main features:- LED lights are sufficiently bright while consuming very little energy.- Photo-sensitive switch turns them off during the day or even when you turn on the 'big' lights at night, ensuring that they are not annoying.I've had one of these for about 2 years now as a freebie from my company's Earth Day giveaway and I've been pleased enough with it to order one extra pair recently.Regarding durability. The brand-new lights appear to be about 30% brighter than the 2 year old one and the old one is still bright enough. That would lead me to conclude that a lifespan of 'several years' should be expected, unless you are receiving a defective unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to see Shirley MacLaine again","review":"I watched this film online and, since it appeared to be a low-budget film, I didn't expect very much, but as soon as Shirley MacLaine appeared, the power of the film became much more intense. Seeing her in this role reminded me of how moving she is on screen. I didn't realize until the credits came up that the film had been directed by Richard Attenborough. Shirley MacLaine makes this film worth watching. Christopher Plummer has an emotional scene that surprised me. And Martin McCann's performance was exceptional. I never expected to enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good At All, Despite The Impressive Pedigree","review":"I'd never heard of this film, but given the impressive cast and crew involved (Richard Attenborough, for Pete's sake? Speaking of Petes, Pete Postelwaithe is here, too!), I thought it might be worth a go. And while the cast and crew do a serviceable job for the most part (ranging anywhere from great to poor), it's the script that really kills this one. More specifically, the dialogue. There is a good story somewhere in here (maybe a great story), but the words actually spoken are quite often so trite, cliched and cornball that not even such magnificent actors as Christopher Plummer and Shirley MacLaine can overcome it. Sounds harsh, I know, but it really is that bad, particularly during the wartime flashbacks, which are painfully cheesy. I only sat through the movie to see how it wrapped up and how all the connections worked and everything, but even the ending is underwhelming."},{"rating":"2","title":"A love so strong","review":"Great love story.

The flashback scenes explaining that his girlfriend was murdered by thugs was too disjointed with 5 30 second flashbacks. One would have been much better. HOWEVER! Not only is it a British film, amd all that implys, but the back ground music is SO LOUD that for 90% of the video you can't hear anything that was said. My copy might have had a bad subtitle track, but less than 5% of the time there was no subtitles to help you figure out what was said and happening. Do not even rent this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor delivery condition, printing irregularities","review":"I read alot of period fiction Robert Howard being among my favourites. I was waiting some small time for this second volume in the series.I could've saved my money! 1. The two copies I ordered (in hardcover) were in awfull shape and 2. One of the two copies had an additional signature of blank paper half way through the book. A very amateurish package for a series giving it self such great airs as this one is.

Initially, I was pleased to see Valentine addressing tougher questions about God, faith and suffering; but as the novel progressed it seemed as though every distressful situation was miraculously remedied by the presence of an angel or the rosary at the center of the story. While I realize that this was part of the plot device--people being inadvertently touched by holiness which then passes by--it nonetheless completely voided any realism in the novel whatsoever. And I, too, was troubled by \\"Rent-A-Nun\\": it conjured up the notion of indulgences and seemed to invoke the very worst stereoptypes about Catholicism. In terms of stylistic merit, I continue to prefer the Mitford novels, which are so artfully put together while deceptively seeming simple and which address difficult issues of faith in a subtle yet revealing fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable","review":"I never like when they can't get the original voice actors back, and Patrick Dempsey was lukewarm, at best. The relationship with Koda was whiny, and the love story, while sweet, was completely predictable, even for our 4 year old. All-in-all, just kind of pathetic. If you do purchase or rent this, you might as well have some fun with it, and pick out all the blantant rips-off of other Disney films. Spot Pocahontas! Mulan! Beauty and the Beast! Tarzan! and many, many more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"My kids and I really enjoyed seeing the 2nd movie. We thought it was really well done. A great story and love the songs.

This one is very cheesy. I think it was made just to make money. I hate those kind of movies - sequels and prequels made just for the money, no love put into it. And the voice actor for \\"brother bear\\" is different - I like the one from the first movie better. And the story is also cheesy - the first movie, in a way, brings a few tears to your eyes. Gosh, the first movie was sad, but it was cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother Bear 2 DVD","review":"My 2 and 3 year old daughters enjoyed this sequel 10 times more than the first brother bear, perhaps because the main character is female, Nita.

It's well executed.The music was catchy, but featured the same four-chord progressions. The songs seemed the same to me. Also, there is also the problem that I felt the first movie had: the songs are sung in third person (someone offscreen is singing them and they have no impact on the plot of the movie). I wish that there would be at least one song that the characters sing, but this is not the case.Overall, a very cute movie that stands out from the monotony of the earlier Disney sequels. Perhaps Disney is maturing as it ventures more into the world of making sequels (something that Walt Disney himself vowed would never happen)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"We bought this for our four year old grandson.

I'm always curious about sequel movies, because you never know if they're going to disappoint (most of them do) or if they'll live up to the original. This movie definitely lives up to the original. It's fun, entertaining, and is moving. Melissa Etheridge's tracks for this movie are really nice too. The theme of this movie is love, sacrifice and friendship.

Although, the girl's aim is to solve the girls murder, her actions honestly don't reflect it. Without a purpose, the book winds up being a summary about basically nothing. The slow pace is mainly due to the excessive descriptions.This book also seemed quite unfinished, with lots of lose ends still lingering in my mind. By the end of the novel, Martha Grimes, seemed to have created more mysteries than she had solved.Although, this book was enjoyable at first, at the end, I was so bored, confused, and frustrated, that I ended up disliking it.

I have long been a fan of Martha Grimes and her Richard Jury series and this is the first book of hers that I have read that does not center around that British crime solver. One of the things that I loved about it was its' humor and I have not seen another reviewer refer to that. I found myself smiling at the 12 year old's train of thought. Not all of the characters are fully developed, but that may be left to other books that are concerned with this distinctly American location by Martha Grimes.

I found this a film in which I was waiting for a truly original 'gotcha' moment but it never comes. Instead it plays out like one of those demonic-horror films in which a possessed child--the anti-Christ--is born to an innocent woman. I'm truly perplexed. Surely all the truly interesting possibilities of a 'conquest from outer space' haven't been played out. Why can't the writers figure out some new truly interesting twists?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommend this to your friends if you wanna be mean!","review":"I know of someone who told his friends to go see this \\"really, really good movie called Astronaut's Wife\\".

It was very apparent from the movie's trailer that the story most likely involves the old \\"alien living inside a person's body\\" theme, and such was indeed the case. The problem is that the story failed to come up with a new \\"twist\\" to this subject to make it even remotely interesting.If the message still isn't clear at this point, then maybe this will help : AVOID BUYING THIS PATHETIC DVD AT ALL COSTS !

Poor character development, no science, and the ending leaves you with not knowing what the point of the movie was. Your time is better spent elsewhere. Not even worth a dollar rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-thought of plot, but acting makes it terrible.","review":"What in the world is wrong with Hollywood these days? If this is what filmmaking is coming to, I'm afraid of what the future holds. There is nothing good to say about The Astronaut's Wife, except that it succeeds in flopping majorly due to the emotionless acting and flat dialogue. Johnny Depp with a southern accent? Please. Another aspect to look at is the absence of chemistry between Depp and Charlize Theron. Not only do their words have no meaning, but they sound forced and consigned. There is not one scene in this movie that will convince you that these two people are truly happily married. The emotional meaning in this film is about as astounding as Johnny Depp's southern drawl. Don't get me wrong: this movie could've been a brilliant cinema had the acting not totally sabotaged it to nothing. The DVD is a winner, though, if you want to waste time and money on this flopper."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a Depp fan...","review":"If you enjoy Johnny Depp, this is a must see as he seems to carry the movie. Theron handled the emotional scenes well, but as a whole, it needed character depth and a coherent plot. The reason I gave it 2 stars as there is no violence, limited use of profanity, and only one embarrassing sex scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every bit as exciting as its title...","review":"Rarely have I seen so many relentlessy arty shots in support of so little story. Ashamed to be reprising the cruddy little 50's sci-fi flick \\"I Married a Monster from Outer Space\\", the director apparently decided to remake \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" instead -- but he succeeds only in proving what a thin line there is between the sinister and the absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"This movie was the poorest excuse for a film I'd seen in a long time. It's poor plot and plot development managed to almost put me asleep. In the midst of such great films as The Matrix and The Sixth Sense its sad that a production studio would even let this title be released. This movie is a great choice if you need something to lure you into a trance and then make you fall asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets","review":"This movie has it all: bad writing, poor acting and cheap production. I watched, because Johnny Depp has usually been in good movies. This was a mistake for him, and a mistake for me to watch. The writing was so flawed, it is hard to comment on it's inadequacies. It wasn't like there was a few missing links or non-sensical scenes; there seemed to be no attempt at coherency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say no!","review":"I think Johnny Depp is a wonderful actor and I usually enjoy his work.However, this movie was not well written at all and therefore not enjoyable to me. The plot seems muddled and the character's are not developed well. I think the scariest thing about this movie is Johnny Depp's haircolor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I. think there was something wrong with the DVD!","review":"Attempted to watch this on DVD, but it never started properly.All we could access was a semi-documentary about two low-energy (read no-energy) individuals who OH-SO-SLOWLY start to distrust each other since the male half of the \\"dynamic\\" duo (and I use dynamic in it's un-purest form) seemed to have been posest by a \\"jelly-fish wanna-be audio-morph intent on building silly airplanes\\".This went on for about 110 minutes too long, which leads me to believe that they couldn't fit the movie on the DVD also. Too bad, I was really looking forward to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been so much better","review":"This was a pretty disappointing movie. When I first read the description and found out Johnny Depp was going to be one of the main characters, I got excited. Unfortunately, his performance couldn't save a rather boring and slow-moving storyline. However, this was one of his older films, and was made before he turned into an extremely popular movie star. If only the plot was actually more interesting, I might have given the Astronaut's Wife a higher score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astronaut's Wife","review":"The movie picks up pace quickly and soon you are intrigued by the events that happen between Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron. You become involved in the characters and end up on your seat or behind it until the very end. The DVD format of this is crisp and clear. The pause button may be used when parts of the story become too intense. The movie is first rate with brilliant performances by Depp who only surpasses it in Sleepy Hollow. Charlize Theron is sypathetic as the wife of the astronaut who is different in some way. You'll have to see the movie to find out the rest. It's a must-see movie for the year 2000!"},{"rating":"2","title":"movie","review":"Depp was great as Spencer in this movie. I loved the fact that he scared the crap out of me, I loved his southern accent and he was so gorgeous with chesnut hair in this movie. I hope Johnny plays more scary characters. He plays it quite well. Charlizes acting was good also. Very good movie. And Surprising ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I still can't figure out what, exactly, this movie was about. I was confused from beginning to end. Possibly I was so bored that I just didn't pay attention. This has to be one of the worst movies that I've seen in a long time, and I'm not hard to please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Mediocre SF flick","review":"This is a nice-looking movie with a good cast, but the pacing is fairly slow and anyone who has seen more than a dozen SF movies will not find any new ideas here. It's fairly obvious from the beginning how the plot will develop, so there's little in the way of suspense. The ending is no real surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actors save the day","review":"The biggest problem of the film is, that there are no new ideas in the story. There are a lot of holes you can't ignore, a lot of incidents you can predict. The Ending too is not very surprising. Most of all, I ask myself why the things that happen are so bad. What is so bad about the twins? I couldn't find anything. For me is a lot senseless. But there are also good things in the movie: Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron are great (as usual). They made me forget that there were so many bad things about the film. There are also a lot of exciting scenes, that have the right tempo. But all in all, I wouldn't recommand \\"The Astronaut's Wife\\" to my friends. Only the actors save the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Acting, Good Suspense","review":"Two astronauts lose contact with NASA for two full minutes during a routine repair operation on a satellite. What happened during those two minutes becomes the center focus of this movie. Spencer (played by Depp) and his partner return to Earth, but the partner dies and Spencer isn't quite the same. That isn't apparent at first until a former NASA employee tries to contact Jillian (played by Theron). Then the movie takes a sinister turn. Is Jillian crazy, or is she pregnant with alien twins?I enjoyed the performance of Depp and Theron. They have a chemistry that I haven't seen between two actors in a long time. The special effects were good, but I had to turn up the volume to hear the actors' voices over the sound. I give this movie four stars because of the climax. Rather than give it away, I'll say that it didn't fit with the natural laws of science. Otherwise, I enjoyed the movie. It has a cliffhanger, which suggests a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Thought I Was Lost In Space","review":"Do yourself a favor and miss this flick. Johnny Depp returns from space after a trivial incident ('we lost contact for two minutes'-oh my!) and spends the rest of the film walking around acting like he's waiting for something to happen. His wife, suspicious of him for unknown reasons, might or might not be nutty. The other characters are barely in the film at all, although the obnoxious society women are the best part. I guess there was supposed to be some doubt as to whether Johnny Depp was an alien or not, the screenwriter seemed to think there was, but I didn't. The add campaign, which included some revealing dialogue which was apparently cut from the film (perhaps to maintain the imaginary ambiguity) left little doubt. I kept thinking, \\"Yeah yeah, he's an alien, can I go home now?\\" I spent the whole time waiting for the movie to start, then it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Yourself...","review":"...and don't even bother with this video. I wish I had even one good thing to say about it but I don't. I especially hated the mousy Charlize Theron. Geeeze talk about poor acting, she wins the razy for 1999. It is hard to believe this film even made it to release. Want to see a great film instead? Rent, or rather, buy \\"Bottle Rocket.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"REVERSAL OF THRUST","review":"Could have been much better with Charlize as the Astro. Lovely sets,lovely costumes ......eye candy and all of that.Could really have been more fun if we already had 'some' of these jellyfish' aliens living amongst us ......Overdone and recycled....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touching Ice","review":"The haircut gave it away. Charlize Theron is Roseary a la \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" but instead of the Devil up to his shenanigans, it's an alien who gets her pregnant by travelling across space as a radio transmission and occupying her husband.Johnny Depp is suitably vacant as the possessed spaceman. The movie riffs a little on female insecurities about pregnancy and the impossibility of men and women really understanding each other. It's a case of men being from Mars, etc.There's little to connect to emotionally in the movie and this is not helped by the director's cold minimalist aesthetic. This movie is as frigid as the regions of Nova Zembla, but now and then you feel a little heat like what is produced by touching ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I was expecting a lot from this movie - great plot, great cast. Instead - yawn. I was very disappointed - felt like the movie kept building but never really went anywhere. It could have been so much better if they'd actually built the suspense, and if the actors had seemed to truly care. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Sci-fic movie I've ever seen!","review":"Most viewers said this film was bad, but to me it was pretty good. I don't usually get sci-fic movies but I actually get this one. If you like horror, love, and space movies check this movie out. This movie is about a perfect all-American couple. Spencer Armocost (Depp)has died in space, then a life force take his body and his memory. NASA lost contact for two minutes and in space with the another astronaut contact them back. His goal to make his wife(Theron) pregant and he need his own kind to make a space ship from their design. ~~~~~I ACTUALLY GIVE IT 4.5 STAR!~~~~~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooh, look at the lovely lighting","review":"An interesting premise is ruined by a director's desire to make a name for himself through imagery.If you can bare to keep your mind switched on, for what must be the dullest film of all-time, then you'll see some beautiful design and cinematography. Also in shot you may see the deadest actors this side of 'Zombie Flesheaters'. I like Jonny Depp as an actor and, being male, I like Charlize Theron too but... God knows what they were thinking.I've seen my fair share of boring films but they can usually at least prick my attention with a little fast-pacing every-so-often but, as I said, the film is simply a long string of nice looking but inconsequential set-pieces.Watch Abel Ferrara's 'Body Snatchers' instead, for a relevant update of 50s B-movie ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The Best But Worth Watching Once In A While. Great","review":"This is by far not the best science fiction movie that I have seen, it has a great love scene in it and the ending is a surprise. Johnny Depp is just pretty to look at in any movie that he is in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rosemary's Twins","review":"Not a good buy. I purchased it and watched it on a Sunday night. This movie got a lot of bad reviews from profesional critics and movie watchers, and I am afraid they may be correct. Overall I do not regret buying and watching this movie. Some movies are good, some not so good, and some are terrible, but how can you judge the good one from the bad one if you never see the bad ones, therefore give this movie a chance and you be the judge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Predictable","review":"This was a horrible waste of money. It is slow moving, anti-suspense, and uses a very predictable plot that could have been played out and summed up in under 10 minutes. By the end of this long drawn out snooze-fest, you are saying to your TV \\"Please, just die already, just end this movie\\". If you are bored and it comes onto regular tv, ok, maybe watch it. But I wouldn't recommend even paying a $1 rental fee for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Starz being a little generous too...","review":"Astronaut's Wife is a whole lot of hype over nothing. I really expected better, but it turns out that the movie is one of the worst ever for Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron.

A story I seem to here variants of over and over and over again....Yep, 2 stars is VERY generous..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very pathetic waste of time very lackluster ploit.","review":"It's ashame that director think that we wanna watch really bad movies.But whatever this director was thinking when he made this pathetic waste of film was abviously thinking he was so bored he may as well make this thing but what a waste of time because by the time you figure out the ploit if you figure it out your begging for someone to put you out your misery ,but hey when your out of sleep medicine by all means put this in and youll fall asleep pretty dang quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been really good","review":"This film is a let-down, I like Johnny Depp and i usually think Charlize Therin is very hot and a good actress, in this film Depp is wasted and Charlize Therin, is very ugly looking(she looks really bad with the short-short hair)The plot insult's you A plot about aliens taking over Depp & another astronaut and impregnating their wives-Which is a total waste for the very pretty Donna Murphy who blows Charlize Therin away in her short scenes in this film. Instead of seeing Donna Murphy's charater impregnated(which would have made this film better)we are only told after she commits suicide, that she was impregnated by an alien, instead we see Therin get impregnated by Depp, and her Running around acting stupid and getting everyone killed for her ignorance. save your time, only rent to see Donna Murphy.Then turn it off after her character dies."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too much for this horrible film","review":"This is the absolute WORST movie I have seen in a long time.

I just wanted it to have a good solid ending to make me feel better about wasting 2 hours, but even that let me down. Don't waste your money renting it or buying it...unless you need a sleep aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me X Files series anytime","review":"This movie is so-so, something that I would only watch when there's nothing else for me to do. The movie is suspensful enough but once the viewers manage to figure out where it's going, it's becoming a bit stale. I do feel that the movie is built upon from a very simple premises & therefore, there's only so much that it could go. The on-your-face scary moments are deliberate as we have seen in other horror flicks. I couldn't help noticing Charlize Theron once again played a victimised wife, as she had done in the Devil's Advocate. To be truthful, the atmosphere of the movie is similar to something that's come out from X Files, even its open ended ending. Well, you would spot its uncanny resemblance with X Files especially when the credit starts to role (its font & background is exactly the same. The only absence is X Files theme song). Well, watch it if you need to but don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED!","review":"I don't usually make it a habit to write reviews about movies I can't stand - because the interest and enthusiasm just aren't there. However, for this movie, I'll make an exception! This movie is TERRIBLE! As someone else so eloquently put, I WISH I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO GIVE IT ONE STAR! It's draggy; the writing is dull; the characters might as well be made out of plastic; and it's not even scary or suspenseful in the least (and trust me, I'm someone who scares VERY easily)! What was with Johnny Depp's hair and accent? Pukesville. And what was with that woman's shorn head? Not attractive. Suffice it to say, I can't find a single good thing to say about this boring,ho-hum of a film. I can't even comment about the end, because I FELL ASLEEP! I'm just glad I rented the movie as opposed to buying it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A smart sci/fi movie","review":"I normally don't like sci/fi but this one was an exception. First Charlize Theron is just gorgeous to watch. Johnny Dep, though usually a very good actor, was miscast as an evil replication of her husband. The character of Jillian was smart and resourcefull. She was the fiber in this tale that made it suspenceful, thoughtful, and enjoyable. The fact that she worked her way out of a situation supposedly created by aliens, was both commendable and believable. She's a great actress. Other reviews here cite \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", don't accept that. Not even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stars over substance.","review":"I was really disappointed by this movie. I thought this was going to be somewhat of a sci-fi movie, but about the only action in the film occurs near the very end. I guess I shouldn't have been too disappointed; the title pretty much says it all.The film revolves around the astronaut's wife (played by Charlize Theron). I was so bored by the opening half of the movie, that I never learned the characters names, I didn't care anything about them. Her husband (played by Johnny Depp) is in an accident in space, but after a brief hospital visit he makes a full recovery. Nevertheless, his wife notices some subtle changes in his behavior. Things aren't exactly what they appear to be.This movie portrays itself as being a type of sci-fi movie (and it was labeled as such in the store I rented it), but it is really more of a thriller along the lines of WHAT LIES BENEATH (a far superior piece of cinematic magic). However, there isn't anything thrilling in this thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"This movie didn't do a thing for me, the plot was stupid, no special effects, and wooden acting.

Also didn't go into the ground very easy and if I got one side in, it came back out when I tried to put the opposite side in. Finally settled for getting some of the pieces into the ground and leaving the others on top of it.

I don't know if it was the music or moving dedication, but it was done very well. The Auditions were also very fun to watch. It's clear why the actors got the parts they did because they were all so good. As far as the actual movie goes, it's still pretty darn cool.

I was extremely disappointed in Amy for starring in such a boring, unintriguing movie. The only actual action was toward the end with the final battle between Seth and Viki's ex.

The second summer, it started getting temperamental, took a long time to warm up, and seemed to burn more propane. Cleaning the unit with the CO2 cartridges did not help. This summer, it takes many, many tries to get it started up (6-10). I suspect it is about to die. I paid almost $500 and I only use it 4 months a year.

It was never sealed in a sealed box, for all know it is a defective unit. But I cannot do anything about it. They were oh so kind to offer a $50 discount on a new unit. Big whoop!

Bought a second (we have a large and long yard) and the first died before the end of the Summer (would not complete warmup). After trying a bunch of things with customer service, they replaced for free. Half way through the second season, the second unit died (same symptom). It was out of warranty, and I would have been happy to pay for service, but no deal - the company has no repair service. Now we are on the second year for the replacement first unit. I'm waiting for that one to break, but it is still catching lots of mosquitoes. I want to love this thing, but a year of mosquito catching for $500 is a bit steep. If they repaired these units after warranty - even it broke after the first year and the service was for a (reasonable) fee, I'd probably give it 5 stars.

Suffice it to say I know a little bit about mechanical devices. The concept behind the mosquito magnet is very good and when it works it works very well. The problem is in the execution of the design. This is a very unreliable product that lasts on average about a year and a half. When it breaks repairs are very expensive. The other problem for those of us who are mechanically inclined is that the company REFUSES to sell repair parts under the pretext of \\"safety\\". Imagine if Chevy or Ford refused to sell parts. What do you think the Federal Trade commission would do? Perhaps the FTC should order a mandatory recall and compel the company to replace the defective parts at their cost, not ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work The Majority of the Time","review":"When it works which is only 10% of the time it does catch mosquitos.

Anyway, although the Liberty ignites (you have to plug in a transformer) the suction in the bell is too weak to catch any mosquitos. The proof is in the net. In a month it might catch 4-5 mosquitos, and my back yard, backing onto a wooded area, is swarming with insects. All in all, I think the manufacturer is selling smoke. Expensive smoke.

But League of Justice, an Elseworlds tale, certainly has its root in a host D&D; and early 1980s pulp fantasy novels.Four normal kids -- three upstanding young camp counselors and a ne'er-do-well thief and junkie -- are inexplicably summoned to another world where knights and sorcerers and monsters fight for supremacy. After being saved in the forest by a Jack o' the Green variation on Green Arrow and his mystical Bird Lady, the four set out on a quest for various heroes -- the Batmancer, the Amazon Princess, the Hawk Lord and others -- to fight the evil Sovereign (Superman) so they can try to save the kingdom.Hannigan, working with Dick Giordano, supplies the art, which is good, solid stuff. But the story is hokey. By the end, I had to wonder how many plot points were solved by the roll of a 20-sided die.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(n e t) editor"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT QUALITY CASTLE!!!","review":"My son and daughter (3 & 5) love this castle.

It was the most popular present at christmas, with all his cousins (all girls) playing all over the thing. It's a good size to fit the wonderful Schleich figures too!All wood, nicely decorated, no plastic and most importantly, no Disney Kitsch! Just a wonderful old fashioned playset that will see years of use. We placed it on his rarely used train table so there are pastures for the horses and water for the drawbridge.I could not be more pleased.

Immediately after unpacking it, I asked her what she thought, to which she replied, \\"it looks terribly clever, Mom!\\" And it does seem clever - - unisex, flexible design with four turrets, a staircase, \\"dungeon\\", courtyard, drawbridge and several nooks & crannies to keep her occupied. It's very grand in scale - - several kids can play with it all at once with reasonable civility - - so purchasing the additional bendable wooden figurines from M&D is a good idea. It's sturdy in construction but not as well-built as our Pottery Barn doll house (but not nearly as expensive either). In terms of the \\"fold n' go\\" aspect of the toy, I don't think this is a toy that we'd take on a roadtrip due to its large size but the folding mechanism is great to stow it neatly away after playtime.

Nevertheless, it was an amazing experience revisiting this book recently after reading it some 10 years ago. Much has changed over such a decade -- my own life, our surroundings, my beliefs, and, therefore, the ways I relate to literature. In that sense, it is not surprising THAT the same text would now take on rather different meanings. What fascinates me is HOW -- much of the text managed to touch me deeply both times, via totally different angles through the prism of life. It is interesting enough that the insights would evolve with one's personal development; what is even more amazing is that the ideology would also be applicable in an era nearly 300 years after the book was written -- a demonstration of what a classics is really all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I expected this book to be a copy of the original version, not a shorten version of it (like a 1/4 of the original size!).Extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice for a Hipppie","review":"If you're a hippie and like your books to have an incense smell and talk about hindu prayers and cliches from Golden Age India, and think that you can get by as a Sanskrit student by knowing some Sanskrit words, get it!

The devanagari characters are quite small. My guess is that they were treated in the conversion process not as text but as graphics, and so they do not respond to \\"Change Font Size\\" commands. Even when you can enlarge them, they are smudgy and indistinct. What this book deserves is to be re-typeset, although at the time I'm writing this (5/2012) I'm not sure the technology can yet manage all non-Roman scripts well.

It sounded interesting: the story of a man whose family background tells him he could have, should have been more than a grocery clerk and how a moral man reacts when presented with not-so-moral opportunity in a seemingly corrupt world.I was expecting a story that would grab and hold my attention. While the central conflict was eventually revealed, the various tangents the narration wandered off on became too distracting to really enjoy the central core of the story. Perhaps the biggest disappointment of all was the ending. I won't give away any details, but suffice it to say that when I reached the last page on my Kindle I had to go back and see if I'd missed something. It was not only abrupt but Ethan's actions seemed out of character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter of our discontent","review":"I love this book.

The basic dilemma that Ethan is faced with is one that all can identify with on a personal/professional level. I was surprised with the ending and the choice Ethan makes, although those who have read Steinbeck's earlier works prior to this book may not be. This book also contains the quote, \\"The threshold of insult is intelligence and security.\\", which spoke volumes to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book of quiet power","review":"Without doubt, one of the finest in the Steinbeck pantheon.

Criticism: too much detail; on and on about one particular thing; very distracting"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very timely novel about modern morality even though written in 1961","review":"I had never before read this last of Steinbeck's novels and thoroughly enjoyed it. The moral struggle of Ethan Allen Hawley mirrors that of many people in today's society and government. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No wonder he won the Nobel Prize for this.","review":"I have read a lot of Steinbeck books and this book is one of my favorites. I loved the Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden, but there was something about this book that made it my favorite. It might be because of the prose or the theme of the book,I really think it is the combination of the two. I think that it hits home with the middle class morality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a perfect novel","review":"I've read this book again and again, and each time I realize why this is my favorite novel. The dialogue, descriptions, and prose are so wonderfully constructed that the reader is left to ponder how John Steinbeck ever thought to write such a magical story. It's a tale of man's soul, of morals, of the mind, and of family. If you can find a flaw in this book, I'd love to hear about it. It's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"an overlooked classic","review":"I like Steinbeck a lot and I admire his ability to adeptly write about so many different themes in his various novels. Out of all of his books, I think this is one of the least known, which is really too bad. Steinbeck's prose and descriptive ability never falters; he makes the book come alive but never overwhelms the reader with detail. The variety of characters (another one of Steinbeck's traits) usually would seem like too much for this relatively short novel, but each one is memorable, adding another layer, another necessary part that makes this novel work so well. This book's themes, especially the theme of whether it's worth it to sacrifice ideals in order to get ahead, are applicable to this day and age and ensure the timelessness of this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Handbook on American Values.....","review":"If you are ever asked what five books you would recommend to someone who knew nothing about America to introduce them to what it means to be American...like say...on the Foreign Service Exam ;-) this book had better be on that list. The Grapes of Wrath is the Masterpiece that gets all the attention but this novel shines even in the shadow of one of the key pieces of American literature. I have rarely been \\"moved\\" by a novel the way that I was with this book. It forces you to read it at its own pace and to let the story unfold around you. It is a great book and one that deserves to be read time and again. Read it yourself and then give it to your children. This book will speak to your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Content with Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck shows true artistry of dialogue in this book set in New England in the 1950s. The protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, conveys every bit of his is misfortune (or missed fortune, as the case may be) and everyman, grocery store clerk persona in his words along with something deeper, darker, and perhaps undetectable to one who isn't privy to what haunts his mind at night. He is a delightful character, despite his self-indulgence. Although the plot is slow and relies heavily on somewhat unbelievable coincidences, the story is chock-full of brilliant dialogue. You can practically see the scenes in black and white in your mind with a Jimmy Stewart-esque Ethan tapping out the language in a beautiful staccato song of times gone by."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Having read much of Steinbeck in my youth, I lately read one book I missed. Wow. This is a masterpiece in my view. Put it on your list, for sure. You will probably reread the final couple of chapters. You can also write your own ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story of Failure and Redemption","review":"This is a very easy read. Steinbeck lays a moral foundation through the characters and develops each of them well. He shows the weaknesses of humanity through the lens of the story. In a nutshell this is a very good, well written, story of hope and possibility despite decadence, greed and corruption within all of humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dissertation on Morality","review":"I like this Steinbeck novel because it suggests ideas about morality, but requires the reader to further those ideas allowing the reader to form a relation with Steinbeck's ideas. I found this novel to be more insightful and thought out than a few of Steinbeck's other novels, notably Cannery Row. While Cannery Row and even Of Mice and Men pave a definite internal path for the reader, The Winter of Our Discontent allows the reader freedom to expand his or her mind on the ideas of morality standards and temptation.Overall, The Winter of Our Discontent reminded me of how much we, as humans, are saturated in a greedy, free-riding society. Steinbeck's story implies that maintaining one's morals within society is an impossibility, but the novel also challenges me, and other readers, to prove that wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"The question is still valuable","review":"Only bad thing in that book is atempt to answer the question.May be it is the most powerful of all Steinbeck books. May be only one of them, where author do not really know the answer.Of course, he is trying to answer. While Dostoevsky in same situation forced his hero to commit murder, Steinbeck forces world to teach hero a lesson. But he have enough taste to live hero with gains from his crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"As one who loved The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men, I was excited to revisit Steinbeck after quite a few years. Reading this book was simply painful. I didn't like the characters, the prose seemed to drag, and it just didn't ring true. I never accepted the premise, that Ethan would change from a good and decent man to a deceitful one who turned on his friends and colleagues. Most of all, I didn't care what happened! There was the occasional brilliant phrase but I was so bored that I could barely appreciate it. I must have read a different novel than all of your other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for emergencies!","review":"Look closer! The BIG RED BUTTON is NOT the emergency button as one would think from the description of this item. The emergency button is the small red button along with all the other buttons in a row.

It expresses the necessity of a country to be aware of the resources it possesses and the lengths to which it must go to obtain this information.

Overall, this is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this","review":"Korn has been a band that I have respected since their first album. No other band has ever been able to show such intense emotion and anger that sounds so honest and sincere. This tribute album takes some great korn songs and ruins them. It sounds like the bands on this cd maybe heard the songs they are performing once or twice, and then said to each other, \\" How can we destroy this song.\\" Stay away from this cd, it is a complete mockery of the greatest band in metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious...?","review":"I have no idea what that was supposed to be. I survived the whole album, though Im not sure how. I realize it is a Tribute album and not a Remix album (the other review got the two mixed up, i guess). Im sure these bands tried their hardest to put something together for one of the greatest groups around, but it just didnt work.

Some of the combat narratives start to bread up the monontony but I found them few and usually brief. I would say this book is ideal for the dedicated Naval historian.

It beeps a lot in our yard, so I'm still trying to figure out exactly how to best use it and decipher the signals. Overall I'm quite happy with it. I love it's lightweight and sleek design, and the price can't be beat for something this cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Tomorrow big lacker in Master P films","review":"Master P one of the best in the business ,matter of the fact one of the best to ever run his company ,but I must say he's trying to do too much. This movie had good actors like Pam Grier and Gary Busey who are in the headliners but are barely in the movie also along with Master P. (Big mistake) It surrounded around this one unknown actor wo was a special agent for his country working for Master P undercover who was a big time gangster. Gary Busey was a big time crime lord in controll of weapons and Pam Grier was a FBI agent on the case to crack both of them. This movie a good screen play but bad I must say very bad production it was very low budget the quadilty was bad ,the editing was bad that took from this film capablity of being a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what everyone should read....","review":"I bought this book just because I liked what Andreas had to say about the natural ways of healing. Once I opened this book, I really could not keep it down. My humble suggestion to anyone who reads this book: Please please read this book with your heart... not with your head. While reading do not try to argue with what you read.... Read it and feel it... once you complete reading it, then if you want to and feel like, try to see if you can really make sense of it with the normal mind. I am in total AWE after reading this book!!! Filled my heart with love for every living and non-living being around me. This is coming from a truly blessed soul is all that I can say!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Veil of Duality","review":"After reading this book, I purchased 4 more copies.

We could all benefit from this knowledge. Need I say more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money...","review":"I was expecting great things from this book after reading the Miracle Gall Bladder Cure, but I was dissapointed. What a load of new age rubbish. The author may in fact be some way mad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brick Lane: a journey and a destination","review":"This was Ms Ali's debut novel, and was shortlisted for the 2003 Man Booker Prize. While Brick Lane is about a particular set of experiences for a specific set of characters, it is also more broadly about the dislocation experienced by all migrants.Brick Lane tells the story of Hazneen, who came to England from Bangladesh at the age of 18 for an arranged marriage to Chanu. When she arrives, she has very limited English, but falls into the role of a dutiful wife to a man who is also culturally dislocated and whose rigid adherence to remembered custom and practice renders him sadly ineffectual.This novel explores cultural difference, family ties and associated impacts on individuals.Highly recommended - not because it provides all of the answers or instant understanding but because it identifies so many of the questions.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Growth of Nazneen - The Main Character...","review":"Its not a bad read, better than some of the other asian-culture books I have read. The book is about Nazneen, a Bangladeshi, who is at 18 years married off to a UK-based Bangladeshi, some 20 years her senior. The book revolves arounf her life in the East End of London, and her silent struggles. I felt that the book was like a great looking sandwich, with fresh bread, however, the filling was a little soggy! In other words, the beginning and ending are captivating, but the middle was a little slow. I would have liked to have read more about Nazneens relationship with Karim. The letters from her sister slowed the whole reading experience down a bit - and I could have done without this."},{"rating":"1","title":"letdown....","review":"i was expecting a novel which was going to be unique since it was nominated for so many awards but was disappointed. The novel drags on and there is no definite path it takes...i am not sure what message the author was trying to send...the characters were not clearly etched...i thought it was about the struggles of an immigrant girl in london but all it did was ramble..i have to be careful to pick authors based on nominations for \\"awards\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long & Drab","review":"It was dissapointing. It was long and got boring after the first 150 pages. Towards the end, when the Muslim League agenda comes in, it was unbearable. I was reading every alternate page. Nazneen's sister, Hasina's story would have been more compelling and interesting. The protagonist's character lacks depth. Overall, Ali should have kept the book shorter, got rid of the religious aspect and strengthen her characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had those hours back","review":"I forced myself to read this book as it is going to be discussed at my next book club. The best word I can use to describe this book is tedious. The dialogue especially was uninspired. I really could not care less what happened to any of the characters, and the ending was just as boring as the rest of the book. I was very disappointed in the entire story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented author but the book's ultimately unsatisfying","review":"Life in Brick Lane is captured with an uncanny, almost photographic realism. And the story of Nanzeen and Chanu's life together rings true. Yet the pace is maddeningly slow and the plot disintegrates into predictability. That said, I believe that Monica Ali is a writer who has been blessed with great talent. Unfortunately, Brick Lane is not a great novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I loved this book and have read it more than once. I think it shows an outsider possibly what it is like not only for Bangladeshi immigrant women living in London, but also for the women in Bagladesh.It really makes you appreciate your own life and situation too. I can't belive this is her first book! For all of those harsh critics out there; can you do better? If so, do it! From my experience some of the critics are the least expert on the things they critique (as in they could hardly do it themselves, but find it easier to judge the work of others)...just saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I really wanted to love this book. I got lost in the letters from Razia and I just couldn't get a handle on Nazneen and Karim's budding relationship. I thought the daughters were poorly developed and the husband was ridiculous. Cutting corns and trimming nosehairs are not my idea of a successful marriage. So I will say that Monica Ali definitely portrayed their lacking marriage successfully. I wish I would have liked it more. I am interested in seeing the movie, but I think it's a shame when I have a feeling that the movie will be better than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Satisfying Ending","review":"The ending is superb and deeply satisfies the reader. All of the narration comes together to leave an accomplishment... but had I not persevered through the book my initial lack of interest (which spanned for 3/4 of the book) would have won out. Brick Lane takes too long to go anywhere and seems to spend too much time explaining the plot rather than living it. Nazneen's seclusion from the world did not work to the favor of this book and her emotions seem stifled. Hasina's letters seem to be a bit odd in place as Nazneen only seems to be casually interested in them. However, if you can wait out for the last few chapters of the book you will find that it is a quiet gem of a read... though you may not read it twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"It just goes on and on and goes nowhere. I don't care about the characters. The sister's letters are a chore to read and I end up saying, \\"so what?\\" I generally enjoy reading about other cultures and was really looking forward to this one because of all the hype.What a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woman's Awakening","review":"The Story tells the story of one woman's journey to find her true self-desires, interests, opinions. I had a difficult time putting it down, but there were parts that were somewhat dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brick Lane","review":"This books had many starts and stops. Unfortunately, there are too many stops. Just as the book started to get interesting, the reader is lead back down into dismal descriptions of a dirty apartment, drug use and all-around hopelessness. I, luckily, borrowed this book from the library just I didn't feel as I wasted my money. I think the book would have been so much more interesting if it had been written with the sister's view and her story, albeit a little more realistic. However, this book was too long, boring and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Do yourself a favor and pass on this book. Could not care about the characters, story just seemed to go on and on. It was way too long which just increased the pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge disappointment","review":"The reason I gave this book one star is that it is not possible to give none.Every time I walked into a bookstore for a couple of months I wanted to buy this book, because it was getting very good reviews and the beginning was promising. But once I actually bought it and started reading it, like many other reviewers, I found the story way too slow and boring. At no point did I feel I was actually getting involved in the characters' lives - I simply couldn't care less. After reading the reviews here I'm now definitely going to give up, even though I always finish my books and I regret having spent 10 Euros on a book I didn't even finish - but it just does not seem worth losing any more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and duller","review":"This book keeps your interest for the about the first 50 pages and then just disintegrates to the point where you just don't care about the characters. It was downright muddled, at times.It was all I could do to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and did not make me care","review":"For someone who never puts a book down once I have started no matter how little it appeals to me, I did the impossible and gave up reading the rest of Brick Lane when I arrived at 200 pages. The reviews on Monica Ali's book promised so much, but gave so little. A long drawn out book with a few redeeming scenes (when Nazneen's first child was ill in hospital and she and Chanu took turns to keep watch), Brick Lane is tough going. Especially annoying was the gibberish from Nazneen's sister which I assumed was meant to be Bengali expressed in direct transliteration. The characters were neither fascinating nor inspirational nor interesting nor deserving of empathy. Of course if I had plodded on I might have changed my mind, but the point being that it was so un-engaging there was no desire on my part to get to the end of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"long... pointless ... boring","review":"This is just another depressing book about South Asians. I have to admit I only got half way through, so maybe the end was better, but I tend to doubt it.I got the book on CD - listening to the whiney South Asian woman reading it was painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Just really never got in to the characters and I felt the book jumped all over the place. Also, thought the relationship w/the young man Nazneen meets would be more exciting or refreshing -- a total let down.I didn't care about the characters at all and felt overwhelmed by all of the \\"letters\\" regarding Hasina, Nazneen's sister.Really didn't enjoy it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls flat in it's won verbosity","review":"Since most of the reviewers have already shared the storyline of this novel, I will spare the reader any more- much as I wish Monica Ali had done.

I do know that this author received a wealth of hype when the book is filled with \\"cliche after cliche\\". Sorry Monica. I do believe there is some talent there. But if you don't know the culture you are writing about, do extensive research, research, research. Perhaps your characters might have been more authentic if you, yourself, really knew/know the culture. Do you? I don't feel you do--at all---nor do I feel that whatever research you did helped you know enough. I don't know about Bangladesh culture, but I do know cliched, super fast, quickly rushed writing and poor research. I hope your next book lends to your readers a lot more of what you do know. Brick Lane is not terrible, but it's too darn formula-ic, wrought with passages that really don't say anything about the characters other than that they are A,B,C,D'ish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy Novel","review":"I have never read such a trashy novel! Unless you know the true society of which the story is supposedly to be in, you will realized this book is based on the imagination of the author- not in reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"What a bore. This book does not live up to the hype. Its incredibly slow to start and it doesn't get any better. It just drags along. I didn't actually finish the book. That's how terrible it is. All that I can say is that this book is terrible, and if you must read it please don't buy it. Go to your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slow Read","review":"I originally picked up this book because it seemed like it had gotten some decent reviews. I can't stay that I enjoyed the novel very much, mostly because it was slow moving, the characters were all over the place, and the ending was weak. Don't waste your time reading this novel, pick up something better like The Kite Runner, which has a lot more substance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monica Ali's Brick Lane","review":"I usually enjoying reading novels pertaining to other cultures, especially Asian cultures. However, I found this book rather dry. I constantly found myself re-reading because of the complex, upon complex sentences. At one point, I almost didn't want to finish the book because it wasn't one of those books that you want to run home and read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Finish","review":"I have a problem with abandoning a book before finishing it because I can't give up the hope that there may be something worthwhile at the end. If I were the type to cast an unfinished book aside, I would have done so with Brick Lane. There came a point in the novel when the main character, Nazneen, began attending political meetings, which is perfectly interesting in itself, but the story gets bogged down in the political details and becomes boring. I found myself disliking Nazneen's choices at the end of the book. I also didn't like Nazneen's children. While characters in novels are almost always flawed, these flaws are supposed to endear us to the character. These characters just didn't seem to have enough redeeming qualities to be likeable. The one character I found that I liked was Nazneen's husband, Chanu, who irritated Nazneen, but I couldn't help seeing how good of a person he really was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the connection??","review":"This read was a huge disappointment. There were so many opportunities to draw the reader in, yet the author failed to make the catch. Developing a feel for these characters was difficult at best. As emotional events unfolded in the life of Nazneem, the author failed to take the extra step of connecting with the reader. At one point a significant loss occurs, yet the emotional aspects of such a tremendous loss are completely neglected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly boring","review":"It usually takes me about a week or two to get through a paperback.

After about page 100, it's just repeats of characters actions and stuff, it gets kinda lame. And the muslim group part makes the book sooooo slow, you gotta skim it. But then you can't help but feel pity, the way the author throws emotions about how Nazneen feels is almost real. if the book was only had the first 100 pages it would've been cool, but at then end you're just like, dude, this book blows."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big yawn","review":"Bought it after reading the hype and proceeded to be extremely disappointed. Just goes to show you that slick marketing by publishers can suck you in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Club gives thumbs down.","review":"We chose this book for our Book Club, and the overwhelming response was negative. The common thread was that the letters in the book actually distracted from the story, were difficult to read (poor language flow), and in general did not enlarge the understanding of the characters. In addition, the characters in the book did not engage and in some cases, actually enraged, the readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"This T-Shirt was supposedly \\"licensed\\" by DC and Warner Brothers but it's really just the regular design printed on a standard T-Shirt Brand, Delta Heavy Weight to be exact... kind of like false advertising since the picture they display is a completely different T-shirt than the one you receive.

I like the music and I like the combination. One word of caution--the dynamic range of the Requiem is so great that you probably need a good speaker system to fully appreciate it. On my little boombox, the quiet parts tended to get lost, unless I cranked it up a lot, and then I was afraid the loud parts would damage my speakers. My other \\"complaint\\" is that the piece sandwiched between these two sacred pieces seems to be a secular work; I would rather have had another sacred piece, although I find the music hauntingly beautiful and apt to get stuck in my head!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for 1 season.

Last year, it ran without problem although the mosquito harvest was unimpressive. This year the CO2 generator failed again and I'll need to return it now at my expense.Living in Minnesota, I was hoping this device would control our backyard pests but I found the Mosquito Magnet both unreliable and ineffective.

The manager of the store said it was only available via mail order, but that numerous customers had brought their mosquito nets in to show him thousands of mosquitoes caught by the Magnet. What you don't know when you purchase this item is that it cannot be set up anywhere in your yard that is not protected from rainfall.

Depending on what you pay for the propane, attractant and CO2 cartridges, it sums up to a cost of $20 around or more at each tank refill. Since you have to refill the propane tank, replace the attractant and use the Quick-clean every 21 days, this adds up to an operating cost of over $400 per year!

It is very effective in catching 10 to 20 mosquitoes per night. After a month the numbers dwindled to about 5 to 10 per night. Possibly, because the mosquito population was collapsing. I apply the CO2 cartridge and change the Octenol lure only once at the beginning of each summer. I also turn it off every morning and turn it back on during the evening because it doesn't catch any mosquitoes when the sun is shining hot. I haven't had any problems with it breaking down for over 5 years. Perhaps, I got lucky with a good unit. Or possibly, it is because I turn it off every morning and this keeps it from wearing down.Pros: Effective in catching mosquitoes consistently.

The latest attractant, OCT-3, really makes a difference compared with the old versions. Don't get lazy about cleaning the propane nozzle with the carbon charger before you refill the propane tank; otherwise, it takes forever to start the machine. The Mosquito Magnet takes some patience and investment in accessories, but we feel that it has made our backyard a bit more bearable.

We're not the only ones - other people in my neighborhood similarly suckered in by the great literature that American Biophysics presents say they don't work for them either. The company put us on a beta test using special octenal for our type of mosquitos: Asian but still...nothing... we've given up and are going to toss the thing - I'd feel guilty selling it or even giving it away.

Instead, the only bugs killed where the ones I slapped off my legs as I spent several hours over the course of a couple of weeks hauling this thing to different points of my yard and begging it to actually run. What really tries your patience is that it takes 20 minutes to warm up and five minutes to shut down. Do the math and you can try to start it only twice per hour. As the father of a 3-year old (one of the reasons why I bought this white elephant), I don't have six hours in a row to coax this tempermental thing to work. The instruction manual isn't much help -- it doesn't even tell you what the different speeds of flashing light mean.

Every 21 days you have to change the propane tank, net, and lure and use a new CO2 recharge cartridge and the gas reset tool. You can easily spend $40+.However, the real problem is that the unit regularly stops working. If you turn the propane on too fast, if you connect the unit to an outlet without full power, if the net is dirty, etc. the unit will stop functioning and give you a fault lighting sequence.

The higher models have multiple codes to tell you exactly what part is acting up. You WILL be fixing this thing so your going to need the diagnostics.On the bright side, the thing does not actually break. It just needs deep cleaining of all of its parts.

It is hard growing up in the shadow of a genius.This movie might not be for everyone, but definitely a well done one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Drama of Sibling Conflict","review":"\\"Beautiful Ohio\\" stars William Hurt and Rita Wilson as Simon and Judith Messerman, progressive parents who want nothing but the best for their two boys, Clive (David Call) and William (Brett Davern). Clive, a math prodigy seemingly a shoo-in for the top prize at an upcoming mathematics competition, often disconnects from his doting parents by speaking in a made-up language that nobody but himself can understand. William, on the other hand, is just trying to get by as he struggles to work his way out from under the shadow of his elder sibling. Director Chad Lowe has elicited effective performances from the entire cast and fashioned a dramatic story that could easily have gone the way of dreary soap opera. Instead, it draws us into the family with humor, emotion, and intelligent pacing. The bare-bones DVD contains no extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Direction!","review":"While this film had a decent plot, there is a reason it has been so-unnoticed. The direction doesn't make you curious, the script doesn't flow, the characters are annoying and the film seems to be going on on it's own without creating any questions or being relevant to the viewer. There is a character who's a math genius yet his character was very incongruous and it seems like the director is having a tough time portraying him. Another young girl who loves to break hearts was also a little twisted. This is a bit like that Christina Ricci picture where she tries to induce someone younger than her to have sex with her, only that somehow that film was more relevant.Can't help but be cynical as ever. Do yourself a favour, close this window and do not watch this film. Want to watch a similar much better film? The Squid and the whale. But I'm sure most fans have of this fickle genre have seen that film.

It covers the current version of Struts (1.2). The second part is what's really great. It teaches you how to design Struts application properly.

For example, there are a number of chapters that are as useful and high quality as this article (from the same author)http://dev2dev.bea.com/pub/a/2005/05/decorators.htmlOther design topics include- Paging- Managing very large resultsets in multi pages- Transfer data object design pattern- Data Access Object- Caching- Persistence layer- etcThere is also a chapter entitled \\"How Struts Works\\" that provides a useful insight into the internal working of Struts.

It seems to have been quite a common read in Borges' time, as it humoristically treats the \\"college experience\\" as it was felt in the day.

That said, Ostroff has written it much better than I could have. While what drove Dickey Chapelle to her achievements and disasters remains a bit hard to grasp, Ostroff has done an excellent job of tracing her cliffhanger career. There are nitpicks: Ostroff puts herself in Chapelle's head at times, as if she knows exactly what Dickie was thinking, and there is no mention of Chapelle's spiritual beliefs or lack thereof. Despite these slips, the book is an excellent tale, well told. I've recommended it widely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful intro for anyone wanting answers as to why?","review":"As a German born in 1944 and leaving Germany at the tender age of 13, I was always ashamed of being German. Gitta Sereny's book allowed me to reflect and think about the times, the people, the mood, the conflicts in a way that was not too overwhelming and hurtful. Her writing style is beautiful and the truth contained in this excellent biography made me want to read more about this shameful period in Germany's history. No longer hesitant to learn what happened, thanks to Gitta's book, I am also much more attuned at what is happening in other parts of the world where genocide takes place in small isolated instances but where we can make a difference in stopping it by letting those in power know \\"never again\\". I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how people, like Speer, can ultimately become connected to an evil plot against humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can truth be re-invented?","review":"A very scholarly work from Gitta Sereny, detailing a man of considerable charm,intelligence and resourcefulness. Gitta Sereny goes some way to explain this complex individual, his relationships with his parents, his wife and children, as well as his place among the elite of the third reich. A man who 'conned' the war crimes commission at Nuremberg, and continued to do so to the rest of the world after the war. Why did his deputy hang and not he? A complex answer despite the evidence. A great read, an insight into the shadows of a totalitarian regime and the place of one man within it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read of World War II history buffs.","review":"Gitta Sereny has produced one of the best biographies I have read in a long time.

I went through the book again and I found that the book does suit beginner anatomy really well. As another reviewer, I was turned off by the art but nonetheless it is a decent book on the subject and I recommended it to beginners and others alike.If your looking for other good figure drawing/anatomy books, pick jack Hamm's book \\"Drawing the head & figure\\" or Andrew Loomis' \\"figure drawing for all it's worth\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy.","review":"I was somwhat dissapointed in the artwork in this book.I guess I expected more from the artist.

This book is probably alright for the artist just picking up thier pencils for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title is Wishful Thinking","review":"Struggling with drawing the human figure and looking for easy answers I was suckered into buying this book by the positive reviews. It's one of the weakest drawing instructionals I've ever seen. It's style is heroic comic book. That's not bad in itself, as you can learn a lot of proportion and foreshortening from good line art. The problem, besides poor drawing, is the lessons(?) go something like this: draw a circle, now divide that into thirds and \\"poof\\", here's the finished drawing! No real instruction, no real system. I found this book useless and even embarrassing to have on the bookshelf. There is no easy answer to drawing the human figure except drawing the human figure and learning from your mistakes. Don't bother with this book, there are better instructions out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bellow average anatomy book","review":"I have no idea why I bot this book. I thought it was going to be a good anatomy book at the least. Basically it's very cartoony, think Titan A.E. This person can't draw so well either, A normal Figure drawer is better. He seams to draw some people too stubby on the legs and the crotch area too low on women. He can't draw manga style either, he draws them to cheap or to stiff. The artist needs to go back to school and do some studies on human anatomy. It also looks like he needs some art lessons too. I would have given this book 2 stars and a half but I decided to round down. Basically as a figure drawer I would be embarrassed to draw like this person, I think he should study lighting, photography, Animation(So his characters wont be so stiff), and figure drawing. Basically if you want a real anatomy book I suggest you buy \\"Dynamic Anatomy\\" by Burne Hogarth and don't make the mistake like I did on buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good basic reference and starting point","review":"This book is a very good exposition of human anatomy for the artist. It includes sections on skeletal structure, musculature, flexation, and how various poses are affect the illustrating of a human figure. This is not a book on how to draw a likeness of someone in particular but a good study on the human body and a foundation of it's structure and illustration. If you are looking to draw a likeness then it is still valuable as a basic understanding of anatomy but there are better choices.The book is a good buy for those who are interested in learning underlying anatomy in order to create accurate and detailed illustrations. It is a good buy and I'm sure will be a regular reference for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good supplmental book for anatomy.","review":"This is definitely a good little book on anatomy for artists; I learned some new things from it, and I've been picking up anatomy tips a few years now. It's easy to follow and helps makes things less confusing. It also has some great concepts in here that a lot of beginners might not know about.However, though it's easy to follow, I don't think anyone should depend heavily upon it, or even start off with this book. The drawings are still very simplified (think Disney animation style, but with a bit more detail added), and some illustrations don't even look right to me (like the bottom illustration on p 103).But I think this would be a great supplement to Jack Hamm's book \\"Drawing the Head and Figure\\" and Ron Tiner's book \\"Figure Drawing without a Model.\\"This book also would have been improved by the addition of different body types, as well (as in Ron Tiner's book).But all in all, a recommended book -- just don't depend on it, kay?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to simple","review":"The problem with this book is that you don't really learn anything about drawing anatomy.

Like all of Hart's books he just makes you \\"think\\" that you've learned something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"I found this book to be rather disappointing. It focuses on comic book style illustration which isn't bad in itself, but the book teaches almost nothing usefull about propotions, muscles, the skeletal struture, or how these affect what you draw.If your looking for an anatomy book along the same lines as this one(comic book style), I would recommend \\"How To Draw Manga: Bodies and Anatomy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad drawing","review":"The trouble in finding a good \\"tips\\" book on anatomy is that they are so inexpertly drawn, and Christopher Hart's book falls in that category. It has a few tips, but the drawings are linear with no volume or texture. The worst is that the origins of the muscles are never right because the artwork isn't substantial enough. I agree with the first reviewer. I,too, was robbed of my money. The man can't draw!To have a first rate anatomy book, I recommend Loise Gordon's 'How to Draw the Human Figure: An Anatomical Approach' which delivers everything that Hart promized but failed to do. Gordon's drawings are simply the best in the field. Get the other two books by her, and your'e set to study anatomy seriously. In addition I find the book 'Artistic Anatomy,' by Dr. Paul Richer, a good reference manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"For non-discerning children","review":"This guy is a one-note player! Oversimplified with too much of the artist's own personal style injected into it. It's a starter book, for goodness' sake, so there must be a bit more impartiality to the drawings to get the basics down! In addition, there are certain rules to drawing humans that are missed in this book. This guy is cutting artistic corners all over the place, drawing symbolically and not literally. It's on the level of bad 1990's cartoons. Come on! I was robbed (well, for a couple nights until I returned it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"its informative but just ok","review":"this book isnt the worst but it isnt the best either, when i bought it i was just looking for a good anatomy book because i im a aspiring comic book artist at age 15 and i needed to understand the anatomy of the body.this book mainly assisted me on small simple things but it just didnt get into any depth or major detail so there were things incomplete in this book. if your a beginner this might be ok to start off with since its just simple.Or if your like me and you want to learn the anatomy full throttle than dont get this book get something more detailed. so two stars because its just ok the art is alright and the info is pretty informative (you can learn a little from this book) but id say get something with more detail for a better and more convincing understanding also more convincing artwork (oh and im a boy dont mind the name at the top)"},{"rating":"1","title":"beginners guide","review":"this book is not helpful to anyone who is a serious artist. if you want to get good at drawing, want to learn more about anatomy, get an anatomy book. this book is suited for people who don't really care about anatomy, and just want to know enough to scrape by.I did not like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm surprised at how good the reviews are...","review":"I love Chris Hart. And in a lot of his newer books he's much better than his old 2004 books. And since I love Chris' stuff, my mom bought me this or Christmas. And I've got to say this book is absolutely terrible. The first section was on the human face and it was really bad. The book didn't even properly focus on female anatomy, in fact it didn't at all, other than som random half nudes in weird positions. I suppose it's alright for details like male muscles and such, but I was looking for basic anatomy. I really would rather have his 'Figure It Out!' book because I need to know how to pose my characters, etc. I'm not a beginner, and I'm no professional, but my skill set is higher than the content of this book.I would recommend this as an accompaniment to another anatomy book for details, but you should not buy this for any other reason. I don't think it would help beginners or the advanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource","review":"Chris Hart\\"s book HUMAN ANATOMY MADE AMAZINGLY EASY is a invaluable resource to artists who need to know anatomical landmarks. Chris provides great illustrations and guidelines to strengthen one's knowledge of anatomy without over complication. Applying this helpful guide to any individual's study of anatomy can only strengthen the rendering of the figure and enhance individual style and expression. A great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference for the body","review":"I found this book to be a very good reference for everything below the neck. There are a few places where the drawing look a bit off, and also where the figures look very geometric from Hart's shading. The feet section wasn't particularly helpful. I learned more drawing my own foot, than trying to understand what he was teaching.The head section, although containing helpful hints, seemed rather complex, compared to what I've been taught in life drawing classes. Also, I don't think there was enough time spent on drawing the head at an angle upwards or downwards, or even tilted to one side. There were a few drawings, which weren't very well done, and some unhelpful tips, but nothing of any value.Overall, I'd give the head section a three, and the section on the body a five, but it's also not the most fabulous book on artistic anatomy. It is a valuable reference, but don't let it be your only one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst item I've purchased on Amazon","review":"This product is very poor quality.

One of the four gets raped and the other almost before one of the businessmen (someone who does not believe in law) kills the attacker with an arrow. Because the whole valley will be flooded soon they decide to leave the body there and tell no one. The one with a heavy heart falls overboard however.What is right? What is wrong? are questions asked in this movie and no one is sure.

I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"overall a very average movie","review":"I remember reading the book years ago and finding it to be pretty thrilling. I can't say as I found the same in the movie. There were some suspenseful moments but overall a great amount of tedium. The characters were strongly lacking in anything of interest most especially that portrayed by Burt Reynolds. The scenery on the other hand was fantastic. Best I can say for this one is I managed to stay awake the entire time it was on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Example of poor quality of a good movie.","review":"Mine will be short and sweet.

Ned Beatty's performance is the oft overlooked keystone of the movie.","review":"I had had never seen the uncut version of this movie previously, nor had I seen it on a big screen until 2010. This is a beautifully filmed movie (except for the bizarre looking day for night footage on the cliff). The performances are first rate, too (again with a lapse on the cliff). The best remembered scenes unfortunately overshadow in our collective memory the fine performances that include those scenes. Bobby's (Ned Beatty) transformation as his inner strength comes out plays in the background of Burt Reynold's and John Voight's more active and prominent performances but is really the keystone of the movie without which it would crumble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny movie","review":"This is a classic, I have always wanted to watch this movie.

Undeniabley, there are a few memorable scenes (including the \\"Dueling Banjos\\" and the \\"Sqeal like a pig\\" scenes), and the director does build up an adequit amount of tension. But all in all, this homoerotic macho adventure/thriller is long, anti-climatic and at times intolerabley dull. Really not that scary, and the good ideas are not followed through on as well as they should have been. The book is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squeal, squeal like a pig.............","review":"This 1972 movie staring Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox was excellent viewing on big screen home tv as it was in the theater. The impact this film has on me is still great. It's a story of 4 men that dare to take a canoe ride down a river in Georgia (because \\"it's there\\") and what they encounter along the way. That's briefly as I can give without telling you what exactly happens. But none of them come out the same from the weird experience. It depicts the \\"genetic deficiencies\\" of mountain people (or hillbillies, not Beverly Hillbillies). These grotesque people along the river pop out and in one horrific scene, make Ned Beatty \\"squeal like a pig\\". The movie is a must see and a must buy for any film buff..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliverance: Reality or fiction?","review":"One of the best actors of his generation, John Voight started out bigtime in John Boorman's frightening tale Deliverance in 1972. Alongside him there was Burt Reynolds, giving the only really good performance of his career, backed up by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. The film starts out with four ordinary men driving up into the mountains to find a river, soon to be erased to give room to a future lake. On the way they run into locals who obviously have a much different view at life. A true nightmare is about to begin when our four friends set out on their canoe trip. This film is still one of the most thrilling and well-acted movies of all time, nothing like anything you have ever seen. Strange that none of the actors received oscar nominations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great film.

Beware buying this!!! It is not a blu-ray print. My original dvd looks better than this. What a rip off! I am going to write Warner Bros a letter about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one","review":"This movie is worth getting for the banjo duel alone.You'll swear that hilly-billy boy is no actor but some genuine in-bred genius they found in the mountains.The film moves in and out of juxtapositions between civilization and wilderness.Great acting and riveting throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars for 4 damn good performances","review":"I'm not surprised that a bunch of the following reviews make reference to the \\"Ned Beatty scene\\". I'd like go a different direction and comment that it's Burt Reynold's only good role (No, Boogie Nights doesn't count). We've seen Ronny Cox in other films, but his character, while subtle at first, becomes an unfortunate pivotal role to the film. Reynolds as the tough guy, ends up taking the back seat to Jon Voight, who brilliantly becomes our only source of survival. (What about Voight's mountainside bow & arrow sequence? I had to watch it twice to get what happened). Hellish scenes, and nightmarish visions make this doomed canoe trip an amazing study of human behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary","review":"This movie, though in itself isn't a scary scary movie, it's a scary idea that will make anyone shiver. The thought of being raped by another man jsut makes me go insane so I would never...never venture into west Virginia. The whole banjo playing was just perfect. I advise anyone who has a strong stomach to watch this...and if you don't watch it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Movie","review":"I origionaly saw this film after seeing Wrong Turn and injoying that.When I bought this I was expecting a low budget horror film having not known about before.Wow this film is sooooooooo good its was what I was expecting in the sence of a creepy thriller but it NOT low budget and its NOT gory.If you want the story read another review I just want to say if you love good action suspence movies this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense that Hitchcock would be proud of.","review":"This movie does for weekend camping trips what \\"Jaws\\" did for swimming in the ocean! Not since \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" has there ever been such a suspenseful powerful film about a group of men facing unique and desperate situations. The first time you watch this will have you on the edge of your seat and cringing in fear. Afterwards you will watch it several times to study the human element and how the strengths and weaknesses of each personality affects the tide of events. Even at the end of the journey, you couldn't breathe a sigh of relief. When the wily sheriff starts grilling Ned Beatty and Jon Voight about details, your heart leaps into your throat once again. The famous \\"love scene\\" will rivet in your mind forever and have you consider investing in a quality firearm or three for any woodland excursion! This film should've swept the Academy Awards as it was top-notch in every area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good. Creepy.","review":"Scary stuff. Stay away from the hill people.

Monologues interrupt (or are laid over) the music, distracting the listener. The final track, for example, has Buckethead playing a beautiful piece of music while someone describes construction of \\"Bucketheadland\\" out of the monorail window. It's okay the first time, and annoying after that.Still, if you like Buckethead, you should get this one. If you haven't heard him before, start with Monsters & Robots, Electric Tears, and Colma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skills","review":"This cd is not of the highest quality recording wise. However the talent of Buckethead and others involved in this cd are well worth the price. If you're a Star Wars head the themes alone should make up the cost.

Not only have I never heard any performance of the Bach solo violin sonatas and partitas that compares with Milstein's, but I find it impossible to listen to this performance without the experience that Milstein is playing them directly as they exist(ed) in the mind of God or of Bach, depending on what you believe in. The performance is transparent: you don't even notice that a human being is technically performing the pieces, there is just direct communion between you and the music. An awesome achievement on Milstein's part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too pretty to give away!","review":"I originally purchased this as a gift, but when I opened the little blue box, I could not bear to part with it!

Of the 41 chapters on the DVD, there are 5, and that includes the closing credits, that'd I'd want to see again, all excellent musical numbers. A movie can't be all bad that has Eric Clapton and B.B. King on guitar.On the other hand, a movie can't be called good that has a plot that defines contrived, 4 real actors in a cast of dozens, indifferent cinematography, lazy direction, and John Goodman in the place of John Belushi. It is an insult to the memory of the hallowed original that this movie was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"You guys had 18 years.All you can think of is this rehash.","review":"BB2000 is pathetic.There is not one laugh in the entire thing.Maybe a chuckle at the part where Elwood visits Cab for the first time but that's about it.The movie thinks that just because we saw the original 18 years ago we'd forget all the humor and laugh at it again and think its completley original.John your cheating us.The only thing that saves it is the music and the acting.The performers were really top notch.But really what was the point of the kid?For Elwood to be a hero to excon's single fathers everywhere?speaking of Elwood,Dan Akroyd did not look like he was having that much in this.The first one you could tell he was having fun but here he just acts bored.There could have been a more original plot here.What about if their was a prequel and you had somebody young to play Elwood and somebody young to play Jake.Or since music is the only rodeming quality,why not just make a concert film?Good idea no."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as they'd have you believe","review":"OK, So this isn't as good as the first film. And how could it compare to a classic. But it's actually one of the best sequels of any great film.Yes, the story is ludicrous, but it does still amuse. But in truth, the entire film is really just an excuse for linking great musical sets together.The music IS magnificent. (The acting is awful, but since most of the cast are professional singers rather than professional actors it isn't really surprising.)If anything the film is more of a homage to the original, taking everything (car chases, ridiculous plot) to the extreme. If you don't like the film the first time, watch it again. You might be surprised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Comic Classic, But Lots of Fun","review":"If you weren't so obsessed with comparing this to the first movie... that was, of course, a classic. Still, this is fun, and much better than I expected. when I heard John Goodman, I nearly cringed, but he was pretty damn good. The movie also made good use of \\"the kid,\\" not going the cutesy route. How can this be labeled a rip-off when the original creators (aside from one dead one) helmed the project? Lighten up... save sacreligious comments for the retards who are religious focused. This was simply a fun sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't regret this purchase","review":"I can't say that this is the best movie ever made, but it is certainly one of the best. The plot and the musical shows go hand in hand, and combination of Dan Aykroyd and John Goodman is quite successful (Although I have to admit, that Belushi was a much better match for Aykroyd)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, silly, but still fun!","review":"There are a lot of negitave reviews for this movie so I wanted to add my 2 cents worth. Yes this movie is no Citizen Cane. It isn't even an fantastic as the original Blues Brothers. What it is though is fun. Aside from the returning stars from the first movie you have a new assorted cast that includes some musical greats. The musical sequences are toe-tapping good. The final scenes and the credits are a great treat. Watch this movie if you understand that it's not Academy award winning material, just an hour or so of silly fun. Dan Akroyd still rocks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Music, Sloppy Movie","review":"I have to give some credit to this movie for its grand music at the end. Otherwise, though, its fairly bland. The story lacks the ingenious humor of the original and John Belushi is badly missed. Elwood then loses something because he now has to take the front role, thus losing his monotone quality that was so much a part of his character in the first film. This battle of the bands, however, is a real plus. Seeing B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Charlie Musselwhite etc. on stage together was thrilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music Bad movie","review":"The music is good in this movie, but I barly got through the movie.

I admit it is nowhere near the legendary status of the first film, nothing ever could be. But it's funny, has great music and is generally a good 90 odd minutes of fun. What's wrong with that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for grocery store and eleveator music fans","review":"I LOVE this movie. If you like comedy and R&B you can't miss this flick. If you went to a Catholic school as a kid (as I did), well then consider this homework, or humor therapy, your choice. The line up of significant musician treasures is unbelievable, B.B. King, Lou Rawls, Eric Clapton, Aretha good God the list goes on and on at that 1st class level. Check it out! Anyone who reviews this movie less than five stars has some sort of perception impairment. If you have the blues, this movie will cure what ails you. Not recommended for serious grocery store and eleveator music fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great follow up to the blockbuster \\"The Blues Brothers\\"","review":"Blues Brothers 2000 has many of the same great types of scenes that The Blues Brothers has. Great car chases, police car pile-ups, and music that will have you tapping your feet all the way to the end of the movie. Most of the original cast appear in this movie, which makes it even better. Personally, I enjoyed this movie more than the first. John Goodman is a great addition to this movie. And you know?

The star of this movie is not John Goodman, or Dan Akyroid, it's the little boy, whose name I can't figure out on the credits. His dance on the counter in that scene when John Goodman and Dan Akroyd (spelling?) makes the whole movie fantastic. And Aretha Franklin's RESPECT! WOW! Another dynmite song to dance to!

But Blues Brothers 2000? Well, the replacements for John Belushi fall very short. The plot is awful. The story doesn't hold together.The one thing going for it is the amount of musicians introduced. If the original movie brought 8 or 9 musicians to mass appeal, this introduced 15. Unfortunately, it was all in a monster jam at the end.You're better off just buying the sound track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, really.","review":"You know that guy you know who keeps telling the same joke over and over again because he either forgot he already told you, or he doesn't realize how it loses its charm after each re-telling? Imagine he has a multi-million dollar budget to make a movie because he told a funny joke 20 years ago.That's the Blues Brothers 2000.This movie seems to have been made for no other reason than to bolster Dan Aykroyd's insistent, sad delusion that he's a blues singer, and to make a soundtrack with a bunch of legendary musicians. Noble aims, poor outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next to no plot, but great music","review":"I know \\"The Blues Brothers\\" was a better movie, but I still don't think this movie was so bad. It takes place 18 years after the Blues Brothers got arrested for wrecking Chicago. Elwood Blues is on his own now that his brother Jake has died, but nonetheless embarks on another \\"Mission from God\\", and once again attempts to put the band back together. It's not as funny as the original because of John Belushi not being in it, but I think John would have been proud of the music. I thought the music was the backbone of this production and that the artists did very well. Plus, how can anybody be against bringing the original cast back, like Aretha Franklin and James Brown? I'm thrilled that they agreed to this. All in all, I think it's a good movie that shouldn't have been panned by the critics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"Not the original and definitely not as good but, you've GOT to have it if you're a fan of the Blue & the Blues Brothers.

I went to see it when it came out. The only good part of this movie was the dedication to three members of the original cast who have died. There is no real new plot, horrible acting, and the story is so fake the writers of the script must need a refresh in how to write one. This movie is one the worst I ever seen! Grade:F"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Had The Blues Watching This One","review":"Just not the same. . .with Belushi gone, and Goodman trying to be a substitute. Even the Queen of Soul couldn't top the performance she gave in the earlier film. Some laughs, but very little of the magic. There was a gag about how Elwood parks his car that was done too many times; it was funnier in the first film. And what was up with adding a kid to the mix? The surprise for me was hearing Joe Morton sing. He's actually pretty good! If you do watch this one, stick around after the end credits to catch a performance by James Brown (who's STILL the man, by the way)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues Galore!","review":"This film is basically the same as the first movie from the 80s, but you've *got* to have it because of the music.

Good Cast, bad movie.","review":"I cannot understand how people gave a 5 start rating to this movie. Especially if you compare the whole thing with the original blues brothers... Good sound and music, lots of stars, but the jokes are all the same, the story is boring and not funny. Too much based on Dan Aykroyd, who appears to have lost his Elwood spirit (eats hamburgers etc.). I think the last 15-20 minutes of the film was fine(the song contest) and it was thrilling to see all those blues giants jam together. The rest of the movie belongs to the trash can. I'd recommend you to buy the superb soundtrack rather than watching this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to the late John Belushi","review":"It is mind boggling that Dan Aykroyd who helped create the original Blues Brothers would wait almost 20 years to produce a sequel of this caliber.I waited till BB 2000 came out on video and watched it. I was dumfounded! I did not laugh at anything. I was waiting for a scence that would at least make me snicker but to no avail.Right at the scence when the Dan and John were in the river in their car as a submarine I could not take it anymore. I stopped the tape, rewound it, put it back in its cover and returned it the next day.I will not watch it again! This movie is an insult to anybody who loved the original and John Belushi should come back to haunt Dan Aykroyd from the grave for attempting to pass this off as a sequel.The original Blues Brothers was the funniest thing Dan Aykroyd ever did (apart from SNL) and nothing he has done since has been even remotely funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"a very bad film is the best way to sum up this mess.nothing works at all.what seemed cool 20 years back is at best a Spoof.the music is so-so at best.skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great!!!","review":"I watched this movie, then I rewound it and watched it again.

Shame on you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great music review","review":"Like the first Blues Brothers flick, this film offers lots of car chases/wrecks, lots of fantastic production numbers from the stars of R&B, and a major dose of silliness. The focused energy and star quality of Belushi isn't found in 2000 but the music from the guest stars is better in the new movie. The biggest mistake was focusing on Akroyd's low-key character which works as second banana but not as the lead role. Like the first film, the reputation of Blues Brothers 2000 will improve with age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying but not filling","review":"So I have rented the movie once, saw it once, but right after I rented it I went out and bought the soundtrack, but not the movie. So that sums it up for the movie, the music is great, especially if you like blues/R&B (The Gator Boys 'Dream Team' band at the end is especially memorable). But the movie itself is just so-so. The villains are not as fun as the original. I prefer the Good Ole Boys, The illinois nazi and even the guy who played X in the X-files to the Russians, but still, the music makes the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"As a Blues Brothes Fan...I'm [Peeved]!!!!! This Movie STINKS","review":"After waiting a good portion of my life to see the long awaited sequal, My heart sank to my feet at the cheesy plot, stupid jokes, and the fact that as an Illinoisan, you could easily tell that they were not in Chicago. I took the video out and threw it against the wall shortly after seeing the rediculous bluesmobile turned submarine scene. John Belushi, John Candy and Cab Calloway deserved much better. Some say the music was great...as a musician, the music in this movie doesn't compare to the quality blues of the first movie- WAY over produced. DO NOT BUY THIS [BAD] USELESS EXCUSE FOR A FILM."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is A Pathetic Movie","review":"If Blues Brothers 2000 were made as a documentary about the Blues Brothers or a documentary about the musicians in the movie, then I might've given it some stars, but, as a movie, this is a horrible, pathetic, feeble attempt to recreate the magic of the first film, which is a near perfect comedy. If there were an \\"E.T.\\" part II, it would probably suck as bad as BB 2000. Certain movies should not be tainted with sequeals. This movie has animation! What audience was this movie created for? If I wanted to see a film strictly about blues performances and blues legends I'll rent a documentary. Blues Brothers is about the characters and this poor excuse for a movie has none of the elements that made the original such an excellent movie. If you have never seen it and are a fan of the Blues Brothers please do not buy it, it will destroy your image of Elwood and \\"the band.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"PA-Thetic","review":"Oh my GOD this Movie was pathetic....How the HELL the same Writers and the same Director as the Original film could put out this piece of trash is just completly beyond me.

Elwood wants to get the band together again(Doesn't the idiot remember what trouble it got tham all into 18 years ago?), only this time its harder because they all have lives and careers of their own, and after taking 10-year-old Orphan, Buster, under his wing, the police think Buster was kidnapped and are hot on Elwood's trail.A highly predictable movie. The only reason it rates 2 stars is because Dan Akyroyd is in it, and the songs are still funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like rythm & blues you will love this movie.","review":"The plot to this movie is basicly the same as the first, the acting is fair, but the music is fantastic.

Jake","review":"Elwood Blues(Dan Aykroyd) is back,but with a different partner,Jake's brother(John Goodman). John Belushi died in 1982 of a drug overdose in Los Angeles. So,his character of Jake was killed as well. Many fans imagined John's brother James would resume the role of Jake. In 1997,ABC pulled the plug on Goodman's Emmy-winning sitcom Roseanne after a nine-season run. A short time later,he and Aykroyd made this sequel to the 1980 hit movie. I don't believe the \\"2000\\" in the title was appropriate. It should have been \\"1998\\",since this film was theatrically released that year. This is another of those not-too-successful sequels. I loved it and thought the soundtrack was awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie made me physically ill","review":"I rented this movie back when it was a new release at Blockbuster. As I was laying on my futon, about halfway through, I became physically ill. I started to sweat, my stomach was aching, I felt like I was going to barf. I had to shut the movie off and go downstairs. I sat with my mom who was reading a magazine and I felt better. I can only assume that this movie was the cause of my ailments. I still have never seen the rest of the film, but from what I remember it was garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH","review":"I stopped the movie halfway thru when 'the band' is butchering 'Ghost Riders in the Sky', some cheap special effects of skeletal horses with ghost riders appear above the stage, and Aykroid activates and summons the blues mobile with a remote control device aka batmobile(the blues mobile can also drive underwater). The only good thing about this movie is it does have a lot of the original cast, but that does not save this film from having horrible acting, dialogue (compare the two Aretha Franklin scenes from both movies as an example), storyline (get the band together and raise money-wow-what an original idea!) and even singing. The choice of songs are moronic at times: the call-in dating service and the 'lookin for a fox' at the strip club come to mind. Truly, this is a bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Belushi is spinning in his grave!","review":"If you loved the first film, because it was so much more than just another slapstick, you'll hate this for exactly the same reason.

All the charm and good feeling of the first film are nowhere to be found here. It is replaced by soul-less Disney blues and badly delivered 'jokes' that even Bob Hope would have turned down.

All involved should hang their heads in shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS, SUCKS, SUCKS","review":"Being the huge Blues Brothers fan that I am, I was INCREDIBLY disapppointed when I saw this movie. All I have to say is that the script to this sequel should have been left on a director's shelf to collect dust. Not only is it impossible to recreate the magic that Belushi brought to the first, but it looks like Dan Akroyd's acting has gotten worse and is not as nimble and light on his feet as he once was!I'm convinced that John Landis has just lost all common sense when it comes to making movies.

I've seen 2 videos on MTV2 (which I think is kind of better because I hate how MTV plays their channel, too many programs, barely any music!). The two were Clint Eastwood from the other album, and 19/2000, the soulchild remix. Take this piece of advice though, you WILL hate track number 3, because: it's 7 minutes long, it is just a bunch of music, nothing too neat, and it has the worst variation of the original 19/2000. I think the only song that can possibly be the reason for the parental advisory would have to be track 6. I heard stoned and a lot of reference of effects from drugs. Otherwise, this CD is pretty good, but with 9 tracks and 30-some minutes, it's not as good as it could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to a Gorillaz collection","review":"G-Sides is a cd with mostly songs that had been released with hard to find singles of the hit songs. It has two remixes of 19-2000, the first one (the Soulchild remix) being extremely good with a up beat groove, the second one being the worst song on the cd. Latin Simone in english is a treat to hear. The Sounder and Clint Eastwood Remix are two songs by Phi Life, and are both very good, even for someone who doesn't like most traditional rap. One of the best songs is Ghost Train, which actually has the feel of moving on a very fast, and haunting, train. Don't overlook Faust though, because about 2:30 into the song, Noodle starts singing in Japanese, which I was thrilled to hear, being a very big J-Pop fan. The cd ends nicely with 12D3, a very mellow song, much like Brother from the first cd.

The sound is typical of the period and generally rather good. As one of the major violinists of the century, Milstein delivers excellent mainstream performances of the concerti. Milstein's Dvorak concerto is THE classic performance of this work (he recorded it twice in 1959 and 1965)-- this collection contains the earlier version. The other concerti are fine as well. If you love great violin playing, you should like this collection. If you are a specific admirer of Milstein, then you must have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"To me, Milstein was the greatest violinist of the twentieth century. He was a great technical player and was an eqauly good muscian. I love his playing! He plays most of the great violin concertos and plays them beuatifully. His recordings of the Brahms, the Tchaikovsky, the Beethoven, Saint-Saens 3, an Introduction and Tarantelle are my favorites. This CD is pricey, but at least put it on your Christmas list.

But the low stars goes for the mean spiritedness in this family. The low rent sister-in-law maybe a greedy gold digger but please--who said the children should pay for the mother's sins. The scathing treatment of the children is horrible. They are treated like her low rent offspring when they are also half the so called upper crust brother's. The upper crust brother who drinks, gambles and won't even buy a proper home to house his ever increasing clan. Even a new born baby is condemned as a devil's minion--no wonder they turn out 'witchy' when their own daddy showers more attention on the nephew and they get treated like dirt from the get-go. Grandmother has no trouble handing over $50,000 to her spoiled son w/o question but thinks Frances Mae is greedy for wanting more room for her children. I want to get to know these people.

I was severely disappointed with this book. I think after reading the back cover it seemed interesting enough. But when the story goes on and on about nothing really that striking, I kept wondering when it would ever end. The writing was hoping to be humourous, but slightly missing the mark. The foreshading was too obvious, and the characters stereotypical. I think perhaps it would have been an ok read if there wasn't so much filler in between the story. I couldn't make it to the end.

The characters are so memorable and I found myself thinking about them even when I wasn't reading the book. I know they will make for great discussion. I may have been born in the north but I must have a southern soul. Having been to the Charleston area several times it was great fun to be able to relate to many of the places identified in the book.

The sound issue is a significant problem since it would mean you are unable to view this outstanding movie. Jean Reno is amazing.

It was seriously under-rated in the USA, probably because of the erratic story (you have to see the Director's Cut to understand fully) and the sexual imagery of Mathilda, which most of the critics misunderstood.

As is the case with so many \\"uncut\\" versions of films, the scenes cut out of the original US release of The Professional are best left on the editing room floor. The added scenes both disrupt the flow of the film AND make Leon seem like a borderline pedafile.

He convulses and his body rejects them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Encourages a fantasy that doesn't need to be encouraged.","review":"This movie dresses and grooms a 12-year-old girl as a sex object instead of a child and then portrays her characters as having strong sexual desires for an unattractive middle aged man. People seem to say this is \\"OK\\" because the film \\"Isn't about that\\" and because \\"the middle aged character continues to reject her sexual advances.\\" I say, look at the implications. This film implies that there are beautiful pre-pubescent girls who have a strong sexual desires for gone-to-seed middle aged men.

The way Leon gets into the police HQ and shoots around is ridiculous ..I thought such stuff was only NEO's ( as in the MATRIX) preserve. The only redeeming aspects are the last shootout in the hotel and the villain when he pops his pill and cranes his neck .. man that is creepy.

Italian assassin. Plus the extra footage that was taken out for the American release is actually meaningful (not an extra 10 mins of them walking in a park or something).Also the relationship between Natalie Portman's character and Jean Reno's is very interesting. It could be seen simply as a guy protecting a helpless young girl and child's infatuation for a cool older guy, but it has this eerie-ness to it that you just can't shake. I really like that.If you've never seen the movie before, you should definitely check this movie out. If you've seen the American version and liked it, definitely get this one -- the extra footage is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE","review":"This movie is a phenomenal piece of work.

He does manage to create some exciting action-packed sequences, and does create a credible relationship between Portman and Reno, but he ultimately leans to the mushy sentimentality that he avoided in his earlier films. Jean Reno is great as the lovable milk-drinking hitman. Natalie Portman gives an astonishing performance that may well be her best. The film has surprising sexual undercurrents, the 'lolita' kind. Gary Oldman is way over the top but he does create a fun merciless character. A worthy effort, but could of been better.

I was previously unaware of the existence of the extra footage until lately. I own both versions on DVD and can honestly say that the extra 24 minutes missing from the US version, while not necessary to the plot, were fantastic, and added to the richness of the film. Overall, I feel that Leon is much more likable (and capable!) in this version. If you're trying to decide which one to get, I believe this one is far superior to the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes!!!","review":"i, too, saw & fell in love with the american version. i bought it vhs & dvd and now, i own the director's cut. oh yes! much much better!! fuller, much more rounded out. the subject material that was cut is more risqué, yes, but worth it. natalie portman gives an incredible performance, as does Mr. Reno, and Mr. Oldman is spectacular as always. you just can't take your eyes away when oldman is onscreen. this film takes an american action formula and pumps it up with euro emotion, daring, and bravado. the extra footage may dance dangerously close to taboo (here in america) but you have to credit director luc besson in going for it. particularly enjoyable is the dinner scene where mathilda professes her \\"love\\" for leon and gets drunk. let's see MORE european/director's cuts of these great films!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leon just got better","review":"I've always loved this movie (as well as most movies by Luc Besson) since I saw it back in '93.

It's great to see it on Blu-ray at last. The glue that holds the film together is the relationship between Leon and Matilda but Gary Oldman steals the show with a wonderfully OTT performance as the corrupt cop on their tail.There are some great special features on the disc too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leon the Professional","review":"This movie is definitely a classic. It touches on the sadistic in a naive way and quite acceptable in Luc Besson's native French culture (according to his girlfriend anyway). The only gripe I have is that like The Big Blue, I much prefer the edited version. It's amazing how editors can get it so right. A fabulous film - Gary Oldman is a master at his craft and I love Jean Reno as the emotionally immature 'cleaner'. Natalie Portman in her first big role and its a tough role to follow. Haven't seen her in a movie after this one where her talent is able to come to the fore as much as in this one. One of the most noticeable exclusions in the bonus material is Luc Besson himself. I also would have loved to see an interview with Gary Oldman and a feature on Eric Serra the composer. The bonus material has made me want to check out La Femme Nikita where it all began."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth watching.","review":"An interesting and endearing film revolving around the unlikely match-up of a professional killer and a beautiful young girl with some MAJOR family problems. Jean Reno does a wonderful job of under-acting as the cold, stony \\"hit-man\\" who is unwittingly and unwillingly dragged into the troubles of a young innocent whose life is about to be ruined by some crooked cops. These two produce such magic on screen together, that you can almost forgive Gary Oldman his psychotic over-acting as the prime bad-guy. The action scenes are both original and believable: genuine edge-of-the-seat stuff. Director Luc Besson finds a nice balance between the drama of human interaction and the fast-paced action of a great thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all around","review":"Good quality DVD and excellent movie. I wasn't sure what to expect from the uncut version (I love the American releaseof \\"The Professional\\"), but I think the added material does enhance the movie. It's rather embarrassing to think that the rest of world got \\"Leon\\" and we got the \\"babied\\" version. There's nothing objectionable here."},{"rating":"2","title":"great film, uncut version better.","review":"If your going to buy Leon/the Professional you should get the Uncut international version, it is better. I can see why so much was cut from the domestic US release. It was cut to fit into the action movie category and so they wouldn't have to worry about all the overly sensetive prudes in America. Granted it is a great action movie, but thats just the background through which the stories focus occurs, which is the relationship and sexual tension between Leon and Matilda(a very young girl) played by Portman(the best acting she's ever done).There have been enough reviews on this, I'll cut to the simplified chase. Combine Nabokov's Lolita (their relationship)and the Terminator (for action), sounds like a great flick to me, and it was. This version restores the movie, the previous versions are watered down for the American Audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleaning for a Living","review":"Jean Reno is Leon, a genuine Italian hitman with a sleazy wardrobe, a gun case, and a cheap apartment, who does \\"cleaning\\" tasks for the boss. He lives down the hall from teen Mathilda (Natalie Portman) whose family is brutally murdered in their apartment by a corrupt police squad led by psycho chief detective Stansfield (Gary Oldman) after her father fails to return stolen drugs. Leon, having witnessed the crime through a keyhole, then comforts Natalie and allows her to stay with him and the two develop a relationship that becomes an unlikely partnership of vengence.Reno and Portman deliver excellent performances, but it is Oldman who provides the needed offbeat sadism in his character that adds to the film's intensity and makes the story work. Before a raid, the stressed Stansfield pops a few amphetamines and appears to go into a trance while imagining a triumphant symphony as the battle ensues. The Professional is a unique and enjoyably satisfying violent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Combination","review":"The Professional represents a very rare synthesis of heartfelt drama with searing action with emotional undercurrents. The music is perfect for this movie and only adds to the emotional intensity, expect standout performances from all castmembers and a great job of direction by Luc Besson. YOU WILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE....."},{"rating":"2","title":"the professional","review":"I still don't know why I love this movie so much. I am by nature a very calm sort of peaceful person, never in a million years I would have wasted money in renting a violent movie let alone buying it! But this movie really goes beyond violence. In fact, the violence aspect is only a facade for a most intrinsic and pure message: Love germinate in all enviroment no matter how harsh or hostile the environment is. And what's more it's cleverly done so by the outstanding acting of Portman, Reno and Oldman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVD and Movie","review":"5 star review for the movie/DVD.The DVD has a great picture quality, since we do get the Superbit version.We also get a DTS and Dolby 5.1 surround sound tracks, which is awesome.My only nit pick is, my order did not come with the slip case, but I'm okay with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This movie is so much better then the U.S. version. Leon who cared for no one, became the caretaker for orphaned Mathilda and grew to love and protect her as his daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll never watch the theatrical version again!!","review":"I'm not sure what it says about me but \\"The Professional\\" is one of my favorite movies. I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't know there was an extended/European version till now. The \\"extra\\" footage does an excelent job of providing more back story and character development. The extra Mathilda materiel changes the whole movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best film ever, but...","review":"... you haven't seen it unless you saw the Director's Cut. Just forget about the normal US Version, there are about twenty minutes missing. Only in the Director's Cut you'll see the whole story... and it is absolutely fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I love these calm little moments before the storm\\"","review":"I can't agree more with the customer reviews...INCREDIBLE!! This movie exemplifies everything cinema is lacking today. Flawed characters you actually care about, villains that are so unpredictable they actually scare you, beautiful camera shots, and I could go on and on. Bravo Mr.Besson an instant classic BUT in a world where viewers are impressed with the same old good guys vs. bad guys, this movie will probably get passed over like many others. Watch it or you're missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow what acting!","review":"How did I miss the film when it came out? The acting was great. The young girl gave performance that I would expect from a much more mature person. The plot was different than anything I can remember. The opening got my attention, and I was surprised with what followed. I also love NYC, so the setting made it all the more ejnoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"Awesome movie.. a bit old but entertaining and exhilarating for its time.

It came promptly=---reliable seller. I think this movie has natalie portman, plalying as a young girl. Superb acting. Natalie is an amazing actress. This movie should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Buy","review":"To be honest this is the best Blu-Ray purchase I have made. This is one of my all time favorite films and I can honestly say this version made it even better. There is tons of extra footage here and it adds so much more depth to the story. The extended version develops the characters more and helps sync the events that take place. For the price this movie is offered for on here there is no reason any one with a Blu-Ray player should not have a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 1080p version of one of the best films in existence.","review":"There is nothing I can say about the content of this movie that has not been said before. It is my favorite movie (and I consider myself a film buff); It has amazing action, amazing character development, amazing act, just amazing everything. The Blu-Ray version itself is good. For a movie that is 15+ years old, the remastering is fairly well done, though of course putting it up against the likes of new films like District 9 in glorious 1080p will make you see the overall graininess of it. Nonetheless, it certainly suffices.Important thing to note: This has BOTH the US theatrical version AND the International version (with the ~20 minutes of extra scenes included). This is GREAT because now you don't have to choose only one version; you get both.The 10 year retrospective documentary on this is also fairly enlightening and interesting for fans of the film/fiction.If you haven't seen this movie and you own a Blu-ray player, buy it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rest Of The Story","review":"The additional 24 minutes of footage make this movie finally come together for the viewer.The scene of Tony's first face to face meeting with Mathilda , (glaringly absent from the first U.S. version)make one see how she could approach him with familiarity later.The restored scenes of Leon training Mathilda (in the use of firearms), and going on \\"cleaning\\" jobs, lends credibility to her having the idea she could take on the DEA. And so on, and so on.I considered it a excellent film before,but it is much more coherent and understandable with the re-insertion of the missing scenes.******(6 Stars)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing film, great edition.","review":"Leon: The Professional is a great film. It is a fantastic action film that goes beyond that. The relationship between Leon and Mathilda is not only sweet but real, and you have no choice but to care for these characters.Gary Oldman is terrifi, as usual. Not only terrific, but terrifying. He is the ultimate bad guy.The sets, the music, the performances, the effects, the direction... Leon is one of those few films in which everything seems to fit.This DVD edition has a really good transfer. It is obviously the extended cut, which is far better than the US theatrical release. It is a two disc edition with some nice extras. Not as many as one would hope, but good ones anyway.I would strongly recommend buying this Deluxe edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouststanding movie","review":"This movie will easily become one the greatest if not the greatest movie ever made.Natalie Portman's and Jean Reno's acting in Leon are beyond superlatives. Acting at this level really blurs fiction with reality; Mathilda and Leon in this film where no longer acting but really living it.Rating this masterpiece using other great movies as a yardstick is like trying to compare Einstein's equations on General Relativity to an accountant's meaningless columns of numbers. They are simply not in the same universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT","review":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE. GARY OLDMANS PERFORMANCE IS INTENSE.

It's the same as Face/off. It seems that in most movies the SWAT officers just run into the situation, guns a blazin' without any planning or care for innocents.

By the time I got around to having time to sit down and watch the movie I was well past the available return date for Amazon purchases.The Blu-ray has NO WORKING ENGLISH track available during the movie - the sound works fine for all the bonus / special features, but during the actual movie - playback will not play in English. Yes, my Blu-Ray player is up to date; yes, I've tried all the various other settings available - it's the disc. The English Audio track was not properly copied onto this disc. And no one will take responsibility for replacement. Not Amazon, not Sony ...What a waste of money!I certainly won't be purchasing Blu-Ray movies from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disgrace -- thank you, \\"Hollywood\\"","review":"The \\"geniuses\\" who manage Sony Pictures have yet again demonstrated their utter contempt for American film watchers. This time they excised 23 minutes of vital scenes from the movie while remastering it in Blu-ray format.Either they think we are all \\"Bible-thumpers\\" incapable of handling fictional adult themes or they think we are so stupid that we will purchase first this heavily-censored version and then in six months be happy to purchase a second Blu-ray version containing the actual movie Luc Besson shot.Boycott this version! But definitely buy the 133 minute one when it is released in high definition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Professional","review":"I watched this movie yesterday after 3 years and I fell in love with the movie. It was a very thrilling movie, you want to know each moment what would happen next. I truly understood the depth of the relationship between Matilda and Leon, which I failed to when I saw the movie 3 years ago. It was a very touching relationship.I enjoyed watching the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When you need the job done right...hire the professional","review":"Luc Besson did a great job with this film as he written and directed it himself. I think this is his best film yet and Jay Reno plays the perfect role as the italian hit man. The film is very entertaining and the action was excellent. I think the best part was the swat raid on Leon's place. The action gets intense and it's realistic and not like one guy with a pistol taking out everyone with fully-autos in which they all shoot and still can't hit him. Words can't really describe the movie as you need to watch it yourself to see how it is. Its rarely that i'll give a movie such a high rating but with the good acting, great action and excellent story line you can't go wrong with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, inadequate DVD","review":"I'm frustrated by the lack of extra content on DVDs and the Professional is right in there with the worst offenders. How I would have loved to watch an interview with Luc Besson or Jean Reno or Natalie Portman discussing the movie. All you get is the trailer. Granted the sound and video quality on this disc are very, very good, but when you've got such a rich medium, it begs to be put to use. Example: the Apollo 13 DVD and The Matrix DVDs are both are best of breed and top anything I've seen to date"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie!","review":"This is a classic. Natalie Portman in an amazing debut, Jean Reno and Gary Oldman are unforgettable.Be sure to get this extended version of this movie. It's far better than the theatrical version."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME!","review":"I bought this movie about a week ago, although I had never seen it before. After I watched it with a friend, I just sat there and said to myself, \\"wow\\". THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN! Jean Reno is absolutely fantastic and Nathalie Portman is unbelievably mature for her age. Leon is so gripping, so fascinating, so cleverly made that I'm surprised it hasn't gained more publicity than it already has. Please watch this. It will change your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"Objectively speaking this movie probably doesn't *quite* deserve 5 stars -- there are a few awkward moments and some minor aspects that could've been improved upon. But I like it too much to give it less. It's an over-the-top film with a subtley surreal quality (the story is too far-fetched to be credible, but too well done to be dismissed in its given context), and a solid sense of character development. Film builds in adventure and emotion into a truly entertaing, gripping, and heart-wrenching climax. Very worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Luc Besson's best if not THE best","review":"\\"The Professional\\" is a thoroughly professional production in every respect. Great directing, superb casting, absorbing and original story, splendid photography and musical score - plenty of believable tense situations. Oldman is out of this world as the mad, drug-sodden corrupt cop. High-class violence all the way. Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leon thrilling, daring","review":"I'm a hug fan of Luc Besson and have always enjoyed his particular ability to put an ironic spin on the \\"Hollywood\\" movie.Leon is what? An action-thriller? A psychological-action-thriller? It defies easy description in part because Besson is so adept at molding the material - taking our expectations and turning them on their ear.For those who don't know, Natalie Portman made her film debut here, and her scenes with Jean Reno are unsettling, to say the very least. The film was criticized for its Lolita-like approach to this relationship, but understanding Besson's \\"deconstruction\\" of the sorts of relationships we expect to find in these movies is key.This is a great movie, made before Besson moved into his preoccuption with visual style (The Fifth Element, The Messenger), as good, if not better, than La Femme Nikita."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very ugly looking Blu-ray transfer.","review":"First of all: I love this movie. It should have received a much better treatment than it has now. The standard DVD was by no means perfect. The Blu-ray is awful. Image contrast has been boosted to ridiculous heights, leaving no detail in any tone slightly lighter than a midtone. So as soon as daylight enters the picture: shadow areas stay and the rest dissolves into a white, bleached out glare...Sony should be forced to rerelease!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"Thanks for the great deal and the quick, fast shipment. The item arrived, gently used and all in tact. It was great doing business with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leon DVD better than expected","review":"Seller shipped within 48 hours. However, seller would not give any discount for multiple DVD purchases. You do not save any money the more DVDs you buy from this seller. The DVD is listed as used yet worked as if brand new.The DVD itself is EXCELLENT. We haven't seen this movie in a few years, however it was like watching it for the first time since it contained extra scenes in the movie that must have been deleted on the DVD from many years ago. It is worth getting the deluxe edition. There are 2 discs, one with extras, including interviews with the actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong DVD great movie! BUY THE ORIGINAL!","review":"Most people have seen this version, but it is the severely edited American edition. The real name of this movie is 'Leon' (sometimes with 'The Professional' tagged as a subtitle) and has 26 minutes of footage that was cut from the American edition.

This version not so happy with, since it was 'extended cut' (and not identified as such on case), and felt that giggly restaurant scene and more bedroom talk were wholly unnecessary. Sooo, triple dip came in form of $7.99 blu (BBuy), which has both theatrical and uncut versions (also same extras as 'deluxe' dvd), and nicer picture, though not 'reference' quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Professional","review":"This is what you call a Sleeper Movie and a feel good movie.

In comparison, the added 24 minutes was well worth it. Only one problem with the DVD uncut version. The rear speakers when using DD 5.1 is muted or close to non-existent. The Dolby Pro-logic works fine though. The 1st DVD \\"The Professional\\" Cut version actually works fine using DD 5.1.Many other people on forums and newsgroups have reported this and is most likely an error during the mastering of the DVD.Other than the sound problem on the uncut version, it's a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"This film is one of my absolute favorites. I've never once watched it without being engrossed (and without crying, at least once). The international cut is far better, I think, than the one released here in the States. There are scenes that deepen the relationship between the two main characters and make you mourn the death of Jean Reno's character even more. Buy this film, this version. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leon - The Professional (Deluxe Edition)","review":"I couldn't believe it once i got home with my new dvd..watching this new Leon Deluxe Edition I began to notice new scenes.. Scenes where Matilda starting killing people.. she got drunk, tried to kiss Leon.. asked him for sex.. it was pretty full on and totally unexpected.. and not in any of the other Leon dvds i've seen.. (i have 2 previous versions).. I'd say there is 20 minutes at least more on this disc. The other special features are interesting too..So if you want to see some more, uncomfortable yet watchable scenes, do buy this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This DVD is the Euro Version which has missing footage from the USA version.It is amazingly clear as well this extra bit thing is impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies of all time...","review":"I got this thru Amazon Prime digital downloads. Its a great movie.. And the ending song is one of my favorites in a movie, the song that plays as the credits roll. I like a good movie sound track or just good music in movies.I dont like telling plots of movies, even online...lol. I guess I can say its an action, revenge type of movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Massively good movie, no DVD features...","review":"If you're looking for a fancy DVD with featurettes etc etc this is not the CD for you. OK, that's the only negative here. The extended version is WELL worth the price of admission for movie fans. Where as the American version was edited to become a shoot em up type film the European version focuses on the relationship of Leon and Matilda. And it does so in a wonderfull manner. The film is a much more satisfying experience this way, still inundated with the wild action scenes. Some might complain it slows the pace but I would disagree.Seeing the film in digital format is of course fantastic, and the Dolby 5.1 sounds fantastic. This is a DVD worth having simply for the movie itself, it really has a life of it's own with the added footage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found it.","review":"I looked in the local stores for this for a long time.

I'm a fan of both Reno and Danny Aiello but this film from the ridiculous beginning until I had to turn it off midway through was horrible.The meeting between Reno and Aiello at the beginning was childish; and the action sequnces where Reno acts like Spiderman and kills a good half dozen armed thugs was ludicrous.This film couldn't make up its mind as to whether it was a spoof of gangsters, or out and out sci-fi.Save yourself the time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy w/ the way I received DVD","review":"I am not happy w/ the way I received this DVD.

The movie is not a typical action movie. The plot develops far better than average, the cast develops the roles far better, and the directing is first rate. very much along the same lines as La Femme Nikita, also by Besson with a smaller role by Reno, the movie is moved along by its story, not by the explosions and the action on the screen. The hit-man with his tag-along child who decides to work for him to learn the skills to get revenge takes work to pull it off, and this movie does so in style. If you are not familiar with the films of Luc Besson, this is a great movie to start with. You may even decide to give The Fifth Element another shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bet on Besson","review":"Many people who watch this film will probably become life-long fans of both Luc Besson and Jean Reno.For the remainder, there must be very few who would feel disappointed that they bought it.This film works on so many levels, that you'll be talking about it afterwards for days. It's violent, touching, action-packed, delicate, provocative yet shallow.The change of tempo throughout the movie is the most striking directorial feature, and the one that will leave you begging for the next cut-scene at the finale. Fortunately Besson leaves it, as he usually does, without patronising his audience.Reno is simply frighteningly brilliant. Alternately wooden when out of his depth with his new protege, to fluid machine when within the role of assassin, his near one-man show carries the directorial tempo perfectly.Thoroughly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie Ever Made!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie was the greatest!!!!

This version goes in depth into the relationship between Leon and Matilda. It is now very clear the mutual love between the two. Maybe the editors thought the relationship was too much to go into in America, however the cut scenes add depth and understanding to a very awkward situation.There are other included scenes that address the professionalism of Leon. The inclusion of his training of Matilda make the scene at the DEA building more clear.In all the additional footage clears up some misunderstandings and add depth to the film. I wish all monumental films will come out with an uncut version. For the general audiance a cut film usually progresses the plot at the cost of character development. As far as this film and the hundreds of great films out there, show me what the director see's, not necessarily what the editor wants me to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time reading this author","review":"I found the descriptions of people/places/scenes just too descriptive and I'm more used to characterisations from GregBear/Peter F.

The best being the emotional struggle for the characters in the Bonander story which was affecting, and the wort being the utterly shallow and insipid writing of Small. The Small romance had no detail of plot, character, or circumstance. It was as if the elements were chosen at random from a Arabian mad-lib, and strung together with lots of adverbs. The love scenes were especially disappointing, with mechanical explainations of love acts, having no purpose other than to be \\"naughty\\". The Thea Devine story was a pleasant deviation from the tiresome girl-plotting-to-trap/impress-guy scenario, with compelling love scenes. One last thing; I didn't consider any of the men to be \\"Rogues\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Bertrice Small manages to save this book with her story, but just barely.

This is a huge technical error that I could not imagine any competent artist making. She does not use a reference, obviously, because the sun does not shine from two directions.There also seem to be very rushed in a formula driven manner without any stepping back to reflect and make necessary changes. She says you can paint a good painting quickly in half hour. Maybe she can do her method in that time, but a good painting takes time to reflect and change along the way. In my opinion, she does not take the time to see what she is creating.There are some palette knife techniques to pick up, but I would not buy this video for any other reasons.

However, with all the wonderful stories that Michael shared with us in his book I know I'm only closer to achieving that dream in the next few years.Thank you Michael and Ella for your wonderful book.Dana Provostand my lovely GreysRenoir, Cezanne, Sancerre and Paris"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about an exceptional dog and a fun trip","review":"I just finished reading \\"Ella in Europe\\" and I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed the travelogue and the word pictures of the places Mr. Konik visited but mostly I enjoyed the story about an exceptional canine companion. It is obvious that Mr. Konik saw deeper that the surface of the animal that became his best pal and was able to utilize her talents and uniqueness in a way that both she and those who came in contact with her had great benefit. Ella and he were \\"in sync\\" in a way that sadly many never experience with their pets and usually it is because we are too busy with life to really live it. Mr. Konik decided that he and Ella needed to take time to stop and smell the roses and the gourmet foods and fresh air as well as experiencing the sights and sounds of living. We are not all able to take a trip such as they did but we can vicariously do so through this little book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read!","review":"When was the last time you read a travel book which made you dig deep into your own emotions? This book is nothing short of brillant. It is a tender tale superbly written by a master story teller. Michael Konik, a fantastic writer, shares sweet moments with Ella as they vacation throughout Europe.He has managed to weave tenderness and travel into one great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving tale about a man and his elegant canine bestfriend","review":"This book is more than a beautiful tale about a charming man and his elegant canine bestfriend, Ella, and their adventure together in the most exciting places in Europe. This would have been reason enough to be completely satisfied with this book, however, it is also moving story about an extraordinary friendship and loyalty. The loyalty Ella has to her master is endearing but what is more moving to me is the author's loyalty to his bestfriend. I laughed. I was fascinated. I was deeply moved. I highly recommend this book not only to dog lovers but also to those who are a fan of friendship, loyalty, beauty and life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purrfect for you to read!","review":"I totally loved this book! Im a huge dog lover and I have a eight year old Boston Terrier named Tilly. Ive been to Italy twice, and always felt bad for leaving her behind. Now I know I dont have to! I loved reading first about how Michael felt about Ella, those true love feelings a human and dog share. The people of Europe, how they interacted, the stories, and I love the photos. I recomend this book to anyone.Dog lovers, travelers, anyone! A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dog Lover's Book","review":"I just loved this book. Ella is a magical and wonderful dog. Michael Konik is a great author and I felt as if I were in Europe with his descriptions of resturants and bars, hotels and the people throughout. He really loves Ella and so did the people in Europe. A fun book to lighten your spirit and know that a dog is truly a man's best friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring and repetitive","review":"As a Lab owner, I was very excited when this book came out. The best part of the book was when Konik met Ella. After reading about their adventure through Europe for a while, I was glad I checked this book out from the library instead of buying it. Don't get me wrong! I like Ella. She seems to be a good dog. But Konik's style of writing drives me crazy! Very very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog love","review":"A dog lover myself, I was intent on finding this book excellent. Unfortunately, too much of the writing was simply fawning over how Ella was \\"incredible\\" and loved. More of Ella's actual adventures would have made this book better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars because of the love between author and dog.","review":"I'm puzzled why most people rate this book so highly. Ella is a 'good dog', as the author repeats again and again, but it gets boring quickly being told that repetively. The beginning, when we hear how he found Ella is the best part of the book; after that all the chapters seem the same. How many times do we have to hear that the author can't believe that Ella is actually in a Italian/French/Austrian/restaurant? The travel sections only have three points: Ella is a good dog. Ella amazingly got to eat in restaurants/travel in public transportation,etc. Everyone who meets Ella loves her. Just scramble those three sentences and insert words like 'Venice' and 'Eiffel Tower' and you'll have read the entire book.That said, I do love how much this man adores his dog, and I wish America did allow dogs as much freedom as Europe does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Unnatural","review":"about how this guy obsesses about his dog. Maybe it's because I'm a cat person, but I just can't imagine living such an empty life - a life that revovles around a dog. It's like he lives just to take his dog, or, I guess he'd say daughter, to a golf course? Perhaps he just has problems relating to people, I don't know. THat said, the book was very repetitive...Europe is one big fabulous society....America is bad for having leash laws and forbidding dogs in restaurants....Ella is beautiful, bella, belle...Ella! You're swimming in the Med! Ella, you're dining in a French restaurant! Ella, you pooping in Rome! etc. etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't Want it to End!","review":"This book is so enthralling I didn't want it to end. The author's relationship with his \\"best friend\\" Ella the dog reminded me of some of the best friends I've loved and lost. We never went to Europe together. After reading about the author's adventures in France and Italy with his dog I wanted to have the experiences myself. It's been a couple of years since I said goodbye to my last dog, a Newfie named Bobber. This touching book has made me decide to welcome another dog into my life. I found \\"Ella in Europe\\" to be a wonderful reading expereince. The only way I think you wouldn't like this book is if you hate dogs or you hate Europe. In other words, something's got to be wrong with your heart if this book doesn't touch you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Beauty","review":"This book is a real beauty, just like Ella. I don't remember enjoying a story so much. I didn't want it to end. Dog-person or no, I would recommend this touching story to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"ella in europe - a great read!","review":"Ella in Europe is a terrific book....THE adventure us dog lovers would look to undertake....it is funny and sad, goofy and inspirational and best of all, makes one re-evaluate just what is important in the moment. My 7 year old pup and i read most of this book out on our deck and we were sorry to get to the end..but it is one i will read several times and probably see something new each time...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty shoes, need breaking in","review":"I bought they shoes to wear on my wedding day, and they are very comfy. They are very lovely once you see them in person. They fit, but pinch a little by my pinky toe (only on my right foot, which is larger), so they need breaking in. I do not have wide feet, but I could see them being a problem for people who do. They run true to size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and comfy, but run small","review":"The shoe is very nice, but unfortunately Dr. Scholl's tend to run a bit small, especially if you have wide feet. Despite the shoe I ordered being too snug, I could tell that they were comfortable when you get the right size- there's a nice gel sole built into the shoe. My only other complaint is that the shoe looked more like it had a cloth fabric on the outside when in fact it's just a hard shoe that's actually quite glossy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Adept Medical Ethics Drama With A Cerebral Climax","review":"Micheal Apted's Extreme Measures is a snake of a medical drama, writhing around in the dark dank areas of medicine that are independent of scalpels, anastesia, and emergency room proceedures. It's concerned with the hippocratic subconscious, decisions that have less to do with making the proper incisions and zapping the heart back into rhythm and more to do with the god-like freedom that can come from medical knowledge. Hackman is superb in a role that never vears into pure villainy, but hovers upon the thin line between moral justifications and immoral personal detachment. Grant is surprisingly effective and shows wonderful range in shedding his usual spasms of nervousness. The last 15 minutes is intellectual chewing gum for us all to masticate upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same movie as the book?","review":"First of all, LOVED the book. However, the movie might as well have had a different title. The two plots are so different it isnt even funny. If you're expecting this movie to even look a fraction of what the book was, you'll be sorely misled. However, if you havent read the book, and just watch the movie, you may very well be happy. The movie could stand alone rather well on its own accord, but if you read the book, you're just opening yourself to disappointment. I couldnt wait after I read this book to see the movie. I blinked several times to see if I was hallucinating at this poor copy of the book.I've never been this harsh in a review before, but I was just so disappointed in this movie I had waited through reading the book and waiting for it to come out on HBO, to get this poor excuse of an interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book","review":"After having read the book and waiting in anticipation when it first came out, I was extremely disappointed. The movie very well could be alright on its own merits, but the books plot is very different and much more suspenseful."},{"rating":"2","title":"suspenseful and a darn good movie.","review":"Hugh Grant and Gene Hackman at their best. The medical context of this movie is very realistic. Suspenseful. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning. A keeper for all video movie collectors"},{"rating":"2","title":"fast arrival","review":"I have not watched it yet but it arrived fast and was in a great condition. I can't wait to find the time to sit back and watch it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that has captured both hearts and imagination!","review":"Whiffle Squeek has many elements associated with a quality children's book. The plot is captivating and leads to a satisfying ending. The rhythmic and repetitive narrative involves young children. They relate to the colorful characters and follow the sing-song progression of the story. Often the children in my preschool class would plead \\"again, again,\\" and I would reply, \\"Yes, with pleasure\\" If you like this book I would also recommend CHICKA CHICKA BOOM BOOM (author unknown)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to See The Media Hasn't Changed!","review":"I enjoy books about the Civil War. This was a great way to learn about the war from the people who were watching it. Nowdays, we have wars such as the Gulf War on television. Here were the folks who HAD to be your eyes and ears. This would be a great book to have high school classes read as a comparison to seeing a film about Vietnam or Desert Storm, just to see the contrasts. History classes in American History and Journalism would also benefit. For the general public, unless you are interested in these topics, it is a lot of detail to absorb."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL PRINT","review":"There is a warning on the first page that this might be a bad print, but I'd love it if I had known before buying it.... All the pages on the right side are messed up, first letters in each sentence missing.The book is good for its content, but I'd rather buy a used edition"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can it possibly get much better than this ?!!","review":"It's so hard to find cd's that have more than 2 or 3 songs that are good enough to listen to. Yet Sister Hazel somehow manages to make every song on every cd better than the next! Chasing Daylight is definitely nothing shy of \\"Sister Hazel\\" perfection! What a complete music lovers dream. I love every song on this cd (as I do on their others)! This band has got it together. They just keep getting better! If you haven't heard this cd I \\"recommend\\" you buy it.

The development of Sister Hazel is amazing and I believe they just get better everytime they come out with something new. I would also recommend seeing them in concert, they sound the same as they do on the CD.. These guys love the fans, and I know they would love it if you purchased this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"BACK TO ROOTS WITH INDIE RELEASE!","review":"Just when you think they had done their best work, Chasing Daylight comes along. It will knock you off your feet! This independent release allowed Sister Hazel to give us what we love them for - soulful harmonies, lyrics that you can relate to on every level, and a contagious beat that becomes addicting! From the beautiful harmonies of Your Mistake, to the realistic Life Got In the Way, to the heartfelt Sword & Shield, their raw talent in writing and performing are a breath of fresh air!spitfiregemini"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Companion for re-reading Betsy/Tacy","review":"I'm a history buff and the period I love the best is 1900-1930 which is why I love Betsy Tacy so much.

If you have never tried the books, do, and then find yourself a copy of this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history of key American documents","review":"You can probably ignore \\"Teacher's\\" review. Heffner has, through seven editions, tried to maintain objectivity while including contemporary criticisms with the original documents. His book is neither Eurocentric, conservative or leftist. If you're tired of having Glen Beck spin the Constitution and other early founding documents for his own ends, get a copy of ADHOTUS and read the original, unaltered, unabridged documents for yourself and form you OWN opinions. This is essential reading for all Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must reading for every American citizen!","review":"Read the words that shaped the character of our nation and changed the history of the world. From the rousing Declaration of Independence to the inspiring speeches of our modern presidents, this book has it all. Students and scholars alike will find this an excellent reference tool. This book should be in the hands and minds of every American who loves liberty."},{"rating":"1","title":"A moving tribute to Eurocentrism","review":"Unfortuntately, the first words of this textbook encourage a Eurocentric view of American history. The textbook from here does a good job of boring the student to death and avoids any attempt at truth, especially until the 1930's. Also, I noticed another glowing error. The grapabo review and the textbook suggests that the Civil War was fought as a states issues. However, Abraham Lincoln and the everyone else in the 1860's on both sides would disagree. Another example of perpetuating the Confederate Myth. I would not recommend this book to any of my classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas present!","review":"I got this as a Christmas present as my daughter loves 30 Rock. She loved it, Than you very much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Season","review":"I think I laughed twice during this entire season of 30 Rock.

Either way, I will happily leave my 30 Rock DVD collection incomplete by not wasting money on this season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"I love Tina Fey.

These DVD's not only hang but the codec left a vertical white line staggering back and forth on my monitor \\"forever\\" -- that is until I impulsively tried a CD from Season four. While the DVD would not run, it fixed the problem caused by playing Season Five.I'm so glad I don't need a new monitor after all.To those who actually watched these, did you use your computer or other equipment. (I watch other DVDs just fine.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"honestly written, and enlightening","review":"This memoir, written in alternating voices between mother and son, is revealing as a story of coming to terms with a loved one's sexuality, but more importantly it documents the perceptions of a parent and child from infancy to adulthood, and the importance of accepting people for who they are. It should be required reading for every parent, no matter if their child is homosexual or heterosexual. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly moving and insightful","review":"I picked up this book in a store, never having heard about it before, and I read it in two days. This is a well-written account, with alternating chapters by mother and son, of what it was like to grow up as a gay male, and what it was like to raise a boy who was somehow different from the rest. There is a four-year age difference between myself and Chris Shyer, and our stories were in many, many ways similar, including my living near Chris' hometown. This book made me think of some of my own painful experiences coming to accept myself in a societal landscape where I was targeted as different. For that reason, this made it a sometimes difficult read for me but I still couldn't put the book down until I was finished. Very, very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great humor","review":"If you love wit both covert and overt you will love this series.Excellent setting and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk!!

Samples are short and the ability for a competent user to lengthen them as needed is very restricted. Then try to get support from the company!! I waited 14 days for a response to a simple question and had to threaten them with stopping payment before I got any kind of answer. Then, the answer was that they couldn't help me and that they would not accept a return of the product for a refund. BUYER BEWARE!!! When I complained, all they did was send me a copy of the end-user license. I called AMEX and filed a claim against them. I'm going back to Vienna Instruments which sound better, work better and have EXCELLENT Customer Support! At least you can call Vienna and get a real person on the line.

As a long-term practitioner of the Düd'jom Lineage of teachings, and translator to His Holiness Shenphen Dawa Norbu Rinpoche, I cannot too strongly recommend this book to all those who feel they would like to undertake the Buddhist path. The Ven. Gyatrul Rinpoche skilfully steers the practitioner - be they beginner or mature student - through the various reefs of hope and fear attached to such an undertaking, and brings them clear to at least a vision of the path that leads to the other shore, beyond, and back again.

And not all the memories were good, either. I did not wantto put it down when I started reading, but some of the scenes and action were hard to get through. I am a former Marine (1965-1969)and a pilot, but I didn't serve in combat. I did see planes crash (one right in front of me) and people were killed. This backgrounddid allow me to empathize with the characters of the book. I recommend this book if you want a hard look at what combat and militaryaviation (helicopters in particular) can entail.

This from what I read was someone's history about Josephus. I did not like it. There may be good research on the historical facts but the writer obviously came to the research with a prejudice against Josephus, and against the Bible and the information is therefore to me tainted. I did not finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe these reviews!","review":"It may be due to the fact that I was only 7 when this film premiered, but I found House of Games to be atrocious! The acting was laughable (Lindsay Crouse was dull and wooden, while Montagna's lines came across comically though not usually intended to be so), the plot was entirely transparent (just imagine - getting conned by con men), and the character development left much to be desired.An interesting side-note, however, is that this movie reminds viewers just how much influence tobacco companies had on movie houses back in the '80s. The whole film is one long drag off a Camel, and even Granny happily lights Crouse's cigarettes with her vintage lighter.Do not purchase this movie without first watching it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"Really -- don't buy or even rent this film. It's slow, boring, and so poorly acted, it appeared that the actors were reading their lines. I'm not kidding!

A intense drama betweeen manipulative con artist and cold uptight Psychiatrist who is amused by mind games. The ending brings deep seeting issues of the psychiatrist herself. The con tricks are realistic and elevated by great acting from Joe Mantegna. He lives in the character every inch of the film in words, acting and body language ! One wonders if a psychiatrist can be this bold and insensitive yet harmless. We would imagine a emotional and feeling person in that profession.You will be wary of Mind games and will wonder whom to trust after the movie ! Intelligent folks out there...You will relish this melodrama !"},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"Solid Mamet flick, MUCH better than the more recent 'Spanish Prisoner.'

Excellent performances, taut editing, and slick Mamet dialogue, (along with some twists and turns!) help make this one of the coolest flicks of all time.It's no wonder that Roger Ebert called it the BEST FILM OF THE YEAR.Be sure to give it a look.PS - Chic, I miss all the fun we had working together, hope all is well with you!KL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful acting, leaden pace","review":"Too stylized to be enjoyable. Crouse is so wooden that you wish the camera would move away from her and free her up. Mantegna is slightly more enjoyable, but the convincing performances are all from the bit-players. The result -- no tension (how can you care about the leads?), no engagement, and therefore no pay-off. A clunker I can't wait to get rid of."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"Lindsay Crouse does a hilarious impression of Keanu Reeves on horse tranquilizers, but that can't save this movie.

Here's a sample:Mike: I can not explain what I do.Margaret: I do not mind.Mike: You do not?Margaret: I do not.Mike: It is good you do not.Margaret: Yes. I would say quite good.Mike: Yes. Quite good.Me: The president is on the phone, and he says they Russians will use nuclear force if one of you doesn't use a contraction!Mike: I would say that is a problem.Margaret: You would?Mike: Yes, I would.Margaret: I do not see how you would not, really.Bomb: Kaboom.This isn't the worst movie ever; just my least favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't direct this film like HE did!","review":"A few films fall into the catogory of ones that make me want to run from the room kicking and screaming, \\"Don't ever direct a film the way this one was!\\" Wag the Dog seemed to fall into that category. David Mamet often can't make a career transition from stage work to screen. Lindsey Crouse is as stiff and repulsive as sleazy Joe Montegna is. They perform each scene like they're playing on stage to an audience. Other characters appear to be on projection backdrops along with the cardboard street slum set. Oh, and believability. Montegna can steal a key to use a first class hotel room without the bell boy or maid coming up to clean their room and find new guests there. He can spend the night there with Crouse. She will make sure each intimate line is heard in the back row. His con men gamble with a squirt gun! Wouldn't an empty pistol bluff just as easy?

In this film you will witness day to day life characters, the plot is simplified but its not just about a psychiatrist getting acquainted with a gambler, its much more deeper than that. Joe Mantegna is simply brilliant, succeeds in playing the role of a gambler to perfection, he is very precise and shines with flamboyancy throughout the film. Lindsay Crouse is excellent and her chemistry with Mantegna is so strong and deep, you can't help but glue your eyes to the pair, every single dialogue, every single action or even a movement grabs your attention. The film gets dark slowly, situations slowly get unpredictable and then you start wondering whom to trust and whom not to. The film is wroth watching many times, its totally a joy ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing is as it seems","review":"The beauty of David Mamet's superb \\"House of Games\\" is that it keeps you guessing, right up until the end. The film is about con men, but it is Mamet's screenplay that pulls the real con, getting viewer thinking it is headed in one direction and then veering off somewhere else. This is what \\"The Sting\\" might have been like had it not been a comedy. The real strength of the film is in the performances, particularly the leads Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna. The supporting cast are all from Mamet's theatrical company and they don't so much perform their roles as they inhabit them. Overall, this film proves that David Mamet is as good a film director as he is a playwrite."},{"rating":"2","title":"great the first time, but can't be re-viewed once you know the secret","review":"The first time I viewed this film, I was utterly wowed by the intricacy of the plot and the absolutely first rate acting. There is no doubt that that experience is worth the price of admission. You get the obsessively self-controlled psychiatrist, Crouse, who enters an alien underworld with indeciferable intentions. Then you have the mysterious and charming \\"gambler\\", Mantegna, who acts as her guide. The two of them enter what appears to be a wonderfully seductive and fascinating relationship that only grows more complicated and unpredictable as the film progresses - I do not want to play the spoiler here.Unfortunately, once you \\"get it\\", there is little pleasure in watching it again for nuance and additional meaning, which I can only conclude are not there. As such, I would not recommend buying the film: it is far better to rent it, however excellent it is on first viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overrated but worth watching","review":"The Bottom Line:House of Games is for the most part an intriguing thriller about confidence men which shouldn't be terribly predictable even if you've seen a lot of these types of films, but it flies off the rails in the final act (when a character says \\"Thank you sir may I have another\\" I was rolling my eyes very hard) and Mamet could certainly have used a better actress in the lead than Lindsay Crouse (aka Mrs. Mamet); House of Games is a decent movie but the director's later effort The Spanish Prisoner takes similar ideas and does them much better.3/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quo And The Blues","review":"This is a excellent blues style album by this great rock band.The Dog of Two Head album is a pre commercialised album from the Quo and is a truly awesome piece of work.The songs are great and well produced with great guitar tones and sound.

Abe has kept his paternity a secret and has watched Elaine Wager develop into a talented attorney. Heroin addict Cole Burgess is charged with the crime and what at first seems to be a simple case of robbery/murder develops into a complex maze of power and corruption. Hardy is hired to defend Burgess and Glitsky fights his own battles in this overly long but entertaining story. There are several characters to keep track of and by remembering each character's personality and behavior, the story has more depth than the typical legal fiction. Lescroart's skill is apparant as you read how each character struggles with the personal conflicts that define them.

Good thing that it also had one of the largest grease trays. Its only downfall was the excruciating 12 1/2 minutes it took to heat up to 350 degrees.

Doctors have the physcian's desk manual, this is a must for the hypnosis office. Not for those just who want to learn hypnosis. I have used these in sessions I have not wanted to do and have recieved great results and have increased by client base."},{"rating":"1","title":"FROSTY","review":"The freezer builds up too much frost and doesn't keep things frozen. One side freezes and the other side doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful book when fiction is presented as fact","review":"I confess to having read two of Dan Brown's books , and even saw the Ron Howard's and Tom Hanks movie. I claim to be a Christian and yet Brown's writing and ideas are just so contrary to a faith based world view. This little book is quite useful for someone like me. With an alphabetical marching of topics in page after page, Cox reveals the sources for the facts and the fiction (mostly fiction) behind Brown's fictions. Since I first found out that Geoffrey Moore did not invent the the idea of \\"eartly adopters\\" , I have been a believer that ideas get recycled from story teller to story teller. Cox does us a favor by laying out just where many of the ideas came from and often from whom. If you have read the \\"book\\" then this book is quite helpful to you. I was interested in the links between DaVinci, Isaac Newton and others Cox found."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Fowles Worst","review":"John Fowles is undoubtably one of the great writers of the 20th century. No-one with any love for literature should fail to read \\"The French Lieutenant's Woman\\", \\"The Collector\\" and especially \\"The Magus\\". Unfortunately he ran out of inspiration after \\"Daniel Martin\\" and this effort is simply unreadable. I made several attempts at reading it, but I couldn't get past page 60. Other Fowles enthusiasts I know share this view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"Many books have been labelled \\"verbal masturbation\\", but this is the real thing. John Fowles indulges his sexual and literary fantasies, entering them from every angle he can manage until he expends himself. What results is not \\"one man's interaction with his muse\\" as one review called it, but unreadable and pretentious and not remotely sexy subporn... that wouldn't have been publicised - or noticed - if they hadn't come from someone as well known as Fowles.Some of the parts, such as his encounter with a black nurse, and a guitar wielding dominatrix muse read like something out of a bored private schoolboy's diary.It's a pity, because John Fowles was once a great writer... but this book and \\"Daniel Martin\\" do him a great disservice.Mercifully short, and that's it's one bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to watch and follow","review":"I learned how to paint clouds with this, and of course, other things, but clouds are hard to paint.

One of the all-time best animated movies, with excellent animation, voices, and direction. Doesn't preach or pander to any one audience, but has moments that are fun for adults (check out the \\"Atomic Holocuast\\" movie-within-the-movie) and kids-- It is my 2-year old's favorite movie as well, and I suspect it will remain so for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overlooked Gem!","review":"Despite it's poor box office returns, The Iron Giant is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. The animation is top notch and voice performances are some of the best in an animated feature. Hats off to Eli Marienthal for making \\"Hogarth Hughs\\" such a loveable character. Every time I watch this film I notice another subtle detail.

I would have a lot more hair somehow a singing fry cook just doesn't compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of THE best animated films ever!","review":"That's saying alot considering we probably own every single Disney animated film ever made. This is done with the style and substance of the Brave Little Toaster and the ending is great!The entire movie is enthralling (I usually find something else to do in the middle of most \\"kids\\" movies and don't end up watching until the end). I watched this one until the end!Although it is more expensive than others - doesn't have the Disney cashflow behind it evidently - it is well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For kids, age 2 to 92","review":"What kid growing up didn't want his/her own robot?

We purchased this DVD for our 2-1/2-year old daughter after renting in only once because we knew we'd be renting it a dozen times!

I assumed that a DVD produced in 1999 would be in Dolby Digital 5.1, but the menu didn't give any alternative to the stereo default, and the stereo sound was poor quality at best. As a result, the poor stereo recording resulted in ghost images (if you have external speakers) that were very distracting throughout the movie. Save your money and purchase the VHS instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase","review":"My grandson purchased this without permission.

Our boys are ages 7 and 3 and it wasn't your typical animated movie, this was really boy stuff. We hooked it up on the TV in our car for a long road trip and were very upset to hear mild profanity during the movie. We think that many parents do not allow profanity of any type and will not want their children to watch this movie. We wish we would have known and now do not watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever","review":"THis was boring from beginnning to end.

Not good for kids or adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great !","review":"I watched this and sat through it based purely on the review rating. Thee was absolutely nothing in this that grabbed me, The animation was less than stellar. The story was predictable. It's your basic boy tries to save misunderstood monster story. I don't think it's worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically excellent, but intellectually dishonest","review":"There so are many good things about this movie that I really wish I could write a positive review. First of all, the animation is great. On par with Princess Mononoke. The characters are likeable, with the exception of the sterotypical paranoid government agent. The story line for the first two thirds of the movie is both funny and touching. Unfortunately, it goes down hill from there.After throughly enjoying the first two-thirds of movie, my viewing experience was ruined when the later third degenerated into an anti-gun rights, anti-government diatribe.If you want your children indoctrinated into that type of extreme left-wing dogma, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, I recommend you skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm.. too much brain washing...","review":"I really do not like movies that try to tell me how to think.

A classic movie in the sense that it connects on various levels with the movie-watcher. With movies like \\"Hannah Montana\\" making millions, it's a crime this movie wasn't more commercially successful or better appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brad Bird and the Iron Giant","review":"I'll start by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. If you are a fan of Bird's work on the Simpson's or if you liked the Incredibles, you should have this in your collection. Brad's gift for writing and directing is evident here in what I believe is his first full length movie. It has a touching family-oriented story line, fleshed out with the voice talents of Aniston and Connick. In fact, that's what makes this movie stand out amongst others of its kind, the story. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Well, I saw this movie in the theater, and was surprised to not be disapointed with it. Disney is one of those companies that it really is hard to make a bad movie (at least animation/cartoon).It is a well-delivered movie with bits and pieces of humor in it, but mainly seriousness. A very 'touching' story. The ending is very powerful and would suggest a sequel, though, to my knowledge, there hasn't been any."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good new look at animation","review":"This movie will really start off a change in the cartoon industry for the next century. The way the 'actors' move arround in this movie might really impress you on the level of natural movement.

I am not sure who enjoyed it more, my daughter or myself. I stumbled across it by accident several years ago in VHS form and will definately add the DVD version to our collection.

Prove to the movie industry that audiences aren't comprised of dolts and watch this superbly crafted tale. For the cost of two tickets to a lousy, overhyped megafilm, you can own a film/dvd worth viewing over and over again. This film is rich, moving and humorous.

After we watched it once, I had a talk with them and threw it out.It portrays US military commanders as unthinking, stubborn, reactionary thugs who are responsible for war and injustice.I saw officers that drifted in that direction as a Marine intelligence analyst in the 1980s, but they were rare, disrespected, deadened in their careers and they were still never this bad. This filmmaker imagines them to me in charge of our forces, I'm sure there's no shortage mislead people who agree, but it's not reality.US commanders are nowhere near perfect, but on average they are equal to or better than the business executives that I've worked with in management and IT consulting in hearthcare in terms of ethics and judgment. This film's portrayal of them is juvenile and misleading.If you respect our military, you probably won't respect the message of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"obnoxious sound","review":"This is one of those movies you constantly change the volume from one extreme to the other.It either startles you or you can't hear it, no medium ground whatsoever I watched about 15 minutes of it and chose another movie.

The story does tend to lean a certain way, like against war and weapons , but if you just watch it as a cartoon movie , and realise there are no real iron giants , then you can enjoy it. I think there is something really cool , bout the way it is made as well. Also the fact it is about the 50's adds to it, as to how innocent we once were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Very interesting messages about warfare and life.

I just hope it finds its audience on video."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Iron Giant w/ H. Connick Jr., Jennifer Aniston","review":"I have previously seen this movie and it is fantastic. My son is 3 and really enjoys the story. It takes what could be a very scary subject - a GIANT robot - and makes the whole story very gentle, endearing and enjoyable. The robot crashes to earth and is befriended by a young boy and the challenges of how to hide his \\"new friend\\" are comical at times. He also has to keep trying to lose the hound of a Gov't. agent that is sure the boy knows a lot more about the \\"alien invader\\" than he is saying. As the cover states, the result of this movie is \\"an incredible adventure that's part metal, part magic and all heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the best animated movie ever rendered.","review":"Being a fan of any giant robots i.e. Transformers, and Robobtech, I expected to like this film. However I did not expect to love it, as well as not expecting to get a little choked up at the ending. I don't usually get so caught up in a movie, that I will shed a tear for the character, but the characters in this movie are so effective, you can't help, but love them. And for the writers to give so much life to an iron robot was incredible, some live action movies don't have characters bursting with as much life. Most Disney movies are not this genuine and heart-felt, they ususally come off as contrived, or forced. Disney does turn out some good films, just not in this calibur. Everything in this movie was perfectly woven together, the story the characters, the animation. I could go on praising this movie, but my five star rating should say it all. This is a gem of a film, and one that I will hold closley to my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Iron Giant","review":"This movie was a really well thought out movie that every age can enjoy and appreciate with a message intented for everyone! We really enjoyed this movie as a family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad this is available to Amazon Prime members","review":"My kids really enjoy this film.

I highly recommend it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"THE BEST animated film in years! Brad Bird and Warner Brothers have just put Disney to shame.

Perfect for kids AND adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie of 1999 - No, honest it really is","review":"Just get the thing -- Nobody went to see it because the commercials made it look like a stupid retelling of ET, but nothing could be further from the truth.

Parents should be clamoring for a movie with a message about personal responsability and courage. Just do yourself a favor and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Even though I'm not a big animation fan, I was interested in seeing The Iron Giant. I'm glad it was on the Disney channel one day or I'd have never given this movie a chance. It's definitely worth a place in anyone's movie collection. It's a beautifully animated work with a heart-felt story that has a great balance of drama and comedy. The characters are well thought out and multi-dimensional, and at times it's easy to forget they're cartoon characters at all. I would recommend this movie to anyone; it's entertaining for all ages. Don't judge this movie by it's title or it's cover. It's a lot more than it seems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any animation lover","review":"When I had first read about the movie, I was disappointed by the statements made about it. I recently viewed it on a plane flight and was totally mesmerized by the animation. The animation is so clear and the multiple plains give a very realistic 3D view of the robot and the surroundings. The storyline is also well thought out and presents interesting twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron Giant","review":"This is by far the most entertaining animated film ever made. The story was very touching with out being chessy or stupid like other crappy animated movies. Even though there is some mild profanity parents should still let their kids view it. (If they are 8+) I was some what suprised that I had a tear or two run down my face at the end of the movie since I'm 16 and wasn't really interested in watching it in the first place. One of very few animated films I actually like. The action around the end absolutely rocked and the characters were believeable and just simply great. I truly hope for a sequel. Buy The Iron Giant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex, mature masterpiece disguised as kiddie fare","review":"Few movies of any kind, animated or not, manage to blend action, humor, happiness, sadness, nostalgic drama and futuristic sci-fi as masterfully as this one does. And since it did poorly at the box office the way too many genuinely great films do, we all owe it to ourselves and to the art of animated storytelling (almost run into the ground by Pocahontas and all those singing animals) to support this movie in its home video release. I don't care if you haven't even seen this film yet, you still have an obligation to buy The Iron Giant. Trust me, unless you're some kind of monster without the slightest capability of feeling sympathy for a cool little boy and his impossibly awesome, more-emotional-than-most-live-actors robot friend, you'll be holding on to this one for the rest of your life. It's a keeper, even if the DVD extras are a bit sparse..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie.","review":"My 3 year old son and I love this movie.

Well, that's not acceptable, we decided, and my family now also owns the DVD.There's nothing I can say about this movie that has not already been said. All I can stress amonsgt the myriad of reviews is I sincerely hope the animation and production team responsible for this movie bless film-goers with more films like it. This movie is resonant, beautiful, and displays genuine humanity. It is perfection, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron Giant is a GREAT movie!","review":"This is a terrific movie - the best one we've gotten for our 3 year old son.

It's a great movie for almost all ages, and I think it'll surprise you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film for parents and older kids","review":"With a plot similar to E.T. this film may appeal to older kids and parents more than younger ones. Some scenes, even in animation, are quite scary. It's a good story and well worth watching more than once. The Iron Giant's highlight is the dramatic and satisfying (though not entirely original) ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Iron Giant is Splendid!","review":"I was impressed by this movie. I figured that it would be the typical American animation kiddie film. This movie was moving and thought provoking. I was able to relate to the characters especially how the Iron Giant felt about what was happening to the world and himself. This is an animated movie to see for all ages. Maybe we all could learn something from the Iron Giant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron giant","review":"The movie itself was good and the boys enjoyed it but my problem is with amazon. The movie stopped a total of 8 times during viewing with no warning. Then needed to be restarted, fast forwarded, and reloaded.

This has happened to us the last 4 times we tried to view a movie from amazon and not sure if we will be trying again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This movie reminds me of my brother in the 90's as a kid.

Brought to the big screen format by Pete Townshend (The Who) and Des McAnuf (Broadway musical Tommy). While the movie story line differs considerably in spots from the original story, it still does a great job of conveying the message. My son has watched it a dozen times, and that has curbed his appetite for the current version of Marvel's Iron Man, in the movies now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss The Iron Giant!","review":"One of my favorite movies of all time. The animation is breathtaking, the story is wonderful and the characters are alive in this tale set in the 1950s. (Brad Bird, if I could say one thing to you about this movie, it would be \\"Thank You.\\") The comic timing is wonderful and, (unlike the recent movie \\"Final Fantasy-The Spirits Within\\"), the voices actually MATCH the onscreen characters. These people may be animated, but they ACT. My favorite scene in the movie is the \\"kitchen\\" scene. It always makes me laugh. This movie has all the things that makes a movie great; characters you care about, generous doses of awe & wonder, humor and sadness. I gave this movie 5 stars only because I couldn't give it even HIGHER marks. This film didn't get the box office it deserved when it was released. Warner Bros. evidently didn't know what they had.

I was so happy to find this movie on DVD 6 months ago at Circuit City despite the fact that it should have been pulled off the shelves because it was discontinued for the re-release that coincide with the Incredibles. The Iron Giant is just a really feel good movie with real values that don't get instilled in any of those lame Disney cartoons about murder and death in the family. This is a happy movie that everyone should watch because it's truly enjoyable and suitable for everyone. Plus Vin Diesel really does sound like a robot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro Gem","review":"This a joy to watch and contains something rarely encountered in even live action films. No, not a good story, which this film most certainly has; but characters that you come to care about. The editorial review above refers to this work as \\"unpopular\\". Wrong!

Gerald decides to teach his pretty wife a lesson.This is a great old classic. Doris Day and James Garner are wonderful together with great chemistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Doris Day Comedy","review":"Doris Day and James Garner had a wonderful chemistry, first-evidenced when Universal paired them in THE THRILL OF IT ALL!, a bubbly romantic comedy about the tenacious power balance between husband and wife.Beverly Boyer (Doris Day) is a devoted wife and mother who suddenly finds nation-wide fame as the star of the \\"Happy Soap\\" TV commercials. Her successful obstetrician husband Gerald (James Garner) finds himself thrust into the position of being \\"Mr Beverly Boyer\\" as their marriage and private-life careens into a media frenzy. Can marriage survive life in the spotlight?...Adorable romantic comedy with Doris Day at the top of her form. The Boyer children are played winningly by Brian Nash and Kim Karath (best-remembered as little Gretl in \\"The Sound of Music\\").

Outside of a few laughs concerning the swimming pool, this was one boring scene after another.Of course, it's always great to see Edward Andrews and Burt Mustin (one of my all time favorites). But this one is best rented rather than bought....if you think you MUST see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saucy","review":"My, times have changed. At the time, this film was rated as mature and had adult themes. Nowadays, it could be shown after Sesame Street with no qualms. For those who liked Doris Day, and that included everyone in those days, she could be exciting with a mere kiss, a glance, or a gesture. As such, this film was funny, sexy(in 1960's terms), and on target."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful romp","review":"A pretty typical Doris Day outing with Jim Garner in the role usually occupied by Rock Hudson.

I must warn buyers that they would need to spend at least 3 hours per day studying to really keep up with learning a chapter per week if they want to learn quickly. I would really suggest that you skip the cassette and find someone who is a native Dutch speaker to assist you. Hugo really does a great job with these books. I used his \\"Russian in three months\\" and was able to live in a Russian speaking country quite easily after studying his book. Anyway, if a person is serious about learning Dutch, this is a good book. Another word of advice, writing and re-writing the vocabulary and exercises plus actually using the language will keep the vast amount of information retained easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dutch Course Available","review":"While this is the best Dutch course currently available, it could easily be topped. The Pimsleur method is far superior, but currently is unavailable in Dutch. The Foreign Service Institute produces much better tapes and books than Hugo, but again, they are more expensive and not available in Dutch anyway.So, what the student of Dutch is left with is a choice between three or four books and tape courses. The Hugo system worked fine for me, or I should say, I worked hard to master it. This then is the real key to learning: effort. Spend several hours, maybe two, per day, on this couse. Immerse yourself in the language by thinking and talking to yourself in Dutch. Dedicate youself to it, and you will overcome any shortcomings in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BUY!","review":"This book has even spelling mistakes and translating mistakes in it! Bad idea and insulting to the Dutch people as it doesn't particularly make us look good to foreigners.... just a small preview:first lesson: page 32 converation (chapter 3)1)Do you see those two women there!2)do you mean the one with the dress and the long hair?1)That hair is much too beautiful. It's a wig...My boyfriend after 3 chapters learnt only how to tell my mum that she has a wig on her head! Get it?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always on my CD changer","review":"I bought this CD long ago as a neophyte in opera appreciation. I had just seen Turandot and wanted the recording primarily for \\"Nessun Dorma\\", which I also love because of its use in the film, \\"The Killing Fields\\". But I have also appreciated the exquisite renderings of the other songs on the album. Callas. Caballe. Freni. Often, when a compilation like this comes out, one senses that the interpretations are second rate. In this case, it is just the opposite, or at least it seems that way to me.The CD contains well known songs like \\"Vesti la Giubba\\" from Pagliacci, and \\"Un bel Di\\" from Madame Butterfly, but there are lesser known, and beautiful songs as well, such as \\"Viens, Malilika...sous Dome Epais\\" from Lakme', an absolutely gorgeous duet for two sopranos. I would highly reccomend this CD if you want to learn more about opera, or if you simply want some beautiful vocal music to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Intro to Opera","review":"Highly recommended even for those who may think they don't like opera.

They're very good because they have DHA and are very complete when you follow they're regimine. The only problem is, you have to take 4 of them to get 100% of a lot of the essential nutrients, like Vitamins A, C, E, and the B's. With my prescriptions, I only had to take one a day. This is a lot more to remember. Also, they make me burp. And the burp is kind of foul. It's probably the fish oil, but it isn't pleasant. I'm still going to take them because they have all the good stuff I was looking for but be warned about these imperfections!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very stomach gentle","review":"I bought these along with Nature's Way prenatal vitamins to see which I liked best. To be honest, I didn't think there would be much difference. I was taking these for about a week and felt great, no problems. Then I took the others one day and felt sick an hour afterwards for several hours. It just seemed too harsh on my stomach. This brand has DHA, Ginger (good for morning sickness), and digestive enzymes. You do have to take it twice a day (two pills at a time) but that way I know I am getting adequate absorption of the vitamins and nothing is getting flushed out. Also, liquid capsules are more easily absorbed by the body than tablets.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fishy","review":"While they are very complete there are too many negatives to make them worth to me. First you need to take them twice a day now while this may not be a problem for some people this proved to be too much of a hassle for me I'd always forget my morning dose. Second, they are VERY fishy! Even hours after I'd take them I could still taste the fish oil. With my already queasy stomach I just couldn't bear to do it anymore. I am now taking prescription Natelle Plus with DHA and much prefer those."},{"rating":"1","title":"They smell/taste horrible!","review":"I think it's the alfalfae in it that makes them smell/taste so bad, and i get this nasty aftertaste i burp up all day long with them.

Near the end, it also lists all the different registry's with requirements which is priceless if you are into breeding for a sport horse.

Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult going","review":"I have read a lot of GG and consider myself an admirer, but this one was a real chore to get through. It honestly gave me a headache several times. The sister and brother Farrant are fairly compelling characters but the Swedish industrialist Krogh is a complete cipher-- also murky beyond comprehension are whatever financial shenanigans he is up to. The book has moments of clarity but large swatches (page after page really) were for me nearly incomprehensible.

Stick with his better known works unless you are determined to read everything he ever wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS","review":"\\"The Right Stuff\\", based on Tom Wolfe's book and directed by Phillip Kaufman, was a wonderful American story about the Mercury space program that told the tale of U.S. pilots just brimming with gusto, bravado and...the right stuff.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF \\"BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN\\"STWRITES@AOL.COM"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"Truly one of the best films of the early eighties!

I was suprised that it wasn't. It accurately depicts (despite a few little inaccuracies) the beginning of our journey into space. The visual effects were great for the time period. The storyline moves fast but well written. Bill Conti's music for the film was inspiring. The cast (Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward, Lance Henriksen, Jeff Goldblum, etc.) was well picked. This film, despite some inaccuracies, should be recommended viewing for High schoolers (along with \\"Apollo 13,\\" and the war films \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" and \\"The Patriot.\\"). 5 stars and above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, Great film","review":"One of my favorite films of the 80's.The casting is superb and the cinematography is great.And of course Leven Helm's narration and role top it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic excuse for a film.","review":"This film is just plain BAD. Every single story depicted in the film is falsified and primitively \\"sexed up\\" to fit the narrow minded views of it's producers. I especially hated the way they treated Chuck Yeager - it is just plain disrespectful!It is because of films like that (add the pathetic \\"Apollo 13\\" and \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" to this list of shame), that the general public has so little interest in space exploration.Instead of squeezing out crap like that, they should make documentaries, talk to real people, tell their REAL story, finally show some of those 1000s of miles of documentary footage that they have collecting dust in the archives. It sure would be more interesting than their cheesy \\"special effects\\" and family squabbles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you 3 hours of your life to waste...?","review":"The only thing that I was impressed by was the picture quality of a movie from '83. I thought they must have made a mistake and that it was from '93.The movie itself is long, pointless, and gets nowhere fast.

But other than that NOTHING about this movie is even close to the truth. In particular, the character assassination of Gus Grissom, an excellent astronaut who not only flew on the second Mercury flight but also on the First Gemini flight and who was slated for an early Apollo flight is just shameful. Especially considering Gus gave his life in the Apollo I fire. I understand it's not a documentary but when you're portraying real people and real events I think you have some responsibility to the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THE BOOK","review":"Not too many who saw this film seem to have read the book. I did and I know the movie completely misses many subtleties and points of Tom Wolfe's \\"new journalism\\" work. There was no depiction of the astronauts' psyche - first the humiliation of great fighter pilots chosen to duplicate what a monkey accomplished; then feelings of a military man's anxiety of \\"fouling up\\" a simple task, flying in a rocket. These are examples of finer details important to the story, yet the director failed to grasp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly bad","review":"The Bottom Line:This agonizingly long film which devotes at least an hour of screen time to Sam Shepherd riding his horse, talking to his wife in the sunset, and doing brave deeds merely out of manly duty might better be titled \\"Chuck Yeager: All-American Hero;\\" unhappy to merely humanize and reconstruct the heroes of the Space Age, the film decides to invent one and in so doing becomes an overlong mismatch of ideas and scenes that drags mightily and presents 5 dumb moments (e.g. the Aborigines' sparks keep John Glenn aloft! LBJ as a big comical buffoon!) for every good one.2/4"},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"I was not impressed at all with this movie. To show Gus Grissom as some sort of screw up was almost offensive to me. Did Tom Wolfe even bother to interview Deke Slayton, who was Gus' best friend? Did the director, producer, etc? Had anyone connected with this movie asked the right people and the right questions, then they would have had \\"The Right Stuff\\". This movie felt more like an overblown patriotic salute to the Mercury Seven than it did a genuine look at the beginnings of the space program. Instead of this movie, I would highly reccommend Tom Hank's series \\"From the Earth to the Moon.\\" I'd also like to reccommend Slayton's autobiography \\"Deke\\"; that to me was a better look at what actually happened. Had Tom Wolfe started out with Deke, he would have had a far superior book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial Propaganda","review":"Space development is one of my favorite themes. And I knew this movie had high reputations. So I expected much when I bought a copy.But I was really disappointed.Are Americans the only people who have \\"the right stuff\\"? Ofcourse NOT.

It's really disgusting.Anyway, this film is a product of the Cold War."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done","review":"Hollywood has mostly ignored one of the most dramatic events of the modern age, the space program. It's been willing to lavish millions on sci-fi and fantasy but has been meager in detailing the real drama. Tom Wolfe's marvelous book has been captured in this film with the same blend of irony, whimsy, humor and real drama.The astronauts were accidental heroes, men who never expected to be elevated to such a public Olympus. They were never what the PR machine promoted but they got the job done and eventually earned the heroic status they were automatically granted by the propaganda machine of the time.An interesting film that genuinely manages to distill out the essence of the 'right stuff.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Right Stuff is Real","review":"Through great casting and near-perfect screenwriting, this movie presents the transformation of the U.S. following WWII to a space exploring nation. The movie is based on a stellar book by Tom Wolfe, and the depictions of his pilots-cum-astronauts as they struggle to retain their pilot identities within the confines of training for these first probes into space ring true. Poignantly, their experiences are contrasted with those of perhaps the greatest test pilot of that generation, Chuck Yeager, who never became an astronaut."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"\\"The Right Stuff\\" is a movie that every American should see. The American/Soviet space race is chronicled with a high degree of historical accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Packaging","review":"I've had this movie on VHS for years and decided I would like to have a DVD version. The movie is outstanding and will always be a classic. However, this DVD lacks in quality of packaging. They have recorded both sides of one DVD rather than making it a 2-DVD version. The case is the cheapest kind you can find. I saw this package in the Walmart 2/$10 bin one time and didn't buy it because it was so cheaply packaged. I would recommend the 2-DVD version sold by Amazon, even if it is more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent historical movie","review":"This movie is not only entertaining, but it also works great as a history lesson. It grippingly captures the early days of the U.S. space program, focusing on the seven Mercury astronauts -- how they were chosen, their giant personalities, their wives' emotional difficulties, and their triumphs. As a high-school teacher, I have shown this \\"old\\" 1983 movie to kids in recent years, and I'm happy to report they get into it. As I watch them watching the movie, the vast majority of them are rivetted. The movie was nominated for Best Picture but lost to \\"Terms of Endearment.\\" That was a good movie, but not a great one. \\"The Right Stuff\\" is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to review","review":"For me, a big fan of the space program, especially Apollo, was excited to get this movie for I knew little about the Mercury Space Program. My review of this movie may be flawed because I expected one thing and got another. I expected a lot more insight into the, technical sides of things I guess, but instead I got a movie more along the lines of 7 buddies. I thought the movie lacked in visual effects of the missions themselves, for they were brief and lack luster. And for a movie of 3 plus movies, I wish to be interested the whole way through.Now as much sense as that may make, I gave the movie a generous 4 stars, and if you are looking for a movie on the Mercury Program itself, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Epic","review":"I can say little more to praise this film than has been said before.

In both cases, the movie always plays right away; I never get the start menu like it shows on the back of the box. Also whenever I fast forward or rewind, the movie freezes and won't play, so I get to shut down the player or sometimes even \\"End Task\\" on the player. As another review already noted, the movie is burned into both sides of the disk.

Maybe you'll have more success with other players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film, but DVD buyer beware!!","review":"By now, everyone knows this is a great film. First rate acting in all roles, great story and the effects are sensational. It is a terrific movie. However, in this day and age, Warner Bros should be taken to the woodshed over the fact that ( here in Canada anyway) the DVD has the move split. The brand new, sealed edition that I purchased stopped with about half an hour left, and the disc had to be removed and flipped over to watch the end of the movie.

I feel confident putting my little one in it because the rings hold the fabric in place without slipping. This sling is as beautiful as it is functional. The shoulder padding is also really comfortable. The one drawback is that the instruction booklet is less than clear on how to properly do the cradle hold, and there isn't a decent picture of it, but the sling itself is wonderful. I ended up looking on youtube for videos on how to use a ring sling and never looked back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful at all!","review":"I bought this one in pink-lavender stripes and found that it's impossible to use it correctly and very uncomfortable for the child in it (the whole body and especially the neck). I prefer the \\"real\\" carriers though. I would not recommend this type of carrier to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for newborns","review":"Our DD hated this product. It nearly suffocated her, and caused what we think is painful bending in the neck and spine. She still hates it at 4 months, but loves the Baby Bjorn.I think it will be more useful when she is 6-9 months old, but I see no reason to kill your back with this when the Bjorn works so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIke it!","review":"I think this is a pretty good sling for the cost. It's multi-functional and it also comes with a manual that shows you how to best utilize it. I will warn you that it shrunk on me after I washed it, but I'm 5'3\\" so it actually worked to my benefit, b/c I thought it was too long pre wash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea But...","review":"I bought this sling for my newborn and I LOVED the idea of a sling so I could have my hands free while holding him close. It is VERY difficult to use this sling without feeling like baby's head is either \\"chin-crunched\\" or flopping all around. Maybe I'm over cautious but only once did I feel comfortable with him in it. I did return this sling only because of useage issues. The fabric, instruction manual, pattern and rings all seemed just fine. It was a little more pink in color than I thought it would be. If you're looking for an alternative I spent the extra money on the Moby wrap and I am THRILLED with it. It's not difficult to use once you get a routine down and baby seems a lot more secure and I'm a lot more comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy and useful!","review":"I love this sling when I need a quick and easy option for carry my baby when I'm out and about. It fits her better now that she's older (4.5 months) than when she was tiny (I preferred my moby-style wrap then) and it's comfortable for me as well. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the amount of threads that are left at the end of every row of stitching--a higher-quality product would have gone back to trim these, but instead there are little 1/8\\"-1/4\\" left overs all over it. It doesn't detract from the appearance unless you're up close and picky like me, and it's not unraveling or affecting the functionality--but I keep meaning to go back to it and trim all over. Lovely color though, and overall I enjoy this product =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right rings","review":"I took a babywearing class led by someone who helps make the international rules for babywearing. She told me that the rings used in this ring sling are craft rings, not babywearing rings. Now that I know what to look for, I can see that there really is a BIG DIFFERENCE! These rings are tiny and flimsy compared with a real ring sling. That, coupled with the pointless padding along the rails of this sling make it impossible to adjust easily. I struggled to use this for the entire first month of my baby's life and finally upgraded to a professionally made ring sling. The difference is unquestionable. I will say that the fabric in this sling is pretty, but it is also single-sided and very thin. I ended up giving it away to a friend to use as home decor. If you want a real ring sling, look for something condoned by Babywearing International...or at least check their website for the features you should look for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Baby Sling","review":"I use this sling every chance I get. Couldn't use the front baby carriers because they hurt my back. This lets me sit my daughter on my hip and feels so comfortable. High quality, sturdy material. A great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for breat feeding!","review":"I got this sling thinking I would just use it to carry around one of my twins while I carried the other. It is good for that and to use with other types of carriers at the same time. But the best thing about this sling is how easy it is to breast feed with! In public people just think she is asleep and at home I can have a free hand! It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy carry, Baby friendly","review":"Although a bit tricky to figure out how to wear on oneself (including adjusting it) and how to put the baby in it, the LOS Baby Sling is quite effective once you get the hang of using it. More importantly, my newborn baby girl loves it!As a dad, I tend to carry my little girl a lot (when I get home from work) and using the sling allows me to do more than just cuddle her...I use it to carry her as I take my afternoon walks with her - even forgoing the stroller when going for walks (and mall shopping trips). Forget about wearing a weighted vest for a walking workout! This multipurpose sling does for me more than I thought it would! Even more, just a few minutes after putting my baby girl in it, she instantly falls asleep - she would even continue to do so (for at least another hour) after our one hour walks.Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect sling!","review":"I love this sling. It is not pricy and it is just what you need to carry you infant. My daughter loves it!! She is now 6 months and I carry her in the sling in different positions. I absolutely recommend this product to every mother (because the design my husband wont wear it :))"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Baby Carrier","review":"I purchased this carrier for my daughter from Amazon. She can handle it by herself. The baby is almost two weeks old and can be carried in it comfortably. It looks like she can continue to grow and fit in it. My daughter can prepare the sling and baby without assistance. She is balanced and the baby is comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a MUST! :)","review":"my Baby girl LOVES this,she falls right to sleep everytime!...i use this around the house,and mostly when i go out...much better than going into stores with a big carseat,i just slide her in before we get out of car..so much easier!..& i have gotten so many compliments on it! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sling.","review":"This is a great sling for the price. I actually like the color of it better in person. The pictue makes it look kind of weird. My 5 week old likes being cradled in this. Its also an amazing price compared to other slings and I think this one works just as well. Its worth giving a try b/c the price is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it","review":"I bought this product for my newborn and unless you have a gargantuan baby this sling will sag to or below your waist. I adjusted it as tight as I could and I just went to walgreens and bought a sling by infantino...it was a waste of my money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Material waaaay to thin and flimsy.

Only positive is that I got my money back ASAP from Amazon :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Difficult to put on and get baby in, and I didn't \\"trust\\" it anyway, so I pretty much was holding the baby while using this thing, which defeats the purpose. IMO, it's junk. Great idea though, if it actually worked. Overpriced piece of fabric is all it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"It is just too difficult to use it. It's just been sitting there. Maybe I am the type who doesn't like to read instructions; they seems to long to read. When I try it on with my baby, it doesn't seems to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"uncomfortable and baby hates it","review":"I wish I never bought this product. It is really really uncomfortable to adjust and always has extra fabric hanging in the area where the baby should be sitting, so it never supports her correctly. No wonder my baby hates it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sling!","review":"Loved the sling! Bought it when I was taking my 4.5 month old to Disney World. Makes him much lighter to carry and he loves it! He's now 10 months old and 20lbs. Haven't used it much lately, but he never minds going in it. It took a while for me to get use to how to use it, but the instructions were good. Like this sling way better than the snuggli front carrier I have that hurts my shoulders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Pros:Fits easily.Doesn't kill your shoulder (depends on your child I'm sure).We take this on vacation, when we go to the beach or something, and walk around the boardwalk and stuff like that. Everyone comments either on it or how cute our baby is, or a combination of those.Cons:I guess the safety issues are the only thing I can think of to list for a con. You cannot buy these type of slings at a box store like Babies \\"R\\" Us; I'm guessing because of people saying that children can suffocate. But we started using this with our child around the age of 8 weeks, and at that point, our baby was big enough that she fit such that it didn't look like a safety hazard for her at all. So I would caution someone to wait at least two months before using an item like this, but otherwise, we've never thought twice about it, and our child has been fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but one size does not fit all","review":"I was still pregnant when I ordered this and a newbie babywearer at best. I wanted a ring sling and liked the padded shoulder and the low price of this item. Unfortunately the padded rails rendered it useless for me, as I couldn't snug it up tight enough to use before the padding would hit the ring. I'm 5' 5\\" and have an average build, so it's not like I'm super petite or anything. It was even too big for my husband who's 6' with an athletic build. I may yet try cutting it apart to get some use out of it (I'd already washed it before the baby arrived, and didn't realize until I'd tried using it with him that it wouldn't work), but ended up buying a different sling from Sleeping Baby that I absolutely love -- even if it was more than twice as expensive.I will say the Charcoal Parsemage was quite nice looking though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Children's Book","review":"Great book about how a family was able to endure the trials of WWI and open their home to \\"the enemy\\".

This is a challenging job for a music teacher, while working only through a book and an accompanying CD. Cohen's volumes 1 and 2 show only keyboard exercises with absolutely no written guidance for the student. For a more fullfilling learning experience with blues piano, see my review of Alan Swain's \\"Improvise, a Step-by-Step Approach.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Stories About Real Twins","review":"As a twin, I really hate some of the questions that singletons ask, but Susan Kohl seemed to really understand some of the issues that twins face, like being separated for the first time in school and then as an adult trying to separate to find your own identity. She didn't tell the story, the twins told it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the twin curious, this may be an amusing book . . .","review":"but for anyone close to a twin (or even a twin) this book is very vague. The book glazes over the topics in a twins life that truly make them unique and repeats the same things throughout. There are many other aspects of the twin bond that are not even approached by this author. Though I must admit, I was very impressed by the fact that the mother of 6 year old twins was brave enough to venture into the area of the twinless twins, a subject that many twins dare not think about out of fear of being the remaining twin. Approaching this topic and allowing the reader the opportunity to broach a subject that will be life altering for half of the worlds twins in itself is a good reason to read this book. Probably the only good reason. Overall, the book was a difficult read because of the repetition and topic hopping back and forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting music from the 1600's","review":"Johann Christoph Bach and his brother Johann Michael Bach were first cousins of Johann Sebastian Bach's father Johann Ambrosius. Interestingly, Johann Michael is also the father of Sebastian Bach's first wife Maria Barbara and therefore the grandfather of C.P.E. Bach, the best of the composing Bach sons.The pieces on this CD represent music contemporary to Pachabel and Buxtehude and sounds very similar to their works. Johann Christoph's piece \\"Meine Freundin, du bist schön\\" is the best piece on the CD and shows J.C. Bach to be a very profound mid-baroque composer. Johann Michael Bach's piece \\"Ach, bleib bei uns, Herr Jesu Christ is also quite beautiful.Not the best or the most original of the mid-baroque composers, never the less these composers show they are quite capable and illustrate the remarkable musical tradition J.S. Bach came from. I recommend this CD if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't return again...","review":"This book is just not very good, in my opinion. The story was totally unbelievable, in a way that even most horror stories cannot approach. I forced myself to finish it, to see if it ever became interesting, but it never did. Disconnected, implausible storylines fail to mesh throughout the book. Stephen King is not my favorite author, but his horror fiction is certainly always much better than this. If you are interested in Southwestern mystery-type stories, read any of the excellent works by Tony Hillerman. I can't recommend this one, and won't read any others by Bentley Little."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an absolutely horrid piece of pulp.","review":"Flat, lifeless imagery. Characters without a trace of personality. Pathetic plot development. And the absolute worst ending I have ever read. If it were within my power, I would not only demand my money back but also insist that Little compensate me for the time wasted reading this tripe. If you want to read something from a writer with actual talent, try Simon Clark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary Premise, Horrible Book","review":"The idea behind this book is really creepy, but that's where it ends. The characters are totally undeveloped and cliche. By the end, I really didn't care whether they lived or died. The climax of the book is totally unbelievable, and not in a good way - it seemed like Little just got them into so much trouble and just couldn't come up with a credible way to get them out of it.I love Little's short stories, but this was the first novel of his that I've read and it totally put me off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary!","review":"After reading this great book and being thoroughly terrified by some of the most disturbingly original imagery I've come across this year, I was shocked to see the low scores this book got from readers. Maybe you have to be from the southwest to appreciate the achievement here. Compared to Dean Koontz's BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON, which seems to have taken its Four Corners info from a map, Little knows this country and creates an epic novel of horror from this epic landscape. Scary, intense and original. By the way, I liked the ending and thought it DID tie up all loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"The Return started out as a seemingly very promising horror story. Once I got further into the story I realized that it was turning into a very weak offering from Bentley Little. A mummy with a red afro?? Come On!! Very unrealistic even for a horror novel!Too many questions were left unanswered. Such as what happened to the town that dissappeared? What happened to the people that dissappeared? What exactly was the Mongolon Monster??? The answers to these questions were very vague in the story.Also the end of The Return seemed to be rushed. The build up to the supposed climax was satisfying enough, however, the climax of the story itself was anything but!Skip this one. Bentley Little has written some excellent horror novels. Try The Store, The Revelation and The Walking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah...Stupid!","review":"I've read 3 novels by this author \\"The Summoning\\", \\"Dominion\\", \\"The Return\\" I think his writing style is very simplistic and a little opportunistic but he is a guilty pleasure nonetheless!. The first book above was fun, scary, gory and original but seriously flawed. The second book was flawed but was so gory that it kept my interest till the end. \\"The Return\\" is a confusing mess, it's absolutely awful, and I wish it would return to the wretched cess pool from which it was spawned. I'm not giving up on him yet though. Don't always believe those blurbs you see on the front and back covers of books, Stephen King raves about this guy saying \\"He is the best writer working now\\" This is not true..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR A LITTLE FAN","review":"Having read every Bentley Little book, including Death Instinct, I can honestly and regretfully say that this is his worst book. After the first hundred or so pages, I could tell that Bentley had lost his inspiration .... Ridiculous scenes involving dancing pottery killed any horror or suspense that could have built from this complete mess of a story that dragged on and on. I love this author, don't get me wrong, but this is one to skip. I recommend The Ignored, The Mailman, and The Association."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time.","review":"This is my first (and last) experience with Bentley Little's work and to say I was disappointed would be far too kind. The plot, such as it is, deals with a race of creatures that return from the past and start reverting people to a more primitive state. Why is not entirely clear and I just didn't care enough to figure it out. The characters are so interchangeable that you can't tell one from another and the big finish happens so quickly that there is no attempt to build suspense. Not frightening, very predictable and lacking in the basic elements of a good horror novel, THE RETURN definitely does not make me want to check out the rest of this author's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a letdown","review":"I have read all of Bentley Little's books except for \\"The Association\\" and \\"The Policy,\\" which probably explains why I stuck with this book until the end. I seriously considered stopping around page 150 because the book was just a random series of events happening to characters that I really didn't care about. \\"But,\\" I thought, \\"Little's done it before,\\" so I kept going, hoping that either a plot would show up or that things would be explained.Well, no plot ever showed up, and things were sort of explained, but it came late and you REALLY had to suspend disbelief to accept it. And at the end, I still didn't care about any of the characters, but by the time I was really set to give up, I only had about 75 pages to go, so I just finished it.If you haven't read Little, read \\"The Store\\" instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Return","review":"This book is stupid. We all know that when it comes to horror and scifi one must have a suspension of disbelief but this is one ridiculous book!-A \\"monster\\" of the \\"boogie man\\" class.-Dancing pottery.-Artifacts that attack people.-Blood and gore, sadism and perversity more comical than shocking.-Main characters for which you develop not the slightest interest or liking because they are narcissistic and juvenile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book I'd return to","review":"No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't absorb myself in this book like I have been able with most of the other books Little has written. By desciption alone, the plot isn't bad, but it's not terribly interesting to read about. There was just no magic here. I read the events, didnt care about them, didnt care about the characters, and didnt really care about the outcome. This was one of those novels I read for awhile, and kept coming back to after reading another book to finish. I was just bored...I can't put my finger on why exactly, but it's a truth. The pace would speed up, then slow down again, repeating it's vicious cycle.My advice? If you're wanting to sample Little, try one of his other books instead, like the House of the Revelation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"This was the first book I've read by Bentley Little. I purchased it because it sounded interesting. I had to force myself to actually finish it...sorry. This book did not make me want to rush out and purchase another of his works.

This is just my opinion however, others may enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off great","review":"The characters weren't really likable. It didn't tie together all the plots.

There is no resolution to this completely ridiculous, convoluted, mess of a story. The author has plot twists that lead to absolutely nowhere, and seems to forget about characters only to write them in later as an after thought with some ridiculous story once he remembers . The author bases the storyline around some mysterious monsters for which he offers no description or explanation other than being dark with an orange afro, while in contrast spending an inordinate amount of time describing every pit stop the main characters take on their journey, no matter how little relevance it bore to the central storyline. The author then culminated the book with a lackluster \\"climax\\" and resolution that left me wishing Id never read the book at all. Terrible book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter drivel","review":"Mr. Little, if this book is anything to go by, you are one of the laziest writers around.

It kept you on the edge of your seat and then when a scary part happens it makes you fling back into the back of your chair. This book is probably too complicated for young kids, but if you understand the book you'd like it to! The book is real long though, so you have to like to read if you're going to read this book.The book is about a guy named Glen, I don't think that's it, I forgot. He takes his car and drives far away to a city. He joins a group that digs up ancient artifacts. But once they start finding stuff, people start disappearing. Ancient skeletons and a monster that all have orange hair start roaming around killing people.My stepmother has read this book hundreds of times. She likes this book as much as I do. I enjoyed reading this book. I hope you will to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed - was expecting a lot more","review":"I was really expecting to be completely scared. Mr. Little has a great reputation for writing great horror stories, but this was not a great horror story. Way too many characters I could care less about, way too many random events taking place that I could care less about, and a \\"monster\\" that wouldn't scare my daughter if she saw it. There were so many bizarre, unexplained occurences that I kept expecting to be resolved and never did. And the ending!?!?!?!?!?!? What is up with that? It was as if Mr. Little ran out of ideas and just gave up. The best part of reading this novel is that I learned what not to do when writing my own tale of hororr/supernatural.

It's pretty bad. The book drags, doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and the ending is definitely a letdown. I wouldn't have guessed it was written by a professional. It almost seems a good template for how not to write a novel.There are some interesting scenes and details, the book isn't completely without merit, but overall the story is just a wet, sticky mess. Fewer ideas better executed would have made for a better read. There are so many little scenes and ideas and characters in this book and it never really comes together into anything cohesive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof the back cover shouldn't guide purchasing decisions","review":"I read the blurb on the back cover, and thought this book sounded interesting. How wrong I was. The overall plot was pretty confusing, and there were some things that were more ridiculous than scary. I know it is a horror fantasy, but the book doesn't even stay true to it's internal logic. It reads like a first draft rather than a final product.

Heed this warning and skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly Little's worst book to date","review":"I've read several of Mr. Little's books and overall am satisfied. His writing isn't as compelling as King, Masterton, Koontz, or Straub but something about the stories he writes I usually like. Not this one. I do have to say that the first 100 pages were most terrifying building up what I thought would be a fantastic read but from there it took a serious descent downhill.

However, despite the high reviews, this dress, for the high price I paid of $29, is of HORRIBLE quality! I bought this costume for my daughter's 5th birthday and within 2 hours (no rough playing at all) the ribbon around the waist was unraveling. Also, as my daughter was dressing in and out of it throughout the day, large holes ripped in the outer netting in a few places. The feel of this dress is also very bad. I wouldn't have minded so much if I paid $10 for it, but definitely not worth $30!!!!! I am very dissatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Money","review":"This is a nice anthology with some excellent selections, but there is really no justification for the high price tag. Close to 90% of the selections are in the public domain (this includes the translations. For $100 I should get a modern translation of Kant, not one that is over 100 years old!). All this material (again, including the translations) is readily available online for free. The introductions are very slim, not very informative and do not justify the extremely high cost. A book like this should cost around $30-$40.

The work is written from the point of view of analytic philosophy, and thus tend to give short shrift to some thinkers in the continental stream.

The articles cover topics mostly in Western philosophy (though fair treatment is given to non-Western thought), and are clear enough for the general reader to understand. Longer articles cover major thinkers and schools, while shorter articles treat topics ranging from the arcane to the absurd. My one complaint is its bias toward the Anglo-American idiom of philosophy. Though European thought is covered sufficiently, there is an irritating tendency (depending on the contributor) to not take the Continent as seriously. But all in all, this is the best volume of its kind that I have come across."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best General Book on Philosophy, with a qualification","review":"If there's one volume on philosophy to own, it is this one. Its entries on the canonical philosophers are in-depth and first-rate distillations. All the most famous thought experiments are summarized, and many of the more esoteric philosophical concepts explained. It is heavy on logical concepts; indeed, there's a decided Anglo-American Analytic bent.Which leads to my one problem with it. One thing for which the volume can be criticized is the lack of strong representation of contemporary Continental (post-structuralist or deconstructionist) thought. When it does appear, it is sometimes given a dressing-down of sorts. Thinkers like Foucault, Derrida, Jameson, Deleuze, Chomsky, Irigaray, etc. are given short shrift--and I myself am rather partisan to the analytic-pragmatic tradition, but I see no reason to virtually ignore these very important developments in critical fields."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Tim Augustine is not only a great writer he is an excellent speaker!!

Actually, there isn't much more to say about the film than what has probably been said countless times in other reviews. All I can say is: SEE IT!! It's a classic all the way.The Special Edition DVD is well worth the fifteen bucks I spent at Borders.

The level of gore is surprising, which is how you can tell that this isn't technically a \\"kids\\" movie, so care should be taken with young children (but saying that I'd have been 7 when I saw this and had no problem....but then Nightmare on Elm Street might have desensitised me a bit by that time) but it's essential viewing if only so that you can watch the sequel too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever...","review":"i bought this movie because of the cute cover, thinking it would be great for my kids. turns out its the scariest movie theyd ever watched, creeping them out for weeks to the point where they cant sleep in their own bed. i wish i could give it zero stars. not only is it absolutely terrifying and insanely creepy, even for me, a grown man, but the acting and special effects is so poorly done that i was laughing, which seemed to be the only comedic part of the film. i got this movie for two bucks, and it wasnt even worth that. it is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen. the worst parts are when the gremlins are having a huge party with inappropriate drinking and smoking, when the girl tells her horrific christmas eve story about how her father died in the chimney pretending to be santa, and when the narrator tells us at the end that \\"there might be a gremlin in your house\\" which put my children in tears. words cant describe the hatred i have for this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"for anyone","review":"This is a classic.

The flashdancing gremlin and the cocktail waiter gremlin who spins on the bar (it lasts for bout a 1/2 a second) kills me every time. The director Joe Dante is a genius of the absurd. I just wish most of his movies didn't bomb at the box office (American movie going tastes <are bad> if you ask me), so we could have seen more brilliance (Pick up Gremlins 2, which pretty much takes the Dorry's bar scene and extends it for the last 2/3rds of the movie.

Directed by legendary film director Steven Spielberg. This is one of the best movies ever made. This dvd contains ten mintutes of footage that was cut from the final version of the movie. This was a great movie but was a real hasle to shoot. An two commentaries about the film. For thoose of you that liked that sequel thank the writters for rewritting the script. If they had stuck to the original script the movie would have been more graphic and the sequel would not have been made. This movie is about a furry creature called a Mogwi. That is senstive to sunlight and multiples with water. It lead to the creation of the pg13 rating. This movie has a lot of violence and gory in it. I do not recommend it to any one under 13 unlessed surpervised. Can you young billy peletzer stop the Gremlins rampage or will Kingston Falls be utterlty destroyed.

Never did remember how bad the C.G.I. and puppets were in this movie. Gotta give it credit though.. it's an old movie. Wonder if they'll ever remake it into a modern day movie. Brought me back to my childhood and reminded me, \\"Not to turn into a Gremlin\\" ;)I especially remember the girls story and how her father got stuck in the chimney.

This one is in that category, and it's kind of a cult favorite, although I wouldn't call it \\"cultish.\\" It got wide viewing when it came out, and there are so many great scenes in this movie. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates head up this great movie, and when Zack's Dad comes back from the city with a gift for his son, beware, and make sure you don't feed it after midnight, or so the legend has it.As movies goes, this is terrific. And to see the part where the Gremlins wreak havoc on the small town, to include the minions of them singing \\"Heigh Ho\\" in the local theater is a riot!Highly recommended!! Lots of laughs!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This is a good movie. A must see movie for family night. It's not scary at all. I think Gizmo is the cutiest Gremlin. I wish he was real so I can have him as my own pet. I would like to also talk about Gremlins 2. That movie is a lot more fun to watch. The Gremlins have a lot of lines. They are funnnnnnnnyyyyyyy!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"START WITH NCAST","review":"I highly recommend starting with NCAST (baby cues)...the last CUE you want your baby to give you is a cry....a baby will use body language to tell you the exact same thing as the cry so why let them cry? When an infant cries the brain releases certain chemicals that have an effect on the neuro transmitters. After 35 seconds of crying those effects may become adverse. I am sure your baby will open its mouth, root (turning head into body), stick tongue out, make noises, etc BEFORE it will cry to tell you that it is hungry....that applies to all of the other \\"cries\\" as well....so don't waste your time or money on this please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eager","review":"I will be a first time mother (due in 3 months ) and I first heard about this on Oprah. I thought it was interesting at the time. I just read a few of the reviews and I was a bit skeptical at first about purchasing the DVD because of the negative reviews, but then I thought about how frustrating things can be as a first time mother and not being able to understand what my baby will be trying to say. So I am actually looking forward to viewing it. Even if it is 15-20 min on 2 disc... I'm sure it will be worth it in the long run when I am up at 2 am in the morning trying to figure out why my baby is fussing and how to soothe her. Mother intuition is best above all which I'm sure will be acquired along the way, but every little bit helps. The price I thought was okay... since I was originally going to purchase it on DunstanBaby.com (56.00)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced for amount of info...","review":"These videos are over priced for what they contain... although there is good information and demonstrations (ie. different burping/gas relieving positions) it wasn't THAT useful... slightly dissapointed as a new mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"First of all, this DVD has about 10 minutes worth of material. There is absolutely no reason to use 2 DVDs, so just by virtue of the packaging choice, you are being overcharged. Second of all, the Dunstan language is basically common sense distilled into 5 very basic points. You \\"learn\\" how to understand the cries for hunger, tiredness, burping, gas and discomfort. When I watched the video, my baby was 2 months old, and I felt like I already knew my baby's basic cries, just as I suspect any parent would. Furthermore, the video includes \\"solutions\\" to address the various cries, but the \\"solutions\\" are ridiculously obvious. For example, she tells you that when you hear the hunger cry, the \\"solution\\" is to feed your baby! Seriously, you'd have to be very dense to benefit from the information in this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"Am a first time mom and bought this book thinking i would learn a thing or two about new borns. I was very disappointed with this product and regreted having bothered buying it. If i could return the product i would. The content have no substance, very poorly narrated and some of what's discussed are things that are so obvious that even a 10 year old would know to do. There were two CD's that came in the case and i barely watched the first one, that's how terrible it was. Save your money for something educative and worth buying. Very amateur production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Limited Crying","review":"We've got twins and bought this before they were born. It was a LIFESAVER! I was dubious at first about it being accurate, but within the first week we were able to decipher our babies' cries. Consequently, we were able to give them what they wanted and the crying stop. We had really very limited crying in the first four or five months thanks to this DVD and being on a strict schedule. My babies didn't need to cry because we were either meeting their needs before they knew they had them with the schedule, or addressing it promptly when they began to fuss by deciphering their cries. I've given it as gifts to my other friends as well. Thank god we had it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dunstan Baby Language","review":"I found the Dunstan Baby Language DVD to be an excellent resource. With my first child, I didn't recognize that his cries were different, and it was very stressful trying to figure out what he needed.

My wife and I thought we were coping (as this was our second child), but were finding being parents of a newborn again very stressful. We watched the DVD's and straight away started to hear the different cries of our baby. It is now week 8 and James is a settled and relaxed little bub because we know what he needs. The supporting info helps and there are some good settling techniques. Much less stress and we get a lot more sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"way, way overpriced. . .","review":"While a small percentage of the information contained in the DVDs is interesting and useful, I thought it was incredibly tacky the way these DVDs are marketed. First of all, each DVD is only 30 minutes long, and includes 15 minutes of testimonials on each DVD. Within the remaining 15 minutes per DVD, you learn 3 words apiece, followed by basic baby care techniques that aren't particularly well presented. There's absolutely NO reason for the package to come in 2 DVDs, except so they can charge more for it. There's only about 15 minutes of original material here. I would borrow but NOT buy this particular item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I Bought the DVD a month after I had our beautiful baby girl Larissa.I must say it was an act of desperation. She just cried and cried and cried.I received the DVD on a Friday afternoon and by Monday the relief wasintense. I got it! A week later now and I hear her cry and instantly knowwhat she wants. I'm not saying she doesn't cry at all anymore, I can justfigure out why a lot quicker and calm her so much faster so that she doesn't become wrought with distress. There are so many world shattering smiles now.The DVD was simple, laid out in plain language. I found it got better after a couple of watches to really get my ear in tune. I recommend it for EVERY new parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I agree that the product is a little expensive and could easily have been formatted to one DVD. However, the information is priceless and SO helpful. Of course, you can successfully raise a baby without it.

When I did it showed up on my CC statement 3 times and when I emailed them to resolve it, I got on some kind of spam list that has me (and others) receiving \\"unsubscribe\\" emails from all over.

My third child (4 months) has almost never had to cry for a need -I know exaclty what he's saying and give him what he's asking for: be it food, pats on the back, or just a nap.

None of her techniques are actually demonstrated on babies. She uses dolls to show the techniques. I saw her on Oprah in the summer of '06, and everything you need to know was during that show. If you can find it, just watch the archive of the show and save the money.The basic cries are inconsistent in my newborn, but occasionally helpful. Trial and error with diaper changes, burping, and nursing gets me the same results.Overall, for a nervous first time mom or desperate parent it might not be bad. We are first-timers and found the info interesting but not very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I wish that I had gotten this before my son was born. It takes patience and careful listening, but I am able to hear what my baby is saying to me about 80+% of the time. The crying spells are reduced because I'm not blindly trying to find the cause of his discomfort. I learned my baby is particularly gassy and in need of more burping than I thought. Now that I know this I can take preventative measures and help relieve his discomfort before it becomes unbearable. As a new parent, it has helped me to relax and built my confidence in my ability to care for my newborn. It's an amazingly simple premise, but it is fascinating. The responsibility is on the parent to listen carefully to their child to learn their sounds, but with a little effort you'll get the hang of it within a few days. I highly recommend this to motivated parents. NOTE: This \\"language\\" applies to babies between birth and 3 months. After that the language clues are diminished or disappear."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!!","review":"This is my first review ever...but I felt compelled to recommend the Dunstan Baby Language DVD, especially to new mothers. It took me a little while to hear the sounds within the cry, but after a couple of days I was able to distinquish them each and every time. As a first-time mom, it has given me the tools needed to understand why my baby is crying and provide him comfort more quickly which has made me more confident in this new, wonderful role, and most importantly I can tend to my baby's needs sooner. I am sharing this DVD with another soon-to-be new mom and I will ask her to pass it on to another...and so on. It really does work. Thank you Priscilla Dunstan for sharing your special gift with the world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It may work for our baby...","review":"It may work for our new born baby, but I don't think that spending $40.00 USD for a DVD is worth it. To learn the 5 baby words, we spend a total of 36-minutes and means of addressing them. Another 24-minutes is bonus material as to \\"what parents are saying\\". All in all, you get 1-hour worth of material, that appears to have been taped in one take, should be costing no more than $10.00 USD.

The euro-pop group retains it's cheesy, energetic sound, but brings a much more mature edge to the prodceedings. I anxiously bought this album while on holiday in Mexico, but I must admit I was very disappointed by it at first. For the past few weeks I have only liked a couple of tracks on the album, but after re-listening to the entire CD, I have found some great tracks that I had missed the first time around. \\"Aquarius\\" ia actually a good album, but is more heavy Euro-pop as opposed to Euro-dance. My favorite track is, without a doubt, \\"Around The World\\". It is an incredible song that sounds a lot like '70s super group ABBA. My other favorites are \\"Bumble Bees\\" and \\"Goodbye To The Circus\\". Overall, this is a very nice effort from AQUA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop culture at it's best and worst!","review":"I really enjoy Aqua's music and style, so it is no surprise that I enjoyed this CD (especially the first three tracks!).....the perfect CD to listen to when you feel like the world is just giving you too much stress to handle.

'Aquarius' is filled with nice, upbeat tunes, but the content of the songs is a bit off the wall. This album is definitely cleaner than 'Aquarium,' in terms of subject matter, but this CD still makes me wonder, \\"What were they thinking?\\" Songs like 'Halloween' and 'Freaky Friday' will definitely have you thinking, \\"Huh?\\" In my opinion, songs like those should've been dropped for more stuff like 'We Belong To The Sea' or 'Good Guys.' Don't get me wrong. Those songs will definitely have you dancing and singing along (like 'Cartoon Heroes'), but they could've done better. Overall, if you're into bubblegum-techno, BritPop music and a die-hard Aqua fan, get this CD. Otherwise, pass on this and get 'Aquarium' or some similar group's CD (I recommend the Vengaboys' new one ^^)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it for Lene","review":"The reason this got 4 stars is cause there is too much focus on the guys.

I think their first CD, Aquarium, is better than this one. Aquarium has happier music and are more like to be dance tracks. I found \\"Cartoon Heroes\\" too much comercial. \\"Around the World\\" is fine. There are other fine musics also, but I bought this CD expecting something like \\"Barbie Girl\\", \\"Dr. Jones\\", \\"My oh My\\", \\"Lollipop\\", \\"Roses are red\\" or \\"Turn Back Time\\", but this CD was disappointing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Endorphin Release-o-rama","review":"From start to finish, this album is a trippy pop dance-o-rama that raises endorphins to a hefty high.

Despite a few catchy songs, the lyrics and melodies are almost too ridiculous. And the only reason I say almost is b/c Aqua has created many great songs on their first CD using horrendously ... lyrics, yet made it work. If you're looking for a good club/dance CD, buy the first one which (I think) 80% of the songs are great (notice I don't say it has substance though). Stay away from this ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Aquarium","review":"To say it, this album was much different from the group's first album, 'Aquarium'. The songs, with the exception of 'Bumble Bee', are basically about nothing but strange subjects. The song 'Halloween' just freaked me out, and Cuba Libre? Let's just say I had no idea what THEY were trying to say. Not quite rock, pop, romance, or even rap. Maybe Aqua could start their own category--Aquatic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Followup (In My Opinion)","review":"I am going to try not to be as positive as possible. First, this CD did not capture me at all and I was not interested in it one bit. Unlike it's US debut \\"Aquarium\\" which was really fun, in a cheesy sort of way. This was way too cheesy for me. None of the songs were that good and I can't even remember one that I liked. I gave it 2 stars only because I loved their debut CD and liked this CD on the 2nd time around, but not the 1st or the 3rd. It think that you should purchase \\"Aquarium\\" instead, but get some other opinions before you make your final decision. Who knows, you might really like it as many people have here at Amazon.com! But, this CD was nothing for me, a flop. Most of the public agreed with me on this one, too. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"repetative and boring","review":"This album is a total let down. After listening to Cartoon Heroes, the first track, and then the 2nd track, I was thinking \\"hey this might be a good album\\". Man was I ever disappointed.

The content and lyrics is for 7 year olds at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetative and boring","review":"believe you me, its not worth buying. Download Cartoon Heroes and spare yourself the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, untoughtful and drained of all the fun","review":"Their first album was listenable, but this album proves that you can't go making 20 listenable songs with the same beat, same hook, and more silly lyrics. They are funny, maybe provocative in a never-never land kind of way, but that's as far as this album goes. I respect them for making the music they enjoy, but it's hard to find any talent behind all the cartoon creativity. This is a flop, just another bubble gum, disposable collection of shallow songs. If you like silly songs, with no meanings, and if you don't pay attention to lyrics, and 50 minutes of the same continous beat, this is the album for you. Otherwise, stay away from Aqua, and rely on the talents and masterminds of true pop music such as Madonna or Ace of Base."},{"rating":"2","title":"They do it again","review":"Aqua does it again. They first were known for Barbie Girl and now this great album. Their music is just fun, happy and stimulating. Cartoon Heroes is just a youthful great track, Freaky friday just makes me think of the classic childrens' movie. OK, well Bumble Bee... a little more adult oriented if you pick up on it, but it just makes you smile its so happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I am confused","review":"Other than the CD rom, I found nothing practical or inspiring in this book.

What a great gift and a great toy. We had a Memorial Day Cook Out on our Cul de Sac and we had kids from 2 to 42 playing with it. Flights ranged from 5 seconds to 5 minutes and my 5 year old was one of the few who was able to master it and get a good long flight....I think the children below five mainly were just chasing the plane around as it flew - so I think about five would be the minimum age. The plane is fairly durable and survived many crashes and tree landings and the subsequent game of \\"throw the football to knock the plane out of the tree!\\" The plane is very light and I doubt it could be flown in much wind so be careful with that. On the plus side the light weight makes it difficult for it to hurt anybody. It is fairly difficult to control precisely as the only control you have is throttle and yaw...and you can only control yaw if you give it some throttle. Otherwise, this plane gets a five for fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a killer book...","review":"A very intriguing book that tackles perhaps the most challenging question of human behavior.

But, with the Nintendo Wii, there are some accessories that not even Nintendo would consider recommending. That is the case with Intec's Wii wired nunchuck controller. The device is not really a strong bet if you need a extra peripheral for the Nintendo Wii. Not only does it not handle well when you play games like Super Mario Galaxy, and The Legend Of Zelda: Skyward Sword, but can easily cost you the game. Overall, if you need another nunchuck add-on, you are just better off with getting one from Nintendo itself.Price: D-Control: DOverall: D 1/2-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality- Beware","review":"I recently bought the Gaiam 4mm Eco Conscious Rubber Yoga mat because i want to practice my yoga on a environmentally friendly high quality mat. After receiving this mat, i am EXTREMELY disappointed. I feel cheated. They claim that it is 4mm, but i measured it to be 2mm between the bumps and maximum 3mm on the bumps. The mat is very flimsy,stretchy and slippery. After 1 use it looks like it is rubbing apart.Gaiam claims that it is a natural rubber mat, but it sure does not feel like a natural rubber mat. I have used a natural rubber mat at my studio, but it is completly different that this mat. Even my instructor questions whether this is actually a natural rubber mat, since it feels so different than the high quality natural rubber mat at the studio.

Most importantly, it provides deeper insights into nutrition that no other book has touched--insights that really make a difference in health. I've read other books by Dr. Tips and they all have been jam packed with valuable information. This book is undoubtedly his best work to date.

How can we like our hero, Max? He thinks with his you know what, and his lack of commitment and his own egotistic desires brands him superficial and super-boring. Kristen is almost as bad, she falls for anything; Maggie is a Jekyll-Hyde lesbian with more teeth than a comb; Nicole is a self-centered and murdering golddigger; Chris Daniel is a cop with no sense of humor and some of the stiffest dialogue ever written.While the ending does pull a good surprise, it's torture getting there.NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was good......","review":"Never Forget was a good book with some great characters.

It was so much fun to read, and I also learned a great deal about keeping kosher and other aspects of Judaism. I am Jewish, but of the \\"secular\\" sort Erlich frequently mentions in regard to her parents; thus there was much I did not know. It is true, as other reviewers have commented, that the parts about the difficulties of keeping kosher become a bit redundant by book's end. Still, this was one of the best reads I've had in a long time, and I'd recommend it to anyone, Jewish or not, who wants to connect with the (VERY different, though by the clock not that long ago) time in which our grandparents and great grandparents lived.

Software won't run without that little devil","review":"What EastWest will not tell you, and you have to look for on their site in small print, is the dongle called \\"iLok\\". They make you buy it for about $40, or your software wont work.I have not gotten around to actually review the software for quality - got the Silver version for Christmas.It just bugs me that they cannot tell you about the \\"iLok\\". Other software, like Cubase, include their dongle. So why can't EastWest manage that? Sad that they have to treat their customers like that.And what the other reviewer said about not being able to sell your songs if you like? That just sucks big time too.

This book made me pine for my home state. I remember big sprawling cattle ranches like the book described. My dad used to take me hunting on some property he owned with several men. The palmettos, boar, gators, deer, armadillos were common place. Like the setting of A Land Remembered. Every time I go back to visit I see another piece of \\"old Florida\\" being swallowed up by developments, malls and sprawl. This book was so enlightening too. I never thought about how the early Florida settlers lived. This book also reminded me of The Yearling.

It is an interesting story following the life of a pioneer family. The way it is written makes you feel like you are right there with them. I felt the hardships that they endured in the story.

The cities mentioned in the book really existed - I looked them up in an atlas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure Trove of Florida History","review":"By the time I read this book I had been working for the National Park Service in Canaveral Seashore for a year. What I felt lacking in my knowledge about central Florida of the mid 1800's to the present was answered in the sweep of the story of the McIvey's and their fictional footprint on the savannahs and hammocks of Florida. The book used the templete of known happenings, areas, weather, flora and fauna to give a three dimensionality to this pivotal era and helped me bring alive Florida to the visitors to our lovely park. The book is a JEWEL and should be a MUST READ for anyone who loves history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ryan D","review":"\\"A Land Remembered\\" is a truly excellent book.

You will be transported back to a time in Florida's History from the mid 1800's thru the middle of this century. You will take part in a family's struggle to make it in this harsh land before air-conditioning and mosquito control. You will stand in awe, laugh and cry with this family thru three generations of an inspiring journey. You will not put this book down all night and when done you will say one word, \\"WOW!&quot"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for every Floridian","review":"This account of Florida pioneers was spellbinding. It was recommended by a history major even though it was fiction. Apparently is it a fixture in the FSU history department. Major events in Florida history are wound around a family that emigrates from Georgia. The dynasty moves on to the founders of Miami (early on, called 'Fort Dallas.'). It is a good read and yes, we cried when the characters we loved died. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great way to learn Florida history!!!","review":"Being a native Floridian with real \\"Crackers\\" in my family tree, I found this book mesmerizing.

I excitedly tried to load the book on my Kindle, but sadly the book is not offered for Kindle.(A study-guide review is offered for Kindle.) I was able to order the paperback version from Amazon.com. The pricing was fair and the shipping was expedient. The book proved to be a fun, quick read. It is not a 'deep' book, but offers insight into Florida's history by following a ficticious family through 3 generations. The book is well written and provides an enjoyable insight into Florida's past and the progression to present day Florida. The story gave me an appreciation for Florida's natural beauty versus the manmade 'Disney' version of today. This book was just the diversion I needed at the stressful Holiday time of year. I recommend it highly to anyone wanting a pleasant easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Land Remembered - Florida's novel","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read.

I highly recommend it for a great read as well as a history of Florida."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased","review":"Anybody who is interested in Florida history needs to read this book, it is very inform-able and interesting, one of those books a person doesn't want to put down, not just explaining how people lived and survived in the swamplands but it is written in story form with people and names and you feel like you are going through it too, very good book, I've read other books on Florida but this is the best!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OLD FLORIDA","review":"Absolutely loved this book. A true depiction of old Florida. Will keep this one on my bookshelf. As a sixth generation Floridian I can relate. Florida has changed so much since I was small. The woods and fields that I played in as a child are no more. The book also showed the pioneering spirit. My great great grandfather drove cattle from South Florida (Tampa area) during the Civil War. He is now listed on a monument in Plant City at the old high school (where my father attended) as a member of the \\"Cow Calvary\\". My grandfather ran beef cattle on the old homestead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching an episode of Bonanza","review":"This book has been lauded up and down the State of Florida for its wonderful historical content. But when any tale is as badly imagined and poorly written as this one, isn't it also necessarily true that that we must question its historical accuracy as well? From the stereotyped Indians, speaking in their unbelievably clear, brief, measured syllables, to the aw shucks blacks, to the backwoods men themselves and the wise all-knowing cook/womenfolk they marry, there are no real people. It is as if Patrick Smith has peopled his land with a lot of little plastic action figures like the kind boys used to get in a bag. Even the countryside itself isn't well depicted. Land Remembered is like a western in reverse - how the West Was Lost. All Patrick Smith adds to formulaic western writing is a little cheap bitterness. Read Peter Matthiessen. Read The Little House on the Prairie books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flat story of a flat place.","review":"The characters are not believable and the plot is is not engaging.

WHATS UP WITH THESE NAMES?- yeah this book was not only stupid and pointless but all of the characters were so unbelievably ignorant that it was hard to bring myself to turn the page.ZECH= MAN WHORE- tawanda or glenda???? the choice was obvious for me but of course by the end of the book i realized he picked glenda who was not my choice. =) what can i say i guess i have bad taste. but seriously lets get real, girls dont say stuff like.. \\"its cold, put your arm around me\\"OVERALL- i have to read volume 2 next. i would rather shoot myself"},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly good read!","review":"This is not my type of book...I'm more of a mystery thriller type of fan. But a friend recommended this book, and after a couple of chapters, I was hooked. This was a good story about growing up in the deep south, and never giving up, no matter what nature throws at you. Tobias and Emma started it all, and with good hearts and open minds, raised a family in the scrub. There were difficult times, but the family was strong and persevered. Tobias' son Zech had the foresight to purchase thousands of acres of land that became more valuable as time wore on. Unfortunately, with time also comes progress, and good ole days that are gone forever. As a friend recommended this to me, I now recommend it to you. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Florida Book Ever","review":"When my Aunt Nila first sent me a copy of ALR I was not impressed with a \\"trashy\\" romance triangle cover. However, on a beach weekend, I grabbed the copy and when I had read the first few pages on Jupiter Beach, I was immediately transported into Patrick Smith's endearing tale of three generations of the MacIvey family and their struggle for survival in early Florida. I would say that 85% of all the honor students I have taught at Coral Gables High in Miami rank this as one of their all-time favorite books. Many have reread it a second time. Smith depicts pioneer life graphically. He is stronger on plot and setting than character and helps teach us a strong respect for the land and a preservation of our past and heritage. This is a great book to teach for environmental concepts and for a love of a sense of place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"An excellent introduction to Florida whether you be 96 or 6 years old! Especially if you've come from outside of the state and think you've come to \\"paradise\\". Here Smith has well strung together the many events that brought Florida to where it is today. Along with presenting characters that are very much like like the real life pioneers and carpetbaggers that help put our state together.One of the admirable parts of his endeavor was to start with the main characters crossing into the state from Georgia and then to travel the family to south Florida and the treks back and forth to Punta Rassa. This is written very well. Those who know the history of Florida will find this an acurate portrayal. Others might want to follow the map that accompanies the book.Do yourself a favor and enjoy the history, heritage and culture of Florida while reading a sweeping adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A land Remembered","review":"A great read.

Although it is technically a fictional story, it seems very real and gives the reader realistic insight on what it was like in FL in the late 1800's, what really happened to the indians that lived here before us, what happened to our wetland resources, how did a few people come to be so filthy rich, many questions that I had before reading the book.

Don't allow yourself to impulse-buy this.","review":"I originally bought these for my new espresso machine. They arrived packed loose, just wrapped in bubble wrap, so I guess they are just sitting on a shelf somewhere in a warehouse waiting to be purchased. One of them had a stain on the stainless steel part, and when I washed it it wouldn't come out. So I sent them back. Return was easy enough and my money was refunded promptly. Thanks for that, Amazon. I guess they just weren't what I was expecting.If you are charmed by the combination of stainless steel and porcelain like I was, take a closer look. When you are holding it in your hand it doesn't feel as nice as a solid-porcelain cup would have. The stainless steel base is hollow and it just looks and feels awkward.

I have read a lot of the titles off of Oprah's book list but this is by far the worst of them all. I find the main character so obnoxious and annoying that I spend majority of the time angry at her. I am unsure if Ms.Gilchrist expected us to feel sorry for Rhoda or if she wanted us to hate her. The story isn't funny, it isn't sad, it isn't anything except a waste of time. I typically enjoy stories that are set in the South because I find the whole atmosphere of the area of intoxicating but this did not do the South justice. I really enjoy poetry but the amount of poetry in this book is over the top. We are expected to believe that Rhoda is really brilliant but her personality does not fit her supposed intelligence. The book's jacket summary gives the idea of a fullfilling and warm novel but it is really lacking and cold.

Peck's in fine form and Sophia has never, for my money, looked so beautiful (she even does a semi-nude shower scene). Things move along swiftly and the film is chocked full of wonderful moments. There's a memorable Mancini score, too. However, the fine wide-screen cinematography is lost on this pan & scan version (the film was shot with zero regard for television viewing). Let's hope the folks at Universal realize the value of this gem and release it on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hitchcock-like Comedy/Thriller","review":"Sophia Loren, one of the world's wonders, is excellent in this tale of espionage and mistaken identity.

Oh, what a lucky man!Peck possesses his usual classic \\"cool\\" as his character and Loren's are forced to elude capture by evil Arabs bent on derailing a peace process. Alan Badel is elegantly evil as the head honcho behind the conspiracy.And, contrary to an earlier reviewer, the memorable score was composed by American legend Henry Mancini. I know because I own a copy! Mancini's trademark use of subtle horns is highly effective in creating a feeling of doom during the tense moments. His rollicking themes utilized during the various \\"chase\\" sequences shows why he was an Academy Award winner.Stanley Donan, know for directing the much-similar \\"Charade\\" starring Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, does an outstanding job at the helm of \\"Arabesque.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Stars, Big Mess","review":"Most of my favorite films are 50s-60s.

Reading the book was very rewarding. I ended up buying another copy to give to my niece who I had intended to give the book to in the first place. I really recommend this to anyone who uses the Internet and wants to catch up and those who are new and want to get onto the Internet. I think this would be a great textbook for Internet classes too!

Regrettably, the book is almost utterly hagiographic: It contains little critical discernment and substitutes summary for scholarship. All in all, typical of the Jungian approach to historical enquiry: full of names, self-justifying, occasionally interesting, but more like cotton candy (vanishing upon consumption) than like true intellectual or psychological nourishment.

Rock Hudson seems heroically determined to invite rumors by pretending to be unsure of his sexuality (\\"Just because you can light a stove doesn't mean you can cook\\") and even creeping back into his apartment wearing nothing more than a woman's fur coat (\\"He's the last guy I would have figured...\\" notes one onlooker) while a somewhat sidelined Doris Day gets married as she's rushed into the delivery room. Along the way Tony Randall practically invents both of the Crane brothers and sets up about three seasons worth of plots for Frasier as his neurotic boss.

I didn't see that there was anything romantic about it; there would have been if someone had rewritten the script and left out the fifty-something crude jokes along with the shot of Doris Day jumping out of Rock Hudson's bed with bare legs. It wasn't tasteful at all, much more like a modern movie, and if I want to see unromantic vulgarity, I'll go to the theater and watch \\"Love Actually\\". The very reason why I watch old movies is to escape the crudeness this movie promotes!I enjoyed \\"Send Me No Flowers\\" and \\"Pillow Talk\\" very much, but this one was off the edge. I wouldn't waste my money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Doris Day and Rock Hudson movies are my favorites. I wish they had made more movies together.

The picture is so grainy I don't enjoy watching it. I'll probably never watch the DVD. Universal should have done a much better job of transferring this movie to DVD. I'm very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer in LA","review":"... well maybe it's summer in most of North America. My voice is always biased and with that I am easily found encouraging all to check out David's music. At times I miss the band sound of Smart Brown Handbag but David's influence is so heavy that be it a solo record or full \\"band\\", one still gets a similar essence. A few weeks ago I heard the Doors while visiting Manhattan and it felt right. David's music, though not Doors-like, also strikes me as that sort of \\"soundtrack for anything\\" music and thus making it truly valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong product","review":"While I have no real problem with the edition I was sent, it was not what I ordered. I thought I ordered the pictured edition, used, but when I received it, found the Cambridge Edition--a fine edition, but not what I needed for my particular purposes. Oh, well. The notes will come in handy sometime, I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version very difficult to read","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer - The Cambridge School Shakespeare series is outstanding. As a homeschooling parent I have been able to teach Shakespeare using the extensive notes, illustrations, vocabulary and other tools in the Cambridge Shakespeare texts.The structure of the paper version of these books is very conducive to reading the play and studying it. Unfortunately the structure of the electronic version is very difficult to read. The notes are mixed in with the text randomly, not put in linked footnotes or end notes as one may expect. Thus as you read your Kindle version expect to be forced to either jump pages frequently or simply move back and forth from the Bard's text to the editors explanatory notes. It makes following the flow of the text extremely difficult!If you are interested in the electronic version of this text you really should check a sample first (wish I had!) to be sure you can follow this confusing chaos of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed","review":"I bought this book because I thought it would give me a more indepth look into this remarkable man's life. Instead, I found myself severly dissapointed. The book does give a good overview of the world around St. Assisi, but really didn't give me any new insight into the facts surrounding the man. Not only that, the author seems to be delving into an almost Jungian religious view. I would not have minded a Catholic view (because St. Assisi was obviously Catholic)or a secular view, but I found the author's choice of religious viewpoint to be completely without rational or support."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any movie buff","review":"I discovered this book through JoBlo's website, and it's a wonderful take on all of our fave films. Jo not only gives a fair and honest review to some of the best movies out there, he includes fascinating tidbits on \\"behind-the-scenes\\" action, as well as why he found each film so engrossing. It's as well-written as the reviews you find on his website, each chapter endowed with Jo's razor-sharp humour and wit.I've recommended this book to all of my fellow film-loving friends.

She was hospitalized twice during the month of November 2011 due to complications from falls. She lives alone and one of her falls was when she was getting up from the toilet, she tumbled forward onto the floor, hitting her head unable to get up all night. This seat gives her stability and extra height when sitting down or rising from the toilet. The hand holds and four legs make it wonderfully stable. I wish now I'd bought her one of these months ago but I'm glad she has it now. She loves it. I plan to get one for my home as soon as I make the decision to have my hip joints replaced. It looks good and works very well. It does not wobble. The secret words are stability, endurance, and trust.

In reality it is not any wider than a seat I already had w/o support legs, that cost half as much. I can not sit comfortably on the seat. my hips press against the arms on both sides, and since my stitches are there, it's painful.

However, it can freely move a few inches back and forth, leading to instability when sitting down or standing, especially for people with impaired mobility. That's because the size of the part that sits inside the toilet bowl is a few inches shorter in the front-to-back dimension than the opening in an elongated toilet bowl.I came up with a solution, using a bungee cord strapped to the two back legs and stretched around the back of the toilet, which prevents the seat from moving resulting in a much safer configuration. However, it would have been far superior if this product were available in a second version for elongated toilets with an insert designed for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"This toilet was extremely low and could never hold 400 lbs...

I only seem to remember about 14. This really should have been a single CD, but she had to make the same mistake George Michael made by trying to fill 2 discs with \\"almost hits\\". Funny thing is they both put the \\"love songs\\" on disc 1, and the \\"dance songs\\" on disc 2. Even funnier, George is on this CD. Anyway. The other mistake Whitney (or somebody) made was remixing half this collection. Was she that embarrassed with some of her stuff, or did she just forget that people buy \\"hits\\" collections to hear the songs the way they're used to hearing them. Put out a remix album if you want to chop them up that bad. On a positive note, half these tracks are the originals, they do sound good, and this is the only way to get everything in the same place."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING!","review":"For years I've been anxiously awaiting her greatest-hits CD only to be let down with this garbage.As you may well know, it's a two CD set. The first one is good. It has her memoriable ballards. It's the second one that is totally off the wall (the \\"THROW DOWN\\" CD). It features her famous fast-pace hits. But instead of the original arrangements, most are rediculous remixes.As far as I know, no one asked Whitney and those other fools to mess with the original cuts. People will buy this double CD set for the great song they remember . . . THAT'S WHY THEY WOULD GO OUT AND BUY A \\"GREATEST HIT\\", \\"BEST OF\\" OR AN \\"ANTHOLOGY\\" CD!The remix of the song \\"I WANNA DANCE WITH SOMEBODY (WHO LOVES ME)\\" was so trashy that I didn't even want to hear it all the way through. What she and her cohorts did was a disrespect.If you're a real Houston fan you'd have the good sense to stay away from this one, but then you probably have all her albums anyway.Charles"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Down and Throw Down!","review":"I bought this 2-CD release when it came about in 2000 because Whitney's one of the 80's artists I grew up listening to. I enjoyed it very well! It has ALL THE HITS BY THE GREATEST VOICE OF ALL TIME!!! If you are a collector or a superfan of hers, please don't let this one pass you by. This diva's voice is creamy and passionate and classy and all 32 flavors!!! The only disappointment I felt was that her dance hits did not come in their original form, they were remixed and I did not feel good when the remix version of \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)\\" came on because the techno beat erased Whitney's feel-good laugh in that song. Plus, this greatest hits package did not contain her \\"Miracle\\", a song that makes me nostalgic for the good ol' days.BUT!!!! Don't let that discourage you from adding WHITNEY HOUSTON to your CD collection. Bonus tracks: \\"One Moment In Time\\" and \\"The Star Spangled Banner.\\" Enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitney Rocks","review":"This is Whitney's ultimate greatest hist collection. My favorite songs are her classic '80s dance hits, such as \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody.\\" I also really enjoy \\"I Will Always Love You.\\" No matter what I listed to on this collection Whitney sounds amazing. I took off 1 star only because there was not any new material, but other than that it's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remastered collection of music!","review":"I really loved both CDs in this collection! Yes, the second CD has dance mixes....some of which I remember more than the original version.

RIP Whitney you are the voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will always love you","review":"I have been a fan of Whitney since day #1. I like this CD because it contains the original version of her hits plus several that are recorded as a mix ideal for dancing. I wasn't familiar with all the duets that were included, but they were very good. I was most happy to see the national anthem included. Her version is the best by far of any celebrity. I would have it sung at all functions that use the Star Spangled Banner. It sends chills up and down my spine. It is too bad that her Greatest Hits came out and then she hit a dry spell. There are a couple of songs off the 2009 release that should also be considered as hits as well including the title track - I Look to You. I think that's where her head and heart were in her final days. i will probably wear out this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen of Pop Music","review":"I received the cd's after a while, they were brand new, and her vocals are from heaven. She is a lovely and beautiful woman, and singer. Her tone is pleasant, the quality of music is great, unique image, great style, lots of real emotions, conviction, feelings. The lyrics will build a connection with you, the listener. She will always be a talented amazing vocalist. The Queen of pop music, the greatest voice of all time. So many great songs.We will always love you Whitney Houston :)."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's lost it","review":"Just another example of Houston's total loss of professional astuteness. The remixes are laughable. Who wants to listen to dance remixes? Listen closely, and her more recent recordings - beginning with the insipid \\"I Will Always Love You\\" - and especially the new cuts, show obvious vocal decline. The woman has literally screamed (what voice she had) away. She literally cannot hold a note for more than a couple of words, and she frequently lapses into the horrific habit of taking breaths in the middle of words. Houston, at the beginning of her career, showed great promise. She surrounded herself with top-notch producers and sang (somewhat) quality material. Somewhere along the way, she's lost sight of what she wants to be....a balladeer, an R&B singer or a Hip-Hop nightmare. Mark my word. Houston's career is on a downslide and her sales will certainly reflect that. If you like her, buy her old CDs and SKIP THIS ONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why have a second Cd.","review":"I don't know whose idea it was to ruin the second cd with remixes, but they should lose their job. The remixes ruin the great hits. If I had realized that the CD had so many ruined songs I never would have purchased it. If anyone reads this note who is someone at a record label, I would like to tell you this. Remixes are garbage and should never be allowed to be released on a greatest hits album. You should be kicked out of the business."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSE ADVERTISING at its WORST","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS CD! This CD is the worst excuse for a Greatest Hits I have ever had the misfortune of buying. I feel ripped off! I wanted to give it NO STARS or NEGATIVE STARS, but this system won't let you. It is truly that bad! Whitney Houston is THE greatest vocalist of our time, but this is NOT original music as you are led to believe by the title \\"Greatest Hits\\". It is AWFUL/PAINFUL remakes of techno-disco with synthesizers and Whitney in a can sounding mixes that destroy her songs. It is a disgrace to her name and her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Me like a lot of other people were eagerly anticipating a greatest hits package from Whitney Houston. While a lot of the hits are here, there are things missing like the original version of \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\", \\"Miracle\\", and \\"Love Will Save The Day\\". Another song I hoped would show up on this compilation was \\"Moment Of Truth\\" which was released only as the B-Side of \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\\" which is also not here in it's original version. The remixes on disc two is what really ruins this package, I would have preferred some of the original 12\\" mixes of the earlier cuts over the weak house mixes included here. What seemed like a good idea, putting ballads on one disc, and uptempo cuts on the other, much like the George Michael greatest hits package, the Whitney set leaves a lot to be desired. Only for the extremely hardcore fan. Fans of the original versions, wait for the remastered CD's of her catalog albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was a choice for \\"0\\" stars","review":"What a disappointment. This cuts from the disks, particularly the second have lost their melody and are nothing more than a cacophonous blasting of sound. The rhythm, beat, and style of the originals are lost. I found the album to be a total waste of money and an insult to her fans.Stop before you buy. It certainly is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Whitney CD you want.","review":"I don't know whose idea it was, but the second CD in this collection is a travesty. Every song on the second CD, save the Star Spangled Banner, is thoroughly trashed as a dance \\"remix.\\" Now, I've heard remixed songs in the past that I've liked, particularly if they've hewn close to the soul of the song or retained the hooks that made it good in the first place. But every one of these remixes is bombastic and most of them bury Whitney's voice somewhere under all the bad electronica. If you want any of the songs listed on the second CD, just get the CD they were originally on. This package is a waste of your money. It's too bad, too. The first CD gets it right, but the second one gets it so wrong, the package is simply ruined. I'm selling this one back to a used dealer as soon as I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring non exciting and disappointing","review":"i expected one cd with hits, another with great remixes. what a disappointment ! first cd is okay with hits, but not all and it features also forgotten songs that aren't really hits ! then second cd is a totally disapointing one ! the remixes are short versions ! what can u expect when it fades at the right time ? then, the original versions of hits remixed are not there.... no original version of queen of the night, always better than this foolish shorten remix. indeed, a bad point for this cd. could have been great like this : 2 cds of greatest hits and 2 cs of long versions of remixes !"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst possible cd","review":"This cd is the same as william hung.

Whitney Houston is a great artist and I think we've waited long enough for this collection. But it could not have come at a better time.

I loved the new song \\"Same Script, Different Cast\\", and I think it will go on to be another #1 hit. The second album was pretty good, but I would have rather had some more of the original songs, and less of the Re-Mixes. Some of the re-mixes are pretty good, but I would have rather had songs like \\"I Wanna dance With Somebody\\" and \\"Be My Baby Tonight\\" left as originals. I was pleased that they included the song \\"one moment in time\\" as a bonus track.

The first CD covers all of Ms. Houston's big hits from 1985 to the present and adds a few bonus selections in. This CD exemplifies how much she has grown vocally over the last 15 years, and is great listening.The second CD, \\"Throw Down\\" is a collection of remixes of the same hits with a few extras added in. With one or two exceptions, these mixes sound alike, don't make much sense by themselves, and are pretty annoying all together. If I want to dance, I'll go to a club, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen Of The Night Still Reigns On","review":"There is no denying about the music of Whitney Houston. She still shows that her songs are still popular all over the world. The Greatest Hits seperates her love songs and dance mixes with sports anthems, like One Moment In Time.It is a very interesting collection for one of the greatest divas of all. The downward effect is the dance mixes are used to much, and you'd prefer the original versions of these songs like I'm Your Baby Tonight, and I Learned From The Best. Frankly, I'd prefer the very same thing.For a diva to have 15 glorious years in the spotlight, this collection puts all the loose ends from Whitney Houston into one nice package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the ballads, love the","review":"I really like this CD! It comes in 2 discs. The first is mostly all of Whitney's lilting ballads of deep-emotion and \\"put your all into it\\" style of songs. It's very enjoyable and I listen to it often.The second, which is mostly all dance and heavy beat rythm was somewhat disappointing. I was disappointed to hear they turned most of the beloved dance hits into all club hop remixes. A few were really exciting. Great for aerobic dancing.However, most of them didn't need to be changed. They were fine just as they first came out. I'm afraid they did an injustice to these songs.Because of the wide range of songs to listen to, I still recommend this CD, but be prepared for those who are use to hearing the dance hits as was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good songs, but leave out the remixes!","review":"There are definitely some good ballads on here that remind me of my childhood, but my favorite fast songs are not the originals!

USA version is messed up, Cool Down CD includes midtempo R&B tracks (MLIYL, HH) and Throw Down CD includes ballads (OMIT, SSB)...

Even though most of our favorites are on this 2-disc album, many of them are remixes that sound horrible.

The remixes become boring and just left me thirsty for the original versions. Also did not like the way the songs were broken out.

Like the a few of the kids said below, this is worth evvy penny. It took a long time to compile it, though--from whaddiwe talkin'? '86-87? Too bad it didn't include them early experimental dance jams and those she did with the group Material...Ooops, this is no anthology, though. I like \\"I Will Always Love You\\" and \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", the most. I ain't a big fan of house remix treatments of jams, but these are alright, if a bit long. I dug her treatment of \\"I Will...\\" on the Arista 25th Celebration. Gotta give props to her, she's still a force to reckon with even with the likes of co-deevahs Deb Cox, ToniBrax, Monica, Faith Evans and Ree Ree hangin' out wid her..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitney The Greatest Hits","review":"While I've always LUV'D Whitney's music, I was disappointed in the re-mixes (disc 2). They should have left the \\"classics\\" alone & not added all the extras to make them \\"so-called\\" re-mixes. They ruined some very GREAT songs in the way you always want to remember Whitney's voice & her recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I ordered this CD after Whitney's passing and I wasn't disappointed with the songs that it included.I recommend it for every collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific album","review":"I don't know that I enjoyed this because she's no longer with us, but I thought the song collection was outstanding, more so on the first of the two cd's than the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"T-Que","review":"I was excited ... until the CD arrived!

I love it still.","review":"I love Whitney Houston. When she passed away, my mom was depressed so I ordered this CD for her. She loved it. But I really like the Cool Down & Throw Down part.

Why her producers have issued this crappy edition of her \\"Greatest\\" Hits???... The first disc is OK, almost all of her best romantic hits (\\"Didn't We Almost Have It All\\" and \\"Saving All My Love For You\\" plus the main theme for \\"The Bodyguard\\" originally from Dolly Parton) are included. The second disc however, is purely another attempt to promote these modern (and weird) DJs that \\"mix\\" dancing themes, whose original versions are far better than the mixed versions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a Greatest Hits collection, save your money","review":"I enjoy Whitney but I am not a huge fan so I was looking for a collection of greatest hits. Well most of the collection consists of songs I have never heard and don't really care much for and the ones that I would call hits are all, in my opinion, very bad remixes rather than original releases. If you are like me and just looking for a nice collection representative of a great artist's work, this is not the collection for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUEEN WHITNEY","review":"Even though Whitney has been in the news in recent years about her several downfalls, including drugs, and her biggest downfall to date, \\"Bobby Brown\\", you have to give credit where credit is due, the woman has a God given gift. The cd begins with her biggest hits, \\"SAVING ALL MY LOVE FOR YOU\\" to later jams \\"HEART BREAK HOTEL\\". Disc 2 is bascially \\"the remix\\" some better than others, and some you wish she would have just kept the same; \\"I'M YOUR BABY TONIGHT!\\". Overall, the cd is great, its a whole lot better than most of today's music. I have always admire Whitney. She will forever remain one of the best in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitney - Epic!","review":"This greatest Hits C.D is definitely one for the collection. All of Whitney's best and most famous songs all rolled into one. From 80's to Naughties. Including some remix's I have never heard...I'm your baby tonight mixed with a house style. (so very impressed, and I dont really like House music). Double C.D with 32 songs all together... However, it does not include \\"When you Believe\\" The duet with Mariah Carey, which would be the only way to make this C.D 5 Stars. All in all, great purchase. x p.s... If the worst comes to worst and you hate the C.D, at least you will have the cover, photographed by the incredible David LaChapelle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ballads and Parties","review":"This collection is a tale of two personalities. There are the romantic, soaring ballads, and then there are the dance club parties. That's why there are two CDs in this collection.Personally, I wanted the first CD, with all of the classic hits. The remixes and party standards will appeal to some, but I don't need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I was very dissapointed in the CD. As one her fans who have followed Whitney's career from the beginning, I was not interested in buying the dance versions of all of her hits. My idea of a greatest hits album is one that has all of your favorites on one CD. This isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUMB REMIXES RUIN GREATEST HITS ALBUM","review":"This would have actually been a pretty good greatest hits album if it weren't for those mind-numbing remixes.

Stick with the albums or burn your own personal compilation instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will always (glub glub glub) you!","review":"Poor old Whitney started off with a fair amount of talent but then turned bad. Most of the songs she sang stank. If you want to hear them, you can hear them here but I don't think you'll want to hear them much. The worst is \\"I Will Always Love You.\\" Rebecca Black said many of the same things in her masterpiece \\"Friday,\\" which you can buy for a whole lot less that this album of stinkeroos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly NOT a Greatest Hits CD Package","review":"The first CD in the package is a \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD. The second CD in the package was nothing but unheard hip hop stuff and a couple of her hits with the hip hop rythm added to it.Wished I hadn't bought the CD and spent extra money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Different Collections?","review":"Whoa! What on earth is going on? I own all of Whitney's previous albums, and so was looking forward to the remixes on the Greatest hits. But, to my surprise, there seems to be one 'Greatest Hits' collection for the US, and a completely different one for the rest of the world. I have read several other reviews where people have expressed disappointment or disgust with the second CD that is full of remixes; my gripe is exactly the opposite: already owning most of the material on CD2, I actually do want the remixes! So, not living in the US, how do I get these? I would like to give a single finger salute to the genius at Arista who devised the idea of having two very different 'greatest hits' collections for Whitney - there is actually sufficient material for a real double-CD Greatest Hits album and also a separate remix CD. This would have kept everybody happy. Well done, bozo's. All I can say is, thank God for mp3's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about this CD!","review":"All the old songs are OK but the new songs are not alright! I gave this CD to my friend one day after I bought! Her live performance is even worst than her performance in this CD!

It is a grat mix of Whitney\`s old hits ( the greatest love of all ) with her new hits (My love is your love)This is an amazing cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Techno Dancehall Disc 2 Ruins The Whole Thing!","review":"I wanted to hear all the original mixes of the songs that I remember hearing on the radio in the 1980's. Unfortunately, many of those songs I recall fondly have been remixed to sound like dancehall numbers, like you might find at a gay nightclub. The techno transformation of the mid '80s to early '90s popular R&B hits does not turn out well. All the wonderful Whitney Houston songs of that period are given the same embellishments and treatment on the second disc. Whitney's amazing voice is overwhelmed by these techno musings, and I'm looking forward to a future \\"greatest hits\\" collection that simply remasters the old songs of Whitney Houston that I loved so much growing up. The selection of songs is great on this 2-disc set. It's the remixes on the second disc that ruin the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remix trash","review":"This is a HUGE disappointment. Especially the 2nd cd, which completely murders the energy of \\"How Will I Know\\" and \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\\". The re-mixes are AWEFUL and those who did them should be forced to listen to nothing but Lawrence Welk music for eternity. Whitney must have been drugged when she approved the re-mixes. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful production","review":"This was produced in England, I believe, and perhaps their standards are different there. In many of the selections, the instrumentation all but drowns out the vocals. And the rendition of \\"I Will Always Love You\\" is totally different from the \\"Bodyguard\\" version, and to me it was a terrible disappointment. Most of the songs are more \\"noise\\" than the joyful and melodious voice that was what made Whitney Houston the beloved singer she was. The best numbers on the 2-CD album are the \\"bonus numbers\\" on CD 2, one of which is her National Anthem. A better choice for Whitney-lovers, I think, is the \\"Ultimate Collection\\" produced by Aristo Europ, in December 2007. Almost all of her truly greatest hits, remastered and truly spectacular, are there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came defective","review":"I was so looking forward to receiving this album, but song seven on the first album was blank. Nothing there. Can you send me another copy? Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"popular Songs -NOT","review":"It is a double Cd with over 36 songs. I only recognized maybe 3 at the most. It is supposed to be greatest hits. Her voice is amazing however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Artist Of All","review":"Whitney Houston's Greatest Hits is a remarkable album! The first cd highlights the best of her balads, including my personal fave...\\"Greatest Love Of All.\\" Disc two takes her hits and sets them up with the remix finish and does it well. Best of all, the new tracks are great. \\"Fine\\" is an excellent dance tune and the duets with Deborah Cox and Enrique Inglasias are red hot! The only down side would have to be the new \\"If I told You That\\" with George Michael. Although the song is great and both artists are superb, the track doesn't quite cut the duet mark. Check out Whitney's solo version. Over all, \\"Whitney: The Greatest Hits\\" is by far the best collection of songs by one of the greatest artists of our time! A real must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest Hits?","review":"Basically what is wrong witht the CD is that the first disc is just boring. Having all the ballad one after another just kills it. They are amazing songs to listen to, but 17 in row just makes it all sound bad and I can't even liten to the disc all the way through.And there is the 2nd disc what is even the point of this? To ruin great songs. The remixes arn't even good. The only ones I like are the remixes to \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" and \\"How Will I Know\\". The original versions of the songs are so much better. This is not a greatest hits album. It just makes all her songs sound horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitney can do Better!","review":"CD #1 is great because it has all of her songs when she used to have that powerful voice. CD #2 reminds me of the music that has you dancing in the GAP. It's all of her songs with a Latin/House music beat. And my favorite songs are either remixed or has a different beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take back the top spot! 1","review":"This really is a super CD but I really wish Whitney had spent more times making Cd's like this instead of making movies(which did provide her with some hits) and then everyone knows she would of been the top selling artist and not that faker, Mariah Carey(although theres nothing wrong with her personality, I dont like her singing). This Cd shows the great songs Whitney has produced from a few albums.Imagine if she had spent more time on singing and not movies?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not complete","review":"This is missing a song.

This is what I heard growing up in high school. Studying in college. And driving to work every morning. I heard Whitney singing the *radio* versions of her hits, and the radio versions are what put Whitney consistently in the Top 5 Billboard chart. INSTEAD, we are given stupid, boring, soulless remixes. CD#1 (slow ballads):5/5 CD#2 (remixes): 0/5. I'm *extremely* disappointed. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"Have always liked Whitney songs, but disc 2 is a waste!!!! disc one is the only disc i listen to.

If you are a Whitney fan, I highly recommend you get this CD(there are 2 CD's in this album).Whitney is one person who, in my opinion is, \\"in a class by herself\\" singer that has a God given voice that only a few people in the world are blessed with.So I definitely highly recommend to buy this album, it's well worth the price. Actually for a 2 CD set, the price is really great. Also, even if your not a Whitney fan, I suggest that you purchase this album and listen to the songs, you will definitely and instantly become a Whitney fan.Bruce"},{"rating":"1","title":"whitney houston - the greatest hits","review":"The CD is just ok.

All of her ballads are preserved in their original form, but the \\"top DJs of the day\\" do a number on her classic dance tracks. Take for instance, \\"So Emotional\\". If you are looking for the great upbeat musical track, you won't find that her. Its Whitneys' vocals spliced over a depressing rave-style club beat. Its murderous in my opinion. I have much respect for Jellybean Benitez and wouldn't mind hearing his club take on Whitney in a club, but not on a Greatest Hits package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who remixed whitneys greatest hits","review":"I am a huge Whitney Houston fan.

I have always been a fan of Whitney, but this is the BEST collection of her YET.

I've always loved her hit music. I ordered this album and neglected to notice that most of the songs are remixes of the original tracks. These ARE NOT the original versions of her Greatest Hits. In my opinion the remixed versions are but a shade of the originals. I did not at all like the remixes and I longed for originals. Unforunately I'll have to put up with listening to them on her original albums until she comes out with a TRUE Greates Hits album. Either that or I'll burn my own greatest hits album.

No one can deny the great voice and overall talent of Whitney Houston. But I don't think she has reached her potential as a performer and vocalist.

I saw a little ad included in the album, \\"The Bodygaurd\\" for a greatest Hits album and waited for years in anticipation for it. Then when it finally came out, over half the songs were terrible remixes that hardly sound anything like the original songs. What was the record company thinking? Obviously Whiteny has so far removed herself from the sweet singing lady we first loved, she has become a Diva and not in the good way. The only good thing about this album was the the song, \\"Same script, different cast\\", I loved this song and thought it was one of the most beautiful of all the original songs she released on the album. I don't know what is happening with Miss Whiteny, but she had better get her act together and start respecting her fans again before she finds herself out in the cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Originals, Love the Remixes","review":"Only downside is the placement of slow original songs on one disc and the remixes on the other. What makes a great album is the variety of selections that appear one after the other. This would have been a five-star release if it had alternated the tempos.

Many of these remixes are not available on other CD's so it makes this compilation a real treasure. The four new songs are all great work, especially the duet with Deborah Cox and the great \\"Fine\\". These songs will surely be #1 hits if they will be commercially released. The bonus tracks \\"One moment in time\\" and the live-sung \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" from Super Bowl 1991 are realy rarities, so go and by this piece of music history.

She has an amazing, rich, powerful voice which she uses to the fullest extent, much to the delight of her fans. Even the newer tracks, such as \\"If I Told You That\\" and \\"Fine\\" have that sexy diva style and flare that embodies Whitney. Many complain that on Disc #2, \\"Throw Down\\" (the first Disc is appropriately named \\"Cool Down\\" based on the style and tempo of each disc), there are too many remixes, but these are good remixes and not Euro-Cheese. Her only rivals are Mariah Carey and Celine Dion, and she is certainly worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could of been Better","review":"Disc 1 was good.

Not a problem of resources, just a badly programmed application \\"back-end.\\" Luckily, when I uninstalled it, the system recovered.As far as features go, well, they might have been the best for the money, but it's a moot point.

I telephoned their customer service number on January 13, 2003 per Taiwan's request and talked to one of their US customer service representatives who promised to relay my message to the technical support people in their Torrance, CA office; he also suggested I fax my issues/problems to them which I did.

The Viennese sound tentative in the extreme. The Fifth is an unforgiving beast. Unless the orchestra and conductor alike are resolute and like-minded, disaster ensues.

Yoko needs a bra, but that's cool too. It was the '70's, people! Even the extra bits with the other guests are great. Shirley MacLaine's an adorable nutjob and the dude talking about spontaneous natural phenomena is a highlight. Lennon lovers, do not miss this set! If you can, check out the dvd with George Harrison.

Especially after all the 5 stars it got from people here. I found myself squirming at times as John is so wound up. He is very anxious and the constant lighting up of ciggies puts me off. He looks to be wired and coked up to me. Cavett at times, even though he tries to look calm and in control, is clearly uncomfortable. Yoko Ono is always asking questions through John like a little girl. On the second appearance The Elephants Memory Band play the tepid \\"Woman is the nigger\\" and a Yoko song which is a complete waste of time.

Performance art should be much more substantial and interesting, this pair of personalities more endearing. My take: he left the Beatles for this??!!

Even emptying it immediately after every use has not prevented it from smelling awful while using the machine. I think this is because the dirty water is never fully emptied.

So far, this machine has cleaned up several wet messes -- soda, hairball incidents, mud, and grease -- and one incredibly dried on mess. A cat was ill while we were away, and she had hidden the mess by moving some clothes over it. When I found it, the carpet was caked with gook. I let the solution in the cleaner soak and then just used the brush over and over in the same direction. The machine lifted the mess off of ther carpet and cleaned deep into the fibers -- you would never know anything happened by looking at it!This version does not stay hot, but in my experience, that doesn't affect it's performance.

After thoroughly cleaning the entire unit, I refilled it with clean water, and tried spraying and vacuuming just that. After three passes, the stain had grown to 14 x 18\\", PLUS there was a new, large stain adjacent to it where the fill tank from the machine had leaked copiously on the carpet while I was working. Couldn't get that stain out either. Now I have to have a professional come out and at least try to clean up both messes, and if that doesn't work, figure out what to do about a trashed new, very large area rug.Many folks gave a very low, negative rating to this product.

I cannot find instructions anywhere on how to disassemble the machine to clean it. We've had it for a little over a year and a half now and after we use it, and do all the things the instructions tell us to do to keep the hose and parts clean, it still gets moldy ! YUCK. I think that is the reason why on the newer models of this machine Bissell choose to make the hose green colored, instead of the clear hose like the older machines have, becuase they don't want you too see the mold growing. I wouldn't recommend this machine based on the mold factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Product !!","review":"In theory, this is a good machine. It did, in fact, work as advertised for a brief time - then it started to smell. All of the urine, drinks, vomit, whatever nasty stuff you just vaccumed up from your carpet, starts to pool under the holding tank. As it festers there, the exhaust fan takes that wonderful aroma and blows it all over your house. This, to an extent, is simply a nuisance - bad smell and extra clean-up of the machine itself - until it starts leaking all of that crap back into your carpet, making more mess than you started with. The first time this happened, Bissell customer service sent a replacement unit. We started having the same problems with it shortly after we received it. Bissell only wants to send us another (no doubt defective) unit - so unless you want to be stuck with a stinky, urine-leaking, mess-maker, don't buy this product !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bissell please pay attention to customers opinion for business success","review":"I got this product brand new from the box and I was very exited to use it at the begining because it was easy to use and not heavy but I was very dissapointed to find out the suction is really bad, from scale 1-5 this is a 1 barely any suction and for the price this is not worth it. Don't waste time and just so you can verify this review get one of this machines in walmart and test it you'll return it the same day and Bissell if you really want more customers to buy your products please work something out, so you can have more suction power into these machines, extra features will matter if machine works at customers satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good suction.","review":"Everytime I've used it, I really have to press HARD on the suction wand.

Maybe it's just my family, we have 3 kids, 3 cats, and a dog so our cleaning products get a lot of use. Take it for what it's worth but it's not like we were doing the entire rug with the steamer.

It is absolutely ridiculous that a new product can only be used twice before it breaks. The machine I have was never dropped or abused in any manner.

It was really simple and although this version does not have the heat option it got EVERYTHING out. I was AMAZED! It thoroughly cleans and sucks every last bit of moisture out of the carpet.

The fourth time I was already used to the problems that I was encountering.I let my friend use the machine once to clean his bed because his dog marked his mattress.

It still does not work (yes we filled them). The working one worked for a little while and now is very tempermental and our dog has figured out how to bark at a certain octave and not set it off - where other times it is going off constantly. I thought these would be a good solution - but it turned out to be a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog to powerfully annoying for this collar","review":"Our dog simply battled his shrieking multi decibal bark through this hokey looking spray collar. It ran out of juice too quickly. If you have a really annoying dog that you never wanted in the first place but, your significant other took in and is now living with you, barking and whining like a tea kettle, I would suggest buying a shock collar or two or three. The spray collar probably works on less driven dogs but not on the kind who get a kick out of being an A-hole."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works until the dog chews it up","review":"This was effective at reducing barking for about a week. But the collar came loose and my dog chewed it up when I wasn't looking. I ordered another one and the same thing happened again. They should make a collar that doesn't come loose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but does not last..","review":"Works well as far as anti-barking...but it only last for a week and it will not spray any more even though it was refilled and battery was changed.

We tested the product before putting it on the dog and it sprays just fine. We put it on the dog and since the dog has more of a whine/howl than a bark, I guess it doesn't pick it up. We tried adjusting it so that the sprayer sits closer to his neck but it still didn't work. It just never went off. I was really hopeful because I don't want to use a shock collar but I guess I have no other choice. This might work if you have a bigger dog with an actual bark but it's just not happening for my little guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective product","review":"I found this product was ineffective for my dog, it's a shame because it was relatively expensive.

He barked twice and got it. He continues to wear it, 3 weeks later, and once in a while forgets, barks, and is sprayed. He runs away, usually under the dining room table for a few minutes. But...memory reset, and he returns to be social. This truly is a kind way to modify your pups barking behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"GentleSpray","review":"I took a big chance buying the Premier GentleSpray. I didn't want to purchase something that might not work, but I was running out of options thinking I might get kicked out of my apartment for my adorably tiny little barking Bichon. Obviously, for him being a small dog I didn't want to use any kind of shock collars on him, but this worked amazingly. To be honest, I was skeptical. I tried it on him, walked out of the apartment, heard him bark once and then he never did it again lol! He doesn't even need to wear it anymore. I think he has learned his lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely functioned; ate the spray; died","review":"Total piece of junk. The thing died-kaput--with just a few uses. Kept filling the chamber, and it still didn't work. Thinking it might be the batteries, I bought more batteries from the listed vendor-junk. Then, at a friend's suggestion, I bought pricey batteries at another shop (>$10 each), and they worked, for a short time. The problem appears to be the unit itself. I am left with 3 big extra cans of spray I bought and cannot use.Finally bought a Petsafe vibration type small dog collar---it works! And the batteries have lasted months! I don't use it often, but I've had it for 5 months and it still works when I use it. It cost 300% more, but it works and is less expensive considering the battery problems, along with the quick death of this piece of junk.

At first, it startled her when the mist would come out, but then, she just accepted it. It seems like this product is for bigger dogs because the collar doesn't really fit her well (she's a small/medium sized JRT).

In our back yard our dog still responds to the spray somewhat, but when we're camping she doesn't even notice the spray. I think it carries away from her too quickly.

The unit had been leaking and sputtering the liquid from the citronella cartridge.Why take the risk? Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"I purchased this because our Basenji mix does not respond to conventional discipline. He's very smart and he is apparently too smart for this collar. He doesn't like it when it sprays but he will bark until it's gone and then he knows he can just go to town. I give it a low rating not just because dogs are capable of figuring it out, but it's too sensitive. It goes off when other dogs bark and even if he just shakes his body it goes off.

The batteries, which runout very quickly, cost anywhere from $4-$10 to replace (and plan on replacing at least 1x per month) if you can find them (very hard to find the correct size). The Citronella spray refills, which, I will submit, last quite awhile.....cost anywhere from $11-$16, again, if you can find them!!!I've changed the battery so many times now, that the +/- posts are all bent, and no longer charge the device. I just spent another $20 to replace the battery and spray, and can't get it to work at all anymore.While I liked the idea that this was a totally humane method of stopping barking, I'm going to try one of the ultrasound devices now. At least the upkeep won't be so much.....9V batteries are easy to find and cheap, and there is no spray to get all over the place, find and replace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a try","review":"So we bought this for our 10 month old Shiba Inu-Chow mix, both breeds are very territorial so I think that may have something to do with it. It worked well at first, but I think it was the startling sensation of the spray that would stop the barking, she got over the collar in 2 days. I was really hoping this would work, but I think it honestly depends on your dog. Its worth a try but buy extra batteries, ours ran out in a week. We gave up on the spray collar after that and are currently looking for a sonar one now. And yes, it will make your dog smell like citronella, if you have a problem with that you should try the scentless kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after 7 uses!","review":"Do not buy this product. I have used it a total of 7 times for walking my dog. While I fill it up, it leaks out by spraying the Citronella. It will spray my dog once for a bark, then it continues to leak.

I have a english bulldog and I was worried that his wrinkled skin would make this collar useless, but I decided to try it anyway. It worked like a charm for my guy. The barking has stopped and it isn't painful, just annoying to him. I would definetely recommend this collar to anyone who has a problem barker. The only thing is you have to be consistent, everyday until they stop and then some. After a while they know the smell of the collar and you won't even have to turn it on! It worked great for my 1 year old bulldog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy for small dogs!","review":"Even after several adjustments and trimming the collar down significantly, this anti-bark dog collar was also an \\"anti-working\\" dog collar for our small shi-tzu/poodle mix.

We understand that for safety reasons this product should be returned to Premier, Premier will not take it back as they did not receive the money for it.

The only problem is that she knows when the collar is on and when it's off. She will not bark when the collar is on but knows she can when the collar isn't on. Since the collar is so bulky we don't make her wear it over night so she does some barking in the morning. I don't think this is a product flaw, just that the stinker is too smart! I would recommend this collar, very effective when worn. I'm also impressed with the way the collar's spray and battery life lasts. I have not had to replace the battery yet and only the spray once. I think the spray only due to the fact that my husband loves to show our friends and family how it works, not on the dog of course!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"This collar does work!

We used a shocking collar before this and the dog would just \\"grin\\" and bear it. The collar would also shock him if he shook his head or jumped around. This collar only senses the bark! It was inexpensive and seems to do the job. I don't even have to turn it on most of the time. Just putting it around his neck is enough. I would highly recommend giving this a try.

I finally called the company and the customer service rep asked if the dog has a high pitched bark. The dog has a VERY high pitched bark. Turns out, their older models (which they no longer sell) work fine with a high pitched bark, but the new model (the one with the on/off switch) doesn't work at all with a high pitched bark. They offered to change out our model for the older version, which I guess they keep in their warehouse for this very purpose. But, if your dog has high pitched bark, you're better off calling Premier directly and figuring out how to get the older model. Or find a brand that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Side effects","review":"Unfortunately, the second time I left my dog alone with the collar on for nuisance barking, it set off anxiety issues.

I used the collars twice and one broke. Amazon sent me out a new collar and I used them again and the other collar broke. It is too bad they are so poorly made, because they did work. I can't believe both collars broke only after two or three uses. The collars did not get wet and the dogs were just out in my backyard. I would not waste your money on these. They need to improve the quality of them or charge 5.00 so you are not throwing away almost 40.00 on something that works for such a short period of time. Save your money and do not buy this cheap product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for one, possible two hours.","review":"Our dog ran to his water dish and washed his face.

Once I got back a unit that worked again - for awhile. Then I got back a unit that never worked again.I stopped sending in my broken units after that.So - in desperation, and impending poverty, I switched to a shock collar; it was either that or what my breeder calls a \\"blue juice special\\". It also worked - and yes, I tried it on myself and decided that it wasn't cruel at all. But the punchline is this: the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar. At least they were cheaper, so I didn't lose as much money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Customer","review":"This product did absolutely nothing for my dog except make him (and my apartment) smell like oranges. He barked right through the sprays. At one point he even managed to chew the collar off his neck (even though I am certain it was fitted properly). I wasted $50 hard earned dollars.

This collar has been truly amazing - we put it on him when we are out in the yard. It allows him to be out with us for hours - something that was never possible because he barked frantically at neighbors, cars, random noises. He is relaxed and almost nonchalant at these things now. It's as if the cycle of excitement is broken because he can't bark. He may glance at something that would have once sent him into a barking frenzy, then lie down in the grass and watch calmly. Same thing with people coming to our front door. He used to bark hysterically and all our attempts at de-sensitization and training did nothing. With the collar on, the door bell rings and he stands calmly and watches as a new person enters the house. He approaches them and sniffs and wants to be petted, but is not threatened or threatening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I was so excited to get this item for my dog cause he barks all the time but it did not work.

He barked at balloons. He barked at nothing at all. As much as I loved him, after three years of this, I couldn't stand him because he was so loud. He's a 60 lb dog, but has a shrill bark of a much smaller dog that made me crazy. We tried different training programs but nothing worked. I went to the store in search of a shock collar when I found this. Despite the hefty price tag, I gave it a try and it worked the first day. My home has never been quieter and I am a happy dog owner. We left in on for a week, although we could have used it less because it worked so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it sort of worked.","review":"My dog has separation anxiety, and my neighbors are getting fed up with the constant barking when we're away. I'm worried that our landlord will make us find a new home for her, so we're ready to try anything. This didn't work. It seems to annoy her at least a little, but for the most part, the anxiety seems too powerful for the collar. I get home, and the entire house smells like citronella. I watch her through the closet door, and she just paces and barks. The citronella seems to make her hesitate a little at the beginning, but when enough time passes, she's just barkzilla. I'm going to try the Thundershirt next in combination with medication from my vet and maybe the bark collar.

I suspected that might be the case for my dog because he wasn't fazed by a squirt bottle with a little vinegar, but thought I'd try it anyway. I couldn't figure out any way to tell ahead of time whether it would work.It worked somewhat for my GSD - he barks but only one or two barks each time instead of a 5-minute frenzy. However, in 3 weeks of careful use, it has not trained him not to bark - if he's not wearing it he barks as always.

The first day, it was really nice, it sprayed gently and she would immediately stop barking. The battery was out the next day and the collar had to be refilled almost every day, or more if she attempted to bark alot.I ordered more batteries. In two and a half weeks, we have used two very expensive and hard to find 6 volt batteries (had to order from Amazon, actually, ) and now the collar is just spraying occasionally and Lucy has caught on to its defective useage. I would not reccommend it at all, even if just for the fact that the batteries are so expensive and short lived and the spray has to be bought continuously and only from THIS company. Also, when I tried to return, the company said they do not deal through Amazon and must be returned directly to them. I thought Amazon stood behind its products and sellers???? Disappointing all the way round."},{"rating":"1","title":"may work for some, but not for me","review":"Had heard from a friend that this worked for another friend of his, so I thought I would give it a whirl since nothing else seems to help. The first time I put it on, it did seem to work, and my dog seemed to back off from barking and looked dazed and confused about what was going on, but eventually, he powered through and decided what the heck, I don't care. I think he thinks the citronella is a form of cologne for him and makes him smell better. Anyway, I was hoping this would be the solution to my problem, but evidently it isn't. I would not go so far as to say \\"it doesn't work\\" as I do believe my friend and I do believe others who have said it worked for them, but it just did not do the trick for my wire haired fox terrier. He's two and half and a handful. Anyway, good luck if you do buy it, and I hope it works for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, but...","review":"Worked great till my dog somehow destoyed it.

After the 1st 2 weeks, it stopped working & the folks at Premier were very helpful: They first suggetsed banging the product to clear bubbles, and this helped some. Then after another week or so it stopped working entirely, and the folks at Premier offered to replace it. Meanwhile, had complained to Amazon, who told me to contact Premier, but also sent me a replacement collar. So for the past mnth we have had TWO collars, and now neither is working, despite the banging we periodically do and replacing batteries and re-filling, although, based on past experience, one of them may start working again. Still the uncertainty is maddening, esp when one is using it to quite an otherwise disruptive, barking dog. My wife is too disheartened to call Premier again, since we are unsure what would be gained with a 3rd flaky collar. It's a great product when it works; getting it to work regularly has been an impossible task for us.

How about this, my dog was standing by me, shook his head like dogs regularly do and it caused the collar to activate. He didn't have on his regular collar with tags that could have bumped up against the spray collar, he didn't bark, he just shook his head.

I did not have much success w/ this product and can say it worked about %50 of the time. Our most successful moments were often in the car, I'm not sure but wonder if this was because the citronella was more potent in an enclosed space?? She would bark continuously at times while the collar sprayed continuously in her face. Hopefully, others have had better luck.

The downside: the collars just don't last, not even a year. If Premier would put a warranty on this item, they would find that they needed to invest a little in the quality of the product. They simply stop spraying after a while, even with a brand new battery and a refill. Normally I would not continue to buy an item with such low quality, but I'm addicted to a nice quiet house now, so I keep coming back.

I also loaned it to a friend with a very spirited Golden Retriever, and it has worked well for their dog, although she continues to need to wear it most of the time even after a year. My mother tried it with her keeshonds, who are the most stubborn dogs I've ever met, and it really didn't work with them, even when she made adjustments for their thick fur. Of course, those dogs are pretty behaviorally challenging, and a strong shock-collar has only been moderately effective for them. So ... for a spirited but reasonably compliant dog, it has seemed to work well, but for more stubborn dogs, the barking challenge may go on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog smells like Citronella...","review":"Unfortunately, the collar didn't do anything for our dog.

Any noise in our yard, the doorbell or knock on the door would send him into a barking jag. He would usually stop when we yelled at him, but it was all the time. When I put the collar on him I was worried that it would bug him, but it didn't seem to bother him in the least. The first time he went out to bark at something in the yard he got out one bark and that was it, quiet. I thought maybe this would change, but no, the barking has all but stopped.

It KIND OF worked for a week maybe, but eventually it stopped spraying when he barked, would end up on the side of his neck or for some unknown reason was not keeping him from barking. Also, the citronella seemed to run out very quickly and needed replacing often. I would say that unless you have a dog that is very timid and scares easily, this collar will not work for you.

Once it does, the customer service is great and will send you a brand new unit with a set of batteries and a can, but even that doesn't change the fact that my dog - and apparently, others' as well - simply got used to the spray after a while, and just keeps barking away, driving the neighbors crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps my dog from barking","review":"My dog never barks with the collar when the battery's new and it's full of spray.

I do wish it had some kind of indicator so you knew how much spray was in there, you just have to guess and how much to fill it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antibark Collar","review":"The product has performed as advertized.

A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"this is not a good product i had it on my dog for about 5 minutes. the idea is awsome but when i put it on my dog he wouldnt move because this thing weighs about 1 pound. then when i took him outside, he started rolling around in the grass it started spraying him. this thing works off of vibration not sound. so everytime he would get excited or try and play fetch it would spray him. i do not reccomend this product to anyone. unless you like your dog smelling like bug spray and being scared to move. it did make him not bark but just because he was to scared to do anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually works!","review":"Trained our Cavalier King Charles to stop barking.

My dog is seven pounds and it is way to large for her, there is absolutely no way this can be used on a small dog, it is way to big. I am unable to return this item because it is a non refundable item. So I paid $30 for something that I cannot use or return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked at first.","review":"I had really high hopes for this product to stop my dog from barking. I even had a relative that said it worked for her. Unfortunately, my dog toughed it out and would bark until all of the solution ran out and he was back to barking at full force. I probably says more about my dog and my training abilities than the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Useless","review":"This collar has absolutely no effect on our springer spaniel's barking.

Used exactly as directed and startled him for the first 5 mins to where he didn't bark in his crate. After that he just kept on barking and whining and the collar would spray after every little sound he made, so it was empty in less then 2 mins. And at $10 a refill can, it can get very expensive when the can is gone in 2-3 days. We will probably have to go to a vibrating or sound collar, or a shock collar even though we don't believe they are humane. What to do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I purchased this collar, put it on my dog and it worked for exactly two barks. After that, nothing. I changed the battery but to no avail.

For the first two weeks she didn't bark at all with the collar on, but after that she worked out how to bark more softly, survive the gentle spray, and discovered that eventually the collar ran out. Then she will bark, but still only once or twice. I check the collar every morning now, when I put it on her, and we are golden. I am so thrilled, because my neighbors were getting pissed and, to be fair, I didn't blame them. Totally worth it, and cheaper on Amazon than at my local petco, at least right now. Yes, it runs out pretty quickly (like every other day, it would seem) so once you see if it works I would go ahead and order some refills and extra batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work","review":"Just got it yesterday.

Both collars worked great for the first few weeks before one suddenly quit working all together. The second one failed too several days later. We have replaced batteries but to no avail. A disappointing purchase as we are beyond the return period and have two collars that are worthless. Like the concept but the execution on these is not ready for prime time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quieter dog now","review":"This collar works great with my dog. I only have to put it on him every once in awhile to keep him from barking. It only needs to spray towards him once then he stops with a little startle. But after that he doesn't even need to wear it for a few days, I think he is not sure if he is wearing it or not. Then once he starts up again with any little noise I put it back on. Good on keeping him quiet with out hurting him.."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: GARBAGE","review":"We purchased the Premier Spray Sense Anti Bark Collar for our miniature dachshund to help with his barking. When we received the item we tried it right away.

The first one sprayed the Citronella as soon as it was refilled, even when on the off button, and the second one we used for one day, I went to refill it, and nothing happened when I blew on it to test it. I exchanged the battery just in case, used a different refill bottle, and nothing! One week for the first, 1 day for the second!!!!! Our dog is a 2.5 lb Maltese kept inside, so it's not excessive wear or water damage. Poor quality! Great potential!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CITRONELLA COLLAR","review":"We bought two of these collars on 07/28/09, we have four small dogs. Three are Chihuahuas and the other a Yorkie.

Tonight I decided to try one on our Yorkie so I will let you all know what happens with her! Our third chihuahua is the brother of the female the one who has only barked once, and he must realize what is happening because he even stopped barking and he doesn't even have a collar on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bye bye $$$$","review":"It just didn't work for us.

Thought this would be a humane way to save him from the neighbor's automatic weapons. Unfortunately the thing completely unravelled the first night. You buy this, make sure you melt the ends of the collar well. That doesn't stop it either sometimes. The spray worked on him the first night. He got used to it though and barking meant more to him than the spray was irritating I suppose. Didn't work so he's still in his flack jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premier Spray Anti Bark Collar","review":"Purchased this collar for a very barky dog which did nothing to alleviate the problem.

It might not be harmful to your pet, but it does absolutely nothing to affect their barking. My collar even would spray my dog when he would just run in the backyard.

I have NEVER been unsatisfied with anything I purchased from Amazon before, but I am very dissatisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do any good with a smart dog","review":"I think my dog is just too intelligent for this. She quickly figured out that she could just bark until the citronella runs out...which was just a small annoyance, not really a deterrant.

So I refilled the reservoir (not that it needed it after only 2 uses), and guess what- still doesn't work. I just contacted Amazon, I hope they'll replace it or give me a refund. It did work those 2 times, so I'd like to try again- with a device that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schizophrenic spraying","review":"I think Premier Pets must have changed the way the internal components of this collar works because I have an older collar from the company that did a great job. It broke after 4 years. This new collar however, sprays for no apparent reason -- even at the slightest noise like clicking the collar into place. It sprays about 5 times and then runs out of spray.It sprays my dog when he whines even slightly - and being he smart bugger he is, he has figured out that if he does a low level whining for about 2 minutes, the collar will run out of spray and then he's free to bark as much as he wants.So in short, this product is not an effective BARK collar, in fact, I think it agitates the dog so much, it's rather disturbing.

But Benny's barking and lunging at other dogs, bicycles, children, motorcycles, people in wheelchairs, push scooters, etc. had gotten so bad that walking him was anxiety time for me.The citronella collar is such an instantaneous distraction and he very quickly learned to ignore a lot of the things that would have caused him to go crazy before. Now going for a walk is relaxing and fun for both of us, and he seems much calmer overall.The only downside is that it is \\"one size fits all\\" and seems pretty heavy for a small dog. I used it on Benny for a few days without filling or turning it on, to acclimate him. Other dog owners see him with the collar and ask about it, and I heartily recommend it. Don't wait any longer, hoping that your dog will stop his barking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $$$","review":"This collar is so sensitive that it would spray my dog when he yawned, wiped his face on the ground, and growled.It even sprayed him when my upstairs neighbors dog barked!

The first few times it seemed to be working, and we would come back to a quite, albeit citronella-scented, dog. Unfortunately, he soon figured out that if he kept barking, he could run the amount of spray out, and as it is not painful, he was quite willing to put up with the scent. We soon were getting calls again and had to break down and purchase a shock collar, which has been working. If the collar could hold a lot more citronella, it might have worked, but each time we came home it would be empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"it leaks...","review":"We bought this product on Amazon.

I don't think they are for large outdoor dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just flush your money down the toilet, it's quicker","review":"This collar is 100% awful. I actually paid $99 for it at one of the big pet stores, so at least Amazon has a much lower price. That being said, this thing isn't worth a penny. Apparently it worked for some of the dogs mentioned in these reviews, but all it did to my dog was go off in his face at random times (not when he barked), which did nothing but terrify and confuse him. It's a bulky collar, but I have a big dog so that wasn't a problem. I can't imagine using this on a small dog though. Also, the citronella smell is awful and makes the whole room stink for hours. Do yourself and your dog a favor and avoid this collar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for my dog","review":"This is the second anti-bark collar I've bought and I find that it works great for my dog. The other type I have is a remote control device which is good for things besides barking, but this one does the job just fine.

No big deal, still liked it. however, within a month it just quit working. Replaced the battery after going to 5 stores to find the right size, and $10 late, still nothing.After doing more reading, I'm now going to buy the high-sound emitting one that works off of vibrations instead of a microphone.

The whining was too high of pitch to be picked up by the microphone, so it did not work for this use.The collar was useful in curbing some barking. It was quick to run out of spray (about 15 puffs per refill), and refilling it involves removing the collar from the dog. The battery also dies very quickly, so do not leave the collar on for a prolonged session.When the first battery died, the collar never worked again. I tried replacing batteries with Premier Spray brand and Radio shack brand. Once replaced, the microphone would not pick up anything less then a loud yell directly into the mic (PS careful when you try this, as its easy to spray yourself in the face, speaking from personal experience here :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing since sliced bread!","review":"I have a small yorkie; 6lbs exactly! I purchased this collar for his nuisance barking. He yaps constantly, when I pick the phone up,Skype, have guest over etc! I was at the point where I stopped inviting people over, talked outside of my house, and locked him in rooms and became oblivious to his barking (however my neighbors did not!).. My friend recommended citronella to me. I tried it, and after the first week, I can honestly say it has been the best decision I have made! As soon as I snapped it on he automatically didn't like it, and just paced. When he barked, it sprayed and he stopped barking. I called my mom and for the first time had a conversation without my dog interrupting. Had guest over to eat and despite minor growls and clawing, he eventually went and played with himself. This collar has been a blessing! Most times if he is barking in a nuisance manor, i snap it on, he stops, and I am able to take it off within 10 minutes and he behaves himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well... with some fine tuning.","review":"I bought 2 collars, one for a border collie and another for a dalmatian. For the border collie, it worked great; no problems whatsoever.For the dalmatian, her collar would seem to spray randomly which confused the poor girl. It sprayed when she drank water, walked on gravel, and for no apparent reason. We adjusted the collar multiple times without much improvement. We switched the dogs' collars. Curiously, both collars seem only to malfunction when on the dalmatian but not the border collie.What finally helped was putting an address label over the microphone. This reduced its sensitivity and now it only sprays when she barks. It's been 2 months and we have a nice quiet bark free home. It also worked great to stop their barking when in car. They used to be bark-a-maniacs when we drive by other dogs. Now they just look with blissful silence. If you have barking dogs, this collar is worth a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunctioned and can't return","review":"This collar worked so well, I was such a happy girl! Our dog barks at anything walking by, and often wakes up our baby from her naps. This collar worked amazingly well. For about a month or two. Then it just stopped working, and the dog continued to bark away. I filled it with more citronella, tested it by blowing on the microphone, and it clicks like it's going to release citronella but it never does. Amazon won't take it back because it has pressurized gas, and I don't see any contact information for the manufacturer to see if they'll replace it. Also, the plastic buckle is really flimsy and let's the collar loosen. Bummer that companies can get away with not standing behind their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted two days","review":"Collar worked great for only two days. Then it died.

It startled my small dog when she barked and I really think she would have learned not to bark had the collar worked for more than a day. When we put it on her the next day, it simply didn't work.

The batteries it uses are real expensive. The collar still didn't work after I replaced the battery possibly because the expensive battery had sat on the store shelf for too long. I don't feel I can afford to maintain this collar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great for Hounds or Prolific Barkers","review":"Definitely not the right product for a hound. We have a Treeing Walker that we adopted from the shelter last year, and he barks A LOT. He barks so much that a neighbor called the Humane Officer and complained. We tried the collar on the recommendations of a friend who had used one with much success and our vet. Copper quickly learned that he could bark through the contents of the collar quickly then he was free to bark to his heart's content - much to the annoyance of everyone around. Also, the first collar we received clogged within a week and had to be returned to the manufacturer. The second collar worked fine for a month, with very frequent refillings, and then clogged just like the first one. I will say this for Premier, they are very responsive to complaints and want to work with you to solve any problems. It's unfortunate that this collar didn't work, but we'll keep searching for another solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This product worked well for about a month.

It keeps spraying out.Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well to reduce barking when on leash.","review":"The barking problem I had with my dog is he goes nuts when taking him on a walk and we pass near another dog. It's not that he is aggressive. He just wants to check out the other dog and barks and lunges when he can't. With this collar he gets a puff of citronella spray near his face with each bark. It's not too intense for him, but seems to be annoying enough to do the trick. He quickly made the connection between the bark and the spray. It also does not leave a lingering odor. He now behaves much better. When we pass another dog he starts acting like he wants to bark, but something in that fur brain of his kicks in and says \\"oh yea, I'll get sprayed, not worth it.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working for my Westie","review":"I had high hopes for this collar, but after a few days of use, my Westie quickly learned that he could \\"out-bark\\" the resevoir of Citronella spray (it only lasts for about 25 sprays).

My dog couldn't break wind without getting sprayed in the face with the citronella. The room and the dog quickly wreaked of citronella (which was worse than his wind). Two thumbs down. If the manufacturer could get down the sensitivity issue and adjust it so it was activated only by a bark and not a whimper or a yawn, this could be a great product. Also, I witnessed my dog trying to sleep in his kennel and the spray collar was literally going off for no apparent reason. I tried adjusting it many different ways with no better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE PRODUCT, NOT RETURNABLE","review":"I had hoped this product would work, unfortunately after one \\"Spray\\" the collar stopped working.

It sprays at some distance from their nose and eyes. It does not spray into their face but in front of their face. I have only had to use it three times and now when he sees me holding the bark collar in my hands, he does not even need it anymore. He gets it. DO NOT put it on the dog and leave the house. Be present. When he/she barks say, \\"NO BARK\\" if you can at the same time. Then when you say \\"NO BARK\\" without the collar, they get it. This is a training device as they say, not disciplinary.

After turning on the switch and placing it on our dog, it worked as advertised ... for a while. Even though I turned it off, it seemed to go through batteries at an amazing pace (3 in 3 weeks). As tip to those who have more success than I, buy them at Target in the electronics department. Check the cross reference on the Net for the correct battery type as they are not the most common variety.

I didn't realize how great it was until now - when I don't have it. It has been a LONG few days without the collar. If I try to mimic the sound of the citronella being released by the collar, sometimes he will stop barking, but I'm definitely not a good substitute.

The collar did work but it ran out of spray after only 5 or 6 barks and then you have to refill it which becomes a pain. The collar itself is made poorly & needs to be readjusted often. In addition to that the dog quickly learned not only how to see if the collar was empty but also learned how to use the collar to spray the other dogs who were not misbehaving and this is not a particularly smart dog. The collar also sometimes sprays if there is any noise including growls or just heavy breathing or one of the other dogs barks too close to the collar which seems unfair. It did seem to curb the problem somewhat but certainly doesn't eliminate it, in addition the smell inside would be quite dangerous to anyone prone to respiratory problems.

There was no problem with the return, but the replacement leaked after a while also. The collar is made of nylon with the usual catch. However, it has a flimsy adjustment piece that easily becomes unadjusted, making it useless. We liked the safety concept despite the cloud of citronella created when our one dog was intelligent enough to outsmart the 20 spray maximum.

I then thought that perhaps it was just the citronella scent, and so was going to try the unscented spray, but on the can it says 'don't get on eyes or skin' and all I could think of was 'hello, what do they think a dog's nose is?'. I'm now looking into ultrasonic bark control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Faze my Doxie","review":"2nd day of using this collar and unfortunately, it doesn't seem to faze my 11lb miniature Dachshund, though it is fairly bulky for such a small dog. She adapted to the extra weight of the collar, and doesn't seemed bothered by it at all. I've put it on her for about an hour in the mornings and a couple of hours each night so far. As far as I know the device is working, though I can't smell anything or notice my dog reacting to it at all. For how much she is barking, I expected to smell even a hint of the citronella, but nope. Like I said, it does not distract her from her persistent barking (at \\"perceived noises outside, doorbells on TV, anything that sounds like knocking on a door). I will likely return this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great humane bark collar","review":"This is the second one we have used and they work great. The first one worked well up until our roommates dog decided to chew it off of our dog. The only issue I have with the collar is that it loosens up too easily and therefore loses effectiveness.

BUT, the first one we purchased lasted about 16 months (not bad, I thought, I'll just buy a new one). I recently purchased a second collar and it leaked all over my dog on day one. Amazon was veary helpfull and they are replacing it for free. I hope this third collar is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Great but Major Flaw","review":"Initially we were ecstatic over this collar. When the first burst of citronella bloomed after our dachshund cut loose barking we all cheered...it stopped him immediately. Within one day the barking was completely controlled. He even refrained from barking when the collar was turned off - he must really hate the smell of citronella. We also got a sort of two for one special...when our other dachsund barked while standing next to the one wearing the collar, it went off. It will also discharge for certain pitches of whining. Unfortunately, if you leave the unit on it burns through a battery a day. The battery is a 6V which is not easy to find and costs around $4. We are hoping that this issue is due to our having a defective unit and that it can be exchanged for one that doesn't tear through batteries. Otherwise this is an expensive training program. In addition, now that the battery keeps dying, our dog is back to barking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"Installed new battery but there was no light to show that unit was working.

The first time she barked I could tell it sprayed because she started to sniff in the air. So I began to test her in the house by knocking on doors and such. She continued the barking so I wanted to make sure the thing was working. Sure enough it wasn't spraying. After replacing the battery, I tried it again and it didn't phase her one bit. The spray is just a fine mist. Even when I tested it like they tell you to do it was so fine that I could hardly smell it. I even adjusted the collar several times to make sure I had it on correctly thinking that would make a difference but it didn't. So if you're looking for something to help control your dog's excessive barking, look somewhere else.

I have an older Dachie mix rescue dog. He hates cats (which I own 2) I'm trying to break him of this habit of barking and going after them. The problem with the collar is that it sprays him with every little sound he makes. He makes some deep sounds (not barking or growling) more like \\"talking\\". so between those sounds and the barking, the collar continuously sprays him. He also figured out if he turns his head, he doesnt get sprayed. At least with a shock collar it differentiates between just sound and barking. the worst part....this collar can not be returned.

This product only sprayed about once every 30+ barks for our dog, so it didn't spray enough for him to associate barking with getting sprayed. Also, please note that since this product comes with a liquid (the spray), it is non-returnable through Amazon.

The dog collar strap will not secure so that the sensor/spray unit will not stay close to the dog making it unable to sense the bark.

They shipped it to me and it wasn't hazardous? I ordered a spare for refill, from another vendor at the same time, and they don't seem to have an issue with the return. I believe Amazon is covering up using hazardous material to hide inferior product quality and refusing the return. I am very disappointed with Amazon's position.

I voice recorded him while I was away, and the first time he tried it, I actually thought it helped. He barked a few times but mostly whined. But, after that time, it doesn't seem to work at all! I don't think he's bothered by the spray even though he depletes the supply within half an hour or so. It may work for other dogs, but I think my dog's anxiety level is too high for him to notice the spray.

The problem with the first one is it sprays constantly. Even if my dog makes a slight sound it goes off. The other one now won't go off at all. I have filled it and it seems the valve is not working. So one of the dogs is still barking because it won't discharge and my other dog can't wear it because every little thing makes it go off.

It weighted him down way too much for it be useful. I read somewhere that this could accomodate a dog over 6 lbs. - impossible!!!!! I was even more angry when I attempted to return it and then learned that this item cannot be returned because it is considered hazardous material!!!!

Nada. Additional observations: the product is poorly labeled and the instructions contradict themselves. The photo showing how to feed the strap through the buckle shows it just the opposite of what the written instructions say.

It worked at first until my dog figured out how to empty the reservoir within about 10 seconds of barking.The cost of the spray to refill it is ridiculous-I have spent about $100 in a year on refills-and the battery life is poor-even though I always turned it off when it wasn't on my dog.I also used the methods they suggested to train her-it just didn't work.I figure between the cost of the collar, refill spray, and batteries I have dropped close to $175 on this for nothing. Now the collar will not even spray at all.If it works for your dog that's great. I have a German Shepherd and maybe dogs like that who are very smart and very protective of their territory don't respond well to this type of collar.I now have to try and find another type of collar that will control her barking-more $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's the not so gentle spray.","review":"It sounds like a great and gentle idea, however instead teaching him not to bark, it thru him into a complete panic attack with every spray. My dog got nothing out of this product but more anxiety and smelling as if he had jumped into a pool of bug spray. I'd give this product zero stars but it wont allow you to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but supervise","review":"These collars worked well on my two eighty pound mutts who were driving my neighbors nuts. The only issue I had was when we left the collars on, unsupervised, for a day. Our dogs proceeded to chew the collars off of each other, which defeats the purpose. I will say, though, after this, the collars still worked, I just had to rig a way to put the device on our normal collars. Be sure to supervise for a little while if you have giant puppies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT!!!","review":"I am very pleased with this product. I am fostering 2 walker hounds (one is 13 and one is 6). They stay in our barn and all of our neighbors started complaining the first night they were there. They are hunters and I think they knew there is a racoon in the barn...so they barked all day and night. So I did some research and ended up buying 2 of these anti bark collars. They do work ... even on the old man. I only put them on at night and the dogs now know as soon as they are on. But when it is out of spray they start back up again. The only thing is that you can't tell when they are out of the spray. Also when 1 barks they both go off. But I DO RECOMMEND THESE COLLARS 100%!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for all dogs...","review":"I have a small dog but she's well within the recommended size/weight.

The prongs on the shock collar were irritating to his skin so I was hoping this would solve his barking problem in a less irritating way.The collar holds about 25 sprays worth of the citronella. My boy would bark repeatedly and and it would spray about half of it right away. He didn't care one bit that poofs of this stuff was being sprayed in his face, he kept right on barking until the collar was out of citronella and then would continue to bark. I tried it a couple different times to no avail.If your dog is a serious yapper, like mine is, and has been for years, this may not be the best solution for you either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Citronella anti-bark collar","review":"This is a great product! It worked very well for my little yapper. My Papillon would start barking when I wasn't around so I couldn't correct the behavior. With this collar I left him alone in a kennel and heard him bark only once then completely stopped. Once in awhile he will bark once or twice, but not out of control. This broke the cycle where he would escalate and get to barking incessantly. Now I don't even put the collar on him and he doesn't bark when I leave him in the kennel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Citronella Collar","review":"I bought two of these for my Chihuahuas.

When we walk them camping they bark and lunge at other dogs. Wow what a difference we went from agressive to docile just because the collar was around their neck. Then we have a neighbor whos dog barks all the time. When they weren't at home we put the collar on her (german shepherd) it was a very quiet afternoon. The neighbor was so thrilled they went and bought one. Then it was a topic of conversation at a party later that week.

Initially, this product was worth the purchase, however, after a couple weeks, our Golden Labrador mix (80 lbs) seemed to disregard the device's spray. At first, we thought it was due to the citronella tank being depleted, thus ineffective, but this was not the case because we could smell the citronella on his neck. The constant refilling process with no gauge on the tank is a pain. Also, having to use a proprietary battery says a lot about the manufacturer. I am currently looking into a sound emitting device for the backyard as the spray collar was ineffective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anti-bark collar","review":"I needed a collar that would help stop my dog from screaming when she went outside; this one works great for that.

This is more humane and works for my dog. It's not for all dogs; our Newfoundland here just barks right through it so a shock collar is more useful for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective for cavalier","review":"I gravitated towards this product because of the positive reviews. I liked that it seemed to be a more humane solution to barking, then the traditional shock collars. Unfortunately, I tried it on my 16 lb cavalier king charles spaniel.

Since we didn't have this on the dog all the time, and maybe our dog doesn't mind the citronella terribly much, sometimes our Newfi mix barked anyway, with the collar on.After a couple of months, the first collar stopped working. The company replaced it in no time and without a fuss, even gave us a new can of citronella & a new battery. But now, about half a year later, the second one also stopped working. Our dog is active but not crazy, and he hasn't gone swimming with it etc.A neighbor happened to tell us they had the same experience with it, also finally gave up on it.

I had two options: I could either let her run amok in the apartment and destroy everything (but remain silent), or I could crate her and sacrifice the silence that I, and my neighbors, required.Crating her became painful not only on my heart-strings, but problematic due to living in an apartment. So, I decided to go ahead and kick it up a notch: Procure a collar--shock or otherwise--and see if that calmed her down.Going the more humane route, I went with this collar.Already long story short: I found that while it worked for the first week, she eventually found that if she barks long enough, the collar runs dry, and she can bark with impunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not convinced yet","review":"I had to have the original product that I received replaced because it was defective.

Which makes me wonder what impact the unscented version has.*Also, if your dog is on a barking tangent, then you can run through the supply in the collar in a couple of minutes.*Once the can only has about 1/4 left, it doesn't fill the reservoir anymore, so the last 1/4 or so is wasted.OVERALL: I think if your dog really hates the smell of lemon, this could definitely work for you. My dog didn't care at all and I went through a few refills pretty quickly (which gets pricey).A side note: Mine leaked a few weeks in and the manufacturer replaced it without any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collar Has Only Sprayed Once","review":"My dog has had the collar on for the past several days. While he has barked numerous times, the collar has nly sprayed once. Prior to purchasing the Premier Gentle Spray collar, I used the Multivet Deluxe collar. I don't think it performed all that well either, but it did spray about 50% of the time when my dog barked and so it definitely worked better than the Premier one has so far.

My sister, however has 9 month old puppie of the same breed cross and the spray had no affect on her at all. She just kept on barking like nothing happened. What I did before I purchased the collars was to rent one from a local kennel and training center to see if it would work on my dogs before I spent the money on them and I really didn't want to put shock collars on them.

I give up, I'm not even going to bother calling Amazon for yet another one, but I might go to my local pet store to get one (different brand maybe!!) so that I can deal with a local store if I have this kind of problem again, but when the collar did work, the effect on my dog was immediate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work for more than 2 days","review":"I was excited to find an inexpensive spray collar, but you get what you pay for.

I have an American Eskimo dog and the collar has completely stopped her negative behaviors (as long as she's wearing it!!). I can now let her go outside and not worry about her barking at ever squirrel/rabbit she sees.However!!! I would like to note, that this collar is really only a bandage for a dog's real issues and should really only be used as a tool. It's also not really something you can have your dog wear 24/7. My dog only wears the collar when I leave for classes in the morning (she's a day time barker) or when I put her outside on tie out. Just something to keep in mind..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't spray at all","review":"I recently purchased this for our chihuahua (7 pounds), however I never saw it spray a single time.

But so did the Innotek when I first put it on our Jack Russell, but she learned to ignore the tingle. The one drawback I see with this product is it is not weather proof, there is no cap to cover the refill nozzle and the battery is not protected from moisture or dirt. This will be a problem since our girl, Dot, is an outdoor dog and she will fill it with dirt and mud. Plus it appears that the unit will need frequent refilling.UPDATE:According to the Amazon description, the collar has been discontinued.After initial success, Dot now barks once then quickly turns her head to avoid the spray. She continues to do so until the reservoir is empty, then continues on with her barking.The enclosed battery lasted less than a month and when I replaced it, sure enough, the compartment was full of dirt.Score: Dot 1 --- Citronella spray 0"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!!!","review":"The idea of this collar is great, however I bought one several months ago and it worked temporarily before giving up the ghost completely. I tried replacing battereds and adding more 'juice' to no avail.I replaced it with the same model, and within two weeks it had also stopped working. I would save your money on this item and just get a mild shock collar which I plan to do with Miss Lily-Barks-a-Lot-Maltese.These are also pesky for two other reasons:You cannot tell whether there is still spray inside the collar, or if it is over or under filled. Only holds about ten sprays, then you must replace it. Dog figures out when it is empty and barking increases.It is hard to tell if the batteries are good unless you have a way to check a lithium battery. I am certain I have paid too much for batteries as I discovered the collar was bad.Overall a horrible investment, wish I could say better things about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This exact same product at my local Petco is $129.00!

She tends to bark in the house or yard just because she hears other dogs in the neighborhood doing so. Make sure the sprayer is pointing toward the chin of the dog and that you've filled it according to directions. After turning it on, you can blow loudly over the mic or \\"bark\\" to make sure it discharges before putting it on your dog. Be sure the sprayer is pointed away from you when you try this! Our dog hates the squirt, and learned quickly the cause and effect. We can even just put the collar on without turning it on now (sometimes we do and sometimes we don't) and she quiets down right away. This isn't something we leave on her all the time. We only put it on for situations where she is unnecessarily barking and annoying us or neighbors. You have to remember to turn the collar off when removed or you'll use the battery up quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"We bought our collars one month ago and they seemed to be functioning.

It worked great and he didn't bark as long as the collar was on him and turned on. I also tried it on our 6 lb Chihuahua and he just ignored the spray and kept barking. The 1st collar lasted about a year then stopped working. Tried new battery and still no worky. I thought a year was Ok use so I bought another one at Petco online. This one lasted 2 weeks until it stopped working. I returned it to a Petco store and exchanged it for another one. This one lasted about 3 weeks before dying. Tried new battery and still nothing. Returned it for my money back and went to PetSmart and bought a sonic collar. We will see how that goes...Overall it worked on one dog and not the other. And the quality of the collars seems to have diminished since I bought the original over a year ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it while it worked..","review":"I read the reviews and knew I shouldn't buy it but I didn't want to resort to a shock collar and my dog hates to be sprayed by the hose so I wanted to give it a try before I invested in something more expensive so I bought it.I tested it and it worked really well and it was amazing the first half of the day, no my dog didn't bark like crazy to break it, he barked once and then he was quiet (I was at home the whole time he had it on). I took it off that night and tested it again and it was broken already.Like I said, great while it worked so now I can invest in something that will last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad we didn't pay too much for this.","review":"This collar didn't work too well for our chiweenie.

It did very well in curbing the barking, more by confusing the dog than anything else. Sometimes it seemed to go off when it wasn't warranted (like when my small dog jumped on my lap), but overall I was satisfied.However, it now leaks the liquid solution, and a few hours after a refill it's empty again even if we weren't using it.

When they received it, they would credit my account. I told them this was unsatisfactory...at least send me a pre-paid shipping label.

A friend of ours got the Premier Anti Bark Collar for her dog and was pleased with the results. She let me borrow it for an afternoon and I couldn't believe what happened! Wally needed about 3 sprays before he got the idea that his barking was causing it. He was quiet the rest of the time he had it on!!! Even with 2 other dogs visiting!I couldn't order it fast enough! Now I can actually put the collar on him and often times I don't even turn it on. He understands that he must be quiet when the collar is on him, and he is!! One thing I really like about it is that the citronella is sprayed right in front of him , not in his face. Wally definitely doesn't like it, but it is not harming him in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my dogs","review":"I bought one of these for each of my dogs.

Unfortunately, it did not help at all. I concede that when it effectively sprayed, she stopped barking immediately, but it only sprayed about 2% of the time, which makes it not only an inffective quick fix but a very inadequate long-term training tool. It's also bulky and uncomfortable looking and the battery dies quite quickly if you forget to shut the device off after removing it from your dog. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"When I ordered this product I liked the idea that it didn't shock or hurt the dog as a training method. However, in practice this product didn't work well at all. First the Citrenella spray is difficult to load into the collar unit (first attempt broke the spout off of the fill bottle releasing the entire bottle at one time into my house). Next the bark collar unit itself didn't work every time the dog barked and stopped working all together in about two weeks.

There are characters that only a novelist could create, but they were, in fact, real ball players who couldn't play the game. The book is a nostalgic trip to a simpler time in baseball, to long gone stadiums (the Polo Grounds) and players. A fun, funny and enlightening book to read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"Like most books published in the 1960s and early 1970s meant for popular consumption, this one was poorly written. It is punctuated with badly outdated slang-phrases leaving you feeling embarrassed for the author. Written in that 'anything goes' style, it meanders around like a drunkard's walk. Actual details and anecdotes about the Mets' goofs are sparse. Worst of all, Breslin fails to create ANY likeable traits in ANY of the characters. I'm gonna have to charge him with an ERROR here."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most disappointing books I have ever read.","review":"This book looked very promising; the format and premise of a history book written from the year 2025. Unfortunately, the book is so superficial in its treatment of the subjects that I found myself falling asleep whenever I attempted to read it.

I give it a 4 because it is the only book out there, but in terms of usability it is a 1. My advice: buy the book and call the ranger station to get the skinny before heading out into the wilderness.

Condescending and bland, most often the rhyming is very dubious if indeed it rhymes at all. See quote. It's more likely something your children will forget fast, since the imagination (and RHYME) in the original is completely gone and gutted with no replacement.There are much better Christian children's books if those are what you're after, and there's always the original with its famed whimsy.

This one has over 200 pieces and due to the large number, each major part of the stormtrooper (head, arms, legs, etc) are each in their own bag. The book shows you which part you end up building and which bag to use.There's also scale diagrams of certain pieces so you don't them mixed up (some pieces are similar but have different lengths). There are some extra pieces but only a select few. The ball and socket parts can be a little hard to put in. It's not very durable but great to look at.

By using love as her main theme Hegi indulges the minds of her readers in touching stories like the one about a girl disobeying all the rules at a nuns'academy just so she could go back and live with her mother.The story about a woman trying to escape the fact that her father is dying and the story about a woman, who finally plucks up the courage to see her daughter's room after she has been dead for some time.

This collection of short stories is truly one that a Hegi fan should keep in his or her own collection for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poetic Failure","review":"A very disappointing collection.

There's just so much completely smart stuff in here - about the marketing insanity of the Olympics, about the look of 20-somethings in the mid-90s, about the meaninglessness of the names of rock bands.

If you push down on him in scorpion mode and roll him along on a WOODEN OR METAL surface his pincers will rotate rapidly. I like how it's near impossible to lose the stinger since it's attached to him and is barricaded at either end. He looks cool in scorpion mode, so, most of the time, I leave him in soorpion mode. What I was saying about durable unless found by a dog meant that somehow my dog got into my room and did some damage to him. I am VERY impressed by the complicated gearing of this figure.

Not to say that the book is without merit; some of the passages describe war time horrors and the difficult descisions leaders must make.

While the literature hovered squarely over Northwest Europe's very own melancholy and mystery, damp and dark, the music might just as well flit away into sugar and sweetness--listen to Strauss's \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" for a perfect example of the schizophrenia. Roger Eno's music, however, is a continuance of the Romantic or Victorian Era's literature. Swimming is all but devoid of Eno's typical classical ensemble instrumentation, but the deep, romantic, NWEuro mood is present in droves. Swimming, as with all of Eno's output, is decisively mature emotionally, obviously British, humble, and peaceful. Eno is touching with Swimming, but with emotion 100% sugar-free. It's such a shame that you're always pointed to the New Age Ninnies section when you ask for Roger Eno. . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"The only reason I picked this book up was because it was a required read for a nursing class - I'm so glad that it was.

Using notes, diaries, and letters of the nurses and many other published and unpublished sources, and interviews of the survivors, Ms. Norman recounts many personal stories which detail the individual experiences which are not usually included in works of history. You learn a little about the Japanese and a lot about American fortitude under the most difficult conditions imaginable. It will make you proud and appreciative of these American women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ANC review of war time experiences.","review":"Written as if the nurses were going back in time to relate their unique experiences during a time of war and prisoner of war.

It gave me a reference for The Japanese treatment of POW's. While the nurses didn't face the extreme hardships of the soldiers, they suffered greatly and acted with more courage and dignity than I could ever muster.I found the individual profiles of the nurses interesting and made me feel like I could relate and know these women.The story of their return to the States and their experiences was illuminating. It doesn't surprise me that they never were treated as equals of the POW's,but it is disappointing.I am very glad I read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"We Band of Angels","review":"This is the true story of the first American women who proved they could handle combat conditions. Army and Navy nurses stationed on the Philippine Islands were thrust into World War II when Japanese bombs rained down on the American bases on the islands and turned them into a fiery hell. Caught in the raging battle, the nurses continued to perform their duties by caring for the wounded. Forced to set up a field hospital in the jungles of Bataan and the tunnels of Corregidor until they were captured. A few nurses escaped, but most were herded into internment camps enduring three years of fear and starvation. From letters, diaries and firsthand accounts they tell their story of what really happened during those dark days. This is a powerful story about women in war."},{"rating":"2","title":"As described","review":"As described. shipped in a timely manner. would buy from again.

Many members of my family were lost in those campaigns. They were in the Death March, the camps and the Hell Ships. The many books on those incidents explain those stories but this book tells of the suffering experienced by the female members of our military. This is a good informative book and is easy to read. The women gave a lot during those years and were for the most part ignored by our government. I salute those ladies and although most have left us we are better off having had them in our military. Only a few knew of the sacrifices they suffered. They were part of the forgotten casualties of the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"we band of angels","review":"this book was very enlighting. i didn't realize that nurses were still on Bataan or corregidor when they fell into Japanese hands. the nurses all displayed a great amount of courage.

What these women endured because of their belief in the American system and the fight for freedom for themselves and for their fellow Americans is almost unbelievable.

From the beginning, people complained about the quality of the outgoing message, no matter how many times I re-recorded it. Some months ago, the second handset died; recently, the battery on the main handset seems to be going. I've never figured out how to check call-waiting calls without disconnecting the first caller.In short, the phone is a disappointment in a number of ways. There are better choices out there.

It is more instructional perhaps in that sense. But for true enjoyment? It is just not for me.Take the money you would spend on this set and buy the LA DIVINA CALLAS set. Well worth the money if you want to hear the divine Miss Callas.

The cover looks great, yeah, but the movie is one of the worst zombie movies I've ever seen! It's TERRIBLE! Not much happens (actually, it's *beep* boring!), all of the characters are extremely forgettable, the zombies don't look great and it doesn't have any gore. Avoid.

There is not a single new idea in this movie.I wish I could say that the make-up and gore was top notch. The hand cameras they used werealways in motion, the make-up looked ok for the brief instants the zombies were observed.These zombies are the slow, stupid kind. Some people in the movie are more evil than the zombies.The young people making the zombie documentary were typical 20-21 year olds.The segments that made this movie are not shown in order, which is a pulp fiction borrowed idea.Rather than buy or rent this movie, one might find a very greasy diner with left-over food, and payto eat beans with congealed grease on it. That would be a better investment.Enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"bait and switch","review":"I really like zombie movies and like independent films. The cover art got my attention. Unfortunately the cover art/disc art has nothing to do with the film and nothing even close either one is shown in the movie.

One of the worst zombie movies I have ever seen. 85 mins of my life wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best!","review":"This movie wasn't what I expected. The whole thing is shot in a Blair Witch type handheld minicam view. It keeps switching from group to group too. I am sick of slow moving stupid zombies. The review says better than 28 days but I say bull. At least the zombies in 28 days can run fast and rip you to shreds in a matter of minutes. I don't know what the reviewers were thinking. I'll probably sell this pile of crap. I only gave it 2 stars because it is at least a zombie movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"begins well but fails to entertain","review":"I'm always keen to support indie horror movies but its a struggle to recommend this. The basic premise of a bird flu pandemic is slightly dated now, and the idea that it would lead to the dead rising is a stretch to the credulity of even the most imaginative horror fan.Having said that the first horror set piece is very well handled and quite effective.Sadly the second two instalments are far less successful with major problems in pacing and narrative.I suspect many zombie movie fans are more interested in suspense and visceral thrills and here too the film falls flat after the first encounter.Acting is on a par with most micro-budget exploitation flicks,which is a shame since the script attempts to be character based.Unfortunately there are too many characters and they all seem to be the same basic personalityso it becomes difficult to remember- or care- who was who.I'm afraid I didn't enjoy this production much at all and have no desire to see it again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, NO. Don't buy it.Or the hype.","review":"I just finished watching this flick mere seconds ago, and I have to say...what a waste. I'm going to go ahead and say it-I did not care for those two retarded looking serial killers. They ruined the whole movie! I know things are bad during a zombie invasion, but why kill a good thing?Avoid this at all costs! I am going to sell mine asap though I 'd rather break it if not for these recession times."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like film festival movies you might like this.","review":"This is a low budget movie with very little to it.

The film makers seem to be morons! Let me film you Mr. Zombie until you bite me! I found the humans more pathetic than the dead...at least the dead have an excuse. Anyone you meet in such a situation might well be a murderer/rapist so stay away from strangers...nope...shoot the guy, rape the girl...then move on.To film the death of you country rather than try to escape and survive seems a bit dumb...if trapped and unable to get away, perhaps for future (if any) generations. I really didn't like the jumpy film either, or the trees or the ground views...thought that the cameraman would be steadier?This film just doesn't have a good story and if that is what the writer wanted...not entertaining. I prefer a chase, a fight, a survival... traditional stuff OK? I'm sorry but one star, but good makeup on the zombies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs!","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this trash. It is poorly acted, poorly filmed junk...and this is coming from a fan of B movie horror schlock!I realize they were going for reality type acting/filming along the lines of Blair Witch...but this was just garbage.The only interesting part of the movie (which was short lived and not explored nearly enough) was the sadistic survivor who gathers up his own zombie prisoner for his own purposes.I am quite serious when I say that I would rather run headlong into the arms of a hungry zombie rather than watch this ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrid","review":"It's pretty rare that I am THIS dissapointed by a film, let alone a zombie movie. I didn't think this was going to be a classic, brilliant film, but I at least expected to be entertained. The acting is weak, and there are no truly likeable characters. The editing is a complete mess, jumping wildly from one group of characters you don't care about to another group of characters you don't care about. The drama seems forced, and the message that men are the monsters, not the zombies, seems tacked on in the third act in a clumsy attempt to give this movie a sense of purpose.I LOVE zombie movies, but this is the only one in my collection of over 30 that I will never watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get through it","review":"I generally have a have a high tolerance for lousy flicks, I just can't get through this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of this home video crap !!!","review":"No Star for this one but I had to !!!!!!!!!!!!

WTF!!!!","review":"This movie is nothing like the cover, it follows a number different groups of people during a zombie outbreak. This is why I hate Zombie moives with SLOW ASS ZOMBIES!!!!!!!!!

Theres a scene with some survivors, and they go into town to get supplies or whatever, and they see a few zombies walking towards them, WALKING! Then they start panicing trying to get all the stuff into the car.................. Look, this movie is going to have you questioning a lot of S**t, rather than finding someway to enjoy this film. I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1 because the idea and the plot was there but it just wasnt executed in the right way. If the Zombies ran, I wouldnt care about the make-up of the zombies and I wouldnt care about the acting......... That much.

Big mistake it was TERRIBLE! I couldn't even finish it, i laughed most of the time because the acting was so bad \\"Oh no a zombie, run...very slowly\\" the zombies moved in slow motion and the people still couldn't get away!! Half the time i was confused, because its done as a documentary from a bunch of different peoples points of view, how do all of these people happen to have camcorders i want to know!! So save yourself the time and the money and do something productive like watching 28 weeks later!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucked","review":"This movie sucked. Don't waste your money on it.

I'd give it negative stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"The cover is of this video is what caught my eye and caused me to buy it (had nothing to do with the movie whatsoever). However it was a complete waste of $13 and my time. I've never touched a camcorder in my life and I could've shot this movie. There wasn't really a plot at all all it was was a group of people running through the woods yelling profanities and half the time you couldn't even see what was happening. I wouldn't even call this a low budget movie I would call it a c movie. Also the last 20 minutes are disturbingly disgustingly sick and I don't me gory sick.If your looking for a good zombie film stick to George Romero movies and maybe 28 days later."},{"rating":"1","title":"It did nothing for me!","review":"Comparisons with Romero's 'Diary of the Dead' are inevitable. Similar premise. Even the titles are basically the same. And to me... neither movie is good. But at least Romero made the smart decision of sticking with one group of survivors. And that is the fatal flaw of the Zombie Diaries. We don't really spend any quality time with any character or group for us to really care. And the movie also lacks truly frightening, suspenseful, or compelling moments. The only scene that stands out is that heartbreaking moment with the little girl. Too little to save this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"where were the zombies????","review":"If you hated Blair Witch Project then you will hate this movie... if you liked BWP... oh who the hell am i kidding, the best part of this movie was the art on the front and back cover.. oh, and the art on the dvd itself... oh kay, i get the low budget and independant angle...(if you want that in your Zombieness then get yourself a copy of Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things!!!) but maybe i never should have watched George R's Diary of the Dead... which freaking ROCKS and is his best yet!!!!ANYHOW... this movie is more about MAN and how they behave in a Zombie world...or better yet how man's insanity is allowed to go unchecked in a world without law enforcement!!! same yourself some cash and skip this movie... unless you buy it used or you run across it in a bargan bin for under $6.00!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaky Camera Work","review":"The plot and characters are ok, but if you're subject to motion sickness or nausea from movies filmed in the style of \\"Bair Witch,\\" stay away from this one.

The hand-held video camera jerked around so excessively, I was only able to stomach about 20 minutes before feeling ill and ejecting it from my Sony PS3. Buyers beware; very poorly filmed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skips around too much","review":"Zombie Diaries tries to tell a story as woven together from various survivors' camcorder footage. The problem lies in the fact that it not only follows a few groups of survivors, but changes timeframes as well, making it hard to piece together exactly how (or when) the various groups crossed paths. The low-budget camcorder approach can work great, even if you don't have a Cloverfield budget, but here it tries to do too much. Some of the scenes, if taken individually, are actually well done, but they never quite come together as a complete story.Also, am I the only person left who doesn't have a camera or camcorder with night-vision capability?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn! Oh, sorry, was I snoring?","review":"I had a real tough time getting to the end of this film. Oh, not due to the blood and gore as I love blood and gore. It was just due to the slow and boring almost non-existent story line. I had read strong reviews and bought it immediately as I love all things Zombie. I had over a bunch of my friends for Zombie Movie night and 3 out of 6 of us actually fell asleep! Sorry but it wasn't the beer as I tried to watch it again cold sober and guess what? The snoring started. If you are looking for a great bed time story to put you to sleep, this is your film! If you are looking for a Zombie movie in the same vein then try Diary of The Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Zombie Film I've Ever Seen","review":"As a huge fan of zombie films I can definitively state this is the worst zombie film I have ever seen. Shot on what looks like a $500 budget this film follows around groups of people in post-zombie infested England in a faux-handheld camera-live style popularized by films like The Blairwitch Project and Cloverfield. As such, expect to get nautious as the camera jerks around constantly while people are busy arguing with each other or running from what have to be the slowest zombies in film history. There are also numerous scenes shot in the dark where the camera serves as the only source of light....yawn. Been there done that in equally bad films like Quarantine. There is no character development, basically no plot, and nothing to keep the viewer remotely interested in what happens. When this film ends you will be pissed that you spent 1 hour and 20 minutes watching this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"28 Days Later\\"","review":"When I flipped the case over and read the bold quote in red lettering: \\" Better Than Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later\\" according to [...], that should've been an immediate red flag telling me to wait until this showed up in the $[...] DVD bin at the local Wal Mart, but I took the chance since I enjoy zombie films and zombie fiction, realizing there are some good ones and some real bad ones out there on the market. It could've been better but these guys obviously tried their best with a limited budget. Another word of caution: you might get dizzy from all the hand held camera movement. If you want a Brit zombie flick, stick to \\"28 Days Later\\" or \\"28 Weeks Later\\", both of which are excellent.

I am also a fan of a good Zombie/Virus Outbreak/Breakdown of society movie when it is done well. This movie is not done well at all. The story line, if you can call it that, is poorly handled and muddled. There is nothing new or creative about how the virus breaks out and society breaks down in this movie. The performance of the actors is just terrible. If they are ad libing then they have done a horrible job. If they are reading a script than the script is horrible as well. The gore is thrown in for shock value only and adds nothing to the movie. The zombies themselves are as boring as they come.

Well this is one of those places where teenagers on a $15 dollar budget do a better job.Honestly you don't even need to read any more of what I have to say, This isn't as much a review as it is a WARNING.

If you're in the mood for a shoot \`em up video game zombie flick, this might not be it, but if you are looking for a dark twisted psychological apocalyptic film with zombies, look no more. This isn't a Dairy of the Dead rip-off, this is what Dairy of the Dead should have been. The film shows you the zombie outbreak from different points of view and at different times of the outbreak. It approaches it from a very real human perspective and that is part of what makes it so freaking scary. How do people deal when they come across a zombie outbreak, how do they cope in a world infested by zombies and how do they react to living in a society where all rules are gone? The film dives into some dark aspects of the human soul, taking you on a journey where very few films dare to go. I actually had to watch it in parts because it disturbed me that much.

No way... but at least it had good effects and a more coherent story line. When I read some of the reviews of Zombie Diaries where people said that it was better than Diary of the Dead, I had to check it out. Some of the acting was decent, but it didn't make up for the acting that was just simply horrible.Even for a movie that you know is going to have lousy, handheld camera film work, this one was terrible. The scenes that may actually have had the potential to have some action were ruined by crummy, camera-only lighting that just gave brief (and convenient) jumbles of images of the zombies, mixed in with longer scenes of complete darkness and off-camera screaming or yelling.I really had to struggle to keep awake during this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombie Diaries - don't bother","review":"Lame.

One could just walk around shooting them in the head with no threat to life and limb. The characters make no effort to fortify their locations; they idiotically go out at night to kill them; a few somehow manage to get themselves caught by zombies in broad daylight; the characters do none of the things one would expect in such a horrible situation other than argue with each other. Mostly we see people looking for zombies or just talking to each other. To top it off the gore factor is missing.

If you like intelligent space opera, then look no further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorance is annoying","review":"The failure of the characters to learn from their mistakes is annoying. When they are attacked by pirates ad nauseum one would think that even the greenest of individuals would learn to defend themselves in some way, but repeatedly the characters in this book blithely tra-la along.The author also has a fixation on rape and the main character has a cultural mindset from the century before last rather than the century after next. The main characters navel gazing was tedious. He seemed to be able to self-fixate at the drop of a hat.I'm not going to bother with the rest in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh, not great","review":"It really baffles me that this book and its sequels have so many fans. The writing is unimpressive, the characters are poorly developed except for the protagonist, and all including the protagonist are wildly unrealistic. The universe they live in isn't at all imaginative, its a not-at-all disguised metaphor for contemporary Earth. When I read this in Junior High I couldn't get real porn so I could at least recommend the series for the excessive sex (some of which was rather imaginative I must say), but with the wide availability of internet smut today I can think of no reason to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic space saga about love, redemption, and survival.","review":"I think the book cover says it best...one day Hope Hubris would be the most powerful man in the solar system, but first he was a refugee.Would love to hear from other Refugee fans or anyone who enjoyed the Space Tyrant series.

To say I was dissapointed is a profound understatement, this story is abhorrent, repulsive, and was obviously written to appeal to the fringes and those who enjoy brutality, repetitive and redundant events, and immorality. I for one will not be reading the sequels in this series and regret that I took time away from reading worthwhile stories and wasted it on this less than satisfying storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par with Piers Anthony standards","review":"I was an avid Pier Anthony fan in my youth. The Split Infinity series followed by the Xanth series absorbed 100s of hours of my young adulthood and I was hooked. Now older and still an avid reader I decided to revert back and try some of Piers' other novels. Unfortunately this one was very dissapointing. Pages and pages of endless description and preaching by the main character adding no value to the story or character development. Repetitive action that causes the reader to hope for a different outcome that never happens. I would not reccomend this book as some of his other novels have a much more interesting story and writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid piece, good album","review":"Submarine Fleet is a solid band giving a solid piece of work here.

You can change polly's hair as well! If you press the wheel then it makes fun music! Very cool toy. I'd say you have to be careful with it so won't break.

If you don't build the 'junkyard' arches, you can use those pieces and follow the instructions to build a second base. This is certainly an intentional move on the part of the designers, who then rebuilt the second base into the arches to give increased playability and justify the inclusion of the 'Watto' figure.(I knocked off one point because the Watto figure leaves something to be desired, and for the lack of a Mawhonic figure to pilot the second pod.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordinary Zen","review":"There are quite a few long reviews on this book that should suffice for a detailed information without my two cents added. I will, however, note that this book lacks much of the glamor so often attributed to Zen masters. 'Shobogenzo Zuimonki' is plain and straight-forward, and Dogen does not lead one to indulge in wild, philosophical explorations. Rather, he points to a quite ordinary and much more 'down-to-Earth' Zen, which is refreshingly simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is a hit","review":"I had no idea who Nichole Nordeman was until I saw her perform at a Clay Crosse concert that I attended recently.

I recommend her music to anyone interested in christian music... and to those who aren't!(One \\"listen\\" and you might change your mind!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"How can she do it?","review":"I challenge DANIELLE of Nichole's first CD reviews to a debate over NN's ability to have a cohesive thought in her poetry, because SHE HAS IT! Her first album had no lack of clarity, and this album is slowly moving up in the ranks of my CD changer. Eyes still need to be on her, because she's not going to leave this field for a long time!

They are ALL great! She has a gift from God and she uses it well. I was Blessed to be able to see her on July,03,2000 in Baton Rouge,La. It was out of this world! Her songs will really make you think....think before you Laugh at someone....think before you Criticize someone....think before Judge someone just because they LOOK different, ACT different or because they have a different SKIN color than you. It will make you think about your walk with God and how you act as a Christian. She writes all of her Songs and Music. I Actually had the privilege of meeting her in person. She was so SWEET and Friendly. She did not mind giving me her Autograph and she even posed in a picture with me.

This is a cd every christian should have. and even if you aren't christian, i can guarantee that this cd with inspire you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting premise.","review":"I must confess that the title is what first intrigued me. I like \\"process\\" oriented books, that tell me how to do more with less. But when I cracked it open, I found a very broad collection of quality open source projects, all available for free.Rather than just listing the products and letting me fend for myself, the authors walk me through what to expect from an MVC or persistence framework, laying out the landscape and telling me what the tradeoffs are for each solution.

The problem which I encountered is that these wont fit my Olympic bar and they also wouldnt fit the E-Z curl bar, which amazon recommended me to buy along with it( Curl bar). I personally suggest a lockjaw because they are quick and covenient & wouldnt give you unnecessary extra hassle of wrestling with the clamps while you are working out."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, BUT A LOT OF WORK","review":"I bought these thinking it was going to be easy to put on and off but it takes 2 hands to compress it enough in order for it to slide on the end of my bar and i am no panzy. i think for the price golds gym offers a way better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I only give it one star because they won't let me give it 0.

These collars will NOT fit on a 2 inch Olympic bar, making them completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Quality, Substandard","review":"These are poor quality barbell collars. I was hoping that these would be the same as the standard (high quality) 2\\" barbell collars that you would find at any commercial gym, but they are not. The springs are very easy to compress, which indicates poor quality. Also the picture used does not depict the actual collars I received. The picture shows collars with handles that angle away from the springs, but the ones received come straight down from springs. That makes them harder to put on and take off, because there is not enough room for your hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"SImple and useful","review":"These clips are a staple in any gym - they are best suited for home gyms as there is not the intense and frequent use that they get in the public gyms.

I guess I got lucky.However, they're not particularly sturdy. They do all right on the barbell, but when I do a dumbbell lift that makes the weight go vertical (hammer curls, tricep extensions, etc) I find the clamps slipping with any semi-decent weight (40+ lbs per side). This is VERY disconcerting when it's going above your head for a tricep extension. I've quit doing those lifts for the time being, as much as it upsets me. Getting a massive head injury doesn't sound like fun, or a good workout.I'm currently trying to find some better clamps. They're cheap but you get what you pay for I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"I bought 3 sets of these to go with a cheap dumbell/curl bar set I pick up from Walmart. The bars came with some really cheap collars that slid off the bar way to easy. Of the 3 sets I bought, 2 or 3 of the actual collars fit well on the bars. The others are kind of a pain to get on. I would imagine over time and with use they will loosen up some, but that's the reason for only 4 stars. Other than the fact that some of them are a pain to get on and off, they do work much better and keep the weights on the bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected","review":"Everything I expected from this collar.

I would not recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I bought 4 sets of these to replace my current crappy collars. Too bad these suck even more. They slide right on and off when they are tightened. There is no need to squeeze the handles to open them up and slide em on. What good is it to have these things if they don't hold on tight? Only 1 out of the 8 collars worked. Horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and Secure","review":"The Valeo Olympic Spring Collars are easy to slip on and off the bar yet they grip and firmly keep the weighted plates in place during any type of lift.

You dont even get what you pay for.","review":"This product will not fit any of your olympic bars and as many have likely found out, it is not worth the effort to return it. They are \\"over sprung\\" and would take complete compression to get on a bar. I could not get them on any of my three bars. DO NOT BUY THIS SHODDY PRODUCT. Yet another \\"amazon prime product\\" quickly becomming synonymous with \\"second hand products not worth the purchase price where you are actually paying for shipping because the product is worthless and free\\" ...

The first two types, from different manufacturers have been great. This product is by far the least usable. When I squeeze the collar to slide it on or off the collar twists to a diagonal alignment and maintains a lot of friction against the bar. This makes it very difficult to slide on and off.I think they are crap and would never purchase them again"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor sound quality; authentic?","review":"These may be based on the original great popular tunes, but the sound quality is too poor for there to be much appreciation. In fact it sounds like it was made from a highly compressed mp3 file.

You will cheer for both characters and you are almost to the brink of tears once you read the epiloge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised and disappointed","review":"I have to say that I was sadly disappointed with the book. I am an aspiring writer and bought the book because of my mentor. The story has a good plot and I am familiar with Richmond and Williamsburg in Virginia, which is the setting for the book. But a part of the way into the book I had to stop reading. The scenes and words were trashy and extremely sexual. I thought to myself, if this is what it takes to be a writer, then I am not a writer.

My last bulb is blown and still inside because it is fused to the connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle","review":"It lasted one year. During that year, the motion sensor would trip on its own which made it pointless since it turned on quite often. As others have pointed out, you would have to jump around very near it to get it to turn on, and yet it would go off on its own when nothing was near. Replacing the bulb was a pain. Turns out the ceramic mounts that hold the bulb in place had grown brittle over time from the heat and cracked when I tried to replace the bulb. I also noticed that I do not like the method of removing the glass front.

So, in the end I sprayed it on, wiped down the windows, wiped them down again immediately after, and finally wiped them down 4 days later to keep them clear.Edit - After using the product on two separate vehicles for almost two months I ended up throwing out the product. I had to clean the windows on my vehicles every 3-4 days to keep them from fogging up and greatly inhibiting my view through windows or mirrors.

At least we thought it was a good deal. By the time we got it hooked up and running, the printing was fine. But not two days later, I tried my first scanning job....big mistake. I got the click click click noise of machinery trying to work, but nothing happening. I had to unplug the printer in order to stop this annoying sound. After calling the Lexmark help line, they sent me this newer version....same stupid problems. This thing prints fine, but won't scan or copy.

The printer driver does not work with a simple installation process although the scanner driver does. I downloaded the \\"latest\\" version, it did not fix the problem but then the scanner user interface completely disappeared. After install/uninstall/reboot > 10 times with a specific sequence, and including manually editing registry a few times, finally, both the printer and scanner drivers are fully operational, although I still don't have the scanner user interface. I would not expect an average user to get it work if all drivers were not installed right the first time. After all, I decided to keep this printer/scanner since hardware works as expected, and I can use other software to operate the scanner. Customer support is reasonable through the live-chat agent but when the software is so buggy, overall you get limited help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only those who love buying ink need apply.","review":"It prints beautifully, the first time, every cartridge. Beyond that, it's a crapshoot. There are times I'll get two or three printings before either blue or yellow clogs up, rendering the whole color cartridge useless, and there are others where I'll buy new cartridges, print something, go back to print something else in a day or two, and again, one color clogged. The black never seems to clog or dry out unless I go weeks or months without use, but the color is useless. Throw in the fact that it has fed paper crooked since day one (bad design on Lexmark's part), and you'll begin to see my frustrations.Also, the two-pack of cartridges costs more than the printer itself. That probably should've been my fist warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless with Windows 7","review":"Should be zero star rating. Since upgrading to Windows 7 this has become a paperweight.

I knew I should have put it on ebay and sold it, but stupid me opened the box. Found out that it didn't even come with both cartridges! (which I hear is common these days) I printed an 8x10 on nice glossy photo paper and was fairly impressed given the low msrp of this printer. However, after 3 weeks of non-use, the yellow nozzles are hopelessly clogged.

Can opens up with a twist of the turn dial, and I used a regular hand rag to apply to shoes after applying generously to rag. I used plenty of elbow grease and rubbed it in all over shoe. After I was done it looked like I just brought them home from the shoe store. Looks like new, but as with any shoe polish it depends on what kind of work or walk environment as to how long the polish will last, but I didn't use that much so there is plenty to go around for the low price I paid. I have never used any other shoe polish before so I don't have anything to compare it to otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.

I dont know what other software can do the job better, but this one is definitely not the one, at least with this user (Windows XP user).

Now, older and wiser, I study in Yeshiva and learn Torah on a daily basis. What Artscroll does is pick and choose which commentaries to include in order to fit their agenda. Before reading it, I know which midrash or Rashi they will cite in favor of an equally valid Onkelos, Rambam or Ramban (or the other way around). If you wish to stick to one view that is valid, though the views of Gedolim are contingent upon numerous variables. While make no mistake about it if it is a choice between this and some conservative or reformed Chumash- the choice is obvious. Though I do believe, as does my Rabbi, that for all the good Artscroll does, they do equally if not more harm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast becoming the new standard Chumash in synagogues","review":"I used to use the Hertz Chumash that is common in most Conservative and Orthodox synagogues. Now when I am in synagogue, I go looking for a Stone Chumash, which I find far superior to Hertz. Unfortunately, others do as well, and the supply is not yet up to the demand. Now I own my own.Not only is the Stone Chumash an easy-to-read translation with fascinating commentaries, it also includes various tables and charts, such as geneology charts and timelines of events, and drawings of items in the Mishkan, which help give the Torah more meaning.

For those of you out there low on cash, I recommend reading hir column archives and forgetting this book.That said, if you aren't low on cash or want a handy reference without having to read multiple screens worth of information it's quite lovely.

If you already know what hardware there is available this book won't be much help. It didn't even have suggestions about which toy might be superior for which purpose. I was hoping for a more comprehensive treatment of the act and how it could enhance the bond between my lover and myself. This book was more like an quick overview stretched out for 100 pages.

I really liked that the Japanese characters were kept untranslated and the background music, songs and opening were kept in tact. I like being able to learn through research rather than having subtitles stamped over them.It pleased me to find the rest of the episodes were available on Amazon Prime. The show only ran one season, but this one ended the story without a cliffhanger. The show itself is very silly and sometimes quite insane. It's along the same lines of silliness as Hare+Guu, which I also enjoyed watching. The streaming was great. No issues with Amazon itself.

Little wonder why Amazon bundle the two books together.Putting the two sets of ideas side by side (and they are developed independently using different research methods), one see a clear match between the typology of Lawrence & Nohria's basic drives and Reiss's basic desires, although the 4 drives in Lawrence & Nohria are higher-order groupings of Reiss's 16 basic desires.The only comments that I would like to add here is that the 4 drives in Lawrence & Nohria should be seen as psychological rather than biological. Secondly, the concept of individuality (i.e. individual differences in \\"how much\\" we desire each of these basic drives) is not apparent in this book as it is in Reiss's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book uses scientific 'evidence' like it was written in the 50s.

Moberly's book presents the argument that homosexuals suffer from stunted development ... and the \\"new Christian ethic\\" is simply to acknolwedge that. When gays \\"grow up\\" they can become heterosexual. She presents no case studies for her theories, no facts -- which leads me to believe she makes up her conclusions.

Whether this is the cause of homosexuality is not my concern. This book invalidates homosexuals as if there were something wrong with being gay. Moberley says that later-life bonding with the same sex (platonically) can change one spontaneously into a heterosexual.I find her concepts to be emotionally abusive because she wants to rewrite the personalities of homosexuals, as if they had a mental disorder. Her treatment methods are immoral.

I'd also recommend it to people who want to help people who want to change as it looks at the underlying issues, not the symptom.

The life she brings to this track is highly noticeable and all I can say is that it is a travesty that no one with any sense noticed this and did the song justice. Even D. Ramirez, who's remix of the original version was the basis for this dirty dancefloor number, fails to deliver the goods on the full-length vocal mix. Ignore the dub on this, as it also fails to please.I'd also like to say that any future releases of this song are probably worth ignoring as well. ITunes currently has a single of this up and all the remixes (from Fred Falke, Randy Katana, Tony Senghorne, and Kris Menace) are all highly lackluster and either completely misuse Luciana's vocals or fail to use them at all.This is what happens when good dance songs get badly remixed.

The first day I ran with this thing on, within three steps the straps loosened up and the vest began to bounce up and down, and side to side.I refused to turn around and go home to adjust it, so I had to hold the thing down with my hands as I ran. Very annoying. The second day, I tried knotting the straps together and although it helped, it still ended up loosing up enough to make it bounce up and down slightly. I just got back from running with it on the third day in a row, and again, didn't say on tight. Another thing worth noting is that the vest kind of feels like its slipping off your shoulders as you run, but doesn't actually do so. Feels like its pulling down and out on your shoulders, and if you lift your arms up, you can feel it restraining some movement. I'm probably going to return it tomorrow.

He then gives some to his work mate (Bullock) who suddenly turns into a beauty after looking a complete dog (shades of Miss Congeniality).This is when the movie dies on its feet. It seems to be badly edited with bits missing, Donovan is a bad actor, I'm not surprised he didn't get to become a huge star, unlike Bullock who holds the whole mess together (just).

She starts out looking really bad and winds up looking beautiful as she starts emerging from the academic, scientific cocoon in which she had wrapped herself.A number of well done comedy moments involving the love potion provide plenty of laughter for the viewer.

The best tracks on the album happen to be the ones produced by Sheryl Crow, which include: \\"Candlebright\\", \\"Sorcerer\\" and \\"Fall From Grace\\". Crow did wonders with Stevie's already unique melodious music by turning the guitars up and re-capturing the sound that established Stevie as one of the best female rock vocalists of the 70's. Many reviewers have compared \\"the magic\\" of TISL with that of Bella Donna and I would have to heartily agree.

That Made Me Stronger, again not a \\"Baby why don't you love me anymore?\\" song.

There is not a bad song on this CD, and they're all beautifully delivered to us as only Stevie can deliver a song. She takes us into her world with each song.

The people who worked/appeared on this CD from the producers to Sheryl Crow, Sarah McLaghlan... managed to snap Stevie out of her magical, mystical trance. This album sounds like everyone's else's out there -- mainly those of her guests. The linear notes say Sharon Celani and Lori Nicks were on there but I could barely hear them. And Stevie's voice is losing its magic. It's become far too nasally and thick to listen to comfortably and the work on this album accentuated that. Only \\"Fall From Grace\\" and a couple others in combination earned the one star I rate this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stevie's back with a vengence!","review":"This album is great! I am not being bias when I say this either. I am 23 and I have loved Stevie for nearly a decade now. I have all of her albums, bootlegs, singles etc. Never has Stevie sounded so good since 1977's Rumours and 1981's Bella Donna. Not only does the music sound good but also the lyrics, Stevies voice and sound of Stevie dueting with Natalie Maines on Too Far From Texas and the background vocals of Sarah McLachlan in Love Is. I definitely recommend this album to everyone even the non-Stevie Nicks fans. I hope that this success of hers continues and spills over into Fleetwood Mac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Stevie","review":"and forever proud of her lyrics.

However, her raspy voice somewhat dominates the entire album giving a vague impression of a lack of variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best never rest","review":"Stevie is doing it again.

Instead, Sheryl Crow manages to make just about every song sound like the other, which only contributes to the ennui.Unfortunately, only one track, \\"Everyday\\", stands out, and it's not even written by Nicks.I was hoping for a recording as moving and stirring, if not as passionate, as Buckingham/Nicks, but this doesn't come close. Perhaps the pair should collaborate again; the murky dam water may provide the fertile medium for creativity that was evidently missing when this was recorded.I heard Stevie comment that this record took a \\"long time\\" to make.

She has definitely gone the way of Lindsay Buckingham, who coincidentally, has also lost it (voice-wise), but still continues as if everything were fine. It would have been better to leave well enough alone. How very, very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Think She's In Trouble...","review":"Like most of you, I am a Nicks fan and have all her solo work. I really like Street Angel, much more than this release. I listened to it once. Liked about three songs. Listened to it a few more times. Hmmmm. Not much sticks out. Sort of reminds me of Elton's WEST COAST album. All the press people yelp about a \\"return to form\\" and a \\"modern classic.\\" Hey, all we really want from these 50somethings is a good album. No great expectations. Well, this album is probably my least favorite. Like Elton, the hype machine went into gear. I listened, but this album isn't the classic we heard so much about. Also, I think we all know it--sales dropped off pretty fast and like Elton's latest, it wasn't the \\"hit\\" everyone thought it was going to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only Stevie had a better band...","review":"Here are 13 new songs, but unfortunately they mostly sound the same. I wish Stevie had a more inspired set of band members to accompany her. They just don't give her much to work with. There are not many musicians in the world that can write the lyrics, sing the songs and compose the music and come up with a great CD. Stevie isn't a one-person band and this CD relies too much on her voice to keep your attention. The band just stays in the background and adds nothing to Stevie's effort. The result is a repetitive and a lackluster CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many people even listened to this dreck...","review":"before writing such glowing reviews? Stevie Nicks has made a career out of writing the same three songs over and over and over...Good for her, but I'm not impressed. She definitely needs Lindsey Buckingham to rein her in as she couldn't write an interesting song if her life depended on it. And bringing in Sheryl Crow? Miss Crow rode on Kevin Gilbert's coattails to fame and now churns out ordinary music for the masses who wouldn't recognize Good Music if it bit them. Stevie, hope you make a lot of money with this CD. Seems to me it's the only reason to release such a poor selection of songs...Maybe it's me, but the whole act is getting very tiresome. She's no longer Rhiannon, the Welsh Witch, just a vocalist who's better days are long gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money on this one, try and get it for free","review":"I give this album only two stars for Trouble In Shang-ri-la\\" & \\"Planets of the Universe\\", these songs are great. I found the songs to be repetitive and not up to par with early Nick's work. If you can get it for free save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back","review":"Although I am a real sucker for Stevie's older stuff ie Edge of Seventeen, Stand Back, Stop Draggin my Heart Around, I found this CD to be refreshing. A suprise Christmas gift, I had to warm up to the new stuff. However I think that Stevie adapts to the new sounds that we hear today while simutaneously retaining her old sound and spirit that her listeners have grown to relish. She keeps on rocking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Seems Right In Paradise...","review":"The title track as well as the album name, Trouble In Shangri-La means trouble in Paradise. There's no trouble on this CD. I found Everyday to be uplifting. Planets of the Universe and Fall From Grace are energetic songs, that make you want to get up and dance. Sorceror and Love Changes are a bit different, kind of jazzy, but otherwise great tunes. Some songs are slower ballads like That Made Me Stronger and I Miss You evoke emotional feeling and thought. In conclusion, this record is a must for Stevie Nicks fans, and anyone else who enjoys music that is written by the artist and not by the record companies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Much Needed Shot in the Arm to the Music Industry","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the most powerful works that Stevie has even done. Her songwriting is stronger than ever and the musical arrangements on this CD are pure genius. The beauty of Stevie Nicks is that not only is she one of the primary influences for women in rock, but she becomes influenced by her peers and admirers. There are hints of Sheryl Crow, Patti Smith and Emmylou Harris in this CD along with her usual melodic gypsy fare. This CD is a solid piece or work and anyone who appreciates great rock and roll like Stevie and her contemporaries (Tom Petty, Don Henley, etc.) will NOT be disappointed by this CD. Stevie, thank you for continuing to inspire the rest of us with your magic. Keep doin' that voodoo you do so well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE'S BACK...................","review":"Stevie Nicks is back in full force. Trouble in Shangrila is the album that everyone has been waiting for from Stevie. The song writing can not be beat. The production is flawless. The voice is incredible. Trouble in Shangrila will remind everyone why Fleetwood Mac became the supergroup that they are. Without Stevie, they would have never accomplished so much in music. This album deserves to go platinum. Stevie is back to save us from the teen pop acts that are flooding the airwaves. Hats off to Stevie Nicks for delivering such a stellar piece of work...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't download CDs you bought.","review":"Bought this album for $4.99. Downloaded the 'free' version as part of amazon prime. They messed up the shipping and had to resend it.

So far my 'free' downloads have cost me $9.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"So many good songs. So soulful.

But her voice...has not...aged well. Granted the rest of her may still look 30, but her voice...that's another story. The first song I heard off this was \\"Too Far From Texas\\", I couldn't believe I was actually hearing a \\"new\\" song from Stevie Nicks on the radio! It's a good song, and her voice would have sounded good on it 15-20 years ago...

Sometimes it's a breeze","review":"She's added some backup singers, although I don't think she needed them. Listen to it at least twice before you decide. What it is lacking in melody has been made up for in sheer songwriting genius, laying it all out on the table for anyone willing to listen.\\"That Made me Stronger\\" was written about a conversation she had with Tom Petty; and most of the other songs seem to have been written about every woman's experience in this world. \\"Sorcerer\\" being her own personal story perhaps..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, her worst album yet","review":"This album is dreadful. Every song sounds the same (thanks to Sheryl Crow) and Stevie's voice is more monotone and without range than ever. The generic backing tracks are the worst thing though, with electronic drumtracks and the same beat on every song, they sound like hip hop tracks. What happened to real live rock bands playing the instruments? Stevie was once the queen or rock, well, she'll never lay claim to that again with preprogammed music like this. Top it all off with uninspired guest appearances by people who have absolutely nothing in common with Stevie's style such as Macy Gray and Sarah Machlachlan in what's an obvious attempt to get airplay and you have the worst album she has ever released."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is a disgrace....","review":"After hearing such classics as \\"Edge Of Seventeen\\" and \\"Rooms On Fire\\" this pales next to them. The title track offers a promise for a good CD, but it quickly goes down hill from there. She sort of has a voice like Macy Grey, it changed vastly since the last album. Stevie once again fails to make herself popular by adding a few newer artists, Sarah McLaughlan and Sheryll Crow. Also she needs to stop trying to be some music goddess! Look at the cover, how more fairytale-like can you get? In conclusion buy her older stuff. If you already have ALL of her older stuff(even the worst of the old is better than all the new) save your money, something better is bound to come out. Hey, you can't get any lower than the pits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Washed up vocals destroys the solid music","review":"Unfortunately, Stevie's voice ruins what is a solid collection of songs and musicianship. I realize she has never had a great voice, but it has grown so raspy and unappealing that I found it hard to listen to the album. You're better off buying the classic Mac albums of the 70s and early 80s."},{"rating":"1","title":"unabel to listen to the sample review.","review":"heard on my own cd player,to far from texas,to meloncholic,&sad to listen to,should be drop from the cd song play!It is to personal,& should not be included in a song format,of that style!

Very rock and roll, very Stevie, just perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STAND BACK NICKS IS ON TOP!","review":"Stevie Nicks is back with her solo career on top. \\"Trouble in Shangri'La\\" is a strong effort.If I had to put all of her solo efforts together I would have to say that \\"Bella Donna\\" from 1981 is her best album to date.Though this album gives you back the Nicks we missed with \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\", \\"Bombay Sapphire\\", \\"Fall From Grace\\" and Sorcerer\\" as some of the strongest cuts on the album.The production and Nicks raspy vocals are at there strongest coming into the new century.This is a very good album from beginning to end - but of course I am comparing it to her classic \\"Bella Donna\\" and I have to take off 1 star due to some filler songs like \\"Everyday\\", and \\"I Miss You\\", however still a very strong CD that will be playing on my machine for quite sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stevie is at her absolute BEST! She's never been better!","review":"I've been listening to Stevie since the mid 70's. While her other solo albums have shone, this one is by far her best. I put it on this afternoon and was singing along by the 3rd verse of the 2nd song! Very lyrical. Excellent musical experimentation. I love that she collaborated on so much of this album-it shows. All the contributing artists are in top form. Good job Stevie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of her best","review":"I read a review written by someone who was rating Stevie Nick's \\"The other side of the mirror\\" and at that time the person wrote that she would never produce another album that was as good or as popular as \\"Bella Donna\\". That had to be before she produced \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\". I can't speak for record sales but I think that artistically this has to be one of her best albums. Every song on this album is great and as good as Bella Donna was, This has to rate as one of her most fantastic albums. I actually like the \\"Wild Heart\\" better than \\"Bella Donna\\", but if you are a true fan of Stevie Nick's this album should amaze you. Go out and buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Stevie Nicks !!!!!! You Get 12 Great Songs = One oustanding CD !!!!!!!","review":"This is a fantastic cd from Stevie Nicks.

Also, infertility is not the case in all adoptive families (mine included). Another statement that bothered me was this one about Russia: \\"how it's too hard for families to keep more than one baby...\\"I wish I had also known that the book is about a young girl (at least that's what the drawings portray) - I would be reading this book to a boy.The book is extremely simplistic in words and pictures, and nothing an adoptive parent wouldn't naturally tell an adoptive child anyway. The font is difficult to read. I will re-sell this one to someone else whose family it better fits.Lesson learned: never buy another book that does not have the \\"look inside\\" feature or that I can see in person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another rip-off","review":"This is another one of those CD's featuring re-makes of hits by one or more of the original artists.

It attempts to weave business management, nature writing, fishing, and quantum mechanics, among other things. For me, this attempt fails. \\"Your mileage may vary\\". The writing is pleasant in places, but painful in many others:\\"The maze of streets and alleyways lead on to limbs and twigs, reaching out to halls in needles with special energy-fixing organelles-the chloroplasts too have DNA. It is here the favored triplets enact their star performance to a caroling chorus of chlorphyll. Triplets beckoned from the moisture of the soil are joined in wedlock with triplets coaxed in from the breeze. The parson comes from ninty million miles away. The nuptial festivities are sanctified with sunlight.

I even sent a gift copy to my son. Unfortunately, the book wasn't worth the wait. I waited patiently for the belly laughing humor I was sure this book contained and all I received for my patience was a few chuckles.Not only was they hype much better than the book but I found the editing (if there was any) to be very poor. As a reader I find it very frustrating to try and guess which word the author intended to use in a given sentence. This book was worse than a small town weekly newspaper for errors. In addition, I found the author's over use of asides and paragraph numbering to be even more frustrating.Mr. Williams shows potential as a southern humorist but this book obviously went to print way too soon.

Not only are there many recommendations but, there are complete stories and songs in the book to allow you to teach without having to purchase other books. There is more information in the book than I thought my daughter could comprehend. But, I offer some of the information to her and she understands and wants more.

My daughter attends a school that teaches the material covered in this book and she's learning the continents, all about Christopher Columbus, simple fractions and she's collecting data and graphing it in math class.

There are some Core Knowledge schools throughout the US but we need more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Everything","review":"I expected a more informative text, but most of the book was filler -- old, simple lesson ideas, re-printed fairy tale stories and book lists.

I grew up with many of these stories and KNOW my parents and grandparents told them in a much less violent way. I will be returning this book for sure.If you don't want to tell your child stories about death, violence and hitting then don't waste your time on this book. I know they will learn this at some point....but let them be children for the short time they are innocent.Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful general resource","review":"Though it runs the risk of serving everyone and so pleasing no one, this Core Knowledge kindergarten book really is helpful. I've used it as a \\"spine\\" to satisfy myself that I haven't left any gaping holes in my daughter's kindergarten education. It seems to have been written more for folks with kids in public school to fill in any gaps; I'm using it from a homeschooler's perspective. It has served its purpose. I don't plan to use the remaining Core Knowledge Series books because I want to pursue a classical education for my kids, but I would recommend this book to those who are as timid as I was starting out with homeschooling and who haven't yet settled on a specific curriculum or direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this series!","review":"This is the stuff we want our children to know!

I'm just a girl is a great song, I've always loved Gwens voice its very unique and unlike any other voices. My favourite song on the album is very difficult to say because I adored everything. And They haven't let us down with the most recent, It's my life which is one of my favourite songs of all time. All and all this was one hell of an album.

They only got popular when gwen broke up with the gutarist and actully could write something descent, and a producer came in and chANGED THEIR 8 MINUTE SONGS into something that will sell. Now that the dust has settled from the break up and their not making songs like im just a girl no doubt complety sucks. All their music is crap hella good is one of the worst songs ever it is all pop their is not even a guitar playing in that song.

Their music is awfull."},{"rating":"1","title":"So utterly worthless it brings me to the point of tears...","review":"No Doubt is (are?) the most overrated band, even more so than [...].

Hollaback Girl wasn't much better, either.Underneath It All, Hella Good, Hey Baby and I'm Just a Girl stand as the weakest tracks, but everything here's bad. Underneath It All is my alltime least favorite song, or at least one of them.I've bashed this album on many fronts, so I'll end on a good note...you could do worse...wait wait, I got this mixed up with my future Led Zeppelin review.I've bashed this album on many fronts, so I'll end on a bad note: this is crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk Talk's version of \\"It's my life\\" is Still BETTER !!!!","review":"But Good try anyways Gwen ...

Gwen Stefani's voice is as irritating a a cat being strangled. What possesed them to re-make a great song like Talk Talk's \\"It's My Life\\" is beyond me. Perhaps it will encourage some people to investigate some of Talk Talk's music. Then maybe they can get a glimpse of what real talent is. If this band ever had any shred of integrity it was lost so fast once they made some notiriety. They almost make Madonna look like she deserves her fame.

It captures all of their finest music.Two new surprises in the collection are \\"Trapped in a Box\\" and \\"It's my Life.\\" The first one will take you back to the early years of No Doubt and their foundation, while the later will bring you to the present. \\"It's my life\\" is a brand new project for the band. They took a previously written song and made it their own vs. writing their own material.Overall, this in one CD not to be missed!It will make a great addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great notes too!","review":"Aside from being a great CD the liner notes are great too. For someone who doesn't know all there to know about No Doubt the liner notes give you the backstory on all the songs plus a time-appropriate photo for each song. If you don't own any No Doubt already, buy this CD--you'll recognize every song and for those lyrics you didn't know you'll have the words to sing along to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marry Me Gwen Stefani!","review":"I think that at this point in No Doubts career, it was high time for them to produce an disc with all of their singles. My favorite cut on this is the high octane bombast of \\"New\\". I love the over processed drums, the 80s style keyboards, and everything about the song. Another highlight is \\"Hella Good,\\" which is from the rock steady album. Over all, I believe that this is an album thats all about change, as is the band. They have gone from scrappy kids who like Ska, to neo New wavers in 10 years. They have a way of paying homage to their influences, while claiming the styles for their own in a way that no other band is capable of. the only thing that would make it better is if this record was sequenced chronologically, either in correct, or reverse order, so the listener could take the journey with the band, instead of having it scattered around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Overview","review":"No Doubt's The Singles 1992-2003 includes most of their hit songs from 1996-2001 as well as a great new track, a cover of Talk Talk's \\"It's My Life.\\" Here, they manage to sound fresh while staying true to their new wave-inspired roots. Including their first single, 1992's \\"Trapped in a Box,\\" is a good move as it highlights how far the band has come since the beginning. Preferably, the album would include \\"Happy Now?\\" and be sequenced chronologically; nonetheless, this is an excellent collection for casual fans. You can't argue with hits like \\"Just a Girl,\\" \\"Simple Kind of Life,\\" and \\"Hey Baby.\\" 4 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I don't usually like many greatest hits cds because many artists tend to leave out my favorite songs, but I love No Doubt's The Singles 92-03. Each song from this retrospective is excellent and reminds me of certain times when that song was a hit. Tracks from Tragic Kingdom takes me back to middle school while songs from Rock Steady reminds me of senior year. I'm not a big No Doubt fan (I only have Tragic Kingdom) but this is hands down, one of favorite albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"please forgive the below idiot","review":"A great classic cd that includes the latest and the greatest.Just please ignore the idiot below-----> mauricio porco \\"trance tot the sun\\" who writes that kind of review.

Tragic Kingdom is their best CD, hands down, though Ex-Girlfriend is my favorite song (& video) they've ever done. my favorites are ex-girlfriend, excuse me mr., hella good (great dancing song), hey baby, etc. i wish they wouldnt have put don't speak on it (even though it's their biggest hit)."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many great songs!","review":"Never have I seen such a great catalogue of hits. This \`best of' album truly represents No Doubt in its best light. All their wonderful singles are on this disc. Once you pop in this CD you'll realize just how many awesome pop-rock hits this band has put out. This is a both great introduction to no doubt and an awesome compilation of their best songs for the loyal No Doubt fans. I rank this album high up with Tori Amos' new greatest hits album, which is also defiantly worth checking out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointed","review":"Love the band, but wasn't sure why they took their hits and wrecked them by remixing them with artists who just don't have the talent or sound that they have... anybody want my copy? you can have it for free..."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I really should do these review things more often. This item/seller however deserved it. The album came right on time, \\"like new\\" as described with no scratches on the case or disc. I would most definitely buy from this seller again. And the cd is great, good compilation of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk Talk","review":"All I can say is that I grew up a sain, stable being because No Doubt guided me through middle school. God knows I would have ended up like a tanned bimbo if I grew up with Britney. Overall, this is a good cd, although I do agree it should be in chronological order. The new single is an added bonus that everyone will enjoy, even if it's a cover. Poppy beats and saucy character, electric keyboards and funky guitars bass, and a good drumline is what you'll find packed into this cd.

It's sure to bring back great memories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"I already had Rock Steady and Return of Saturn, and i was kind of unsure about purchasing this CD since there are repeats and I really hate that, but this CD is awesome! I don't care if I had every single one of No Doubt's CD, I would still buy this! This CD puts all the best songs together in one awesome CD! wow. the best songs are 'don't speak', 'hey baby', 'underneath it all', 'spiderwebs', 'just a girl', 'hella good' and 'simple kind of life'. That's a lot of best songs, and from that you can tell what a great CD this is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No doubt, it's awesome..","review":"I have been a No Doubt fan ever since the release of \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" in 1995. Some of my fave songs are: spiderwebs, it's my life, ex-girlfriend, don't speak, just a girl, hella good, hey baby(i like the video), underneath it all, and running. NO DOUBT ROCKS!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you must have only one No Doubt album...","review":"...this is probably it. Compiling most if not all of the band's mid 90s/early 00s material, \\"The Singles\\" is a fantastic overview of one of the best pop bands to emerge in the post-new wave era. Though originally pigeonholed as a ska revival band, No Doubt proved themselves capable of digesting every great pop trend of the last 20 years and churning those influences back out in the form of concise 4 minute singles. The new cover of Talk Talk's \\"It's My Life\\" is pleasant but somewhat pointless in it's straightforward adherence to the original, but the rest of the album is one magnificent pop single after another. The only reason not to purchase \\"The Singles\\" is if you plan on buying the individual albums instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"the perfect no doubt collection","review":"every great song no doubt has put out in their career is on this record and I still play it all the time. I would recommend getting this, but also buy Return of Saturn cause some of the lesser known tracks are the best music of their career."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Had No Idea They Had Such Great Songs!","review":"I've always liked No Doubt, particuarly the always-entertaining Gwen Stefani, but not enough to ever consider buying a full album. Still, after seeing their \\"The Singles\\", I knew I had to have it.The album is pretty good, especially \\"Just a Girl\\", \\"Hey Baby\\", \\"Underneath It All\\", and \\"Don't Speak\\". Also, check out Ms. Stefani's superb solo album, \\"Love Angel Music Baby\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Doubt...That's Right!!","review":"I have never been a fan of this kind of music, but my goodness this band is just great! Listening to their music has really opened my eyes to the various musical styles out there. Now I have expanded my collection to include all kinds and I'm loving it. Gwen's voice is different; she is definitely unique and it only makes the band stand out from the others. I don't really know about the history or specifics of the band and their career, but I know enough to recommend this cd to causal listeners or those who are just becoming acquainted with their music. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MUSIC FROM A GREAT BAND","review":"This CD is Great. I am now officially an admirer of NO DOUBTS music. I've always like their music and GWEN's stage presence.But what made it a done deal was when i heard the remake of TALK TALK's It's My Life. Talk Talk is one of my Favorite groups. And I don't think nobody could have done it better than No Doubt. And for the record I'm a Hip-Hop Producer. So thats saying alot.Because having your ear for music cross over to another music category and love what you hear says alot about that artist or band. And does this album deserve 5 stars....NO DOUBT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"This album got me into No Doubt. I got it for It's My Life, but now Sunday Morning is my favorite. If you are a casual fan or hard core fan, buy this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Watching a Sinking Ship","review":"Let me start off by saying I know that this is a CD more for new fans of No Doubt, so there won't be all of their best songs. However, this CD really highlights how far this once great band has fallen. I got into No Doubt in about 93 or 94 and enjoyed their ska sound. Their first CD was great, the Beacon Street Collection was incredible too, Tragic Kingdom was great, then it all went downhill from their as they abandoned their sound. Now I look at a collection that doesn't include Total Hate, Move On, Happy Now (which actually was a single) or any other older songs other than the massively overrated Trapped in a Box. Get this CD if you're new to the band or if you want to see as a band self-implodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average Set from a Very Run of the Mill Band","review":"at first I thought No Doubt was kinda Cool but over time they got corny&aside from a few decent cuts they just seemed like an Act going through the Motions.One Knock out song in \\"Don't Speak\\"&some pretty good tracks here&there but nothing that has Been Consistant.overall they are very average to me&pretty run of the mill after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brown noise generator","review":"I watched it, suffered through it and at several points it was as though Jay focused his brown noise wave on my bowels.

It is well-written, lively, and most readable; but it is also terribly romanticized, Damien IS saintly. Perhaps he was. Readers should take minor note that the main text was published originally in 1937 (according to an older edition of this book that I own)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good subjectivist moral philosophy","review":"This is a well written, entertaining book. I did not find the arguments in the early part of the book on error theory and the \\"queerness\\" of object values convincing, but I do believe that different people have different values, which opens the door for a subjective moral philosophy. At this point, the book does an excellent job in developing and building the ideas behind just such a philosophy. This is the closest to \\"Humean\\" moral thought written in the 20th century that I have found (which I consider to be high praise)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for Training, HR and OD practicioners","review":"One of the most useful books I have read in the past few years. The Robinsons present a consultant- and client-friendly consulting model and offer many specific how to's to put it to work. While the terminology they use in their model could be improved, the theory is sound and very readable. It isn't, however, a quick fix book: it takes serious thought and a lot of work to employ their ideas. But that is what it takes for HR professionals to earn a seat at the table.

I bought a membership in aircourier.org and it was the worst travel investment I ever made. The customer service is terrible, which actually counts tons when you're trying to arrange a flight. (You might have better luck going through another consolidator, but aircourier.org is really terrible.)The other thing I found after diligently checking the flight lists is that you can often do better these days just by finding cheap web-fare flights yourself on sites like qixo.com, expedia.com, etc.. I was really disappointed by what I thought would be higher discounts. It's often no more than a few dollars (!!) difference for a lot more hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as you might think","review":"Hailed by reviewers all over the US (according to the book itself), this book definetely does not deliver.

I have purchased several high quality cat posts/trees over the last five years. The carpeting on all of them is soft and much better quality. This is what they show in the pictures but NOT what you get. This carpeting is not soft at all. It is very rough and somewhat shaggy. They obviously are using much cheaper carpeting but did not bother to update their photos. It is deceptive.A couple of years ago I purchased a beautiful cat tree with four cradles, a tunnel, sisal posts, and high quality carpeting all for $150.I purchased this post because of good reviews and the pictures show high quality carpeting.

They are also fallible, their space craft accident record is abysmal.These stories are all very optimistic.Generally I like my aliens \\"fried\\", but I'd make exception for \\"the people\\", they're simply too nice to shoot.

She had the ability to weave magic into her stories, and to make the reader feel and know what was happening. From Perdita and Low, to Lucine, to Valancy and the rest, Zenna made her characters come alive, and gave the feeling that these were not imaginary people, but real ones. These were not made-up events, but she was describing life somewhere in this world that was as it *should* be. Another reviewer said that there would be less suicide if more teens would read these stories, and I agree wholeheartedly. I know they changed my outlook on life.

Each reading is as fresh as the first! There is humor, sadness, joy and just about everything else but it is the pure Goodness of her characters that always shines through. The paperbacks, which have gone in and out of print many times (and are currently unavailable) began intertwining the original \\"pulp\\" stories with another story in order to tie then all together and Ingathering maintains this format, and has one previously-unpublished story.

Reusable coffee-ground basket which came with machine arrived bent out of shape.It does make coffee. The auto-pause works.

Venus 2001 sound alful too...the vocals are buried deep into the track and at times, doesn't even sound like the girls. I guess they are laughing all the way to the bank with this album.

However, I really like it now. They are pretty heavy into the techno-sound now. The remakes of old songs are to be viewed as playing around and experimentation. If you don't expect an \\"improvement\\" on the originals, you won't be disappointed. Just look at them as fun remixes. Overall, I like \\"If\\" and \\"Crazy\\" probably the best. But Boom is also quite good. I didn't care for the Careless Whisper cover. They rushed it a bit. I would rather have heard more of a slow \\"Through a Child's Eyes\\"-theme applied to it. All in all, worth the money to get in the US. Why they didn't release here is not known, but their die-hard fans have to get this one too. Keep it up Sarah and Keren!!

I've seen some poorly fabricated box set packages (i.e., the rusting Bill Evans box) but this takes incompetent design to a new level.

Chris Rea delivered a 10 cd box set for around $100 quite recently. I am not comparing artistic merits here, just the bottom line. Perhaps there are plans to make this set available in a less expensive format but from what I have read, that appears unlikely.

Work on this set for 20 years, then release it at a time when no one can afford it. Anyone who plops $300 on this box is obviously not being hurt by the recession. Or, maybe they don't feel like eating for a month.For all the hype about how interactive this set is, it's mostly novelty. Are you really going to look at lyrics & photos over and over? No, your going to enjoy it once and then tuck it away. It's the music that bears repeated listening, and I don't know of anyone that has a Blu-Ray car stereo. So, it's not even portable in that way.Finally, the unreleased material, the cornerstone of this entire project, is sorely lacking. More than 50 percent of this is stuff any diehard fan already owns.

He spells out so simply the danger of evil, its destructive and intrusive nature, yet he shows how, on that planet (and unlike Earth), the battle was won by good in the beginning, keeping sin from gaining a foothold on that planet, and God's supremacy shone through. For Christian and non-Christian alike, this intellectual, philosophical, and moral novel gives you a new perspective on the \\"Good versus Evil\\" debate. I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone and everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A genuine pleasure","review":"Another excellent book. I know a lot of people find this book long winded and it is, but that is primarily because of the books focus on world views. Those long winded parts are essential to the collection as a whole and it is really interesting to see the way C S Lewis underscores the Christian philosophy throughout the series.Being Christian makes it a pleasure to read C S Lewis' contrast of the Christian worldview with the current popular worldviews prevalent today. It is also neat to speculate how humanity would have been but for the fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book completed my collection!!","review":"This item arrived quickly.

A sadly lacking quality of todays people. The over lap of values and moral setting are evident in all of the books. But done in such a way as to make you not want to put the book down.The mark of a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly Lewis's Best","review":"This, the second volume in Lewis's \\"Cosmic Trilogy\\", is very likely his best book. That is in part because he manages to deal with Big Questions in (especially for Lewis) a low-key way; he presents difficult problems and gives reasoned answers, all in the context of a suspenseful tale--suspenseful even with little true action, the tension being almost entirely moral.Best of all, Lewis's usual penchant for Very Very Obvious wrapups is here modulated to, in effect, a song of praise, so that it does not bemean the tale itself, nor leave the reader feeling she has been treated like a half-wit, the taste Lewis all too often leaves in the mouth.This is an unusual novel, an interesting one, a complex and deep one, and a rewarding one. (It contains a scene that is perhaps the best and most horrifying portrayal in all literature of true Evil seen face to face.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth reading","review":"C.S. Lewis was one of the most brilliant authors that I have ever heard of. The way that he was able to capture the idea of temptation fear, and endurance is beautiful and truly amazing! This book takes readers to a new planet with new problems. I enjoyed reading the struggle that Random had and how he overcame each step with true dignity. This story is a must read for anyone who enjoys an exciting space thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Out of the Silent Planet","review":"This second book of the Space Trilogy is even better than Out of the Silent Planet, the first book. As in the first book, this book contains types of biblical themes. The main theme here runs along the line of the account in Genesis about the temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden. Of course, though C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy books are based upon Bible story lines, remember that they are science fiction and not necessarily doctrinally sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kind of Book whose Close draws tears.","review":"Drawn into paradise, the reader is alive, excited, fearful. Perelandra is a beautiful image of flowing colors and time, it draws on the thoughtfulness and imagination of the reader to take these swirling colors and inexpressible fellings displayed in Lewis' writing and form the image of this green, gold, red and blue world where creation is fresh, and yet already on the verge of destruction..."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll either love it -- or just plain not \\"get it\\".","review":"I agree with other reviewers who suggest that, even if you're not into the allegorical aspect of the book, it is worth reading for the stunning descriptions of an alien planet. I've read the book several times; the most enjoyable was while on summer vacation in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Reading about the green seas and golden skies, the variegated floating islands, the bubble trees, etc., while surrounded by the wondrous beauty of our own world, was a profoundly enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"CS Lewis's fiction never disappoints me.","review":"There are so many great things about this book, as with all Lewis's books. I think everyone should read them all, and this one is great especially if you liked Out of the Silent Planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Sequel","review":"While I agree with the review that this book may not be true Science Fiction, but should be considered Fantasy, I still enjoyed this book. The idea of visiting a world before the introduction of sin into it fascinates me. The book is a great followup to \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", where we learn of the rebellion of Thulcandra, or Earth. Here we have the attempt of Satan to destroy the Edenic planet of Perelandra, and ruin another planet of God's creation. The debates between Weston, Ransom, and the Queen of Perelandra are thought provoking. A few passages even gave me the creeps - seeing the destructiveness of evil compared to the beauty of perfection. This book will not disappoint - unless you are looking for it to be a Hard Sci-Fi novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"indigestible prose","review":"After a certainly interesting visit to Malacandra (Mars), which sounds only slightly old fashioned, we have here another planetary visit by the indefatigble Dr. Ransom. The space craft is a coffin and after his resurrection on Venus he meets Eve and..... Now stop, this cant be right. \\"Eve?\\" Oh yes, Venus is a primordial planet, paradise in the essence. There is no mankind there and therefore they have not fallen, yet. So the world is still benevolent to its dwellers and any evil existing there is introduced by the travellers from Thulcandra (earth).I must say I waded through the book feeling increasingly uncomfortable. All that christian and fundamentalist imagery gave me toothache, in the toes. The tone of the book is somewhat edyfying and pietistic and, well.... schmaltzy, saccharine, cloyingly sweet, exalted, sentimental, get the drift?I did not enjoy the book, nor did I enjoy the next instalment, the \\"Hideous strength\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Redemption story","review":"This is the second of three series that is not-so-well-known but a must-read of the CS Lewis collection. As in the first of the three, CS Lewis tells the Christian redemption story again through the narrative of Ransom and the characters on the second planet he visits, Perelandra. Personally I found it little slow-moving, but the highlight was when the main character has an epiphany and states, \\"I am Ransom,\\" realizing he is the messiah figure sent to redeem this planet from the stain and spread of an evil force. After this the book quickly wraps things up leaving the reader with a most beautiful ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"My first thoughts on receiving this book was \\"wow, this is different\\". You've got to understand, I don't normally read this type of fiction, but I got this because I wanted to read more of Lewis's work. To say this is different from Narnia is a huge understatement, but it is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save up your money & buy the real deal!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS CD unless you happen to know any of the artists included. This is a horribly ill-timed and shoddily produced item. It took 25 years for the industry to produce a genuine tribute album to Santana. Why does it take less than ten years for P.O.D.? Please don't misunderstand, I LOVE Payable On Death. However, instead of producing a tribute album less than 5 years after most of the selections were originally released, why not wait until the band's popularity has begun to wane (die down), then assemble some more accomplished and capable artists?

I read that book about a decade ago, and I'm glad to say that it holds up upon re-reading.The other stories in \\"Passage of the Light\\" are also quite good albeit not as great. (Basically, this is an anthology of Malzberg's stories which are about SF and or SF writing.) If you only know Malzberg from such depressing and bewildering novels like \\"Beyond Apollo\\", then give this a try, since all of the stories are highly entertaining and funny and sometimes even brillant. The only downside of this collection is that it doesn't include \\"Galaxies\\", which is probably Malzberg's best novel after H.W.

They have everything, from hard rocking songs like \\"Different Than You\\" \\"Dose\\" and \\"Lay Your Money Down\\" to melodic slow songs like \\"Stray\\" and \\"Once in a Lifetime\\".

This was one of several truly memorable period pieces in that year or two (which included THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING and THE WIND AND THE LION). Great performances by Connery, Audrey Hepburn, Robert Shaw and Nicol Williamson. Also in a small part, Richard Harris as very mad Richard the Lionheart. A warm tale of love, aging with real chemistry between Connery and Hepburn. The end is a downer but it really had to be that way. No extras to speak of on this. One of Richard Lester's best films -- ranks with THREE & FOUR MUSKETEERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin & Marian","review":"This is an interesting interpretation of the old fable. It starts slow but picks up after Robin and Little John return to England. Sean Connery gives a fine performance as would be expected. Robert Shaw's interpretation as the Sheriff is wonderful. Not your ordinary Robin Hood story, but well worth the time to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Dreary Tripe, the only good thing about this movie is the cast.Historically inaccurate as far as armour goes, and Ray Charles could have see that the location is Spain and not England."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please....","review":"I love the story of Robin Hood. So much so, that I have watched just about every rendition of it. This one is aweful. Robin comes home an old man to his equally older Maid Marian.He apparently had very little concern for her seeing as he never bothered to come home to claim her. In my opinion, she should have married someone else, but instead she became a nun.Oh, that's romantic.And finally, at the end of the movie, she poisons them both. Hello...that is just depressing. If she can't have the rest of his life, then they might as well go out together. I will concede that this is fresh new take on a very old story, but come on.... where is the joy? All there was to take away from this movie was sadness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent, vulgar, and lustful tale!","review":"Most of the other reviews are terrible, i.e., this is really a useless love story.

How ever I am such a huge fan of Sean Connery and Audry Hepburn, that I could not turn it off. I kept wondering what would happen next. I was waiting for something worthy of these two actors to happen.Then It happened. (A sort of spoiler alert.) The final scene was the best love scene that I had ever saw in my whole life. It was highly emotional, as was I. I felt their pain, as I understood what the whole point of the movie was, love and sacrifice. It was a memorable ending to a movie that I will have to watch several times to be able to fully understand the depth of it.I highly recommend this movie to all adults, because we have all suffered love, loss, and aging therefore we can relate to these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star power, minus interesting story","review":"I think people watch this for the idea & the actors in it.

Only trouble is ...the Sheriff of Nottingham is out to get them because she's Lady Marian and he's Robin Hood! All this played out in tongue-in-cheek style by director Richard Lester. I saw this movie in 1976 for the first time, and just recently a few days ago. It is still one of the best romances ever made, and, probably, the Dream Cast ever: Robert Shaw, Nichol Williamson, Richard Harris, Denholm Elliott, Ian Holm as Lackland John and, as his young bride ...Victoria Abril in her first role!

I suggest only buying this book as a gag gift, because that's all it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I bought this book because I always was intrigued by Paris and her extravagant life style. But all I really learned about her from this book is that she's totally shallow, disrespectful, rude, and lives in a fantasy world with no clue about reality.A lot of her comments totally took me by surprise, and half the time I couldn't believe she was serious.I also thought the photo's might also include her house, rooms in the house, cars, closets, etc to show us how she lives. But all the photos were of her, and while those were good, I got incredibly SICK of seeing her on every page in the same skanky outfit and fake smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Bible","review":"Dear Paris,Thank you very much for writing such a wonderful book.

Well, it took me not even an hour to read because it is mainly a picture book. It was written in an elemantary school level (actually, I think a child could have written it better). And it just proves that she is as shallow as everyone thinks. I was quite annoyed at one particular thing she said \\"Make sure you have a good looking sibling\\". Like you can really choose your siblings! This girl is completely clueless as to what real life is... I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone... 0 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreal and sad","review":"First of all, there is no way I would pay one red cent for this trash.

Since it's pronounced like 'airess' and not 'hairess', the indefinite article would have to be 'an.'

Well, apart from the fact that MAC's Prrr lipglass is her favourite lipgloss.I bought this expecting an actual autobiography (she's still under 30, but there is a lot to talk about), but didn't find it. In all honesty, this book was published to publicise her reality show, music album, perfumes and movie \`The House Of Wax' (she actually gives fans a major spoiler by what she says).There are lots of nice pictures and the actual writing that is here is light and fun, so the more attentive fans will enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's exactly how u epect her to be","review":"I originally read this book to get some fashion ideas. As it has a lot of colourful pictures. the clothes she wears in it only suit her, and we all can't wear designer clothes. i was looking for more casual look. I couldn't find many other books with many pictures as this one. I will review this book for the writings and pictures.It was quite interesting how she explain how she gets men to do things for her. Like if she is at a hotel with a lot of luggage and she cant carry them all, she \\"try's to look helpless\\" she says it never fails. She said other things that can seem manipulative to others, but I would see it as childish. For this reason I can see why this wouldn't be interesting to some people.Pro's A lot of good colourful pictures like i said.Con's If you look for insight of depth to her character, u won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paris, I don't dislike you, but.....","review":"Paris Hilton is probably a nice person who is loved by her family and friends, who hasn't hurt anyone. But, as she mentioned in her book, she hasn't worked one day in her life. What can I possibly learn from a person like that? Paris says that in order to be an heiress, you need to be born into the right family. Not to be blunt, but DUH!!! The book is somewhat entertaining because you can't keep but not taking Paris seriously at all. So she wants to be a model - run to your rich daddy. A singer? A rich daddy. An actress? Thanks to the rich daddy. She has millions, yet she dedicates her life to partying and pampering herself instead of putting a part of that money into something useful like curing cancer or feeding hungry children.

I was given this book to check it out (don't pay, go to the library and check it out). While it was amusing, with some funny antidotes that a writer helped Paris out with, it was ultimately a boring book that didn't give any depth into who she hopes to become (she hasn't become anyone interesting yet. The book left a lot to be desire and made one feel more and more that she really was a spoiled party girl who had nothing better to do than to poke fun at reality (for 99.99% of the people in the world) and show off the fact that she's rich. While I think it's great that Paris has so much on the table as far as projects, anyone could with the money, fame and backing she has. My advice, skip the book; you will get a better sense of her if you watch her on one of those entertainment shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"So not hot!","review":"I got this book thinking it would be way more interesting than it actullay was. I am not a huge Paris fan, but think she is interesting. But her book was NOT! It was like a reading a trash or gossip magazine about someone. I could not finish the book. I was that bored with it.

I don't know if there was a ghostwriter or what, or if Paris actually wrote every word after she came back from all those parties not drunk, but this \\"autobiography\\" (seriously, what is this thing really??) does not come across as intelligent. I'm usually perceptive to sarcasm, but I wouldn't have noticed that if I hadn't read the amazon reviews.An intelligent person, much like a book worth reading, will usually have a point. Whatever this thing Paris has published in her name, unfortunately, lacks that crucial aspect.Two starts for the glossy pages. I definitely appreciate a hundred pictures of Paris that come along. I can't remember the last time I read a book with pictures in it, but hey - that's hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH???","review":"I don't like the book anymore than I like Paris. THose who love the book say that it's fun how Paris tells them where to go, what to do, ect like an heiress. Well, do we NEED to have someone tell us what to do? Do we need to act like someone else to be fabulous? Her life is not our life, any \\"tips\\" is kind of worthless, do you think? And why do we need to act a certain way if we agree every one of us is unique and beautiful? Would acting stupid and shallow and superficial be acceptable if you live a carefree life? It's like saying if you are born in war, it's ok for you to kill. It's not her fault she was born into privileges.

There are 2 types of persons who reside in high society; those that revel in their image (which, sorry, gets old), and those that lay low, are highly intelligent, and quite eccentric. Certain persons in history are quite interesting to read about, however, Paris is not one of them. She has a horrible sense of fashion, limited vocabulary, and is rediculously boring. Yet, her publiscist is someone who deserves \\"mad props.\\" The ability to market a moron and make bank off of her is remarkable. But, the purchasing of Hilton paraphernalia by the masses is simply more evidence of the dumbing down of Americans.

Can you guess why? If you said \\"for money\\" you're showing some signs of common sense. This is aimed at two types of people, girls ranging from 12-21 and sex hungry boys between the ages of 15-21. Being a 16 year old male I can say honestly, Paris Hilton is truly ugly. (I could name atleast 75 other women in the entertainment buisness hotter than her) She has zero class no intelligence or any positive physical appearence. Yet she has more money than you (whom ever is reading this now) or I. Welcome to America, eh? It is scary though, seeing young girls look up to a woman (i'm using the term loosely here no doubt) like Paris Hilton.

This is an \\"either you hate it or you love it\\" book. The vast majority rated on the ends of the spectrum.This bratty little girl is being fed by a sadly malnourished America. We'd be better to occupy ourselves with something that matters. Paris does not. She is the most useless, empty person I've seen in a long, long time. The only reason I'd pay attention to her life at all is to try and figure out where we've failed in instilling values in our citizens and what can be done to reduce or eliminate our celebrity worship. It's distressing, depressing, and pathetic.About the book, I agree with the reviewer who said, \\"The writing is very simplistic, the tone is overly shallow, and there seems to be more pictures than words.\\" It perfectly describes Paris Hilton herself: simplistic, overly shallow, more pictures than words.Waste of money, waste of a life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like slowing down to watch a car wreck","review":"You can't help yourself but after the fact you're wondering what the fascination actually was.

It's pretty pathetic that a seedy DIY porn movie has brought her all of this fame (ok, infamy) and she's milking it for all it's worth.

Paris gives advice on \\"how to be an heiress\\" all of which is completely ridiculous! I felt like she was poking fun at her fan base with suggestions of eating unhealthy and acting like a total imbecile. Every chance she gets she brags about her life and indirectly makes fun of people who haven't lived the way she has.My advice is wait to buy this poo at a yard sale for 50 cents and no more!

I was expecting \\"confessions\\" and there was not a single mention of the sex-tape scandal. This book was written on a 2nd grade level and took about 30 minutes to read. In the book, Paris constantly talks about \\"being yourself\\", \\"don't listen to anyone's advice\\" but the entire book is a step by step on how to be Paris Hilton. She tells you what you should do and exactly how you should do it, only because she does it that way. The most insulting line of the book is when she says \\"Only have billionaire friends\\" How shallow can a person be!? I guess if you were 9 years old and had millions of dollars at your disposal and wanted to be a Paris Hilton clone, then you might find this book useful. If not, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paris Hilton commits her own worst sin","review":"In case you - like me - believe in giving people the benefit of the doubt, and thus might be tempted to see if there actually is another, unseen Paris Hilton, as she purports to do in \\"Confessions of a Heiress,\\" let me save you some time.The only thing hidden behind Paris' glossy surface, is more surface.I was, however, pleased by the neat corrollation between the uselessness of the book (too large, pink and expensive to fit on most book buyers shelves or in their budgets; not big enough to be used as a doorstop or protective weapon) and the uselessness of Paris Hilton herself (basically also too large, pink and expensive - not to mention parasitical).In one of the many comic moments throughout, Paris notes that she thinks it is the worst sin in the world to be boring. Please note the headline of this article.Basically, never was a girl less like her namesake. And never was a single facial expression so devoutly used in press pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a professional career woman, wife, mother (and previously Paris Hilton fan), I was disappointed in this book in that it is written in a very 'child-like' fashion (or perhaps at age 30, I'm just too old for this kind of read?). Though I'm sure there are other 'early-twenties' out there, with good education and without the help of writers, that could do a much better job. Paris doesn't mention what kind of education she has and I think it shows through this book. I love fashion, I love entertainment, I love Hollywood, but I love intelligence and wit too."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless book from a worthless human being","review":"Paris Hilton is symbolic of everything wrong with society. Her celebrity is strictly circumstantial-a sex tape left in the worng place at the right time. I guess she benefited from that exposure, since she netted a deal for this piece of garbage. Her book is an example of how cynical and unimaginative the publishing world has become in the last fifteen years, churning out garbage from vapid celebrities instead of taking risks on talented new writers."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const C=d(B,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-b52828a0"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/43.md","filePath":"glossary/43.md"}'),R={name:"glossary/43.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(C)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
