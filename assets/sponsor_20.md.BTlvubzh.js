It has a nice non-obtrusive design that fits on any desk. I am particular fond of the adjustable light intensity. However, it arrived bend. It was not a transport problem, it rather appeared to be a production problem. The aluminum light-bulb holder was bend and sticking out of the casing.

This desk lamp looks nice.Negatives: Halogen is way too hot. Since this is a desk lamp, the light is close to the desk surface. So it heats up the desk surface and puts out heat making a person sitting at the desk a bit warm. Also was pricey. The stickers that came on the desk left marks when I removed them.

I found Mr. Nancy's book to be mildly amusing at best, and generally tedious. Why? The secret to a successful book in this genre, as other authors such as Rosa and Novello have found, is to write silly letters that make the recipients swallow them hook, line and sinker, and respond with a letter thats almost as funny as the author's. Nancy doesn't have this talent. Many letters go without reply, or are answered with curt form letters. This makes the joke fall flat. We can all write stupid letters, but if we can't catch the victim in our trap what's the use?

Inside are some of the silliest, stupidest, cleverly written letters to such establishments as famous hotels and casinos, department stores, transportation lines, countries and more. Ted Nancy manages to balance the insanity of his letters with just enough compliments and legitimate sounding phrases that the companies must be left in a quandry of wondering whether or not to take Mr. Nancy's requests seriously. Two Siamese twin brothers joined at the shoulders who wish to apply for work (minus the one needing a 3-week vacation)? A 2-foot tall dwarf requesting a hotel room with a special shower head that won't \\"blow him all over the tub\\" like most others do?This book had me chuckling aloud. It's a light, fast read.

It contains a collection of hilarious prank letters sent by a Ted L. Nancy (a probable pseudonym for Jerry Seinfeld). Matching the hilarity of the letters, however, are the equally ridiculous responses to them. At the moment, a television show is being developed by Seinfeld (again under the guise of Ted L. Nancy) which will display the marvelous wackiness of Mr. Nancy for a ... tube audience. It is difficult to imagine how this will transfer to the small screen. I recommend reading the Ted L. Nancy books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy Fever","review":"I loved this book! My teacher read my class this book. It's all about the author (Ned L Nancy) writing stupid letters to hotels, casinos, fancy places etc. He wrote to one hotel saying he was a midget who needed special room furniture.

Most of the letters written by Mr. Nancy are quite funny, but the responses he receives--usually deadly serious--are often even funnier.

Unfortunately it is missing some sort of spark that TLL had. I'm utterly amazed that this book even got published and expect it was largely due to the introduction by Jerry Seinfield (the author might be Seinfield himself, but I would expect it to be a better book if he wrote it.) Anyway, I read a little over half the book and stopped reading it because it seemed a little too repetitive to me. I also bought the sequel to this book and I'll probably thumb through it before donating it/giving it away.

She is a long haired 3 year old cat who sheds constantly and has ALOT of Dandruff. This mousse made her smell better, made her coat shiny, and seemed to get a handle on the dander. My cat does NOT like being wet at all so she has run off to hide while I've been working the mousse into her coat, which will cause the mousse to dry thickly. A quick brushing once she comes out of hiding has fixed that problem, though.

But it is Richter's piano that delights, with much spontaneity and interesting touches. Moreover, if you have not heard this version of the \\"Appassionata\\" sonata by Richter, you must look into this. It is one of the best performances available of this turbulent piece. A bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Richter","review":"This is the first recording of Beethoven's Piano Concerto #1 and the two sonatas I owned, and I have played them many times over the past 40 years. I would call attention to the slow movement of the Appassionata, which Richter plays with great warmth and tenderness. Many people know and value the Richter of jaw-dropping power and virtuosity, but he could also play slow passages with a kind of spiritual fervor that few pianists ever achieve. The Adagio of the Rachmaninov Concerto #2 would be one example, and the Andante of Sonata #23 on this recording is another. Those who collect Richter recordings know the wide range of recording quality of his extensive discography. This disc is certainly among the better recordings of Richter available and an essential item in any Richter collection. The sound is quite good for 1960."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIRST THE MONEY,THEN THE POWER","review":"SKIP-DOG DROPS THAT FLATLAND FUNK HEAVY ON THIS 1-THIS SH** KNOCKS HELLA CLEAN ALL THE WAY THRU-MAKE SURE & PEEP E.Z.S.D. \\"GAME 2 BE $OLD\\" ALSO"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the hype about?","review":"What is all the hype about?

I have quite a few albums of Vivaldi from the I Musici in the 60s to the more recent Fabio Biondi. Comparing to older recordings, I feel this one is more refreshing because the instruments sound more distinct to each other (not fusing together much) and the melodies are more energetic (an interpretation with less legato). Comparing to other more recent recordings, like those by Fabio Biondi, Giuliano Carmignola or Monica Huggett (I like them all), I feel this recording by Rachel Podger is just standing out in its own style. It is not as stormy as those of Fabio Biondi and Giuliano Carmignola but is also different from those of Monica Huggett. While I think other reviewers has done a better job in comparing this album to others, in my own opinion I would say it is a \\"sweeter\\" interpretation of Vivaldi which I haven't found anything similar yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcendent Vivaldi","review":"Glorious, exciting music with great dynamics and sensitivity. Rachel Podger's playing is inspiring in its expressiveness and beauty. It is sublime. Arte dei Suonatori and Ms. Podger play wonderfully together with remarkable precision. The faster movements are fiery, the slower ones touch the emotions with their flowing, delicate rhythms. This is the first recording I have of Ms. Podger. It certainly won't be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROD'S COMING OUT PARTY","review":"Some of the great harmonica players have passed on like Junior Wells and Little Walter. We are fortunate to have a legend that's living - Rod Piazza. Along with his band The Mighty Flyers, they deliver on \\"Tough And Tender\\" equalling their great live reputation in the studio. \\"The Flyers\\" general approach to the Blues is positive,fun and with a feeling and you get all that on this disc. The eleven songs are all original with the added spark coming from guitarist Rick Holmstrom, especially on \\"Quicksand\\". I also recommend searching out Piazza's session work on the Michelle Shocked song \\"Graffiti Limbo\\", you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Bothy Band Album","review":"I have to disagree with several other reviews of this album- this is, for me, the best example of the masterful Bothy Band in full flight. The live setting removes the frequent over-production of great Irish musicians & almost every set on this record is excellent (a feat that 'After Hours', for example, cannot claim)The combination of full-on jigs & reels (the opening 'Martin Wynne's' set being a good example), poignant & funny songs and pensive instrumentals (eg 'The Maids of Mitchelstown') is unmatched in any other Irish folk record which I have yet heard.Paddy Keenan's 'Bucks of Oranmore' is indeed a highlight, but the whole set offers more than the rest of the Bothy's back catalogue. This is one of THE irish masterpieces and is a perfect demonstration of exciting music which doesn't rely on production effects - just legendary musicians playing fine tunes. This is one of the best records made in any genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS BOOK","review":"IF you are looking for something different to do, the name says it all: Adventure will follow!

Unfortunately this 1980 edition is very pale in comparison to the other adaptations. The dialogues are not faithful to the book and the portrayal of the characters are quite off. Fortunately, this is just a library loan. I would hate to spend my money on this piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked it after watching it a couple of times","review":"I first saw this version on Netflix, and didn't quite like it at first. But after watching it a couple of times, because it had more dialogue between Darcy and Elizabeth, I became addicted to it. I had to buy the DVD, which is of much better quality than Netflix's. I must have watched it twenty times already! I really like Colin Firth's version, but I must say I like this one a little better. It is much better cast and this Elizabeth is more of what you picture her to be after reading the book. I love every single scene Elizabeth and Darcy appear together. David Rintoul is intriguing. I have never watched a dvd so many times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay. Definitely not my favorite.","review":"This version is \\"okay.\\" Just okay. It is from 1980 and the interior lighting is overly harsh and the exteriors are fine but come as a shock. Mr Darcy (David Rintoul) is icy, prideful, aloof -- so totally believable -- but Elizabeth Garvey as Elizabeth Bennet was somewhat lacking, as she did not show any charisma or anything that would make her a stand out to the likes of a Mr. Darcy. (I almost agree with Miss Bingley's opinions of this Elizabeth, \\"For my part, I confess I could never see any beauty in her....\\")Some of the dialogue was played with, having other characters say the words. Usually with adaptations, I don't mind this if it serves for flow or continuity, but it seemed to serve no purpose. I enjoy anything P&P; and was glad to see this version, but,it won't be one I watch over and over again. I'd rent it unless you are like me, and just have to have your own copy regardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"A&E was better","review":"I love Pride and Prejudice...both the book and movie, but I was less than impressed with this version....did not feel the romance, the flair. Garvie is beautiful..yes, but she is prettier than the Jane character...it is not to be so. hated Darcy character...no life, no soul...in trying to be proud, he killed the character.... very wooden. Just did not leave with a satisfied feeling at all. The A&E version though inconvenient being on 6 tapes...much better....of course I forgive the inconvenience because it was a mini-series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to sit through...","review":"Love the other versions so much I purchased this one with high hopes, dissapointed to say the least. No chemistry between the characters, looks low budget and found myself distracted by the awful lighting which casts unflattering shadows on everyones face. Darcy walks around scowling with a stick up his arse and is completely unlikeable, Elizabeth appears to be just reading her lines and Mr. Bennet is miserably mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the English versions of the classics","review":"I am such a fan of Pride and Prejudice! I adore the A&E version, which cannot be topped in my opinion, as well as the old black and white and the \\"Bollywood\\" version, Bride and Prejudice. I purchased this DVD and enjoyed it very much. I have several of the old classics done in the 80's by the British, and have yet to be dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of the one thing can be bad for you !","review":"I am not being critical of the Pride and Predjudice version that is under review I think it is a great video. But if you have seen one you have seen them all. I suppose I am a bit prejudice, but I first saw the version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and I fell in love with characters. i have seen that version alot of times and i just got used to the characters being the way they were, i saw the new version to see how much it had changed and if it would change my views on Pride and Prej as a story, but it didn't. I didn't warm to the characters as much cause i expected them to be the same. Anyway If I had not seen the Colin Firth Version first I would be as in love with the new version as I am with the old. i think it was great work and Elizabeth Garvie did a great job, along with the supporting actors and crew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride and Prejudice ~ Marsha Fitzalan","review":"Okay movie...poor film quality. Later remakes are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are they THINKING?!??!","review":"I rented this edition of P&P over the weekend to watch with a fellow Austen fanatic, and we both hated it. We have seen nearly every version of this classic tale, and this one is at the very bottom. The actors are horrible, especially Mr. Darcy, who has the same face and shows the exact same emotion throughout the whole movie until the very end. There is very little chemistry between him and Elizabeth, so it made it harder to believe the ending, unlike in other editions. It is extremely slow-moving, edited very poorly, and very little art or music direction. It was actually very painful to watch the whole 4 hours, and I would never recommend this version to anyone. The A&E/BBC version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth still reign supreme to me. Despite some problems, it is the most believable, most romantic, most beautifully done production of Pride and Prejudice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't put your faith in reviews","review":"After reading the review which claimed that this version was much more true to the book than the A&E version, I purchased it. I couldn't wait to get home to watch it!All I can say is, I don't know which book this film is so true to, but it is definitely not Pride and Prejudice! Many pivotal scenes and a lot of dialogue were either eliminated or altered so that they lacked the emotion and the humor that Jane Austen had so brilliantly crafted. The casting was appalling and the performances were wooden.Except for the fact that Elizabeth and Jane were a bit more conventionally pretty in this adaptation, the A & E version beats it hands down in every other category. When you watch that version, it's almost like reading the book.If you have to buy one film adaptation of the novel, buy the A&E version. Then you won't be disappointed as I was.But, as I said, don't put your faith in reviews! To each his own! To me, Colin Firth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS PRODUCTION SUCKS BIG TIME!!","review":"This production of Pride and Prejudice is almost totally unlike the novel it is a waste of time. Large portions of the dialogue do not appear in the book and Weldon(the writer) or the director make many stupid choices in regard to revealing characterization. As for the acting the two main leads are insipid--Rintoul is wooden and remains wooden showing no transformation and Garvie kept reminding me of Marie Osmond. See the Firth/Ehle production!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1980s version vs. 1995 version","review":"I just saw the 1980s bbc version after having seen the 1995 version and rereading the book, and it is almost not fair to compare the two movies. The screen writing and direction for the 1995 version is just so much more sophisticated. A very typical example: at the party at Sir Lucas' house toward the beginning of the novel, we have the scene where Elizabeth observes that Darcy is listening to her conversation and she teases him for it. In the 1980s version, Darcy is standing all the way across a rather large and crowded room from her,and she has to wind her way over to him and say something like, \\"did I not just express myself uncommonly well just now,\\" or something like that. It made no sense at all. I also agree with a previous reviewer who noted that Kitty looked to be about 40 in the 1980s version. I could go on and on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice (1980)","review":"This is excellent! Beautiful singing from Elizabeth. I love how Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Bingley are portrayed in the movie. It's a good movie to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prej with E. Garvie","review":"Follows book except for end. Wish this could be made into DVD. Have worn out tape format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money.","review":"Don't waste your money. Spend a few extra dollars and buy the more recent A&E version. This version looks as if it was made in someone's basement. The production values are nil and the acting is wooden. There are a few nice moments toward the end, and if there were no other version available, I might recommend it more. The A&E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, is superb. I especially recommend the DVD with a featurette on the making of Pride and Predjudice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I beg to differ with you, but...","review":"I found this adaptation lacking. I failed to see any real emotion portrayed by any of the characters, and especially that of Mr. Darcy. What a stone face!I enjoyed the A&E version of P&P so much that I watched it 3 times the first weekend I saw it. I have since considered it the most excellent movie of my acquaintance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst that I've seen!!!","review":"I have seen just about every single version that was ever made of this movie and this one is possibly the worst that I've seen. I could hardly sit and watch it! The version with Collin Firth was much more entertaining. If I had to pick a P&P movie, it would not be this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can not finish watching more than 20 minutes","review":"I am spoiled by the A&E version. It has Jane Austin's spirit. A true enjoy. As a matter of fact, that is my all time favorite. This BBC one is unspeakable. Just read the reviews that has one star, I agree with all of them. I even think that 20 minutes is a waste of my time. If you never read the book, you would never think this movie is intended to be a romance, never a comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butt numbingly dull","review":"I had to write a book report on P&P.; Since I'm lazy, I thought watching the movie would made my work easier. Wow, did I learn my lesson! This is the most boring movie I have ever seen and surprisingly made by BBC which I always think it's the best in making period movies.Who are those actors? Most of them, especially young ones, seems like have no acting training at all. They all say their line in a fast, monotone voice. And what's with this Darcy guy? Even when he is speaking, not an inch of his face moves. And did he have neck injury? When he turns his head, he always turns his whole upper body.Besides the aweful acting, the directing, editing and everything else are no good either. In the end, it's a total waste of 4 hours and totally put me off the idea of reading the book and writing the report. I did on Oliver Twist instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfull","review":"Hi Just wanted to warn every one of this awful adaption of Pride and prejudice...First, You just have to look at the front to see that Jane AND lizzy are both really ugly the nicest you could call them would be not even tolerable. 1 Lizzy has eyes that are sticking out she way to thin her hairs awful there is nothing about her in the least that isa appealing. jane is a little better but not by much. 2 both are bad actresses. The movie has almost no music the quality is quite bad, the sister, mother, and father are bad actors themselves. Mr. darcy and Mr Bingly are both wow you feel bad for them. there pretty bad themselves so I recommend this to any one who has tons of time on there hands feels like laphing at awful acting, and watching the most boring dull non- intersting movie ever then enjoy but others wise don't wast your money or pay attention to the four stars this movie has been given. I love Pride and prejudice so its nothing against the movie itself... just this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great casting!","review":"This is an older BBC production that ran on Great Performances in the 70's. It is well cast, and has a number of scenes and lines which come to mind whenever I think of the novel. It runs over 5 hours, but even my hubby can sit through it in one long Sunday afternoon! The time flies (blink, blink!). It is close to the novel, but not as close as the BBC version with Colin Firth, which has become my favorite (after watching both versions dozens of times). I still watch this version for those lines and looks which are only captured here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm a big fan of Pride and Prejudice, so I have watched the BBC series based on the novel. I liked this version of it, just as much as I loved 1995 version. They're both excellent and I'm glad to own them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite version","review":"I find this version so engaging and so true to Jane Austen's novel that I look forward to watching it over and over again.This version does not just focus on the main characters but reveals the relationships amongst all characters to make you appreciate the life people lead in that era.Overall, this is my favorite version."},{"rating":"2","title":"pride and prejudice","review":"The movie is the greatest for all the details- The remakes after this all vary on the theme and leave stuff out.This DVD is a 2 sider and i do not like that- I was not expecting that - seems cheaply done for such a nice classic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest","review":"This is the most faithful production of the Jane Austen classic.Great acting throughout. Contrary to some reviewers comments, the acting was not stiff, but accurate to the culture of the time. The A&E; version was nice, but too \\"watered down\\" or \\"dumbed down\\". Moreover, in the A&E; version, much of Austen's best dialogue was changed, IMHO, if you cant improve it, leave it alone. This version is the standard to judge the other versions of Pride and Prejudice."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than A&E version!","review":"This version is truest to the novel, and better than A&E version, I'm really enjoy it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"i can't believe anyone liked this version of jane austen's wonderful novel. the character's were flat and wooden. it was painful to watch. i fast forwarded through much of it, because it was just too boring and didn't fit with my thoughts of the original story. for example, after jane returns from london and is talking about missing bingley, she is laughing - it was ridiculous to me. lizzy didn't have any sparkle or wit, she was dull and one dimensional. others have commented about how superior this darcy was to other versions, and i cannot understand this. colin firth and matthew macfadyen (he was the one of the only good parts of that version) did a much better job as darcy. i couldn't stand this one. yuck. save yourself the bother and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in Energy and humor","review":"One of the things I love about Pride and Prejudice is the wit/humor in it -- this version seems to suck the life and humor right out of the story. Propriety is one thing, but some of Austen's characters are intentionally over the the top, and so I think it's fitting that in other versions the characters express that energy and sense of humor. Here they are just dry, and while the script doesn't eliminate all of the humor, it's delivered so poorly as to fall completely flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Elizabeth & Darcy than 96, not such a good production","review":"This production is not so lavish as the 96 version, and does not have quite the same drive. However Elizabeth Garvie as Lizzie, and David Rintoul as Darcy are far better than their 1996 counterparts (Colin Firth attempting to look moody looks like Colin Firth looking constipated). Incidentally both this version and the '96 version were BBC versions, the latter with production money contributed by A&E."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought this unintentionally","review":"I bought this in high school after reading (and LOVING) the novel and watching watching clips from what my teacher called \\"the BBC miniseries.\\" I didn't realize that the version we saw was actually the A&E/BBC version, and bought this one by accident. What a disappointment! Yes, as many people have pointed out, it is very accurate. However, when I read the book, I felt like the characters were alive, but did not feel that at all when I watched this version. Needless to say, it hasn't come out of its case since that afternoon of disappointed viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the characters but...","review":"The thing that really annoyed me was that the dialogues had been switched around. For example, in the book, if Elizabeth says something to Jane, in this adaptation she says it instead to Wickham. Other than that, it was better than the 1996 adaptation because the characters seemed to fit in more. Elizabeth is not supposed to be more beautiful than Jane and surely she is not. David Rintoul was excellent, he is supposed to be slightly wooden so I am not sure I agree with all the criqitues of his performance. The two miscasts in my opinion were Wickham (I thought he was supposed be very handsome in looks, much more so than Darcy) and Kitty (why on earth was she so old?)Overall, if you are a Jane Austen fan, you must see both adaptations but if you only want a romantic love story, get the A&E; version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best One of the Crowd! And I've Seen Them All!!","review":"This was the most true to the book and the best of all P & P's I've seen thus far. Even better than the A&E version that lasted for 5 hours! This Mr. Darcy was...well...sexier! I could gaze into his eyes for hours! And Elizabeth Garvie's portrayal of Eliza Bennet far exceeded my expectations. A clear winner. There's no need in making another!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darcy may be stiff, but that's just one way to play him","review":"This is still, by far, my favorite of the three main versions of P & P available. I like the acting in this one, for the most part, much better. As said by another reviewer, Elizabeth Garvie makes the perfect Eliza Bennett. One thing about E. Garvie though, it was lamented in another review that she had not done much other acting. In fact I can name at least one other thing that I have seen her in: an episode of Fairy Tale Theater called \\"The 12 Dancing Princesses\\", a series that played on PBS about 10 years ago. I don't know if it is still available, but worth checking out.With regards to the other acting, I liked the portrayal of Mrs. Bennett much better, and also the portrayal of Mr. Collins. The one doesn't need to seem so disagreeable, and the other, not so slimy (comparing to A&E version)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Faithfully Jane Austen. I like how Mr and Mrs Bennet are played. I also like Darcy - he really does look like he is grieving for his parents and in love at the same time. I love the letter scene and the scenes at Pemberley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt like a Stage Play","review":"I couldn't even get through this one. I have the 1995 BBC and the 2007 big screen and enjoyed both for their differences, but this one was unbearable. Save your money and get the '95 production. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"true to novel, but slack in imagination and emotional spark","review":"I rented this mini some time ago, and although it was true to the text, it has some obvious flaws. The pacing is entirely off. There are some downplayed moments that should be poignant, which instead just feel like dead air. Most importantly, the performances leave much to be desired, as the two main characters, Lizzy and Darcy, are barely brought to life by the respective actors. I have to admit, my favorite parts of the adaptation were those with Darcy, not because of his character, but because the actor had the uncanny ability to barely open his mouth when brusquely and dully dead-panning his lines. His mouth remains a thin harsh line throughout the entre film, keep watch, you'll see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was never so disappointed in my life. I have seen 3 versions of Pride and Prejudice and this by far is the absolute ruin of them all. The A&E production is awesome,Colin and Jennifer are the best. I couldn't stand to watch this BBC one more than once, it was like drudging through MUD! It's like a small town amateur theater play. Very mundane and hard for me to get into after the one with Colin and Jennifer. No fluency and so choppy and direct, it's like the characters weren't even real............. totally disgusted with this one, and a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Adaptation!","review":"I must agree with the reviewers that find the BBC version truer to the book. The actors better protrayed their characters in line with the manners of that time. The pacing of the story is slow and the setting is not as visually striking as the A&E; version. The costumes are very good though.The A&E; version is a visual feast. The story is paced well and the set and costumes are beautiful. However, there is a more modern spin on the story. The actors did a wonderful job but their portrayal of their characters was not quite in line with society of that period. There was not enough reserve of emotions that was displayed in the book.I can't say that I liked one version over the other. If you want a truer version of the book, you will be most impressed with the BBC version. If you want a feast for the eyes, the A&E; version would be your preference. I own both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Austen fans: take note","review":"Agreeing with someone else's review, this is the version for Austen fans. It is the truest to the book, and the overall feeling of Austen's time. After seeing this, the A&E version seems more like lurid soap opera, rather than the subtle satire Austen in fact wrote. I have enjoyed all three film versions, but this one retains my heart. While Austen might have laughed at the notion that Darcy would one day appear in a wet shirt contest, I strongly doubt she ever would have thought to include it."},{"rating":"1","title":"froze and skipped","review":"this movie froze and skipped most of the way through making it unwatchable. I returned it and got a full refund. The movie look like it was copied"},{"rating":"1","title":"Favourite version but it was only a tease!","review":"I purchased this adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel and was extremely disappointed that I only received 3 episodes in the package. It is supposed to come as a 2 disc set but only received one writable disc and it was of a poor quality. So although I recommend this version as the best adaptation of the novel, I am sorely disappointed with the actual product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing version","review":"It really wasn't that great... long, slow moving, low budget production.

It is not. My mistake, but I should have known what I would get for the price. It's barely OK. Spend some extra cash and get the full version starring Colin Firth. He is the best Darcy ever and that version is nearly a carbon copy of the book. Very well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it zero stars.","review":"I couldn't even watch this all the way through. I tried. I really tried. But it is HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE!The acting is bad. The writing is bad - even the authentic Jane Austen dialogue comes across poorly here! None of the characters come across they way Austen described them in the book. (I don't understand the reviews calling this the most authentic version; I strongly disagree!)and don't even get me started on Mr. Darcy. huh???? When I read reviews stating that this version was better than Colin Firth, I thought that I was in for a huge treat. But this Darcy is DREADFUL. I do not know what people who like this version were watching. I love period pieces, especially Jane Austen and MOST especially P&P.; But I cannot even finish this. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I'm turning into quite the collector of British classics that have been made into movies. I love the PRIDE & PREJUDICE story and own the A&E; version with Ehle and Firth. So I thought I'd like another version of the story in my collection, and the reviews encouraged me to buy.But this is so dull, it becomes a struggle to sit through. It is like watching a stage play with exaggerated character reactions. Little seems to flow naturally. The dancing was stiff. The scenery was confined to a few look-alike parlors.The emotion in the A&E; version carried me away, while this one left me yawning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't put your faith in reviews!","review":"I bought this video based on the reviews which claimed it was more faithful to the book than the A&E version. Well, I don't know what book they were comparing it to, but it was definitely not Pride and Prejudice!I found that this version cut a whole lot more scenes and dialogue from the book than the A&E version. The subtle Jane Austen wit and humor that is inherent in the book is completely missing from this version. The casting is disappointing and the performances are wooden.The characters of Elizabeth and Jane are perhaps a little more conventionally pretty than in the A&E version, but that's all that can be said in favor of this adaptation.If you want to see the book come to life on the screen, rent or buy the A&E version. Skip this one.But, as I said, don't put your faith in reviews, not even mine. To each his own. To me, Colin Firth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch","review":"Horrible, horrible adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Elizabeth was portrayed as dull and completely one dimensional. She merely recited her lines. Didn't they read the book before embarking on this fiasco? She is supposed to be clever, witty, and loving all at the same time. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are completely unlikable. As for Mr. Darcy, well a wooden puppet would have done just as well. There was no feeling or emotion, and forget about chemistry between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. The way they portrayed their characters made impossible to believe that they would ever be attracted to each other. The scene of Elizabeth dancing with Mr. Darcy was just an exercise in script reciting. I couldn't get past the second episode. Any other version I have seen is much better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"My favorite is the 1939 version. The A&E version is great. I liked the Kera Knightly version. This one is flat and boring. Everyone is shrill. And Elizabeth has zero appeal. Just awful. Oh, and the sets stink. They spent the equivalent of my child's weekly allowance on this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not available?! Are you kidding?","review":"Why is the fourth episode not available? There is no point having any of the episodes if you don't have them all. It's bad enough that only Episodes 1, 3, and 5 are available for prime but Episode 2 costs $2. I can understand having the first episode free and requiring a purchase for the others, but at least make it possible to view the whole series. Badly done, Amazon. Badly done, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy","review":"OMG. This is so painful to watch. Lousy acting, lots of quotes from the book from wrong people, people seem to gossip, Mr. Bennett is just so crabby; everyone is obnoxious.

I have seen many versions of P&P; the very first being the 1940 Greer Garson, Lawrence Olivier version which even though it is heavily edited and incorrectly costumed is so superior to this version I am surprised people here speak so highly of this version. Such dreadful acting; artificial, overdone and unnatural. Mrs. Bennett is NOTHING like the character in the novel at all, nor is Mr. Bennett.UGH maybe if I had seen this before all others but I really think if I had I might never have even read the book at all. The only reason I give even two stars is the costuming is quite good.

They fit securely in the sockets. Other banana cables fit snugly also, and the jacks have the standard spacing so you can use a dual banana plug with this meter if necessary.- Voltage readings over the range I tested (0-20V) agreed with an Agilent 34401A bench meter.- I got temperature readings two or three degrees Celsius lower from this meter than I did when using the Mastech probe with a Keithley 2000 bench meter's temperature mode.

It talks about how these kids (Elijiah and Elisha)find their strength in God when really they find their strength in manipulating people.

The way the book went the ending was way to short and could have been drawn out a little longer. From this you should be able see that i am not the best person to take advice on this book from since i ussually read total science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better...","review":"Hangman's Curse starts when several jocks at Baker High start going completely nuts. The Veritas project -- Nate, Sarah, Elijah, and Elisha Springfield -- are called in to investigate and find the Truth.The book reads like a thriller, with a plot that keeps twisting and an ending that will shock any reader, but the characters aren't up to standard. The Springfields are all disappointingly two-dimensional, and take every opportunity to show the reader that Christ and Truth go hand-in-hand. The obvious suspects are witches, Satanists, or goths (take your pick; Peretti seems to think the three are synonomous), and the end moral of the story -- that today's high schools are full of cruel kids, evil athiest teachers, and troubled kids resorting to witchcraft because the schools lack belief in Christ -- is a little over the top.The book's interesting, and it'll keep your attention long enough to finish. Read it if you must, but I'm not sure it's worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"When I was a very young girl I read some of the late-Victorian \\"Elsie Dinsmore\\" series (I was stuck at a great-aunt's house in the rain). This book comes as close as anything I've read since in combining surgary piety with an unlikely plot and turgid writing. I can only suppose that all those teachers who were raving about it were teaching in private Christian schools.The premise is nonsense but it might have been fun if treated light-heartedly. Children enjoy fantasy and improbable plots and if they are well-written such stories can teach important lessons about life. As it is, this book doesn't teach \\"values\\" -- it heavy-handedly and explicitly preaches the type of fundemental Christianity that may not be acceptable to many readers.I'm all in favor of clean writing and good values but I consider that books in which adult characters exclaim \\"Praise Jesus\\" should come with some kind of advisory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs warning stickers","review":"This book needs warning stickers that it is promoting the Christian agenda. It presents anti-evolutionary statements as if they were facts (to the further detriment of America's standing in education in the world) and pretends that God'll make everything ok. This is one of the very few books that I'm throwing away as opposed to donating or selling to a used book store."},{"rating":"2","title":"AESOME,AWESOME,AWESOME!!!

At first,it was hard to imagine what the characters looked like. In the movie the characters didn't look like I would have imagined them,but I totally agree with what they look like on the movie(but I imagined Elijah alot cuter.)Also the movie is ALOT different than the book. Even though i'm almost 12,Jake Richardson is TOTALLY HOT in the movie! Sorry, I'm talking more about the movie than the book. I still can't decide if the movie is better, or the book. Anyway, I completely recommend this book, and I highly recommend the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hangman review","review":"The book was about a four star book until the end which was not very good at all. The book was good overall even with the bad end.in the begging of the book the investigators were doing a drug bust when they got called to the school to take on the case of figuring out what happened. AT first the thing the cops knew that the victims had in common was that they were all starters on the varsity football team planning to win the championship. The most recent was Jim Blotz (he was the star quarterback). Everyone thinks that Ian Snyder is the one responsible but they can not prove it. Peretti even makes people believe that Ian is responsible with the title of this book. i wont say more cause it will give away the ending but it is one of the better books i have read.So overall I liked it and I suggest that if you are thinking about reading this novel read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peretti hangmans curse","review":"This is a great book!

The twins (and their parents) are secret agents who were assigned to a high school by the president of the United States to investigate the cause of the mysterious illness of three athletes. Everyone in school thinks the sick students were victims of Abel Frye - a ghost who hung himself at the school in the 1930s. It is the twins' job to find out the real culprit.This book was pretty scary so I tried not to read it too late at night but I am going to buy book #2 of this series very soon and look forward to reading it.

This novel is high on suspense (bordering on horror in some spots), and full of truth. His characters were a little weak, and the story progressed a little too convienently, but it is a series, so he has time to flesh out the Springfields and their Veritas project.

Most bands (my own included) contented themselves to just dig up a bunch of obscure cover songs and maybe only wrack their brains enough to write one or two half way decent originals. Here the Workers present a dozen or so great originals with only one carefully picked cover song \\"Hey Little Bird\\". Highlights include \\"Go Now\\", \\"Already Gone\\", \\"Tears\\", and \\"Mystery Girl\\". These are songs I can still hum even if I haven't listened to this disc in ages.

Jessica was hilarious when she admitted to Tom that he was a good kisser. I just hope she doesn't develop a crush on him in future books. I doubt she will though. Liz and Tom better stay together from now on, now that they have reunited. That was the best part of the whole book when he recognized the locket and he went onto the plane.

For the price, though, I'm happy with it and I'm finally done with paper filters. I also found out that it is able to brew slightly stronger coffee than the steel mesh gold tone One All/Medelco brand. I think because the size of the holes in this filter is smaller than the steel mesh so water doesn't pass through as quickly... but a paper filter still works much better.

Regardless, using this filter with a Bunn worked poorly. The water came out faster than the filter could handle it, the basket overflowed, a good deal of the coffee washed out and clogged the entry hole on the top of the pot ... which caused the coffee to run all over the counter and floor.

Of course people have gotten bigger in the 20th century, due primarily to better nutrition, health care, excercise, etc., but we are hardly the 40 foot giants Wells' talks about. I found it easy to associate Wells' fears with the fears many of today's people have over cloaning. When does science go too far? This story is fairly short and you won't want to put it down.

Wells gets the distinction of illustrating the dilemma. Here is a humorous look at the stereotypical scientists and the hot-headed public confronted with change. Wells pokes fun at academics, politics, and the theoretical vs. practical aspects of science.This book is way better than one may suspect. Sure, it's very British, but some of the absurd scenes--such as giant rats attacking a carriage--are wonderfully described. There was an awful movie a while back that bastardized this fine novel and should be avoided, but do yourself a favor and pick up this novel.

You basically have to connect to 2 external audio outputs to hear the main mix and the monitor mix. I believe a simple headphone jack on the mixer itself would have been a great idea. Of course, since this is a MIDI controller, and not an actual mixer, I don't know the ramifications and troubles with doing that. Those are the 2 reasons I was not able to give this 5 stars.

I was hoping for more of a \\"forward stance here, moving into a cat stance, high block, high block, middle punch...\\" etc.I was a little disappointed in this one. Also, the only kata is the first form and a little of Tekki. The beginning history of kata was kind of interesting, but past that, this wasn't exactly what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bimillennial Church","review":"Paul and those who had been converted by Jesus and his apostles knew they would not leave the world alive.

The pool has a large covered gazebo so that the kids never have to put suntan lotion on, and rain does not get into the pool and change the pH. Intex support does not help and the local three pool stores has no idea how to help other than \\"keep adding chemicals\\".

Unfortunately the pump did not run my pool cleaner very well since the inlet was now in a skimmer rather than the side wall. The pump could not produce a siphon. I ended up replacing the pump filter and chlorine generator Simpl-Chlor works ok but has to run eight hours as apposed to three with the INTEX brand. Cells only last two seasons.

In the long run alot cheaper than the chemicals. I HIGHLY recomend this product to anyone that does not want to spend alot of time keeping pool water clean and balanced.

Even after using the chlorine, shock, etc. we still could not keep the pool clean. I applaud those who have written the reviews for this pump because it truly works wonderful and our pool is sparkling clean every day. We spent about $30 on salt but that's it for the year. Even after rains, there is no need to shock the water. The water has a little salty taste to it but that's it. The kids do not mind it all. It's an amazing pump and well worth the money.

I did listen to it all - but I was suck in a vechile with no other options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Old Koko","review":"I agree with some of the previous comments - there are really no surprises in Moose County, but knowing what you're going to read has a certain charm all its own. I still enjoy this series, and the characters are still pretty wonderful. Yes, this mystery was pretty straightforward, and you know who did it and why. I think I would have liked a little more exposure to the murderer's character - he seemed to be a shadowy figure at best in this one. But Koko still delights, and Polly and Qwill are still wonderful. For all cat fanciers, this series is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How The Cat Who Series Seems","review":"Ive been reading the cat who books for a couple of months and if you like cats and mystery then this is really good for you.They are so hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best !","review":"I was disappointed as an avid fan. This was not either mysterious nor was there any news in the community. I read these not merely for the cats but for the events of the community. I was disappointed in both story and content."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was one book I couldn't put down","review":"I loved the book it was really good. I couldn't put it down.

Always can't wait for the next book to see what Koko and Yum Yum are up to. Have two of my own and think they are smart things to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"an exhausting dissapointment","review":"Through the year, we look forward to the cat who books. My wife reads them aloud by the fire. As this one went on and on with no mystery, no humor, no irony and none of the subtle sexiness of the past books, we sadly realized that either Ms. Braun would never again be able to give us the pleasure we looked forward to or someone else is writing these books. Topics were brought up and dropped i.e. Amanda Goodwinter's race to be Mayor and humor, so loved in the past, is sadly nonexistant. What we had were thick pages, wide margins, and a drone of day to day activities. The villans and town characters had no character and we were depressed instead of elated. Come on, if the publisher is doing this, they should get a better ghost writer. If it's Ms. Braun, it's sadly time to retire. Of course, we will buy the next one and my wife will read it aloud by the fire. We will always have hope that it will be as joyous as the great Cat Who Books we remembered."},{"rating":"1","title":"really quite sad...","review":"I have been reading this series forever, and I think it's about time for the publisher to admit that Ms. Braun is no longer writing the series, or if she is still writing (which is highly doubtful considering the time frame of the entire series from book one) she is being aided by a ghostwriter. There is no possible way that this book could have been written by the same author who was writing the series five years ago. Very boring and cluttered with detail. Those of us who have come to know \\"Qwill\\" and his two cats feel a great loss within the pages of this book- their personality, humor, and warmth. The cats became merely grunting pets in this book- and that's the \\"clue\\" that Ms. Braun has passed on her pen. How truly sad :("},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat Who Disappointed a Reader","review":"I have read every Cat Who book written by this author, and I feel this is the weakest book in the series! All of the other books had twists and turns in the plot, and all of the other books had the ability to keep you guessing until the very end. Unfortunately, in this book, the author chooses to dwell on character development and background material. As a fan of the series, I did not need this additional information - I already love Qwill, Koko and Yum Yum, without knowing the ins and outs of Scottish games or mechanical banks! I hope that the next book in the series sees a return to a real mystery, and not just a walk down memory lane! If you have enjoyed the other books in this series, you will find this entry acceptable, but it will probably not be one of your favorites. If you have never read one of the Cat Who books, or if you have read only a few, I would recommend reading the earlier books before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Again!","review":"I have read all of the Cat Who... books, but the last few have continued to go downhill. This last addition was the worst. I did not care about the person who was killed or the people involved in the crime. And if you don't care about the mystery, what is the point? I was happy to learn more about Qwill's background--but to burn the rest of the letters! These books seemed to have gone bad ever since Polly has become a permanent fixture. (Is it my imagination or does the author's picture remind you of what Polly would look like?) The author seems to spend more time on what people are eating and wearing than the mystery. And does someone Qwill's type really come home and put on a \\"jumpsuit\\"? He did that at least two times. This will be the last time I spend money on this series. But I may go back and read the first several--now those were mysteries with real characters and mysteries Koko would want to solve!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book?","review":"I have always enjoyed KoKo and YumYum and I think Qwill is the greatest. This book however just did not flow. I kept asking myself who wrote this book. It felt like the outline was Ms. Braun, but the writer did not have her smooth whimisical flow. The story was good as always, the dialogue was just too choppy and inconsistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat Who Should Retire","review":"I used to love the CAT WHO. But recently these books are long and boring. Qwill does absolutely nothing to solve the mystery-- the murderer's friend tells him the whole story. Qwill still does nothing. And in the obligatory confrontation with the murderer, Koko doesn't save the day (as he should). The characters are all done wrong as well. Qwill seems to find the commonfolk amusing. I refuse to believe LJB is still writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not possibly be written by Ms. Braun","review":"Most of my enjoyment of this delightful series has come from the literary skills of Lillian Jackson Braun. Her nuances of humor, her turn of a phrase, strong character development, and the life threads that run through the series cause me to always come back for more.This book is clearly NOT written in the same style. It is inoffensive, very light, but tends to the cloying, tea-table mystery style. Not my favorite, and I hesitate to buy any more \\"stories\\" from this \\"series.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"again!No, I am fully aware that she is no Agatha Christie. And that's not the point of why I read her books.I just love the characters (but not Polly! Can't she just disappear?) and of course the antics of Yum Yum and Koko. But as of late, everything that's endearing about the series have been lacking. Is Braun actually indisposed and a greedy relative is ghost writing just to rake in the bucks?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat Who... books have lost the sparkle","review":"I have read the entire series of Cat Who books several times, and I find it difficult to believe this one was even written by Braun. The characters are wooden, the familiar details of Qwilleran's day-to-day life are missing, and the plot is nearly non-existent. What happened to all our favorite characters? I will not be pre-ordering the next book in the series. This one was too disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ghost must be real","review":"I've enjoyed the Cat Who series; I've read them all. Thank you, Ms. Braun, for so many fine stories. But this book could not have been written by you. At one point Qwill refers to a woman as a \\"chick\\" -- I just cannot belive that he would act this way unless a ghostwriter was at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long drive to nowhere","review":"I have read and enjoyed almost every one of the cat who books and this was, by far, the least enjoyable. Reading this book was like going on a Sunday drive; passing nice scenery, and returning home. There was no excitement, no suspense, no amusement, just a pleasant excursion with little to show at the end.We gathered a glimpse into Qwill's past, but even that was cut short with no hope of ever hearing the end. The murdered suspect was just a cardboard cutout with some innuendos, but nothing substantial. The same with the murderers. There was absolutely no character development at all.Even the cats played a minor role.This book was like reading someone's journal of daily activities over a period of a week or so. Interesting, but certainly not worth the price of admission.Wait until this one comes out in paperback, or avoid it altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have paid attention to the bad reviews","review":"I, too, have always been an avid \\"Cat Who ... \\" fan. However, this book fell well below expectations. Ms. Braun should seriously consider retiring Qwill, Koko, and Yum-Yum if, as it seems, she has run out of stories. Unfortunately, I think the rumors of ghostwriters must be true, because I don't want to believe that Ms. Braun has lost her touch. However, this will be my last \\"Cat Who.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Koko Has It All Figured Out","review":"In this installment of, \\"The Cat Who..\\" series, Koko kept doing strange things. He wrapped the kitchen in paper towels. Then he stole some pennies from an antique bank that Qwill bought.What does it all mean?I liked this book. I love reading about Pickax. It is a great place to escape."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cat Who is Disappointing","review":"In this book we do learn a little history on Qwill's life, but not enough to stimulate interest. Also, I find that very little action on the part of Koko and Yum Yum is disappointing. I have always looked forward to that interaction between man and animal fasinating. Nice book, but lasks pizzaze!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad...","review":"I have been reading this series forever, and I think it's about time for the publisher to admit that Ms. Braun is no longer writing the series, or if she is still writing (which is highly unlikely considering the time frame of the entire series) she is being aided by a ghostwriter.

Those of us who have come to know \\"Qwill\\" and his two cats feel a great loss within the pages of this book- their personality, humor, and warmth. To me, the \\"clue\\" that Braun is no longer involved in the series was when, in THE CAT WHO ROBBED A BANK, the cats stopped being Qwilleran's respected roomates and became instead his demanding pets. How truly sad :("},{"rating":"1","title":"how did this book get any stars?","review":"Boring, no mystery, no solving; not much happens except the day to day (boring) details of life at Qwill's. A complete waste of time and money. And most of the reviews I read seem to agree so why did anyone give this boring book any stars? (well, I guess we can't submit without a star so it would get at least one)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another welcome addition to the Cat Who... collection.","review":"I want to commend the author for another wonderful book. I am 15 years old, and these are the only books that I will read over and over. As to the subject of the repetition of the facts on Qwill and the cats, I think that this is necessary for the author to do, because if this is the first book that a person reads out of this series, they will obviously be inquisitive about thet details of the characters. I understand that this wasn't as thought provoking as the other 21 Cat Who... books I own, but sometimes it is better to establish things in one book that will carry over to other stories. (i.e.-Amanda Goodwinter vs. Gregory Blythe) Congratulations, Lilian Jackson Braun, and kudos to the kitties for another job well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Further Slippage","review":"Mrs. Braun's work has been deteriorating throughout her last three works, but this must be the bottom of the slippage! One has to read a rehash of characters in excruciating detail for almost one hundred pages before anything of interest happens in the story line. Having read all the \\"Cat Who\\" books, the early ones were interesting, with sufficient, not overdone character description, and implausable plots that were an amusing read--all the elements lacking in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cat who earned two stars","review":"What a page turner! I kept turning the pages looking for a story! This book is so bland that Mrs. Braun put an overabundance of exclamation points to suggest action where none existed! It seems as if her heart was not in this installment. There was too much \\"filler fluff\\" and not enough theories about the murder and who might have \\"dunnit.\\" Even Qwill was lazy this time figuring the murder will be solved at the end of the book so why bother with it? I hope this was just a bad outing for Mrs. Braun and not a steady decline."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author who robbed her fans","review":"I'm an eternal L.J. Braun/Cat Who fan, but was very disappointed in this latest effort. The details behind the restoration of the the new Inn, Qwill's parental heritage, the Scottish games, the mechanical banks and auction were all fun, interesting and vintage Braun. However, considering that this book is categorized as a \\"murder mystery\\", the murder was boring, and there really wasn't much mystery! Already being a fan, I still enjoyed parts of the book, but if you're not yet a fan, don't start with this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting better","review":"The series itself it slopeing downhill in its old age. I believe that there is a ghostwriter (or more than one?), but this book is MUCH better than the two before it. There are still some remarks that anyone who is reading the series from the beginning will say \\"What?!?!\\" to, like Qwill \\"always wearing a tie to dinner with Polly\\", but it reads like the earlier well written Cat Who books. Either Lillian is back, or they got a better ghostwriter for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a good mystery.","review":"This book catches us up with the good community of Pickax, where Qwilleran lives an an apple barn. The New PickaxHotel has been renovated and Amanda Goodwinter is running for mayor challenging the incumbent Gregory Blythe. We learn a lot about Qwill's family which helps us understand his life before the cats. Although the Cats play a reduced role, the book is just as good as any others in this better than average series."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading title","review":"This collection would be better titled \\"The Anti-Christmas Book.\\" It was obviously compiled by Ebenezer Scrooge BEFORE the Spirits visited!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Mrs. Steinman wrote an enthralling expos�� about the ethics of war and the ethics of the anti war movement of the 1960's changed her life. Her book is great from beginning to end, a great combination of plot and war history. I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Weaving","review":"What a great gift Louise has given us. The stories and questions that arise from the souvenirs she encounters are woven as delicately and powerfully as the silk and stationary on which the stories first appear. Permission is granted to take artifacts from one's life and examine them with tenderness, obsessiveness, and curiosity. I feel so much more compassion toward soldiers. Tim O'Brien and Michael Herr surely opened me up to their powerful confusion and passion from their Vietnam War experiences in The Things They Carry and Dispatches. But this was different. This story exposes the longing a soldier has to be with his loved ones, and the harshness of how this loving man is affected for the rest of his life. The Souvenir cuts to the core of what we lose in war from one generation to the next, and what is gained from a close examination of that loss. A beautiful tear jerker and a deep analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Souvenir - A Compelling Look Back at WWII","review":"Louise Steinman's book, \\"The Souvenir\\", is dead on in her search for her father's war time past. Like many of her generation, she learned too late of his hopes, desires and fears through discovered letters to her mother, written on the battlefields of the Philippine Islands. After discovering the letters, Mrs. Steinman tells a compelling story of her search to discover his past, the youth he lost forever in war, and the family of the Japanese soldier whose good luck talisman (\\"The Souvenir\\") he happened to come into possession of. This is a must read for anyone whose father served in the \\"good war\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"With all the rave reviews..","review":"You see all the reviews having 5 stars out of 5 stars--I couldn't bring myself to agree.

I love the typography and layout. The quotes at the head of each chapter lead us on a challenging \\"Owl Prowl\\". What a privilege it would be to go in person and check out Stripey and the other owls with Max. But next best thing is pulling his book off of the shelf and reading it again and again. Each new read brings a new insight into the lives of great horned owls and the life of humans who care about them. The book is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read for nature fans","review":"I really love this book.

I find the book, albeit the topic, quite boring. I agree with another review that the author tone is lectural and there are many fillers in each chapter. I haven't found anything new in this book either.

This kind of simple psychological presentation of such physiologically complex creatures is very inaccurate and degrading. What is ironic is that for the rest of the book she is trying to convince the reader that for each woman there is a different procedure to (similar to fingerprint) give her an orgasm.As a reader I am disappointed that she is over generalizing such beautiful creatures with stereotypes out of a paperback romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common Lou","review":"The text did not live up to the title.

Where most writers have been happy to repeat the standard conventions about the PRB and their paintings, Barringer wants to tell us that issues seep into their brilliantly-lit compositions. Alas for the reader, in avoiding the pictorial complexity and brilliance of PRB painting, Barringer devotes far too much space to fashionable academic jargon on such subjects as colonialism, gender, class and so on. Instead of ceaseless curiosity in the face of these remarkable paintings, Barringer provides us with a series of judgemental cliches about modernity and ideology. Why, the reader is left to ponder, is he embarrassed by PRB paintings? Why the fixation with 'theory'?

I use the microfiber cloth all the time to clean my lens and LCD disply, it has recently started to show some wear though. However it is because it gets stuck in the velcro that holds the dividers on. The dividers themselves are adjustable and removable. I found this very useful when I still owned a point and shoot. The rain guard is exaclty that, a rain guard. It rests in a velcro pouch that opens on the outside of the bag on the bottom. It covers the front and top of the bag, not the bottom or back though. I have also found it useful to protect my bag from the sun. The rain guard is lighter colored than the bag so in turn, keeps it cooler. Overall an excellent bag.

For a relatively compact (easy to carry)bag it securely protects the camera and has lots of room for extras. The extra wide padded strap is an important consideration if you travel and carry your camera with you. It also converts to a belt held case. I like the fact that there is dual access to the camera. The front flap lifts to open, or the back edge of the case unzips so you can easily see what is inside and also quickly reach for the camera.

There are separate pockets for accessories - to store memory card, lens cleanting kit etc.The bag itself is well padded, and nicely manufactures. I feel comfortable the camera will be well protected.

Ms. Austin has instead sacrificed some commercial success for a bit of dignity, which is present throughout her excellent body of work over the past couple of decades. This album, which features the pedestian but classy production talent of Paul Brown, doesn't seem as special as other Patti Austin albums I've heard, but, to be fair, she'd have to produce a absolute masterpiece to overshadow her past albums (particurally \\"That Secret Place,\\" a personal favorite.) Overall, I'd suggest you buy this album, but she's definately made better recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Different, But Still Good","review":"As a long-time Patti Austin fan, I will probably never dislike anything she records. She is a TRUE diva with God-given talent. \\"On the Way to Love\\" seems to be a new Patti crossing into other styles of musical tastes. It's not \\"Havana Candy,\\" \\"Body Language\\" or \\"Love is Gonna Getcha,\\" but it does include tracks that bring out the rich, sultry voice that we all have come to love and look forward to from Patti Austin.I like the CD, and I'm glad that I bought it.

I admire Patti for creating such unique music with well written lyrics. Sadly this CD is her weakest album to date. It sounds as boring and lifeless as most of the forgettable elevator jazz and R&B. The songs are so similar that I can barely tell if I,m listening to the same song over and over again. I don't like rating albums by talented divas like Ms. Austin this unfavorably but this album was a major miss. Better luck next time Patti. Hopefully it will have a much different sound and more variety. There were a couple of goods songs on here which is why I give this an extra star.

I use them on my gutters and I use them to hang two strands of lights per clip. The first year I encountered the same problem that others have with the first few clips. They would not stay on and it was completely frustrating. It wasn't until a few times of doing this that I learned how to put these on. Each clip must be pulled down straight (you are standing directly underneath the clip) until it clicks onto the gutter. Then it will not come off. They are a little problematic taking them off though, when pushing up they tend to pop off the gutter and sometimes they pop right into the gutter. There is a trick to taking them off too which is to provide force mostly out while pushing slightly up.With these clips I can string 150' of lights in 20-30 minutes all from the ground. They work great if you know the trick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I am not sure what problems the other reviewers had, but this is a great product!

Since the workmanship of the pole is suspect this isn't the easiest process. Also, when I was reaching the pinnacle of my roof and using some force, the product broke. I was able to complete the rest with an extension ladder borrowed from a neighbor.Bottom line, it is a nice idea but poorly executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!!","review":"I have used this product for 7 years and love it. I have never had a problem using them and will continue to do so. Mine are starting to get a little brittle and I am having to replace them, but for $6.00 it's well worth not having to climb on my roof and install lights. I do not have gutters and just attach them to my shingles, so maybe they work work better that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for gutters, not so good for shingles on high pitched roofs","review":"I read several reviews and got the swing of using these clips on the gutters. But when transitioned from my gutters to my shingles, I started to have trouble. The lower shingles weren't too hard. But I have a high pitched roof that requires a ladder AND the extension pole. When you get to the highest part of the roof, inserting the clips under the shingles is almost impossible. So, my review of this product is that it depends on your house. If you have mostly gutters or low shingles, this product works well. If you have a tall, high pitched roof like mine, I think you will give up after your lights fall off in your face a few times. My neighbors enjoyed watching my failed attempts."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Admirable Attempt at the History of an Enigma","review":"Henry Ford was an enigma, and he remains one despite more than 850 pages of text in this fine history of the man and his company. Douglas Brinkley offers a court history of breadth and scope, relying on the rarely accessible Ford Motor Company archives to flesh out stories of the birth of the assembly line, the Model T, union busting in the 1930s, anti-Semitism, and successes with the Mustang, LTD, and Taurus.Throughout \\"Wheels for the World\\" Henry Ford is the force that creates and holds a corporate empire together. Brinkley devotes the first two-thirds of the book to him, exploring the paradoxes in his psyche: a self-taught engineer who created a corporate empire, a high minded entrepreneur in the mold of Robert Owen at one time and an anti-union zealot at another, and a man who used his wealth and power to spout ill-informed and sometimes demagogic ideas. Brinkley's final assessment is well-reasoned and enigmatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I found no mention of Harry Ferguson, the Ford-Ferguson tractor(perhaps the most significant agricultural tractor of the Twentieth Century), or subsequent tractor work by Ford.

There are a total of six cantatas in the oratorio, for the first three days of Christmas, New Year's Day, the Sunday after New Year's Day, and the Feast of the Epiphany. This disk contains only the first three. The disk case plainly reads \\"Weihnachtsoratorium, Kantaten 1-3,\\" so I must assume the incorrect listing came from someone in Amazon who didn't know enough about the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a \\"romance\\" novel","review":"Painful reading! I was extremely disappointed with this book. It left me feeling utterly empty, rather than empowered as a fellow single woman. I was sad to see such a brilliant character reduced to mush by very superficial contact with a man. Hermoine's friends were also brilliant characters however were described in superficial, tedious detail. The main theme that women are raised with the \\"Cinderella complex\\" was beaten over the head too many times and even though acknowledged by the main character a thousand times alone and with her friends, she let herself become victim with no real explaination"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I, too, find it hard to believe that the author of The Women's Room wrote this junk. There was never any plausible reason why the main character was even attracted to George. He was a jerk. Everytime he talked, he barked. His posture was dejected. There was nothing attractive about him in the slightest. How can you get involved in someone's love fantasies when you think it's unbelievable that she would have a second thought about this guy? The narrator's recollections of her early life were much more interesting and believable. An easy read, but annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same person wrote \\"Women's Room\\"?","review":"I can't believe the same author who wrote one of my favorite books, \\"The Women's Room\\", wrote this junk.I never believed the narrator was that nuts about George...it seemed to me she was more awestruck with her lesbian friends who had forged solid relationships than she was with the fickle George.My wonderful spouse brought this book home to me, after finding in in the bargin bin. $3.98 was too much to pay for this sloppy, unbelieveable story from such a first-rate author. Let's hope she pulls herself together for her next effort, or it, too, will end up in the \\"Library Fire Sale\\" stack at my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"So now women, too, claim men and women can't be friends?","review":"I loved the previous novels by Ms. French, but this one leaves me feeling a bit sick.Apparently the theme of her latest is that it is unacceptable for a man to enjoy speaking to a woman, have lunch with her when he is in town, but NOT intend to have a sexual relationship with her -- though he's given no indication he wants such a relationship, and reacts negatively to all physical advances by the woman.It's hard enough for us single-by-choice women to find friends (male or female) without books like this scaring off the few men who still think friendship is possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best","review":"I came very close to putting this book down without finishing it several times. How many times can you read, \\"I can't tell you that,\\" \\"I'd rather not say,\\" and \\"I'm not answering that\\" before you get fed up?The storyline was a mish-mosh of totally implausible events. The events weren't even exciting or thrilling...they were boring, and made you skim through a good majority of the book. I fell asleep three times reading it.Disappointing for such a talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Phillip Margolin is one of my favorite authors, but when I read this book I was sad to think he has lost his desire to write a fantastic story. This one was so slow and predictable. It was an effort to finish it. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"borderline 4 stars","review":"This review pertains to the audio book reading of Lost Lake which I enjoyed pretty well. I think the audio book reading can help make a borderline satisfying novel like this one a little better than if I had read it with my eyes. Still if a writer hasn't written a good story, no audio or video can make it better IMO.For me, the strained but loyal relationship between the soldier Carl Rice and General Wingate's daughter Vanessa Kohler, kept the suspense humming along. Would they survive? Would they unravel the evil General Wingate who was running for President? Would anyone ever believe the general was a murderer like his daughter believed?I felt this novel could've ended in a more interesting way, but I'll give it a 4 star recommendation for storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"Phillip Margolin is another one of those authors that never seems to disappoint me. He's written another intriguing novel with action and suspense you've come to expect. The characters, the plot, and the action, will keep you highly entertained. A solid and well rounded thriller written for those who like to escape.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Political conspiracy or delusional insanity","review":"I seem to find myself in political stories lately. This story is about murder, conspiracy, cover up and trying to figure out who is telling the true story. A daughter accuses her father of leading a secret unit of men from Vietnam and after in killing people. She was a witness to one killing and the killer appeared to be her boyfriend from high school. Her story is too far fetched to be true and her father has her committed to a sanitarium for a year.This is an interesting read. I enjoyed it from the first few pages and although I thought I figured out how it would end, I couldn't wait to finish once I got close to the end. There were still a few twists that I was not expecting.Not a top rated book perhaps, but a book worthy of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.....just awful.","review":"This is a good writer who can do better...and has done. What is going on at HarperCollins?Bad character development, weird plot twists, really poor research....unbelievable action. This is like a bodice ripper for lawyer/thriller novels. Is Catherine Coulter a virus that is spreading....like Aids and Mad Cow? Whatever, Margolin has it. A good author gone bad.I would almost think this was a novel written by interns or grad students....but it is not that good. Grad students and interns have higher standards, and a higher sense of shame.Maybe Margolin has Mad Cow, and his intellect and skills are declining.....so let's hope his audience at Costco also is so afflicted.Embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I had read other titles by this author that were good, so I was tremendously disappointed with this tale. There was absolutely no mystery or surprise, no plot twists, absolutely nothing to hold my attention. As another reviewer did, I ended up mostly skimming the book. (I kept thinking something interesting would happen - my mistake.) I read dozens of books of this genre every year. This is one of the worst I've suffered through in quite a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, implausible, anachronistic . . .","review":"This is a dreadful book. It has an improbable plot, thin characterizations, and sloppy writing. For an example of sloppy writing, his 1970 teenagers describe things as \\"awesome.\\" Dude, awesome wasn't in teen parlance in the 70s.Give it a pass, and don't believe that Margolin compares in any way to Harlan Coben or Michael Connelly. He is not in their league."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Phillip Margolin is one of my favorite authors of popular fiction. His feel for the region in which he lives makes his stories particularly interesting. I enjoy him as I do James Hall who lives in southern Florida.

MAYBE THE ATTORNEY MARGOLIN IS GETTING BACK AT THOSE WHO HAVE LOST MOST OF THEIR FAITH IN ATTORNEYS.......OR MAYBE HE SHOULD JUST QUIT WRITING.

His principal character never would have been able to escape liability for his actions even though they were ordered by his military superior. It's one important difference between our military and Hitler's military."},{"rating":"2","title":"Margolin makes it work","review":"In this mystery thriller, a young Portland attorney finds herself in the middle of a strange case after a man she had recently befriended violently attacks two men at her son's little league game. He claims he is part of a super-secret government group called the Unit. As events unfold, it turns out Morelli, is really Carl Rice, and he is wanted in connection with a number of brutal murders. But he tells a different tale, of killings that were part of his work with the unit. Margolin's book turns out to be a fun interweaving of plot lines, and he even makes what could be a rather tired plot about a supersecret government agency work, as doubt is cast right up to the end about who is really telling the truth, and whether Morelli is really a secret government agent or just a delusional and psychopathic killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read that keeps you turning the pages","review":"This was my first book to read by Margolin, and I wasn't disappointed. The storyline was interesting, the characters were realistic, and the suspense/mystery kept me turning the pages to find out the truth about what happened at Lost Lake. My only complaint is that I wanted to see the bad guys go down in the end and get their just desserts; even though justice is served, Margolin sort of glosses over this part as an afterthought, focusing instead on how the good guys will be moving on with their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow","review":"I am a huge fan of Margolin. Had been expecting this book with great anticipation.Our two main characters - Morelli and Vanessa, both have deep, dark secrets that will eventually link them together. But first, we have to do through endless pages of boring interactions (the relationship with Morelli and the kid was so sugary) that it makes you want to skip to the end of the book.Margolin's usual flow in the storyline practically does not exist in this book. His transition from main characters (who are not even in the same geographical area for the longest time) is ackward and extremely drawn out.Although I did like the Morelli character, the Vanessa one left me cold.Margolin fills his novel up with too much detail and fluff and when he actually gets to the nitty-gritty, its boring.This one is a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution Editors: We're Actually Paying Attention","review":"I've enjoyed Margolin's work in the past, but this novel is long on verbiage and short on real impact. Also, there is a critical error in the text when Kirkpatrick refers to the recently escaped Morelli character as Rice (the true name of the as-yet-unknown mystery man). This threw me for a loop while I was trying to figure out who knew what about whom. (Has anyone else caught this error?) Sorry, Mr. Margolin, but I think this work was a trite amalgam of plenty of better-paced action thrillers. And, I never really felt sympathetic for the cardboard Ami. In short, \\"Lost Lake\\" was just long-winded, overly contrived caca doody. More like \\"Lost Time\\" for me. Now, excuse me while I get back to Ellroy, Bruen, McBain, Mankell, Rankin, Reginald Hill, and the others who can really craft a fine tale and fill it with characters who feel alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Philip Margolin has made a very nice living out of writing tightly-plotted thrillers featuring well-drawn characters. Unfortunately, he has accomplished neither with this book. The plot is implausible, the characters are almost uniformly irritating, and the pace of the storytelling is confusing--all building to an anticipated crescendo, except that there is no crescendo. The book ends with a whimper without even tying up all of the loose ends.It's surprising that a book this underwhelming could come from an author as accomplished and respected as Margolin. I suspect he had a publisher's deadline to meet, and the result looks rushed, undeveloped, and sophomoric--especially compared to his earlier work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent condition","review":"Product was shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition. Would not hesitate to purchase items again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Lake","review":"Margolin doesn't let you down in this escapade...we have a little bit of everything all neatly brought together to a climactic finish which leaves you satisfied with the plot and characters. The two protagonists, Vanessa Kohler and Carl Rice want Ami Vergano, a lawyer, to represent Carl who worked for General Wingate, now running for president, but who, in a prior life, ran an illegal murder unit. Carl was his key gun, so to speak, and now needs defending in the court of law.Phil provides us with a good thriller, with plenty of twists and turns and a plot reeking with subterfuge, betrayal and all the components that make a good writing. We have a great plot and extremely well developed characters all packaged in an interesting and compelling story. This is Margolin at his best as the scene continuously shifts and changes and one is continuously left questioning how this story will end.E.J. Walden, author of \\"Operation Snow Owl\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit over the top, but what the heck, it's fun","review":"This novel is fuelled by the paranoia of the two main characters which eventually infects the other characters in time to bring about a satisfying conclusion. Vanessa Koehler who writes alien abduction and giant rat stories for a weekly tabloid has witnessed a murder by her former boy friend which she's sure has been arranged by her father. She hires a lady lawyer who is renting out a room to the murderer to defend him in spite of the lady's inexperience in criminal law. What follows is a thriller which ends up in a courtroom and while it defies credibility, it is loads of fun with enjoyably quirky characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do You Believe an Ex-Mental Patient Tabloid Reporter","review":"What would happen when a writer for a tabloid newspaper reporter writes a series of fantastic, or perhaps fanatical, stories about a vast secret conspiracy headed by a popular presidential candidate.First the stories would be totally ignored by the mainstream media. And then when it was discovered that the writer had been hospitalized in a mental institution by her father, the presidential candidate, any possible credulence would disappear.But of course, what if it's true.Then again, what if it's not.If it exists, the conspiracy has killed before. Dangerous people to annoy.Like any good mystery, the tale twists and turns until it gets to the somewhat surprising ending.

The characters are not well crafted. The book starts off quite tense and promises a lot, but then loses itself in cluelessly plotted scenes, in which the protagonist doesnt receive any information (like the reader). At the end, there awaits some constructed solution, which is not presented in any thriller-like fassion. The quasi-love story, which accompanies the story, bored the hell out of me.Please, dear Mrs. French! Do not feel pressurized by your publisher! Take your time!

It is very difficult for writers to collaborate on a seamless novel, particularly when it comes to crafting a suspenseful plot. The story never generates any real thrills, and the story is only mildly interesting.It was refreshing to read a story set in London; it was a nice change from the typical American mysteries I usually read.

I listen to some 'commercial' stuff, and this blows it all away. I seriously doubt chronic MTV watchers would enjoy this in the least.

A large part of the attraction is the variety of styles on here, ranging from moderized cabaret crooning, pop tunes and bellydancing to the manic cymbalom instrumentals of Toni Iordache. Even if one style doesn't appeal to you, something else surely will -- to me, some of these songs sound a bit tedious, and an equal number are almost irresistibly perky and fun.

Missing human contact, communication, and love. It shows (from the producer/director's) ideas what happens to a human without that contact. It's an amazing message on how important it is to be loved and have that contact. It's entire musical score is created by Angels & Airwaves.

Many of these metals will react with the very hot alkaline water in a dishwasher; the reason they discolor is that some of the metal has been dissolved.

In other words, the paintings and the pictures of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI told everything of what had happened. It is just like reading a comic book without text.

Expensive upkeep","review":"I have replaced the filter on this multiple times this winter---mold growth is a problem!!!! Filters definitely do not last a season. Good humidifier if willing to deal with this problem and spend the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"No complaints!","review":"I've had this humidifier for over a month now and have been very happy with it. As others have stated before, the curved top of the water containers, make it a little tricky to fill since they won't stand on their own - but the fill hole is about 4\\" wide, so I just stick my hand in the tank and hold it vertical while filling.No problem with moldy smell yet, but I've got to be approaching the point of needing a new filter.I wouldn't say this is noisy for the job it does - at low setting it is very quiet, although you will hear the occasional \\"glurp\\" as water enters the humidifier. At high it is loud (it is a fan, after all), but it kicks out some serious moisture. It will run through 11-gallons in as many hours. I usually turn it to medium or high during the day when I'm out and switch to low for the evening.All in all I would recommend it to anyone who has a large area to humidify."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is it called \\"Quiet\\"Care???","review":"Honeywell should not be allowed to call this product by any name with the word \\"quiet\\" in it. The fan motor itself is quiet, but when the fan turns on every cheap plastic part rattles against every adjacent cheap plastic part and believe me it is load and annoying. I have tried gluing/taping the pieces to eliminate the rattling. The tape works for awhile, but after a day or two the vibrations loosen the tape's hold enough that the rattling comes back. Not a quality product.As a humidifier it is decent, but not good. Also, note that \\"11 gallon\\" capacity does not mean that the reservoir holds 11 gallons, so it needs frequent refilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed by idiots. WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN!","review":"Admittedly, the humidifying part of this device works fine. On the other hand \\"QuietCare\\" is a joke, I've flown single-engine airplanes that were not a loud as this thing. The worst part of it is an engineering problem. It is impossible to stand the tanks upright to fill them. They have to be hand-supported like drunken sailors during the filling up process. What kind of idiot designs something like that only to make it look \\"good\\"? Shame on Honewell's engineering and design department!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than happy","review":"I did have to tighten up the screws that hold the fan assy together to get rid of an annoying buzzing noise. Other than that I like it. I think the complaints about having to hold the tanks while filling because the top is not flat are blown out of proportion.EditAfter using this for a couple of seasons now, my appreciation has diminished considerably due to the ever present buzzing noise this thing generates. It still does the job, but the noise issue has become a major irritation. I have worked on the thing to try to remove or reduce the noise to no avail. This will be it's last season with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely could be better","review":"D. Wardlow is absolutely right. I couldn't have said it better.Very difficult to turn water tank after filling and not having a flat surface to stand on....besides unless you have a utility water basin, you would probably have to use the bath tub to fill the large tank. Then it's really difficult.I tested about how long before needing a filling and it was completely bone dry in 2 nights (16 hrs).

The only thing I don't like about it is that the water containers do not have a flat surface on the top so when you turn them over to fill them you have to hold on to them or they will fall over. My last humidifier that this one replaced had the handles recessed so that it would sit upright to fill. That is what these containers need or maybe handles on the outside but with the handles sticking up they won't set flat.

She didn't describe him as this wonderful, larger-than-life megastar that only had time for his work. It was humbling to know his origins, his heartaches, his humiliations growing up as a Jewish person when that wasn't the most popular thing to be. The story of his overcoming all the obstacles was heartening and enlightening, and I finally saw him as just a person, a father, husband, friend, son, brother; not just the Pa I dreamed of having on Little House, and not necessarily as angelic as Jonathan on Highway to Heaven.

It does have some great matches, as there was a move away from only elimination matches to singles matches.The Bret Hart matches in 1995 against Nash, and his 1996 match against Austin are bright spots, but I lost interest by the 1994 Series and could barely manage to get through it. Midget clowns...Yokozuna at gradually more massive sizes...they were brutal.Even for a diehard WWF fan, it was hard to focus on all of the mid-1990s Survivor Series. The storylines seem to be at their most cartoonish. Be sure that this is an anthology that you'll watch more than once. I found it challenging to get through this anthology, let alone watching the all the events again. I would equate the events to WrestleManias 8, 9, and 11. It represents a transitional period for the WWF, and I know that the challenges stemming from the steroid scandals among others strained the available talent pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst leg","review":"This is the most cartoony, worst survivor series in the history of wwe, and i really hope they print the rest, because this is just sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELMORE JAMES FOREVER !!!!!","review":"Being a HUGE fan of Elmore James, I think this CHARLEY box is one of his best collections: great packaging and excellent booklet, along with an outstanding selection of cuts! Certainly one can compare earlier versions against latter ones, yet Elmore pours his HEART AND SOUL into each track on this cd! Also, there are no repetitious alternates or takes which crowd, for the sake of completeness, some other boxes like ACE's \\"The Classic Early Recordings 1951-1956,\\" which is outstanding in its own right.

I didn't expect a top end piece for the price but my daughter absolutely loves this violin and was dying to go back to school after the winter break to show it off!

Luckily after hearing the entire cd i was not dissapointed. There are some break beat tunes and very fast beats which make this album one of the better techno albums i've ever heard. The first track somethin really bad is extremely good if you're a fan of pop and lock. The rest of tracks are really good as well but not many lyrical sayings which is dissapointing since i happen to like his voice. Hopefully they will do a follow up album which hopefully won't be as hard to attain as this. Overall i recommend this to people who like fast break beat music and aren't afraid of waiting a little bit for this very good cd.

One reviewer didn't like the rubber hose. I don't mind that sort of thing. The size is fine. The quality is fine. The object is inexpensive and highly utilitarian.The reason I am replacing this one, though, is that the nuts holding the bar come loose periodically, requiring you to tighten them. Forget to tighten them and one will inevitably pop off in the middle of a vigorous pounding, leaving the puck to disintegrate into flying grounds (happened twice). The manufacturer should add lock-nuts to the construction.Also, the black base is painted fiberboard. Eh. Solid hardwood would be nice, but would cost more. Solid rubber might be better.

As another reviewer stated, the nuts on the bar tend to fall off, so we used thread sealant. But then with continued use the fiberboard fell apart at the joints. So we glued the joints. But then the fiberboard soaked up any moisture on the counter and finally swelled to a mushy rounded mass. So we coated it in duck tape. Eventually, the plumber's tubing split, exposing the bar, and we tossed it. We ordered a different knock box, but it turned out to be backordered and the supplier sent us another of these RSVP knock boxes as a substitute. Within a few months, the new box fell apart at the joints, and the fiberboard started to swell. I just tossed the wooden frame and put rubber cabinet bumpers as feet on the metal insert. Hopefully, the plumber's pipe will continue to hold."},{"rating":"1","title":"If tempted, avoid the dishwasher","review":"the nuts on the outside do need to be tightened occasionally which is annoying, because i don't remember until it falls off.

The author tries to cover very diverse applications of JNI such as serial I/O, legacy C structure mapping issues, and running a Java program from an NT Service. Strategies such as how to design better JNI code are covered (although not as much as I would have liked). For example, keeping Java and C++ objects in sync via a mirrored approach. As with other technologies, JNI seems easy to those who feel comfortable with C++ UNTIL they have to write a non-trivial JNI application with a deadline. Although, this book does not answer all your questions, such as performance issues, and indepth user allocated memory management concerns, it does give you enough detail and coverage to make its stance as a solid JNI Handbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very concise, practical book about JNI","review":"This book covers a lot of ground in less than 500 pages.

It does have some useful information, however you would think a book dedicated to one topic would go into depth discussing it's aspects, but it does not. The examples are weak, and he doesn't even cover any AWT creation. Read the spec, then you can write your own Essential Java."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This was a very bad buy.

He is a funny writer but that doesn't make up for the lack of clarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sun's tutorial online is much better","review":"If there is one good thing about this book it is that nearly all examples are written in C++, which the online tutorial at Sun's website doesn't do. But those examples are presented stiltedly and not in what I would consider a clear format.There are a couple of special topics which I consider valuable for people interested in those topics: such as making an NT service and serial programming. I however, was not interested in those topics.Gordon thinks he's witty, too (quoting great writers in the chapter headings). He's at best corny and at worst contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Java programmers - catered to C/C++","review":"If you are a Java programmer trying to learn how to connect to C/C++ libraries this book is definitely not for you. You will have to buy another book to supplement this one just learn C/C++ so you can run the examples which by the way do not work. I was disgusted with this book as I had read a few positive reviews, but as I read them closer they were all authored by C/C++ programmers. Again this book is not a Java programmers book and should be cast aside by such."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing!","review":"Based on the review I read, this protective case looked like the best pick. Boy was I wrong! First of all, I did not think the product description was clear about what the product includes. It includes: A black visor (that is also a stand and cover) and a stick on screen protector. The screen protector makes the image look grainy; the only good thing is that you can take it off easily and still reaply it later (unless you get dust on the side that goes against the screen, this is impossible to get off). The black visor screws into the two small holes on the top of your psp (you can twist them on with your fingers). It is wobbly when it is on, due to the many functions it is supposed to do. It does not clip at all when it is down, and so is not at all a secure screen protector. I can see how it would be useful as a sun visor, but there are many other products that are better made that also have this use."},{"rating":"2","title":"getting better","review":"I found last year's collection, and its debut, to be a bit dull.

The pan is big and feels great but clean up is not like your typical nonstick because food sticks. I made steel cut oats using organic coconut oil and they still stuck to the pan each and every time I made them. We made other non meat foods and they stuck as well.

However the two we ordered not only don't work, they leak water all over - I believe from where the impeller fits on the tanks - so a huge mess and except for the water that they leak and the wet towels from cleaning up the messes, it seemed to add very little humidity to the air - useless. If it was possible to give the product a negative star review, I would have done so. After communicating with the seller several times, they refuse to do anything - just replied, talked to their department that handles these things and since they had no complaints and no comments from the manufacturer regarding and recalls, they will do nothing.

The ability to add water with out opening the unit is nice. The biggest problem I have is the sheer lack of humidity this unit produces. Even after nearly 70 hrs of running I notice very little improvement. I did remove the plastic oval with the fins and that helped somewhat. I have been using these things since I was a kid in the winter months and never had this issue with other impeller humidifiers. If it finally breaks in as they do sometimes I will change my review.

COF is by no stretch of the imagination black metal. Dani's vampiric vocals mirror more that of a gothic metal band. The guitar and synth is much like that of a black metal band...but hell, I don't think I have to describe why these guys aren't black metal. But anyway, this is a great album, Dani's vocals are much more shrill and piercing than on previous albums, but still get the job done.

This follow up to 2000's Midian doesn't exactly follow in it's predecessor's foot steps. Midian was largley their most \\"gothy\\"(stupid word, oh well) album, as well as their most melodic. While I really loved that record, it can't hold a candle to the punishing riff after punishing riff of Damnation and a Day. Cradle of Filth were never a black metal band so saying this record doesn't sound like black metal is just a lame excuse for not admitting how enjoyable this is. Elements of black metal, goth, power metal, etc have always been incorporated into their music. Now it's being down better than ever. And the production really adds a massive punch, especially to the thunderous double bass drumming. Simply amazing. Stand out tracks: Babylon A.D, Presents from the Poison Hearted, An Enemy Led the Tempest, and The Smoke of Her Burning."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRADLE WHAT HAVE U DONE!!!!!","review":"Ok, lets take a deep breath. Obviously because i am a cralde fan i gave this album 2 stars. if i werent i wouldn't even give it a one!!!! cradle of filth has obviously taken the wrong rode here.

This album is very artistic, and very well put together. These guys have talent. I have this album, and From the Cradle to Enslave. I'll definatly be checking out their other releases. I highly reccomend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece of Music","review":"This was the first Cradle of Filth CD that I purchased, and although I have subsequently bought Midian and In Death's Embrace (both extreamly good albums), this is by far Cradle of Filth's finest work. The problem with today's music is that if you buy a CD these days, you may have one or even two favorite tracks, with a few others that you like, and some that you just cant stand. Not so with Cradle of Filth on any of their albums. For Damnation and a Day, I personaly have at least seven favorite tracks (Hurt and Virtue, An Enemy Led the Tempest, Better to Reign in Hell, Serpent Tongue, Present From the Poison-Hearted, Mannequin, and Thank God for the Suffering), and all the rest I truly enjoy. This is one of the best albums I have ever had the privilage to listen to, and I await their new album's release with relish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A music catasrophe","review":"As a gigantic Cradle of Filth fan, I bought this as soon as it was realesed.

The album concept and art are interesting and essentially good, production is great, but the music is very flattened. The riffs are rather generic and indolent, the only exceptions being \\"Hurt and Virtue\\" and \\"Mannequin\\". Also, someone needs to shoot Adrian Erlandsson in the leg. It seems that as soon as the incessant droning of the double-bass ceases for a moment, it immediately starts up again.This record may be more accessible than others, but it runs out of gas quickly after you first listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pardon me, but...","review":"..this album (...). The lyrics are stupid, Dani's vocal is plain annoying, and he whole album concept is closer to Rob Zombie than Bram Stoker. I used to be a CoF fan.

THAT is a MASTERPIECE.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD for the Cradle of Filth Fan","review":"Cradle of Filth have outdone themselves with this cd. This CD sounds alittle different from their last few releases. I think it sounds like a mix between Dusk and her Embrace and Midian. The music at times is simple and very fast, Almost the entire time you are also given a orchestra and keyboard in the background. This CD has a much more open fresh sound for CoF. There are 17 tracks, 5 being instrumentals."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting, melodic, just pure haunting music","review":"it was amzing how these guys put this album together. all their lyrics are so poetic and at times are haunting. with dani filths scareming raptures, it sets the stage for a very beautiful performance. while listening to cradle of filth especially if your new to them you'll be in a sense of awe and wonder if he uses a voice changes but he doesnt. from the instrumental plague upon words to the heart pounding ending with end of daze, its a great all around album. Though it wasnt as good dusk and her embrace, it still captures the greatness of what metal has to offer. its really combonation of all metal types it really doesnt have a genre in its own except in the metal genre. but great if you want some great and haunting music to enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"I'm not an obsessive CoF fan, I've got Dusk... Cruelty and Midian and this album. This is probably my favourite.

I'm listening to Damnation now and it really is pretty good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Damnation and a Day","review":"Damnation and a Day, despite the sony label, the new melodic guitar riffs and vocal effects, is still a great album. Many people deny Cradle of any credit, but they should understand that when a band begins to change some of their sound, it's not necessarily selling out; every band needs to go through an evolution at some point in time. Cradle has done this many times, as made evident by The Principle of Evil Made Flesh, then to Dusk and Her Embrace and Cruelty and the Beast which in contrast to their first efforts, sound completely different. By the time they reached Midian and Bitter Suites to Succubi, they changed almost completely with their speed, effects, song-writing style, even their subject matter changed. Cradle of Filth is an aged and matured band, and while Damnation and a Day is not an incredible album, and does tend to drag being 75 min. or so long, it still does well enough to rank with the classic Cradle albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bof...","review":"Compared with Cruelty And The Beast (the greatest album EVER!), this \\"epic\\" soundtrack is poorly written and very disappointing for such a great band as Cradle Of Filth, and for such a talented and intelligent lyrist as Dani. During the first of the album, the British band remained true to their goal to tell the story of Lucifer, the Morning Star, cast away from Heaven for rebelling against G-d and Mankind, but as the songs goes on, the lyrics loose track of the story; ending up with songs like Mannequin, which has absolutely nothing to do with Lucifer. They could've done an album MUCH better (even better than Cruelty... if they really wanted to). One on a Biblical proportion; when you consider that the Devil, and other lesser demons appear more than once in the Bible and the Gospels. If you want epics Cruelty... IS much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All hail cof !","review":"As a way back fan of cradel of filth and some one who has learn alot throught the years from Dani's lirycs...

It's good but not the Cradle of Filth I remember. The new style is more ... how would you say it ... never mind. But, it's just not good.

They were so good on Midian, those were the good old days, huh? I dont know maybe its just me but they have changed alot and I dont like them now. I thought they would be always be my #1 black metal band but man has that changed. My new fav's are Dimmu Borgir, Old Mans Child, and Marduk. But after this cd, and I'm not saying that this is the cds fault but I kinda have curved away from black metal and went in2 hardcore bands like HateBreed, Mushroomhead, Skinlab, Machinehead, Soulfly, and some Slipknot. I guess now that I think about it this cd has alrght production but besides that everything is different. The ferocity isn't there as much and the lyrics aren't nearly as good but I guess to some fans this great and if they do fine. But if you're just getting in2 them try Midian to see what they are really capable of. Later"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why all the complaints?","review":"I can understand people accustomed to earlier works, particularly Midian, being disappointed with this album, as it is a sort of change in style. But I see nothing wrong with it. Having less of Sarah Jezebel Deva isn't such a bad thing now that Dani is able to weave his vocals into the music. The interludes are a nice touch as well. Lyrically, it's as sick, twisted, and disturbing as ever, but I mean that as a compliment. Best songs are \\"Serpent Tongue,\\" \\"Better To Reign In Hell,\\" and \\"Thank God For The Suffering.\\" \\"Mannequin\\" is good too but sounds totally contrary to anything COF has ever done.

This is the second release by this band. I've been a fan ever since their first album, however after listening to The Bell and the Hammer I'm amazed at how much this band has matured. I have been listening avidly to almost every style of music and I've never found anything quite like this album. It's not ground breaking but it's refreshingly new. It's a must have for fans of Mae, Copeland, Coldplay or Waking Ashland. The best tracks are in order The Bell and the Hammer, Sarah Poor Sarah, Eustace, and All We Thought We Could. I also suggest checking out the band Umbrella's"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best live bands Ive seen and Ive seen Mute Math, Muse and U2","review":"Saw this band opening for another band a very long time ago.

I also bought the cd before this one, Always Leave the ground, not long after the concert. If you like this CD and havn't heard the first one then go back and listen to that one. I am also going to start a petition to tell the original band to get back together.

Gligoric has the ability to annotate in a very lucid and comprehensible way. As a member of the older generation and as a positional player, his annotations do not include tons of Fritzy lines but are easy to read and follow. On the downside, the analysis is not always very deep as you'd find in a Nunn book, but there is still material here for months of study in this thick tome.

The iPod clock radios are just plain ugly so I passed on these $99 machines as well. The Eton Sound 50 is attractive and priced well.

After students become familiar with the first two or three tetrachords they need material to practice. Singing the twenty four permutations is a great exercise but not representative of real world examples.

Just because you only intend to play one note at a time, doesn't mean any ol' meat handed lounge player can make the recording. On the contrary, on an ear training set you want to take care not to have distracting overtones caused by an inferior instrument and a careless touch. I can't recommend anything so sloppy for the purpose of training the ear.I'm afraid to say that none of these focused ear traing methods are very good. If you want to do it right, get Schiff's recordings of the Well Tempered Clavier along with the Dover scores. First analyze the score, then listen to the CD while following along with the score. Schiff has the good taste to play only the Bosendorfer piano (nothing else comes close) and he won't rattle your brains with buzzing, hammered overtones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book - some great pictures, but not too much new.","review":"This book has great pictures, including some of the shooting scripts, but doesn't necessarily tell you anything that you don't have online.

It is an amazing recount of the life of Crazy Horse by a fine lakota Historian, who mixes written history with the reliability of oral tradition. Insight is given into the persona of Crazy Horse on a very intimate level. This book is one that is an eye opener. I have always known of Crazy Horse since my youth and his legend is larger life, but this book fills in the blank spaces so that you get the bigger picture of the man and the legend.

How accurate are passed down stories from ancestors many generations back. While reading the book I had no idea which \\"facts\\" were from historical accounts or which came from passed down stories. Also, \\"the white man\\" as portrayed by the author is evil, selfish, greedy, and full of lies while the Indians were brave, valiant, honest, and trustworthy. yeahhhh right. I have read enough factual historical accounts that show Indians as being every bit as corrupt as the white man. The only difference is the whites were greater in number and were intellectually superior when it came to developing weapons. The author is clearly biased. I don't recall him ever putting down the Indians for their savage scalping or pointless raids on other tribes, but as soon as the whites leave behind some trash on the trail it is noted. Not impressed at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story great writer","review":"This book may be history but it reads like a novel and makes you sad as to how these great people had there culture and lives stolen from them,everyone living in this counry should read it,it is hard to beleive but this tribe is still fighting to this day day to get this land back,I just read that they will no longer be allowed to worship in this place anymore,the reason not stated is that with the price of gold so high the powers that be want to start minning again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touched my heart","review":"I bought the book and the CD and both have given me joy.

This is the best professional pan for searing meat or vegetables quickly and without getting the product soggy or overcooked. I translate all the old-fashion oven recipes (Greek, Czech, German, etc etc) into a Japanese style quick sear for the meat, then removing the meat, slowly cooking the more fragile ingredients and sauce making, replacing meat later for controlled simmering.Fast searing, slow simmering--no better pan in the world for convenient one-pot cooking--asian style, sort of. Calphalon anodized aluminum is almost intelligent--the best cookware material. And I have used them all, full copper, stainless-clad copper and aluminum, and iron. My old 3-quart saute pan is so precious to me, I'm buying a new one, just to have in my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the old one","review":"I've had this same kind of pan for years and used it every day - sometimes more than once a day - and loved it. It cooked beautifully and never, ever stuck. But it finally just wore out. I checked the number on the bottom of the pan and ordered a new one with the exact same number. It's terrible! The new one doesn't even cook bacon without sticking. This is NOT the same pan as Calphalon made before."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS PAN!","review":"I hate this pan. I paid $199 for it and everything sticks to it no matter how I treat it and always has. I have written to Calphalon and apparently have no recourse. I have put up with it for more than a year and since Calphalon will do nothing to assist me with the sticking problem I am throwing the pan away. It is not worth the price nor the stress created by using it. I have a generic anodized set of pans that I have had for many years and LOVE them. I was adding this pan to that set. Silly me to think that BRAND NAME Calphalon would be even better.. Not so... It is going in the trash and out of my life and my kitchen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I absolutely love this pan. I have had the non-stick calphalon cookware but never the hard anodized. I really like the way this browns the food I fry in it. Even though you think that the cleanup will be horrible, it isn't. Just let the pan cool then add water and let set for a little and it comes clean very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, but Heavy","review":"I am very happy with this pan.

I have other Caphalon (no-stick) pans and was delighted, based on claimed attributes of their top-of-line pan. However, my pan did not have a flat bottom which is a problem on an electric range.

The recipes are simple to follow, but taste complex.

I purchased this book to be able to make smaller meals at a time. Unfortunately, a good portion of the recipes had too much food for a quart and a half crock. Thankfully I had a 3 quart crock and I used it. The food from these recipes, at best, tasted just ok. Not good, just ok or less than good. I thought this cookbook was designed for the quart and a half crock pot. I stopped using this book after about 18 or 18 recipes. I might as well throw it away. This was a terrible experience for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrocing, but rather depressing page-turner","review":"Indeed, the Randy Roth story is the highlight of the book. I won't rehash the details, but readign it does tend to leave one rather sad, that this animal got away with hurting so many innocent people, whos only mistake was perhaps beign a bit too needy. One can only hope he's earning a proper punishment behind bars, and not running his own little prison gang or something.I did however regret that there was no way to really examine the mans upbringing, and what made him the way he was. Perhaps he was neglected by a mother who doted over her daughters. His mother certainly sounded like a piece of work. Would also have been nice if Miss Rule had done a 'where are they now' segment at the end of this tale as she's done with other books in the is series.So basically after all is said and done, I'd recomend this book. A good start to an exceptional true crime series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating true crime stories","review":"I enjoy reading true crime books, and Ann Rule writes a ton of them. This one includes several different cases. All are compelling, but she goes into much more depth in the Randy Roth murder cases which makes that section stand out. I read that one last, and I stayed up most of the night until I finished it. Fascinating stuff about a truly evil man who managed to fool a lot of smart women.The only negative against Rule is that she sometimes writes in horrible cliches or bizarre metaphors. She'd be a better writer if she could avoid these clunky phrases."},{"rating":"2","title":"What An Exceptional Adventure.","review":"It has been a long time since I went through a book with such interest. I just couldn't put it down. The way Amit Gilboa writes made me feel like I was there. Coming back to work Monday morning was like coming back from vacations, not just the regular weekend it really was. What an exceptional adventure he has been part of. Though I definitely do not think I would be up to live the lifestyle of those described, it was great to witness (almost experience) it through the author's eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really bad book","review":"This book seems to be about nothing very much except that the author has a few dodgy friends. I travelled in Cambodia before. You see some rubbish people there, but you do anywhere. Gilboa's adolescant meanderings will appeal only to those who, like him, have a vicarious fascination with low life and want to to tarnish a whole country with its portrayal. A similar book could be written about any one of a dozen poorer countries. Why bother. Only the dreary will get anything out of this selectively and badly written, adolescant tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very realistic or honest","review":"I've been to phenom penh several times and saw this book for sale there. I realize that this book is listed as non-fiction but I think that it gives a very unrealistic portrayal of the city of phenom penh as viewed by a minor group of expats. I was hoping that it would describe a city that I actually love very much but I found it to be way off base. In addition, it was poorly written as though he just gathered up a bunch of scenes (and at the ends of some chapters just quotes from friends) and threw it all together. Nothing really holds it together. I just have to wonder if there's a point to all of the things that are in this book since it seems more like one \\"wow, dude, check out this\\" bit after another which gets old very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting overview of the Pnomh Penh scene","review":"This book gives a pretty good description of the situation today in Pnomh Penh. Of course the writer oversimplifies a lot of things and tries to give a comprehensive coverage based on a short visit. But overall, he did a good job of introducing Pnomn Penh today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for its time but not representative of Cambodia today","review":"I first read this book about 11 years ago when I was making my backpacking trip through SE Asia. While I enjoyed the book at the time, the book was written well over a decade ago.Phnom Penh has changed markedly since that time, and even the related AIDS epidemic is getting under control in the country. While this might be an interesting piece to read in order to gain an idea as to how the place was in the late 1990's, I don't think it will hold up well over time.So while I would have easily given it 5 stars a decade ago, I can't justify more than two now. The book is simply not relevant to today's Cambodia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing and insightful","review":"Gilboa's take on life in Cambodia has angered some of the expats who still live in Phnom Penh, while also garnering praise from reviewers and readers around the world. An online magazine in Tokyo that I publish has put up a special \\"corner\\" on OFF THE RAILS, archiving a lot of material from newspapers and interviews. Just click on http://members.tripod.com/~leinadmoolb/TokyoBoardWalker-rails.html"},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly no Hunter S. Thompson","review":"While I had a couple of laughs, this book would've been a lot more fun if the author was a better storyteller. The shallow pseudo-informative bits on Cambodian culture & politics don't help either. This book should've been written by one of the lowlife drifters Gilboa tries to portray. Someone who's been shagging fourteen year olds and smoking dope for years, not by a boring business journalist. Still, it's probably a good book to carry around for backpackers hoping to strike up a conversation on the bus or the beach. Try doing that with a copy of Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun ride through the city's absurdities in the 1990s","review":"This is an easy book to read. You will earn a genuine view of how debauchery and flimsiness governed this place inthe 1990s, at least from the point of view of some foreigners who are not exactly sure what they are there to do in the first place. The book is largely anectodal, and interesting for that. It almost totally lacks analysis, which one would have expected from a professional writer like the author. You can almost breath the air in Phnom Penh while reading this book, you can feel the high, but I am not sure how much you understand... but there are other books for that. If you are not a young and slightly nut Westerner but would like to experience Cambodia like if you were one... this book is for you!! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Woefully narrow sense of the place.","review":"AMit Gilboa's OFF THE RAILS starts out giving a vivid sense of a fascinating city, but soon the pounding one note he strikes, the note of westerns as bottom feeders out for rotten good times, begins to weary. Any visitor in Phnom Penh meets and sees some of the people Gilboa knows--they are there and Gilboa provides something of a record of their existence. But Phnom Penh offers so much more than his talk of the depressing \\"Majestic\\" Hotel crowd. Yeah, in a one-line disclaimer in the preface he admits that such people aren't the whole picture, but good journalism must not ignore the greater context after a such a limp disclaimer. Sure, show us the Majestic crowd but at least show them rubbing shoulders with the other expats in the city who work in real education, in building commerce, in landmine operations, in goverment exchanges, in journalism, in physical therapy. Gilboa presents a sensationalist vison--no big problem about that; but it is incredibly narrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"The horror.","review":"It's all here. Expatriates at their worst. And their best. If you're left shocked by those made for TV documentaries on big, bad, Bangkok, then Cambodia is the place you really want to read about. And Gilboa doesn't hesitate to show you the seamy underside. Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be journalists (apologies to Waylon Jennings)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blisteringly good read","review":"I read voraciously across many genres including a good deal of travel writing. Travel writing is too often fairly pale anemic stuff. 'Off the Rails' is anything but anemic. Gilboa dares to go where most travel writers fear to tread and he writes about these experiences in a far more compelling way than most. This book has energy and drive and I simply could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever but not very helpful over all.","review":"This is an OK book but not as indepth as I would like to help plant and maintain a serious orchard around my home.

Its well written, quite funny and poignant at the same time. All of us have a little underachiever in us - some more than others - and this is a perfect testament to that. My only complaint is that the book just ends. There's no real conclusion, no defining moment in which our hero mends his ways or comes to any profound realization. It just ends. All-in-all, a fine novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute short story written as a novella","review":"You must admit that the first few pages of the book, as the reader learns of William's story, are cute, endearing and funny. However, after 20 pages of this, it was already too much. The 100 pages that follow continue to be too much! The idea of exploring an underachiever's mindset is interesting and possibly what attracted most readers to the book, as I think many people at least wonder if they have fulfilled their \\"potential.\\" However, all William does is revel in it--he does little to illuminate the reasons for it in him or in others. The book seems to simply rehash William's unchanging mindset, which, granted, is the idea--he is a devoted underachiever, and perhaps underachieves by telling a story of an awkward length. But the book really needed to be much shorter or much longer. William is too one-dimensional to interest us for the length of this short novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to finish","review":"The life of William, an underachiever, is revealed from childhood to adulthood. His twin, Clive, is his opposite--successful and well liked. William receives just below average grades, attends a below average school, has below average girlfriends, and tells a below average story."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be read in one sitting","review":"This book is so short it should be read in one sitting to fully enjoy it. I regret I didn't read it in one shot. There are not enough breaks in the narrative for putting it down to be picked up later. There is no real story, just the diary writer's funny and pathetic underachieving in every aspect of life, starting from birth. His overachieving twin brother is his foil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holden Caulfield Grows Up","review":"I loved this book and it reminded me of The Catcher in the Rye except William tells the reader \\"all that David Copperfield crap\\". It also parallels Catcher in the Rye in that the ending was unresolved and it left me feeling somewhat unsatisfied. Despite the ending I truly enjoyed the rest of the novel. Anastas wonderful metaphors and the insights into all of the characters (especially Clive) were superb. My favorite part of the book is his term paper where he clarified the differance between underachievers and \\"younger slower brothers of Southern Presidents, like Billy Carter and Roger Clinton.\\" According to William,\\" These gentlemen do the best with whatever genetic leftovers they've been given, while the underachiever is entrusted with a master key to opportunity's home office, and misplaces it.\\" I sympathize with William as I too am an underachiever (too a much lesser degree)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REAL Under Achiever","review":"For some reason the title pulled me to this book. I guess I should have been warned with the \\"underachiever\\" in it. But, I had faith that Anastas could pull it off. I was wrong. Another tale of a boys life through the hardships of growing up. I don't understand how so many people can continue to write about the same old stuff and think that it is even remotely new to the readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly without merit.","review":"I have two questions...How did this garbage ever get published?Why did I bother finishing this trash?One of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read it's only redeeming quality is being under 200 pages.A fictional diary from a complete loser. Pity the poor, upper middle class boy who had, if not everything then more than most and who never tried, never accomplished, never did anything worth writing a book about.The author should be run out of town if he ever even looks at a pen, typewriter or word processor again. Please, don't try. Follow in your un-hero's footsteps and give up. NOW.Seriously, if you want to enjoy the adventures of an underachiever rent or buy the DVD set of Fox's 'Wonderfalls'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely Amusing","review":"The cover of this book is what first drew me in to it; so dull to be so full of brilliance. A very easy read, it is a wonderfully compelling book, which managed to make me laugh, then feel sad for poor William, and then turn around and cheer for him in the end, hoping that he really does become the greatest underachiever in the world. I disagree entirely with Kirkus. The story does not need a plot, but stands alone as a simple monologue, reminiscent, perhaps, of Kerouac's free form. The \\"moral\\" or the story is what's truly important. I must say, it is one of the most refreshing books i have read in a long while.

When I learned it was a movie I could not wait to see it. Now that I have seen the movie I wish they never made it. It has the worst narration I have ever heard. The narrator spoke with no feeling or emotion and you could clearly tell he was reading from a script. I guess you can't expect much from a made for TV movie but I was expecting more.

I don't even know where to begin on this disaster of disjointed characters, nightmarish dialog, and plot holes. Watching this up to the \\"fight\\" is like riding in a truck with a bad transmission with a person that cant drive in manual. I'll try not to spoil too much (anybody with an encyclopedia on generic storytelling would have me beat though) but basically the movie tries to make you feel sorry for one of the biggest jerks in Cinema history, and then makes out the unlikely anti-hero to seem like Fu-manchu.

It's definitely NOT a \\"bible\\". Basic Swishmax is pretty easy and obvious. The harder part of Swishmax is the scripting side - something this book does not cover very well. If you are a complete novice, then I'm sure it is good - If you are looking for a reference book that you can flip open and find an answer to all of your questions, keep looking. There are a number of free websites out there that are very informative on this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much needed to help me with SWISH","review":"When I purchased SwishMax for the first time, I began learning it by trial and error and its built in helps. It was a slow and tedious process. All of the online and offline helps I could find related to Flash. Although the concepts are very similar, enough subtle differences and limitations existed to only cause pain.Then I discovered the \\"Official Swishmax Bible.\\" It helped me considerably to get the basics of the software under my belt. I now can use Swishmax, applying my own creative ideas, with confidence of knowing what the software will and will not do.Thanks to Donna Baker for her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Best Deal in Town","review":"In a nutshell, this is not only a great book, but THE most authoritative guide to SWiSHmax available. Focusing on the omissions (thin coverage of scripting) would be like complaining that the ONLY coffee shop in town doesn't serve Hawaiian Kona.Coming in at 664 pages, you won't find more information for the price anywhere, including e-books (believe me, I've looked). The lack of coverage on scripting can be compensated by visiting some of the SWiSH forums and community websites.I think you'll be in good shape if you use the two-prong approach: the SWiSHmax Bible for all the A-Z fundamentals, and the forum & community websites for the targeted questions & problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Official SWiSHmax Bible","review":"This book and program is amazing. However, I cannot get the scrolling thumbnails to appear in the box that enlarges them. Other than that, I absolutely love the book. I have accomplished many thing while using this book for the website I am presently building. If you have the SWiSHmax program, this book is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"No space to write","review":"The photos are lovely, but I wouldn't have bought this calendar had I realized that most of the date boxes are filled with (rather pedestrian) travel tips, leaving no room to write down appointments, theater and music performances, birthdays, etc. The calendar description should make clear that Romantic Europe is strictly for gazing, not for notating."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the CD.","review":"If I could only put another star on the rating scale,these compilations should be a best seller..I love the songs and the artists who interpreted them ..another five stars too. Reader's Digest is truly commmitted to music lovers like myself..that's why I have given all the box sets a 5 star rating...what are you waiting for,you won't regret having them played over and over again....maybe someone up in the heavens are playing the Reader's Digest collections too,who knows?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great song","review":"This is an undeniably catchy song, but I don't think you need to pay for a bunch of remixes that aren't as good as the original. I'm mainly writing this review to suggest that anyone interested buy \\"Best of Trance 3\\" instead, which has the original version along with some other great songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"the perfect song I waited all of 2003 to hear....","review":"Seeing as 2002 was an extreme year for pop-trance/dance anthems that will probably go down in history as some of the best, I expected 2003 to be just as good. But 2003 disappointed me when it came to good trance flavored dance material. In 2002, we got some killer songs by artists varying from Ian Van Dahl, DJ Sammy, Lasgo, Noemi, DJ Encore featuring Engelina, 4 Strings, Nayer, Dee Dee, Iio,...need I say more? The point is that with that much energy put into music in 2002, I expected 2003 to be even better. Well hoping didn't make it happen, but Laava may have very well saved the reputation of dance music that was delivered in 2002. This first single is right on top along with some of the biggest names, but not only for having a catchy dance-floor classic, but for saving 2003's horrible dance floor mix...and here gives us hope for a positive, more up-beat 2004, can't wait to hear more from Laava."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel like turning the music off!","review":"This cd sucks big time. Laava's voice is very disappointing, and no way I could listen to this cd, I had to turn it off, and that doesn't happen to often, since I like lot of European dance/pop tunes. I would rate it less than 1 star if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice doll -- but a real pain to use in the bath!!!","review":"We gave this doll to my daughter for her 4th birthday last year. While it is a lovely doll and she plays with it often, calling it a \\"bath doll\\" is something of a joke. If you want a doll your child can take in the bath, then dry off and play with, this is not the doll! It takes lots and lots of prolonged squeezing and drip-drying before she can come out of the tub and be played with (otherwise water keeps dripping out of her joints -- legs, arms, neck, eyes) It is usually several days before ours can be played with dry, and that is only after an adult has vigorously squeezed and shaken the doll several times to get all the water out of her head, arms, legs etc. I thought a bath doll would be solid or sealed plastic, so the water couldn't get in. If I were buying a bath doll again, I would not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE","review":"I am an average weight, 5'1 college student. ordered this dress, expecting it to look like the picture. It barely went past my underwear, there was 2 huge slits up the side that went to the hip bone, and the entire back was open held together with elastic string.

What a pain to have to keep buying these cups that only last for a short time. They need to come up with a better way of mounting the detectors so you do not need to keep coming back for this accessory, or maybe that is what they want."},{"rating":"1","title":"An alternative product","review":"I have the Escort 8500 model which includes this suction mount. The mount constantly falls off my windshield. I was going to order a new one to see if it improved things, but the reviews her made me think twice. Then I found an aftermarket mount at southerncarparts dot com. It's a bit more expensive but looks solid and worth the extra cost. It looks like the mounts that come with GPS systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good second battery","review":"I got this additional 56 WH battery to give me at least 10 hrs of heavy load runtime. Enough to handle major hub to major hub air travel. Chicago/NY/Atlanta to Korea might stretch it(14hrs) tho. I would have liked to buy the 63WH battery which is used for the 1015 PEM, but ASUs could not technically explain why a 63WH battery (which incidentally physically fits the 1015PN)could not work with the 1015PN. I coldnt contact the design engneers to get a good explaination. My questions fell on \\"It wasnt designed for the PN\\" answer, not why. Basically the 63WH battery has a higher open circuit voltage than the 56WH battery.Any how, delivery was fast, and actually beat the projected delivery estimate. Outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bracket hold up!","review":"Worked as advertised. This was either a factory original or a great knockoff as it worked great. It doesn't have any moving parts and is pretty basic so it doesn't have to do much. I rate it 5 of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Advertisement","review":"Advertisement lead one to believe that those purchasing the Escort Radar Dectector also purchase the windshield suction cups to connect it to windsheild. Unable to determine what shipped with the radar dector the ad made it seem as if you needed the suction cups to connect to windshield.

If you need new cups go to a hobby store and buy some designed to hang small artwork off windows."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you see if what you get - 1 bracket and 2 cups","review":"This is the same cheap, low suction, bouncy (due to the metal bracket flexing) mount that came new with your Escort detector. The new cups will work marginally better than your old, worn out cups but you will soon come back to your car and find your detector on the floor or dangling from the power cable. Some folks recommend putting your old cups in boiling water for a bit to freshen them up for better grip, but I have not tried it.The Valentine V1 mount is head and shoulders better than this offering from Escort (as is the V1 detector) but the 8500 X50 works pretty good and can be found a lot cheaper - but the Escort mount is just terrible.Note that if you buy a replacement suction cup mount direct from Escort or at many other online stores you get the bracket and FOUR new suction cups - so you have spares when the first two quit gripping. This item from Amazon is just the bracket and TWO cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"why no translations??????","review":"i bought this dvd as it was advertised as subtitles and there are none except in english!!!why not in foreign languages as i can not share this with others withoug spanish subtitles!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absorb.

The guy just drones on and one in this movie. It's like he can't take a breath; his dialogues are just one long sentence.

Ugh.I gave the movie one star for the lovely scenery of the CA coast."},{"rating":"2","title":"The winds of change.","review":"I greatly enjoyed \\"THE SHIFT\\" (which was originally named AMBITION TO MEANING--and no reason to give it 4 stars instead of 5 but whatever). As I watched the movie, it touched me in many different ways. It brought to the surface strong emotions, which I interpret to mean that my soul agreed with what Dr. Dyer was relaying in the movie. It's a simple movie, deep with meaning. Since I've watched it, I have felt a shift take place, taking place. I can best describe it as an underlying feeling of \\"all is well-ness\\" as you go through your day despite the problems and issues I may be dealing with. It's not like you have this perpetual smile on your face and the birds are singing, etc. More of an inner awakening and true knowing that God is in the details and flowing through your life. BEAUTIFUL. I believe that the more I let this \\"flow\\" become a bigger presence in my life that the strength of my fears will diminish.

I watched it as soon as it arrived from Amazon, but I haven't had any desire to watch it again. He's a little easier to understand in this movie, unlike his seminars which I find incomprehensible at times and more like infomercials for his other books. I feel as though he has so much wisdom to impart, yet he can't seem to get it out of him. It's like he's speaking in math, or riddles, and I often wish he'd just cut to the chase and help people for once, instead of touching the tip of the iceberg while hawking his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"an enlightening experience...","review":"Wayne is definitly a very special person.he has an amazing sense of groundedness..and a very enlightening soul, you can easily feel it through the screen.and I definitly recommend this movie to anyone who sees more to life than what they have been tought...the movie had some nice music..and super cinematography too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond words","review":"This movie touched my heart and soul. I cried at is's beauty! Portia de Rossi did en excellent job, as well as all the other actors.

He and Jessica were meant to be together!! No offence to Elizabeth but she is only good when she is with Jessica and she is not so good whan she is by herself or with Tom. Jessica is truely and naturally, funny and exciting but the what happened to Detective Fox. Its like all of a ssudden he dissappeared. The story never said that he was a ghost and besides romance with Jessica is really funny! To all the readers who like Elizabeth more than Jessica you will like this book more but I like the character of jessica's more."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was so-so.","review":"I liked this book all right but like others have said I think they should have Jessica a little more involved with the story. It was a little more exciting to read about her and Sgt. Pruitt then Elizabeth and her play. Also what has happened with Nick? He and Jessica were made for each other and suddenly he disappeared."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was like no other Sweet Valley University Book","review":"This book was da bomb, Elizabeth and Tom should have done it though. They have been through a lot and I think that they are ready for it. Tom however seemed to be in too much of a hurry and Elizabeth was being indecisive. Doesn't she know that she almost sento him crazy. Well as for Jessica, she will beat Seargent Pruitt or her name isn't Jessica Wakefield. That is what I like about her character. All in all the book was great and I hope that what is to come is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Basic Elegance","review":"These shoes are adorable and the padded insole complete the perfect little girls dress shoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing cheap plastic","review":"The faux marble finish on the seat is beautiful (we didn't even mind a flaw on the underside- a small reddish streak). We DID MIND the cheap plastic hardware used to fastened the seat down. The seat easily shifted on the bowl because, unlike metal, it wouldn't tighten down. The plastic hinged split after two months! We are not big or heavy people - it was definitely the plastic. We went to our hardware store and bought brass hardware and it works well and the brass complements the marble finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Gen 3 Glock 22","review":"The rear sight would not slide into place on my G3 Glock 22.

For the third-party company, Nyko, they absolutely made a wireless controller for the Gamecube a reality. The controller works very well for the system, as a substitute for the Wavebird, or the traditional Gamecube controller. It is very easy to operate, and has a very good feel in the gameplay. The control is a bit bigger, and has rubber grips on each handle. Yet, there happens to really be one downside to this wireless controller, is that you can't feel and rumble or vibration that the traditional original Nintendo Gamecube controller has.

The entire premise of the Read With Me DVD system is good, the DVD's themselves are excellent and fun learning tools, however, be careful with the required controller you must purchase.

Like previous reviewers say, it's made SO poorly. I couldn't even figure out how to put it together. My husband had to. Then, once it's together, it falls apart at the drop of a hat.

Buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Venus Fix","review":"As always MJ Rose tells an important story that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Internet porn is the addiction that Dr. Morgan Snow is dealing with in this book. The author does an excellent job of making us understand how this addiction affects not only the men and boys that participate but also how it affects the women in their lives. It is very worrying when we realize how easily available this is not only for adults but for teenage boys and the effects it can have on them and the young girls in their lives.

In reading Mr. Chansky's book, its clear where his loyalties lie. His text is weaved with snide comments about Coach K and the Duke athletic and academic program, while at the same time lionizing Coach Smith the the UNC progam. Don't be fooled: this is not an unbiased portrayal of Duke-Carolina.Chansky's book could also have benefited from better editing. He spends single paragraphs describing some of the most thrilling Duke-Carolina games, but then rambles on for pages about inconsequential stuff, such as CD Chesley's TV deals or Coach K's American Express commercials (an obvious sore point for Chansky).I wouldn't recommend this book. Probably a better read would be \\"To Hate Like This Is to Be Happy Forever\\" since its at least honest about its affliation and more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as unbiased as author wishes","review":"This is a thoroughly researched book that on the whole gives equal time to both UNC and Duke. Although I am a UNC fan, I know that Chansky is a UNC alumnus and can't completely hide his disdain for Mike Kryzewski. Although some of Dean Smith's foibles are mentioned, Coach K gets the worse treatment here. Chansky was rougher on Dean in his other book, \\"Dean's Domain.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"These People are trying to rip Chow Yun-Fat off!","review":"After the success of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Chow Yun Fat has truly become one of the hottest acting commodities not only in the United States and Asia but across the globe as well. But with this great fame there are many money grubbing executive pushers that are literally taking food out of his mouth. By selling these cheap, horrible transfer movies (Most that are not really Chow Yun Fat movies to begin with) these companies are not only tarnishing the integrity of CYF star but are disrespecting and confusing the viewer as well. How the heck are you going to take a forgotten hong kong flick, splice in short Chow Yun Fat footage from another movie, then call it Hong Kong Corruptor? Chow should really consider suing these a@#holes! I don't even think that Chow is aware what is going on.

They just want it to enforce morality rather than \\"promote the general welfare\\" as stated as a purpose of government in the preamble of the constitution.

For those bored by this well that reflects more on your own lack of intellect than anything else. The sets, not a computer generated image in sight, are lavish and authentic without being slavish to detail. The fight scenes are well choreographed, again without effects making them obviously fake. The genuine atmosphere gives the production a soul totally absent from Gladiator. Whilst the ending is too much, Simmons holding up his son to the dying Spartacus, it does not compare to Scott's ludicrous finale. All in all a fine film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning for quality buffs...","review":"I love this film and it was one of my first choices when deciding what to purchase for my new DVD collection. Here is a warning: the quality of the video is dismal on this version of the DVD. When reading the other reviews I had to check my version to make sure it was the right one. First of all the DVD encoding is jittery and interspersed with coding artifacts throughout the film. The quality is similar to a movie taped from TV onto a well worn VHS tape. The poor encoding is immediately noticeable when compared to my other DVD purchases like Ben Hur or Gone with the Wind. In addition, this DVD is not a two disk set. My two star rating is purely based on the reproduction quality since I still consider this one of the greatest movies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I am somewhat puzzled by some of the negative reviews I have seen here. This movie is the prototype for such future blockbusters as \\"Braveheart\\", \\"Gladiator\\", and \\"Glory\\". All three of those movies have scenes in them which were almost directly ripped off from Spartacus.As for Kubrick, it is true that he was not the director at the onset of production. Yet, he has never demanded that his name be taken off of the credits.It seems that many of my fellow reviewers have forgotten that this movie was made in 1960. I admire this film for its great \\"cast of thousands\\" battle scenes, the grandeur of Rome, and the realism of the gladiator training camp. I excuse it for the hokiness of the love story between Douglas and Simmons because they were doing as much as you could get away with in that era.All in all, when one puts the film in its historic perspective, it was a milestone in Hollywood cinematography. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweeter Spartacus in 1960","review":"Kirk Douglas' portrayal of the gladiator slave in this 1960 epic is a far more sympathetic character than that of the recent TV serial.Softened further by his relationship with the regal Jean Simmons, Spartacus is less the commanding presence, general of the slaves, than a victim of the winds of fate blowing around him.Laurence Olivier's Crassus and Miss Simmonds Wife are the performances that linger longest."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE HEROIC EPIC.","review":"This is a typical example of a perfect movie.

Don't buy Spartacus on Blu-ray!","review":"I emphatically agree with all those who ranted about the wretched transfer of Spartacus to Blu-ray. I swear, the Laserdisc we owned twenty years ago looked better than this. The image is dull, dark, and very soft. After taking years to release Spartacus on Blu-ray (remember, it was on HD DVD first) it's hard to believe that Universal has butchered it so badly. We haven't watched it yet; I just scanned through each chapter, and couldn't believe my eyes. I'm really not looking forward at all to watching this disc. My only consolation is that I only paid about ten bucks for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, bad transfer","review":"It should be noted that the reviews on this page refer to two different versions of the Spartacus DVD. This review refers to the Universal single disc edition, not the Criterion two-disc release.While both versions of the film are the same, this version is devastated by a bad transer: both sound and picture quality are seriously lacking - even as far as a blue edge to blacks, including the widescreen matting, and blue fades in parts of the film. The sound is poorly balanced - voices are too quiet, music too loud. I was contantly turning the volume up and down throughout. So much for \\"fully restored.\\"If you are interested in quality and really like this movie I would skip this version and go for the Criterion release, which many other people own and have approved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"\\"Spartacus\\" produced by Kird Douglas and released em 1960, is the best movie of all time, or among the 5 bests.Great epic, superb cast, beautiful soundtrack, it \\"inspired\\" \\"Gladiator\\" (2000) and many other movies.

Horrible, horrible blu-ray. Maybe the worst blu-ray disc I've seen. Do not buy, wait for a recall. It's so blatantly awful even non-cinephiles will notice.Here's the main problem: most all the film grain and fine detail have been completely wiped out in a clumsy attempt to remove video noise. Which begs the question: so what's the point of owning it on blu-ray?What's worse is that it didn't have to be this way. But I guess this is what happens when an indifferent media conglomerate has complete control over a masterpiece. Check out Robert Harris's (the man who restored the film years ago) extremely negative review of this blu-ray on the web. I thought maybe he was overdoing it a bit, but no.

Her eyes were enough to drown in. Surely Spartacus would fall in love with such a woman. Those who watch the DVD will miss the effect of the overture played with cutains closed or the true visual size of the movie, but will be captured by an intelligent script, outstanding actors, and battle sequences that inspired \\"Braveheart\\".

I find it quite irresistible, despite some of the weaknesses in an over-earnest, obvious script from Dalton Trumbo and some less than stellar performances (what was up with John Dall?). Olivier, Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, and Peter Ustinov are more than sufficient reason to watch the film through. The battle scenes are impressive, and had an obvious influence on Mel Gibson's vastly inferior Braveheart. Overall, a film that takes itself a wee bit too seriously, but manages to stay afloat.

Like i said, maybe it's just me. Dont get me wrong, i absolutely adore Stanley Kubrick and 2001: A Space Odessey has to be the best movie ever, but Spartacus just didn't do it for me. I would've liked it if there was more conflict between the gladiators during battle and if they displayed the different types of gladiators like the hoplomachus, the provocator, the secutor etc etc. I give Spartacus 1 star for the \\" I Am Spartacus\\" scene where i laughed so much, i almost fell of my seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romans wore '50's style hairdoos?","review":"Historically inaccurate in many places.

So start up again after the war he did and had another terrific, even an avant-garde orchestra that mixed classical with be-bop. No other band sounded like this one. But again it was short-lived because of Claude's health. Then in 1965 Claude got an orchestra together again and was scheduled to open in Atlantic City, but died the night before.

I spoke to multiple residents in my program and they all had the same problem with this book. This is not an isolated event, but a problem with the manufacture of this particular book. I plan to glue the spine back together myself or take it to a bookbinding company. This defect is serious -- it detracts from the lifespan and value of this expensive book! Who wants to spend $160 for a book to have it fall apart and require glue or duct tape? Ridiculous! This is very unfortunate too, because the content of the book is very good.

It is an awesome quick reference for conferences and sign-out. The descriptions of what to look for in a particular lesion are great. The differential diagnoses are a touch incomplete. However, for the differentials listed, an explanation of why the lesions are different is given. Another bonus is the fact that special stains are included for each lesion (my personal favorite). The book could be a bit more organized, but I think this will come with age.

George is a big man and the sound he delivers from his sax is equally big yet very warm. I adore his solos on \\"Maiden Voyage\\"; he plays with time, he is dynamic then very subtle, simply beautiful.\\"The Amsterdam after dark\\" is his best solo effort, I think. Maybe not as ambitious as \\"Manhattan Panorama\\" but much more pleasing. He is joined by three other American \\"expatriates\\" (it's recorded by a Dutch label), Billy Higgins among them, for 40 minutes of relaxed blowing of few originals and standards.

I save time and frustration because every container takes the same size lid, and because they are so neatly stacked together. The containers have held up very well--I did crack a couple of them when full and frozen. I also have a very high-end dishwasher (came with the house) that melts nearly everything plastic but the containers do fine in it. I believe it warped a couple of the lids since they don't fit as well now. So I handwash the lids now.

Analyzing the crisis and the circumstances that led to it, Wiegel exposes the culture of dissent and self-deception among the seminarians, priests and ultimately among bishops who failed in their ministry of shepherding the flocks. Greater fidelity is the proper response to this crisis and just like any other crisis, this too must be turned into an opportunity. Therefore he lays out a blueprint for a genuine reform of the Catholic Church in America.One may or may not agree with all the opinions, arguments and conclusions of Wiegel; but the book surely provides a mine of information and a wealth of wonderful insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for today's Catholics","review":"George Weigel's impeccable theological credentials and extraordinary ability to express his ideas in the vernacular have produced a desperately needed review of the current crisis in the US Catholic Church. It is clear enough to be understood by non-Catholics and written in a way that individual chapters on specific issues can be read and quoted independently without losing their context.Mr. Weigel's theological and practical knowledge are partnered in a way that looks at the priesthood and the church hierarchy from many angles while remaining firmly rooted in the essentials: The teachings and example of Jesus,the first Priest, the head of the church and the architect of it's structure.I will use this book as an essential tutorial to explain the issues of the current scandal, its origins and solutions to family, friends and anyone with a serious interest in these vital and agonizing issues that affect not just Catholics but all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Wake Up Call","review":"This book manages to take a critical look at the modern Catholic Church and be pro Catholic at the same time. This book will benefit any catholic that wants to know why we are in the mess we are in and how to get out of it. Although not a member of the clergy he offers a few suggestions to the catholic in the pew, as well as quite a few to the US Bishops. I found myself not wanting to read the last few pages as he tries to tell the Vatican/Curia what they need to change to accomodate the Catholic Church in the US. other than that it is a fine book.My hat is off to George Weigel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For the Discerning Man","review":"As one who has spent the past two years serious discerning my vocation, I found this book key in what to look for in dioceses and seminaries. It provides several questions that should be answered both by the potential seminarian and by the seminary/diocese. As well, it gives a good historical and political basis for the situation the Church has come into. I highly recommend this book to all discerning their vocation. The only drawback is that I believe the book is a little expensive for the quantity of material presented.Onto this book, I would also suggest a tape series by Bishop Sheen, \\"Called and Chosen\\" which was made out of a retreat weekend for priests. It was one of his last works, make well into the post Vatican II era, giving insights into our Church today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true story I suspected but had no way of knowing","review":"It does take courage to be Catholic in the modern world. And that's ok especially when the truth is at stake. Weigel has the background and the discerning intellect to present that truth without the varnish of political correctness and the attempt by self-appointed Catholic \\"Intellectuals\\" to out secularize the secularist.The truth is always refreshing especially when put forth in a charitable but forthright way.We presented it in a Catholic book club reading and it was very well received by all.An important read for all Catholics in this age of persecution and attack on the church-[what age isn't].The \\"Courage to be Catholic\\" does present a great gift of hope in the reforms we have already seen in the Church in the last few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of a twin brother's love.","review":"\\"The Were-Wolf\\" by Clemence Housman is a quick-paced story about the travails of blind-love and the truth one brother bears in regards to the true identity of a lone traveler. The horror of the tale focuses more on this blindness rather than the gore-heavy visuals we come to expect from werewolf lore. The prose is crisp with imagery, although a bit heavy-handed with its grandiloquent diction at times. Regardless, it is a melancholy tale that encompasses death and life amongst the endless harrowing of snow and the chicanery found in beauty. Beware the wolf behind the proverbial sheep's clothing!

The emotional impact of this story cannot be overstated. If you have a brother, a sibling, or anyone you truly love then this story of one man's sacrifice for the sake of his beloved brother will leave you torn between admiration and a feeling of profound loss.

The whole thing smacks of cashing in on his popularity. This CD will probably detract from his continued success. There are a few modestly funny moments on this CD, but the material runs mostly between \\"not funny\\" and \\"less than funny\\". My IQ dropped fifteen points after listening to this just once.

It's almost as if Larry, his management, or record label decided to cash in on his recent success with a quickie Christmas release. There's no audience reaction to Larry's material, giving this recording an oddly subdued tone. That takes away so much from a comedy album.Larry has built a lot of goodwill with his fans during the past couple years, and is selling out live everywhere he goes. But this release will surely disappoint many of his fans.

St.John was a jounalist covering the war and trying to stay one step ahead of it. He successfully covers it, but undoubtedly gets caught by it. His depiction of his flight, the blow by blow description of war, which in this context primarily takes the form of experiencing uncontested bombing raids by the Nazis, and his reporting of the effects of this violence on the local people is harrowing, moving and unforgetable.

David and his sidekick Hubert begin piling lie on top of lie to protect his career, and things spiral completely out of control.

Or try and do a complete backup to refresh an existing complete backup; if you've deleted files on your source drive since the last backup, you have to run a seperate step to delete the \\"deleted\\" files from the backup drive! Sheesh! And talk about slow- 65 mb per minute means my 20 gig drive takes hours and hours to complete a backup. As an add-on drive, this device is fine.

At a certain point, not too many pages into the \\"Commentary\\" I figured out what was going on and started the Commentary over again.I needed 3 or 4 bookmarks to keep track of what I'd read so far and where I'd skipped to, during the joyful adventure of reading this all-time great book.Pale Fire has it all:Humor, fantasy, satire, cleverness, rivalry, rejection, redemption, craziness, sarcasm, hero-worship, and above all, Nabokov's spectacular mastery of English prose -- never more evident than in this tour-de-force of page-turning delight.Not only was this one of the most original books I've ever read, but one of the most fun and rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"if ever a novel deserved 5 stars...","review":"Let's put things straight from the start: this is a weird novel, practically a genre unto itself. It consists of a long poem (\\"pale fire\\") supposedly written by a fictional american poet (John Shade) and the subsequent notes/commentary, written by an equally fictional character: Charles Kinbote, a man who claims to be a scholar from the country (fictional again) of Zembla. Now, far from being a reliable annotator, Kinbote bends every word of the poem (hilariously so because it's far too evident) so as to mantain that Shade's autobiographical poem is in fact about the story of Zembla (and Kinbote's personal tragedy).This was intended as a satire against critics who, in Nabokov's opinion, tend to see in other people poems meanings and hints that are not really there.While the concept immediately got my attention, I feared that it might be marred by boring execution. Boy, how was I wrong... Eventually I couldn't put it down until I had finished it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good","review":"Book was delivered in a very timely manner.

Though I fondly smiled at remedies involving unicorn horn, and at cautions about avoiding the meat of the gryphon, I was very disappointed that there were no useful ideas, for all that I respect the skill of the medieval herbalists. Entries are merely Hildegard's description of a plant or animal and its humours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Physica-a disappointment","review":"In the book \\"Physica\\" by Hildegard von Bingen, she omits 50% of the most important information, which is dosages of the herbs. So who could benefit today from reading it? No-one. And the God inspired information is so ridiculous- \\"Lettuce should be eaten without condiment, their injurious juice makes a person's brain empty, and they fill his stomach with illness\\". I was so disappointed because I thought this so called visionary's information would be so valuable and transend all time. More like a waste of time not to mention money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Translation avoiding Christian themes","review":"This book is very interesting as other reviewers noted. The biggest issue I have with it is the poor translation of Christian themes (natural to a work written by a nun of the 12th century). Where the word \\"demon\\" is used in the original text, the translator, Priscilla Throop, renders it as \\"airy spirit\\". And yes, there is a big difference between an \\"airy spirit\\" and a demon. Consider which one you would want in your bedroom at night. Yes, there is a difference. This makes me wonder what else Throop is twisting to fit her own worldview instead of simply giving us Hildegard's writings in common English."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened Hildegard??","review":"When I first got this book, I was excited to read about old time medicines, etc. She was such a revered woman during her time; I thought her medical opinions would be enlightening.

No more good riffs and violence like on bruce lee, hit machine, 123slam, chicken box,thats life..., which is the only thing their music relies on. Mark's ranting is still there, but the music is appalling.They are still one of the best US punk bands for me, along with Nofx and Goodriddance, but really a part from surf's up on the previous album which is a decent song, the two latest albums suck, and i'm not mentioning gusto...Now relative to the other garbage punkmusic out there , this album is no worse, but in comparison to previous stuff they did, i am afraid it sucks. Basically i would say this is a boring version of t.yakimoto or musical monkey"},{"rating":"1","title":"cute, but falling apart","review":"I love this quit, but it's falling apart.

I bought it thinking it would be useful in just turning over to nurse. The only problem is that there is a slight lip on the item so the bed of the co-sleeper is not exactly flush with your bed since there is a lip (the side does not go down all the way). You cannot just lean over to feed, you must get up on your knees and lift the baby into your bed (elbows don't bend backwards). What I do like about it that it is close by so you can see the baby while he's sleeping (I was paranoid about blankets covering his face). It is much easier to pack up to take with you on overnights and packs up smaller than the pack n'play. I do recommend that if you had a c-section to set it a foot or so from the bed (with the fourth side up if it makes you more comfortable) since trying to get up around it is difficult for the first week or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - Happy to Have!","review":"I think the mini co-sleeper is great! Perfect height, lots of storage space underneath to put extra diapers, blankets, toys, whatever in...the only thing that take's some getting used to are the catches to lower/raise the 'bed' side of the sleeper. They were hard to move up/down when I moved it to the living room and back (which was way easier than a regular pack-n-play, since the mini has wheels on one side!) Overall, I think it's a great product :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your INCONSIDERATE Husband, Molly Kikerstein","review":"The ultimate value of this product is not allowing laziness, but instead allows the baby to still be close to his/her mother. This happens to be more important than our society places value on. The added value of not having to get out of bed is fantastic for women who work a full time job and need some sleep at night. It is much easier to fall back to sleep if you have not been up walking. Finally, if your husband is incovienced about your baby crying in their infant years, you are going to have a sad life raising your child alone. It is not inconsiderate when your infant makes noise. It's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Co-sleeper not for nursing mothers","review":"I bought this based on looks recomendations and description. What I got was a glorified pack n play bassinet type thing. The only difference is the side is down on one side to allow you to roll over and pat your baby. I was expecting an extension essentially to my bed with both mine and the baby's matress at the same height this is not so. So I still have to pull her out of her bed abd put her in mine to nurse and then wake her up to put her back in. Plus I have a 4 poster bed with rails down each side at the base of my matress so the sleeper does not push up flush to the bed as it said they should warn about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Co-Sleeper","review":"Good because:-It doesn't take up a lot of space.-It's the perfect size for a tiny one.-Great practical use. Once your baby doesn't fit in it, you can use it to store baby's stuffed animals or other things.I gave it only 4 stars because:-Weight limit is 15 lbs. and my daughter only fit in it up to 4 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"waist of money, buy the ORIGINAL, MINI is too small (baby outgrows it in a month)","review":"Ok, when I bought i thought it was the best thing I've ever bought in my whole life, baby loved the mattress, I loved the mattress (firm but comfortable) and he slept like never before (colicky baby)I loved being able to look at my baby and see him breath. I loved the fact that is was small and portable.BUT my baby outgrew it by the time he was 1 month and a half...and only 20 1/2 inches!!!as soon as he started to move around his bassinet, he got his head stuck in one of the sides of the co-sleeper perpendicular to his body ( i though he had broken his neck!!)I exchanged it for the Original version of this co-sleeper and I love it again..it is not portable as the mini, does not have wheels, it is not as eady to assemble, and definitely not light, but my baby still loves it, the mattress is still awesome and my baby sleeps through the night and he is only 3 months..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This co-sleeper is great - you can have the baby near you without having to worry about him being in bed with you.

I must say though, she hates it! The mattress is so hard I may as well lay her on my floor. She just tosses and turns and grunts. Her poor little head just looks so uncomfortable! and the side of the mattress closest to my bed kind of sinks down and she ends up rolling over and sliding down with her face right up against the side of the sleeper! I also don't like how there is a million pieces of velcro everywhere. Good idea but needs much improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this item!","review":"I absolutely love the Mini Co-Sleeper! It's great having my son at eye level. And the length is such that it's not impossible for me to get in and out of bed even with a night table, which is why I chose the mini over the original. But I really wish it also converted into a play yard, like the original co-sleeper does. Great for changing too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for breast feeding or c-section moms","review":"This is a life saver. Our daughter was born three weeks early by c-section and she nursed very often. I could nurse her while lying in bed and slip her into the co-sleeper. No worries about her falling out of our adult bed. I would however recommend the canapy if you have cats. Whenever our daughter was not in it our three cats used as their ultimate cat napping area."},{"rating":"1","title":"New product's chemical smell was unbearable","review":"This co-sleeper has a lot of positive reviews, and from what I could see it was a sturdy well-built item that must be convenient for many parents.However, I am sensitive to chemicals and right after we opened the package I became violently ill from the odor. I have not been this sick from a chemical smell in at least a year, and we have purchased many other new items since. Given how sick it made me, I would never want that type of smell near my newborn baby.If you do buy this item, air it out for at least a day or two before you bring it anywhere near your baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I bought the extensions for legs so could increase height and be even with my bed - great storage for diapers, wipes, extra clothes - handy at night especially - I also purchased for $25 a nicer mattress and my son used up to almost 5 months and over 16 pounds. Very easy set up. I only give 4 stars because the mattress, like other bassinets, is horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"This baby product deserves more than just 5 stars!","review":"Out of all the millions of products a baby needs, that we have purchased or received, the mini co-sleeper is by far the best and smartest decision made! The first portable crib we bought was the Laura Ashley port-a-crib...beautiful and well made but huge! (It would not fit through doorways if you wanted to move it to another room and took up tons of space in our smaller-sized bedroom.)I had a C-section and am breastfeeding so the co-sleeper has really made our lives much easier with a new baby. It fits securely against the bedside allowing our newborn to sleep with us, but with safety. Plus, there is a ton of storage space underneath and on each end of the crib. We highly recommend the co-sleeper...it is easy to set up and break down, very sturdy and safe; well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dated but Informative Book","review":"Last fall I found Holocaust! at Sam Weller's in Salt Lake City.Since the book was written in 1959, of course the infomation is dated. Bezaquin, who only died a few years ago, told a very gripping, moving story, however. If you can find this book, read it. Recently here on Amazon I found another book that really updates Benzaquin's story. The author of Fire at the Coconut Grove, in the New England remembers series, talked extensively with Benzaquin before he died, and she was given access to his work. The New England Remembers book is easier to find and a lot less expensive, but read Benzaquin if you can, to get a flavor of life decades ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR FLOORS!!!","review":"Bought this for my entry way tile, got it home, read the instructions on the back and learned that it's nor recommended for floors.

Her story is not only wonderous but manages to deliver a more concise and powerful set of lessons without the subtraction of core principals for the sake of either brevity or to justify indulgence in more petty human desires. Three chapters deep into her work you will know why Sanchez ripped her off. If rehash is easier for you the reader please try \\"The Four Agreements\\" by Don Miguel Ruiz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bright Orange Warning Sign","review":"The author of this book, whose writing chops appear to have been honed primarily by his experiences as editor of his college newspaper, presents the face of a person who is both self-aware and soul-searching, but against the larger context of the recycled right wing tripe (Republican = Christian; Democrat = Atheist; No other options exist) he publishes on his personal weblog, the projected circumspection is frankly difficult to believe. The single most effective line in the entire volume: \\"If nothing else...when this is all over I'll be able to say that I spent the night in a Mexican jail.\\" This bit of dark humor is overshadowed by the poorly executed \\"Blue-Haired Conservative,\\" a piece largely composed of self-important boasting (\\"Ooh, look at me, I'm gnarly AND a republican AND totally original!\\") and personal propaganda.

There are only like two maps in the book, and entire chapters seem to cover areas not covered on the maps. It becomes a book of details that tells the history, not a history that includes details. It doesn't hold my interest - actually it is great to read at night on the bedstand. Ten pages puts me right to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Narrative of Ancient Sites","review":"Secrets of Archaeology is an excellent video narrative of many ancient sites. A nice overview of the history is given while the sites are shown in good detail.

I do like the CD, with the exception of \\"Hide\\" not on the CD. The CD was obviously an obligation to fulfill the agreement between the record company and the band. The reason I gave this 2 stars is because they could have made the DVD much better. We as fans have already paid for these songs once and deserve a better effort. The least they could have done was put together a live DVD and sold this as a separate product. I know the footage exists; just make the DVD and make all fans happy.

WOW do they sound incredible live as well!!! If you like Creed YOU will like the album. PERIOD!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This band is terrible!","review":"Its very sad to see how music has turned into a display of depressing,boring talentless garbage like this.I remember when you actually had to have talent to be a musician.Ratt,L.A.guns,GnR,Skid Row,now those are REAL bands.Creed is about a step up from Nirvana!Scott Stapp is a stupid loser who has the most annoying,monotone voice with no range at all.I don't know how you can call this guy a singer.The guitarist plays like a beginner and couldn't play a solo or any lead for that matter if his miserable life depended on it.Typical garbage from a typical band of recent years,no balls,no hooks,no talent and no longevity.I can't imagine how anyone could listen to this band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IS SCOTT STAPP ERASING MY REVIEWS!","review":"I think that I have written my third review of this horrible band so I hope that this one is a charm! It's possible that these guys might be the biggest reason for the downfall of good rock music period! EVERYTHING about this band from the music to their attitude wreaked of arogance. And they along with their label sold this turd to the american public, and to top it off people ate it up!

I love their style, and i'm glad to see Mark Tremonti continuing to lead from the axe in Alter Bridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mixture of songs for their 3 cds","review":"I've always loved Creed. Scott Stapp's voice is very distinct which is good if you are going to be sucessful. Although, everyone seems to compare them to Pearl Jam I just don't see it. Maybe it's because the only Pear Jam song I've heard is the Last Kiss song which was butchered. I enjoyed how they put in the songs from all three of their cd's and it didn't seem like they were discriminating from the albums although I wish they put a couple of other songs from Human Clay and Weathered on to it it was a great cd and I enjoy it immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY CENSOR THE SONGS","review":"The word \\"god damn\\" from the song take me higher is silenced off this album. I could not believe it when I heard it or rather didn't hear it. I didn't investigate the whole album but there may be more of this on here. If you don't mind buying albums where they butcher the artist's songs then this is for you otherwise try to find the original version if it still exists. A real shame to ruin a key part of that song's emotion like that. Totally ruined the flow to have that silence there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anyone else see the problem with this.....","review":"It's so obvious, it makes me sick. CORPORATE TYRANTS TRYING TO MAKE MONEY ON A BAND WHO HAD 3 ALBUMS. Just another case of the record company trying to cash in on something that doesnt exist. That being Creed's \\"Greatest Hit's\\". No doubt about it - My Own Prison album was amazing. After that, c'mon now. I'm patiently awaiting a Creed - Mediocre Radio Hits album for early '05. Please. This is the reason why people download songs off the 'net - is because record companies treat us like crap, giving us albums like these.

There's no b-sides, or live cuts, but the hits are all here. Of course they were taking from just 3 albums, so each is well represented. \\"One\\", \\"Higher\\", \\"My Sacrifice\\", they're all here. And though we could have gotten a few more songs, this is at least 63 minutes. Plus the DVD makes up for a generic track list, and includes the videos, and some live performances. Overall I'd call it a very good hits collection. Compare them to whoever you want, Creed was still a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"please get back together!","review":"I have been a Creed fan through all 3 CDs. I love their music and feel sorry for anyone who feels the need to tear them down. I also like Pearl Jam- but it is a free world- if you don't like Creed then don't listen- but why must you down them when their music makes so many people happy? In regards to this set- I like the songs they chose, more B-sides would have been cool too. I wish they had included more live stuff however. I saw them in concert a couple of years ago and they were awesome. Not everyone sounds good live but they were incredible! I really hope they will reunite someday to give us more awesome music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album worth the buy","review":"Typical Creed music.

Good first album if you want good introduction to their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard rock at its best","review":"One of the things that puts me off most of the hard rock on the market these days is overly dark or smutty lyrics or simple lack of creativity or imagination in the song writing.I bought Nickleback's album for my wife last year and was sorely disappointed with the sexual inuendo and lack of imagination shown in most tracks.Thankfully this album is nothing like that!Creed's music is hard rock at its best. From anthems like Sacrifice to the edgy metal screamer Bullets, Creed deliver the very best of the best in this 13 track album.It's a shame this band wasn't able to stick it out into the 21st century. Their style is still contemporary and many of these songs will be familiar to FM rock radio listeners, even if the name of the band doesn't ring too many bells.If your into hard rock with meaningful themes (other than sex, suicide or cop killing) then don't let this album pass you by."},{"rating":"1","title":"greatest hits after 3 albums..rip off","review":"Why anyone would want to buy this most over-rated bands hits album is beyond me.If they had produced a body of work from say 6 or 7 albums then I might give it some credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creed The Legacy","review":"Creed sold tens of millions of albums...they are among the top grossing band...Ever. For you people that cant see that, dont bother posting. Scott Stapp has great vocals, with the band, even if he is a greedy, egotistical man. And you know what? I went to several shows, and nothing compares.

The band did the best jobthey could under scott. Now a greatest hit's cd. Now I haveto say that is silly. I have band's that have 10 cd's out nobox set or nothing. So let's be fair and let's be nice theywere a good band and if creed or scott removed the name ofgod in that song like the bible said if you can not admit yoursin's in front of man how can I in front of my father.I trying to say is if they were afraid or just not thinkinggod know's everything he will take care of it so relax andsell the cd and keep the one they did not leave out god'sname.

Soon they will be forever forgotten!Crap grunge: Creed, Stone Temple Pilots, Staind, Days Of The New, Nickelback, Alter BridgeGood grunge: Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mad SeasonCrap metal: Poison, Warrant, Quiet Riot, Twisted Sister, Winger, Bon Jovi, Killswitch Engage, As I Lay Dying, April Wine, Europe, CinderellaGood Metal: Iron Maiden, Manowar, Black Sabbath, Slayer, Megadeth, Tool, A Perfect Circle, Metallica, Alice Cooper, Pantera, Helloween, Dio, Judas Priest, Ozzy, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Nine Inch Nails etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"readers will cringe","review":"Pietrusza's portrait of the Squire is not without its flaws. Typos are too frequent. Some words, like soon and merely, are used repetitiously; Hampton L. Carson is represented as \\"Hampton L.

In addition, some readers will cringe at Pietrusza's space allocation: large sections are given over to explanations and clarifications of cases and issues where Landis's name fails to be mentioned, and substantial sections also deal with characters only peripherally associated with Landis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto-tune would have been a blessing.","review":"The instrumental tracks are faithful to the original, but the demo vocals are often under-pitch and poorly mixed - I would never use them to help students learn the songs.

But if you want to know about the war, pick another book. Michael Clapp was Commodore (permanent rank was Captain) of the amphibious assault force, the naval officer in overall command of getting the marines a soldiers ashore along with their supplies. His book, written with a colleague, is a numbing and intensive description of logistical matters liberally strewn with incomprehensible acronyms. Much muted complaining about bad communications and fuzzy organization. It's a wonder the Argentines lost! Events outside his immediate concern get little notice. Sinking of the Belgrano and its consequences merits a mere dismissal as left wing whining. There is no sense of humanity here at all. Still, one has to give credit for the enormous logistical task successfully completed at such a distance from home base. But it's easy to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Expected","review":"I liked this movie. When I saw the title and read the short blurb in the movie description, and being fans of Farrah, my wife and I decided to watch it. We liked it. It had a plot, character developement, and good dialogue. We were disappointed in the accident scene as we felt it did not seem to picture the extent of the inuury. One person's character was transparent enough that both my wife and I guessed ahead of time about him. The story also showed how motive and a goal can change a person such as wanting to keep the farm kept Frannie to her task. And she falls in love to boot. It is a decent movie and one we would recommend to anyone who wants to watch and enjoy a wholesome movie and is also a fan of Farrah's. This review is based on the movies shown on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wholesome","review":"I liked the movie because the entire family could watch - for a change, there was no nudity, profanity, etc., thank goodness! I liked the evolution of Fawcett's character, you gathered that she had been and still was, to an extent, conflicted, but evolved to be quite genuine and likeable. I loved the warmness and sensitivity portrayed by Brad Johnson's character (the strong, yet sensitive male). Bottom line the movie was wholesome, man, woman, love..... I even liked the theme song, I think it's called \\"Carolina Skies\\". Anyone know where I can get a copy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Music","review":"What an amazing difference these disks made for recorded music! Two other, less expensive, brands I've tried recently had dropouts, skips and oversaturated signals. With these Taiyo Yuden disks, the music records perfectly. I also like the white disks for writing on. I wish the white side had lines so I could write straighter, but I know that wouldn't work for people who print on them. Be careful with the cake box.

I bought this book to help me to understand the difficult anatomy of the hand, but it's just a collection of very rough line sketches reproduced on a small and grainy scale, with basically no instruction. There's no denying Bridgman was a master, but I can't get practical information out of his loose sketches. Sometimes I can't even tell what position a hand is in, much less use it as a reference. A book of photographs, or a drawing tutorial, would be a better choice for someone at the beginning or intermediate level.

They have lunch or dinner with friends, attend parties or volunteer at church. But even so, they have great amounts of time left over for introspection. Therein lies the beauty of both authors' stories. Who else could make such ordinary, uneventful lives seem interesting, even gripping?Pym treats her characters with a gentle humor, making even their foibles seem genuinely endearing. While reading \\"Less Than Angels,\\" I cared what happened to level headed Catherine and flighty Phoebe, two single women in love with the same man. Her characters are people I would like to know.

At least not on any page of this introductory volume. Maybe he becomes interesting in a subsequent volume, but this one does not inspire me to attempt to find this out.

Much different from 'backpacking' as we know it. Folks like Helen Hamlin set up camp and lived and worked miles from any sizable town, with only a small number of neighbors, if any. Life was difficult and hard, but never dangerous, if you prepared properly. Ms. Hamlin is a first time author and, as such, is not to be compared with modern, well practiced authors of our time. Still, her story is fascinating reading of a life and times that is part of the wonderful fabric of our country.

A married couple are held captive in their own home by a sadistic killer and forced to reveal \\"secrets\\" to each to survive and complete a puzzle of sin. Its an awkward combination of Saw and Captivity but with no gore to hold your attention and the two main characters seemed far to relaxed about having a serial killer watching over them. Even going as far as to pull out a board game to kill some time. WHAT?! Anyway, its a piece of garbage and the twist at the end wasn't even shocking enough to make 5 minutes of this film worth it.

But what it was, I wasn't expecting in the least bit. The story is basically your typical guy likes girl, girl likes guys friend, guys friend doesn't like girl. Love triangle, eh? Anyways, after Moemi confesses her love for Takashi young \\"dateless\\" Yota is heartbroken. This is where Ai comes in. He picks up a video of her from a video rental store for those \\"pure of heart\\" and then after his VCR malfunctions Ai comes through the TV and is dedicated to getting Yota together with Moemi. It's a great setup, as Ai is hillarius and the feelings the two express are deep. It'll be exciting the see how this one turns out as at the end of Vol. 1 there are still many unanswered questions.

It goes beyond the thesis in \\"Motherless Daughters.\\" Even if you had/have an excellent mother, and even if you like your own mothering style, I guarantee there will moments of insight for you.Most of all I marvel at Black's balance in her information; under any other writer, this book would feel like the usual blame-the-mother for all of the world's ills.

This is a good book in large part becasue Mrs. Black's insight is thoughtful and mindful. It certianly makes one think.

Double standard? Or is it an author kissing up to the next monarch and going after someone who can't defend herself.

Prince Charles is also attacked gently, but Steward maybe saved her worst venom on the lady unable to defend her self anymore. God forbid she fall from favour with the living.

His take on the world explains Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, Bill Gates and the Unabomber, without ever taking them on specifically. This book should be used in every philosophy class, and ethics class as well. Backman is the voice of reason in an age contolled by rhetoric.

If you thought chess was only for braniacs, this movie will show you otherwise. It is very much a sport. In fact, many very good athletes who also play chess will tell you that a chess tournament is physically more draining than many sport competitions. I would certainly agree.The tournament play is realistic as is the jaunts to chess clubs in Manhattan and Washington Square, which I visit as often as I can when we go to New York City. The stress, fun, elation, effort, exhaustion, sound and everything about the tournaments are great.

We concluded that the father/son story is really one of the more insignificant (still important, just not /as/ important) themes of the movie.Combine that with superb acting from Kingsly, Fishburn, Mantegna, and the young Max Pomeranc, and this movie should be required viewing for everyone of any age. And let me restress the fine acting from Pomeranc (who plays the child chess prodigy).

It has become one of the (few) books that I read repeatedly, once every couple of years. It's a really well-written, grown-up fairy tale. I am glad to see that it is still in print.I would also HIGHLY recomment Sunshine, by Robin McKinley, and War for the Oaks, by Emma Bull (the only other fantasy \\"comfort reads\\" that I come back to again and again)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"This was a brilliant faery tale, told as one should be. The story is full of quests, meandering through woods and mountains, wizards gardens and terrifying castles. The characters are unexpected but so fitting for the story. What I love about this book is that the story is not as straightforward as you might think; just when you're sure the Quest is over, you realize there are 100 pages left to go and are constantly surprised by the authors ingenuity and yet the simplicity is stunning. Wonderful book, a must-read for those who love fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover art is its best feature","review":"And, to be honest, that's the reason I bought the book - I was bored and liked the cover.

I first read this book many years ago and I've reread it so many times I have worn out my original hardback. Mary Brown captures perfectly the trials and tribulations of a small band of misfit adventurers who struggle to overcome their individual debilities - and with the support of their magical friends, break the witch's curse forever! My favorite authors include Stephen Donaldson, Mercedes Lackey, and ofcourse J.R.R. Tolkien. In THE UNLIKELY ONES, Mary Brown has created intriguing and likeable characters; human, animal and magical, who struggle to overcome overwhelming obstacles and their own inner demons to show us that love and friendship can overcome anything! This is a charming tale filled with love; poignant and strong. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A1 Cardone A1C58-Water Pump","review":"I find this product to be very good.

The lead singer's voice is even \\"Sting-esque\\", but their own originality makes it a great, fresh update of one of the best sounds of the 80s.I enjoyed the whole album.

Tree 63 is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like looking straight into heaven.","review":"There are no words for this cd. I don't think that I have ever owned a cd that brings you this close to God. So many christian groups these days sing the same lyrics over and over, and the songs all begin to melt together, but with Tree63, the songs are all different and unique. They sing with such truth and conviction, and seem to really touch people's hearts.

The sound of this CD is very upbeat and happy, which is infectious in both a good way and a bad way. For the most part Tree gives us a fresh, enjoyable sound, but this type of music always tends to get a little annoying after you've heard it a lot. Tree is a very talented band that definitely has a future in the States. They are already very successful in South Africa (their home country) where they have hits even on secular rock stations. I enjoy this CD and will continue to, and I think you will too. It is a good idea to get in on this band early because they very well might get big once they get better known. The best song on the disc is clearly Treasure, which is an excellent song. There are also some other good songs. Overall, a good, happy, and definitely worshipful CD which is worth a listen!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"This album is so unbelievable. The music is so original and the words really stick in your heart. If any open-minded person listened to this album they would no longer be so close-minded to todays Christian rock.

Take a look at the Sonic Impact, about twice the cost as the TuneBox but, it will give you 5X the sound quality.

I enjoyed it, but have since given it away, and no longer have access to it. It is a haunting, mesmerizing tale of lost and found self. The only thing that continues to nag at my conscience is the notion of him finding his wife, and then his daughter, whom he finally has sex with. They are about the same age in this scenario, but there is something really lewd about that aspect of the story. For that reason, I wanted nothing further to do with the book, and ultimately gave it away. The movie was equally repulsive in regards to the incest element. Without that aspect, it would have been a fun read and a funner movie. I noticed in one of the above reviews, someone referred to it as non-fiction. Excuse me!

However, it dissapointed me to the fact that as i got later on into the book, in the last several chapters, it had started to get predictable, and finally the last 2 or 3 chapters were obvious in what was going to happen..

The writing is just as simplistic as the flow of the story. The transitions are lean and need more explanation. For example, at one point we have Peter totally enthralled with finding more about his reincarnation. Then he is ready to toss the towel and go home. The only link that connects both situations is a brief mention that he had been canvassing neighborhoods for six days, with no luck.

Drew Barrymore plays the Lolita-esque Ivy, who will apparently stop at nothing to .... well, it's not that clear what Ivy wants exactly, only that she's willing to seduce quite a few people to get it. The plot is not this film's best asset, but who cares? Not most fans of this film, who are perfectly content to watch the talented and sexy Drew Barrymore in this most unlikely come-back role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb, dumb, dumb","review":"I will watch anything in which my favorite actress, Drew Barrymore, appears. But this movie is for Drew fans only. The plot is hopelessly lame, telling of the nefarious influence of bad girl Drew on an improbably wealthy Beverly Hills family. There is almost no plot, little of value in the way of character development, and it is pretentious throughout. And unless you're watching the movie when you're about to drop off to sleep, you might find yourself laughing at quite a bit of it. However, the acting on the part of the two principals, Sylvie (Sara Gilbert) and Ivy (Drew), is good--and for that I'll give one star.The other star I give just for the inspired casting of Drew in the Ivy role. Her classical beauty contrasts nicely with the vixen she is recreating. And Drew is in nearly every scene--an added bonus.

Barrymore plays Ivy, a girl from the wrong side of that tracks who has Lolita-esque ways of getting what she wants. Sara Gilbert (\\"Roseanne\\") plays an awkward teen from a rich family who makes the mistake of befriending Ivy and falls victim to her machinations. Tom Skerritt and Cheryl Ladd play the rich parents who also get drawn into Ivy's web of deceit. The film is predictable, you know what's going to happen when Ivy displays her limber body in front of the rich dad, but Barrymore's performance provides the film's heat and demonstrates a turning point in Barrymore's career of her talent actually carrying some weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical B movie, well acted but stupid plot","review":"Don't watch it for the plot. Overall, there is little characterization other than the two main actresses. If you're lookign for an erotic movie, there is too much violence and not enough sex.

It's so horrendous you could punish your kids by making them sit through it.All I can figure is someone went to Sara Gilbert and said, \\"Hey, how'd you like to make the leap from sit-com to film?\\" Then that same someone went and promised Tom Skerritt a lot of money to appear as a TMJ suffering sexually sicko father. And of course aging '70's starlet Cheryl Ladd did the film because she'd been out of the limelight a while, and then that leaves Drew Barrymore, who more or less played herself in those wilderness years of her career.Poison Ivy stinks.

The curiosity is Cheryl Ladd was the Charlie's Angels Blondie for quite a longtime and everybody knows who Drew became these recent years ;) About the movie, well Not much to say and it's the major problem to it.It will look like the movie is damn too long !

I even felt sorry for the father who had to pay such a heavy price for a few good rolls in the hay. Moral of the story, don't get involved with your kid's friends,it might kill you. I also thoght Cheryl Ladd's character was nothing but a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below-average","review":"The only real good thing about the movie was it's well-cast characters, good performances, and the sex(which you can find more intriguing in Basic Instinct). Otherwise it contains extremely unappealing character(especially Skerrit, who starts to make love to Ivy even when he knows his daughter's in the hospital and even when his wife is dead;I wished Gilbert would have pushed him out the window) and silliness sink it deeply. Not much plot as well, with the familiar who's-sleeping-with-who melodrama. Ther is some character development, but it's also mean-spirited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death Trap","review":"Death Trap.

Michael Caine is excellent as the mystery playwright who'd kill for a hit play. Christopher Reeve matches him all the way as the former student who's just written such a play. Dyan Cannon is amusing as Caine's overly hysterical wife.While the plot has more twists and turns than you'd like to count, it's all energetically made and well acted and just when you think you've figured it out...guess again.I'd like to recommend to future buyers to also purchase the wonderful play by Ira Levin.

It is indeed a film with great acting, and a plot with many unpredictable twists and turns. Reeve gives an impressive performance as Cain's gay lover, and the plot has so many twists that I was guessing til the very end what the outcome would be.

The hole makes it appear that it would be universal but learned the hard way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Made from spring steel can't be bent easily, so there is no way to adjust the level of the detector. When clipped on the visor the detector points down in front of the vehicle. Which makes it pretty much worhless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for Whistler products","review":"When I bought my Whistler Radar detector recently, this visor clip wasrecommended to go with it as a bundle sort of deal. This visor clip isnot made for the Whistler and will not work. I wasted $10.00 on it. End of review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit the Whistler","review":"Don't waste your money buying this with the Whistler. It does not fit the Whistler and it's not worth packing it up and sending it back since return shipping and my time is worth more than $11.00. Amazon should test items before combining them to be sure they are compatible. I will not trust them in the future about this after this experience. The Whister comes with a windshield mount so you don't need to order another one- which they also recommend. Don't get taken like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not using it!","review":"When you insert the clip into the RD. Then try to install or hook onto your visor. I crushess the buttons and it makes the screen of the RD not visible. Good try but not useful. Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"I have had clips previously that were a nightmare to reassemble if they came apart. Also if someone pulled down on the visor while the detector was still attached the clip would never be the same (loose and turning). This one is one piece,hooks onto the visor tight and is easy to attach to the detector once you figure why they put the slot in it. I'm using it on a beltronics and it fits like it was made for it. One thing though, if your going to depend on the rear feature of your detector and your visor is real soft it might cover the receiver for the rear detector. I have it on my liberty and I still get my rear signals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I was really hoping that this would solve the problem I have in the winter time (detector falling off from the windshield) but unfortunately it turned out to be a piece of junk. I agree with one of the previous reviewers that this can leave a permanent mark on your visor. It also eliminates the detection of laser (at least laser coming from behind since the sensor is usually on top of the detector). I saw a radar detector mount that you place on your dash, perhaps that works better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"end out dont even need this....","review":"for your escort 9500ix All you need is just the Direct Wire Power Cord the visor will block the GPS on this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swindle and Handling","review":"The price for the item seemed marvelous until I reviewed the total amount! the vendor was charging about $6.95 for S&H! well, if the item is that heavy and gentle that it costs that much to ship it and handle it, I am not interested.

I have decided not to use it, I think it is too tight against the visor and may cause damage to the visor."},{"rating":"2","title":"an apology for Cao Dai","review":"This book is a nearly-proselytizing apology for the Cao Dai religion, popular in southern Vietnam. Cao Dai is a fascinating religion, and this is one evidence of it. It includes a conversation between the spirit of Victor Hugo and a Cao Dai leader in 1930, illustrations of symbolic hand gestures and other symbols, common prayers and vows, and Hum Dac Bui's presentation of Cao Dai philosophy. In short, it is an incredible primary source. But if you want an outside perspective, look elsewhere. I've heard that Victor Oliver's book \\"Caodai Spiritism\\" is good, but I haven't read it. Joyce Werner's \\"Peasant Politics and Religious Sectarianism\\" is a Yale doctoral thesis, an account of the spread and popularity of Cao Dai. Graham Greene considered converting to Cao Dai but became disillusioned; he gives his interesting, humorous perspective in \\"The Quiet American,\\" which I recommend for literary reasons as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good resource....","review":"One of the few works in English that explores this amazing spiritual tradition.

The only problem with it was the belt that goes around the waist to hold the costume together was too SMALL, and without it the costume doesn't come together. Just be prepared to find something to accommodate. Other than that, really liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother with this one.","review":"I thought that this would be better quality. It was very disappointing. It is made like the cheap one time wear costumes from Walmart that you get for Halloween. It also ran small. I would have to go up 2 sizes to get a descent fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't use it","review":"Very poor product. Another product that is not the same as the advertised item. The undergarment is very flimsy, the armor, which appears to be of good quality in the picture, is certainly not quality and is permanently creased and not ironable. The shoulder pads have a crease through the top of the shoulder and look terrible. The wrist and ankle pads are much smaller than you see in the picture and the straps are paper-thin plastic.My 9 year old son refused to wear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor sizing, inconvenient laces, but still fun for the boy","review":"I thought this would be perfect for my four-year old son. I ordered the child's small, for ages 4-6. The pants were WAY too big for my son and the imitation leather vest came down almost to his ankles. I ended up taking scissors to the vest and trimming it to a manageable size and tucking the pants into his socks. It still doesn't look quite right, but it's acceptable. The arm and leg \\"armor\\" uses laces. The laces are actually just thin strips of ribbon and were very difficult to thread through the eyelets and tie. It's difficult to get the laces tight enough to hold the armor in place, but not too tight to bother the boy. My son could barely wait for me to finish lacing and tying his armor the day the costume arrived. On Halloween, we didn't bother with the arm and leg armor. The vest and belt still make the ninja costume look cool and my son is still putting on the costume nearly every day, even though Halloween was over a week ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was way too small for my 10 year old.","review":"I ordered this in the largest size they offered. A child's large. It was skin tight on my 10 year old son and the pants and sleeves were too short. Don't be fooled, this is more like a child's small/medium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ekco Steak Knives","review":"We were in need of some new steak knife sized knives.

There was one possible, but then you have to ask the question: What's wrong with him that he hangs out with all these whackos? The protagonist is the worst; I can't believe anyone could care about her, or what she does, or why. The flaccid and obscure preamble should have warned me. No one does anything remotely believable from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard going","review":"This book jumps around so much at the beginning that I finally had to abandon it. Perhaps she is an acquired taste, but my first thought (having never read anything of hers before) was that she was not a good writer. The scenes in the first three chapters are totally disjointed. I'm sure she was going somewhere, but I did not have the patience to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Toy! Realistic plane sounds! :)","review":"My son absolutely loves this toy. (But not as much as my husband who is a pilot.) When my son holds the nose of the plane up (during the takeoff and climb phase of the \\"flight\\") the sound of engine thrust increases - just like on a real plane. Same for when the nose is down (during the descent and approach phase of the \\"flight\\".) And when he holds the plane to the left or right - only the left or right light of the plane flashes. It's adorable! My son loves to pretend he is flying \\"like Daddy\\" and my husband loves to teach him the proper terms for all of the sounds.The pilot has an english accent when saying \\"This is your Captain speaking, Please fasten your seatbelts and prepare for takeoff.\\" Very cute. The only problem I have is that the hatch on the back of the plane that holds the luggage keeps falling off. Otherwise - this is an *excellent* toy that my son plays with every day. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched....and deserving of the title","review":"I bought a four-pack of dinosaur themed movies about a year and a half ago. One of them was Planet of Dinosaurs, a movie ripe for Mystery Science Theater 3000 brutalizing. It had overbearing Wendy Carlos electronic score, acting obviously done after a shot of Nyquil and some great Harryhausen-esque stop motion animation. And my five year old son loved it. Dinosaurs and Space Ships! And none of that pesky long-running dialogue to get in the way of Tyranasaurus eating annoying semi-villians. What more could a five year old want?This movie is beyond wretched. It takes a D-minus movie, extracts the stop motion animation and adds Master Thespian acting shot on video. It's high school freshman with camcorder caliber.If you collect Roger Corman films and have a soft spot, you might be able to get a snicker out this. Otherwise, you could die peacefully without ever having experienced this move.Spend the $$$$ and just get Planet of Dinosaurs (also available at Amazon)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable Portable Drive","review":"I purchased this portable drive for two reasons [1] to backup my desktop files, and [2] to transfer files from my desktop to my laptop.The drive worked once, allowing me to copy all my data files (about 35GB) from my desktop (to the portable drive). Now I can't get this thing to power up, regardless of whether I use a single USB 2.0 port or single USB 1.0 port connection, or use the \\"Y\\" USB cable that comes with it to draw power from two source USB connections. My desktop is an older DELL desktop, but my laptop is a gaming XPS DELL. I can't get this thing to power up on either machine. This thing is a huge disappointment. I should have gone with another IOMEGA portable - at least that one never failed and powers up ever time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"In my opinion, this latest CD is even better than her last one and I thought her last one was great also. In addition to being stunningly beautiful, Monica Naranjo also has an equally beautiful voice. Listening to \\"Amame o Dejame\\" puts me in a trance from listening to her beautiful strong voice while songs such as \\"Pantera en Libertad\\" have me singing and dancing along to the dance-club rythms which remind of partying in clubs south of the border. In my opinion it's a definately worth checking out.?Compralo ya!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars Don't do this CD justice....","review":"Monica Naranjo has a beautiful voice.

Being in sixth grade, homework expectations have been kicked up a notch from elementary school. His penmanship isn't the best...this discourages him from writing of any sort. He loves the computer and typing, electronic gadgets of any kind, so I hoped this organizer would be an incentive to keep better track of his homework assignments. It worked!!! He loves typing in the scheduler, and he sets the alarm to remind himself that it's homework time! The built in radio has proved useful as entertainment on the bus ride home.

I tried 2 different digitals and either I could not get an angle that I could read it or it just did not work with all the different metal and magnets around the inside of an RV. This compass has enough adjustments to compensate for metals/magnets and it is easy to read and reasonably accurate. It's a plastic shell but what isn't these days.

The book is best used as a reference manual. Want to buy your first house? Look up the chapter on that. Broke and trying to decide which of your many debts is the most important to pay off first? Look it up in here. The advice is solid and given in enough detail to be of use. This is the kind of book to hang onto for your twenties and early thirties, as its usefulness is flexible with your stage in life.The reason why I gave this book only four stars is because most (all?) of the advice stems from when you're already in debt (loans, car payments, etc.) and how to manage it. I think that it would have been useful to know how to avoid being in debt in the first place. Yes, some debt is good, but it builds up quickly if you don't keep it in check and she doesn't really discuss how to keep it in check.Overall, highly recommended.

And a large portion of the book is dedicated to student loans, the other to car and home purchases, all things I have already made. I am not old, but not near that young either (27).

Young, Fabulous & Broke provides all the information you need to begin a financial life. Orman covers everything from exactly what a FICO score is to managing a student loan to buying your first home. She uses simple terms and real life explanations. Her approach is matter of fact yet inspiring. The financial mistakes made by young upstarts can be very costly. A couple percentage points on a car loan or a couple late credit card payments don't seem important when you're 24 but Ms. Orman does a wonderful job explaining why these things matter and how mismanaging them will effect your future.Even those who think they have everything under control will find this book useful. This is definately a reference tool I will keep for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book if you don't know where to start!","review":"I love Suze's non-fluff approach. She tells it how it is. Feel free to read ahead in the book, but don't allow yourself to get overwhelmed if you decide to read the chapter on buying a house and you're sitting in front of a pile of unpaid bills. I bought this book about 4 years ago when I was $20K+ in debt and we just purchased our first house this past year. I still have some \\"good\\" debt (student loans!) but I feel like I am moving forward with my life (marriage, babies, etc.) and this book was a huge help in that! I highly recommend this book. In fact, I plan on giving my copy to my younger sister!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Money book even the Older, Fabulous & Broke can use","review":"It does not take much to filter the good stuff in this book, true it is written for the younger set, but us older still financially \\"stupid\\" can get lots of important insights out of this book.

Still, I was able to glean invaluable information and recommendations from Orman on basic personal finance dilemmas that are new to me. She's entertaining to read and you can read the book very easily (read it on a roundtrip flight between Boston and Philly).This is a basic introduction to personal finance for the young adult- perfect for recent grads on their own for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is definitely helping me get all my ducks in a row!","review":"Let's face it, being young, fabulous and broke seems to be a sign of the times and most of us just want to put our heads in the sand and forget about our mounting student loan debt, credit card debt, and lack of a secure financial future via a great-paying job or the prospect of social security. Suze uses this book to yank our heads out of the ground, shake the sand off and point us CLEARLY in the right directions to take financial responsibility of our future and reconcile it with our sordid, debt-filled past. She does this in plain speech that is neither patronizing or condescending. Included with the book is an access code to a personalized online action planner that is tailored to help you take those scary first steps towards taking responsibility for improving your financial situation. I trust her judgement and would highly recommend this book to anyone who is young, fabulous and broke (but wants to ditch that last part.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT ELSE, BUT ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!!!","review":"This book gave me more than financial advice; it gave me hope and promise and the self-confidence that I can become young, fabulous, and no longer broke. Through the clear writing in this book, Suze Orman made the task of getting out of debt seem attainable for me (something that otherwise seemed completely overwhelming). And maybe some people think that it's simple, but evidently that's what it needs to be, because no other financial jargain ever made sense to me before I read this book. Suze Orman is the one who, through her \\"fabulous\\" advice, makes it simple. I have recommended this book to my friends and my family and now to people I don't even know. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suze Orman is Fabulous!","review":"It's about time someone smart AND funny wrote a money book targeted toward the younger generations! This should be a required gift for all high school graduates PRIOR to leaving for college...I know it would have benefitted me greatly! Suze gives easy to understand advice on everything from FICO scores to mortgages to car payments, and everything in between. I knew a lot of this information because by the time I bought the book (a year after college graduation), I had bought a car and all but destroyed my FICO score; however, her advice has helped me begin the process of fixing my defunct score. This book is chalk full of fabulous advice for our generation...buy this now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rock CD this year.","review":"This is the best rock CD I've bought this year.

It is a skin-deep look at the topic, and other than the notion that people are not \\"human resources to be consumed\\" but \\"human capital to invest in\\" there is little of note in this book. I heartily agree with the reviewer who notes that the book reads like a homework assignment written by accountants. If you are looking for sage advice on how to \\"Attract, Manage and Retain\\" (and Inspire) people to/in your organization, then I suggest you read biographies of great leaders, good literature, or books written by professionals in the field of organizational development and psychology.

The author structured the book in such a way that it appeals to all learning styles--visual, auditory (using the audio CD or tape), and even movement (using the accompanying CD interactive exercises).

So I ordered Peggy Leonard's Quick and Easy Medical Terminology to better learn the terminlogy myself over the summer. I'm half way through it and it's awesome. I've learned so much more with this book. It is easy, laid out well and thoroughly teaches the basics. Peggy Leonard keeps it interesting too. The audio tape and CD Rom is also helpful.

The thinness is very cool.However, my band is starting to come apart after only four uses. I am very careful with my things and do not abuse them. I would expect a metal band to last a long time, but this one is coming apart on one side where it's welded to the bracket that holds the pin to the case.I called Skagen in NV and they said \\"sorry, we only warrant the movement, not the band.\\" After pointing out that I expected the band to last more that four days, the lady transferred me to someone's voicemail in order to get rid of me.

I paid $100 for it from one of the department stores. From the day I bought it the watch has lost about 10 to 15 minutes a day. I thought it was the battery so I replaced it for $10 but that didn't help. In order to get it repaired I had to send it to them via special delivery which cost me $12 more. I checked my mail today and they sent me a letter asking for $8.95 for the cost of repairs or else I won't get the watch back. I'm trying to figure out why I'm being asked to pay for repairs for a watch that is clearly under warranty. I'll be calling them tomorow to find out.

It is an ongoing problem.Today I went outside. The crystal broke spontaneously as soon as the cold air hit the face.The watch looks nice, but it is poorly made.

At the same time, rigor and theory are not sacrificed in any way. In fact, detailed yet easy-to-read proofs are ubiquitous, and are almost always accompanied by examples using the software.The book comes full circle in the finale with an exposition of the SVD. In the process, it brings together concepts described throughout the book.In summary: As a working professional in computer imaging, I enjoy this book as my standard linear algebra text.

It is a reprint of the hardcover 1999 or 2000 editions targeting Mathematica 3. While the text contains helpful applications of linear algebra to chemistry and electronics, references to deprecated features of Mathematica make the learning experience expensive in time and one resorts to the bundled or online documentation of Mathematica anyway. Images of the user interface are a little grainy and dark, while pictures of gui elements such as palettes are plain awful.I understand one can still use the book to augur some sense out of Mathematica 7+in regards to Linear Algebra but I would of hoped that the books \\"currentness\\" was a little more advertised and a little less expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This product was not made by the Christopher Williams that I thought it would be.

It's solar, it's pink, it's whimsical.It could have been an integral part of my earthquake kit (we do live in Los Angeles).But it didn't really work for me. First off, charging it in the car is pointless and slow. It requires direct sunlight so even a tree giving some shade makes it not charge. Secondly, it takes about eight hours to charge fully, that means you have to follow the sun for eight hours.Unless you live in a yurt, you probably only get a few hours of sunlight from each window. Which brings me to my third point.It charges best when left outside.Nope, it's a $90 item and I don't want to leave it lying around outside.I get that it's hip to be green and pink is fun and playful, the design it beautiful and the freebies are flowing with these (everyone at fashion week LA got one) but it just doesn't do what it's supposed to do.I'll wait for the second generation, hopefully it will work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree this product is JUNK","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer. I got my Solio in December and it only charged via the sun twice. After that, even after leaving the Solio in the sun for days it won't charge.

This is a solid sprayer with a brass wand and nozzle. The nozzle puts out a good pattern and has a good range of adjustment. The pump is fairly efficient and seals well to the tank. The handle is reasonably comfortable to carry around the full sprayer. Hudson has repair parts to keep the unit going if something does fail. The two negatives that I see are that the tank pickup doesn't have a filter and I don't like the free positioning valve handle. I would prefer that the valve handle be fixed to the wand body.

But I wanted something that would help me get through this four hour opera without falling asleep. The musical examples were not sufficient. There are apparently recurring leitmotifs that correspond to Tristan, Isolde, the love portion and other elements of the story. They were mentioned but not explicitly pointed out.

Her books have always been hard to put down, always good reads. 'You Belong to Me' is a really creepy story of a Florida Highway Patrolman who despises women in general yet seems completely obsessed with the two in his life--his wife and his mistress. His position of authority only makes this book that much scarier--to think that a cop would pull you over and then be able to do whatever he wanted to do and you would be completely helpless.

The tabs do pull out easily so you can see the whole picture. They are incredibly difficult to get back into the sleeve since the acetate sheets get caught on the cutout pictures. It is also very easy for a child to pull the entire tab all the way out of the book which exposes the staples used to connect the acetate to the cardboard tab.

Erroll was my inspiration (and still is, although he's no longer with us).One point I failed to mention is that Mr. Garner loved to riddle his adoring fans by beginning a tune with an off-beat 60-second prelude.

Smoke-filled nightclubs with the tinkling of martini glasses and of the piano. Better yet, background music for some Bogart film noir of the 1950's. That is what the jazz piano of Mr. Errol Garner reminds me of. And it seems natural to believe in those dream-like scenarios mentioned above as Garner's heyday was in the 1950s when jazz was going through some turns and it needed to rest, a little, on his capable shoulders. I need only add, since this concert took place in Carmel, California in 1955, that this is one of the few times that the future mayor of Carmel, actor/director Clint Eastwood, and I can agree on something. He has used Garner's work as background in more than one of his films. Hell, he may have been in the audience for this one.

Of course, we couldn't avoid mentionning talking about \\"Concert By The Sea\\" and I was more than surprised to learn that he wasn't happy with the LP. He was unhappy with the choice of the tunes.As an example, he wouldhave loved that his rendition of \\"Bernie's Tune\\" had been rejected against his will.So I strongly recommend that people wait for a complete issue, specially considering that \\"the best is yet to come\\" and will be within 5 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Erroll's best album - best of talent and performance.","review":"I am Brazilian, and have been a fan of Erroll Garner's music for over 35 years.

However, Erroll was extremely inspired that night, which resulted on the unique addition of his widely recognized talent to the best average performance of all albums.

The D200 Auto WB setting has a warm bias and that adding +2 compnsation to make it cooler would almost equal the WB done on the expodisc. During indoor and low light photography with warm bulbs on, the expodisc WB appears to be very warm and that using the tungsten WB setting of my D200 is much much better in achieving a much better color temperature. I think expodisc setting has the advantage during daytime photography whether indoor or outdoor but during night light, I find my D200 preset values much more accurate!

It gives you very accurate custom white balance readings. The problem is that you have to shoot the sample image back into the light source, which is not always possible to do unless you are in a studio or controlled location shoot. For scenics it is not very practical. I used it a few times but it mostly sits in my bag now. It's too much money for something that you don't use because it is a hassle. I am open to suggestions from other users if I am making it unecessarily complex or am misunderstanding how it is supposed to be used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great neutralizer","review":"Excellent for it's intended purpose of neutralizing light color casts. As there is no camera that will read whether light is distributed evenly over any given scene the proposed use of setting the exposure through the Disc is a mute point. In shooting hundreds of room scenes of furniture, people etc there are serious shifts in light balance across any given area. Most photographers know it, but many have forgotten - or never knew it. The light meter is still king of room lighting setup because it will tell you where extra, or less light is needed.

The face of the watch holds up well to any scratches or scuff marks.

It arrived broken, and looking at why it was broken, I found that it looked like the metal watch band was just glued onto a metal tab that was connected to the watch. Very disappointing to see a corner like that cut, the band could of been much sturdier and better secured than with glue. Clearly Skagen cares more about making a stylish watch than they do about making a good product. I would not suggest anyone buy this watch, and I would be hesitant of any of their other watches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I imagined","review":"I bought this watch as a daily wearer.

All the sounds that made the debut great are still present here, and the production sounds even better, which was already awesome. The songs on here are better written, and pack a little more puch commercially, but we all know the story of the band and how they never achieved any fame. Please don't let that deter you though, this record is awesome. Songs like \\"Rockin' on Heaven's Door\\", \\"Miss Mystery\\", \\"Without Love\\" and \\"Two Wrongs (Don't Make It Love)\\" are awesome, however, there is a tiny bit of filler throughout the remainder of the record.If you dig 80's hard rock or metal in any way, or just really like these guys, definitely check this record out.

I've never given a one-star rating to anything before, but I do here as a warning: These books are violent and could be profoundly disturbing to some young children, as the world created here is one in which no adult can be trusted, and innocent children are beaten, tortured and murdered. As an advocate for kids, just let me say, without attacking the poorly written books further, that there are hundreds of books out there that are appropriate for young readers. Keep searching, regardless of what others may have said about the series--or check it out from a library and read the books (you can skim one in about 30 minutes) before you make the critical decision to put one into the hands of a malleable mind.

Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great books - just not for kids","review":"Great writing - very vivid images - very ingrossing stories. I loved the books. But I am 47 years old. If you wouldn't let your kids watch an R rated movie, think hard before you let them read these books.These books are much more realistic and frightening than would be appropriate for children. And the messages are terrifying. In the first book of the series, the protagonist is 'tested' by 'good adults' with fear and intimidation. 'Bad children' are killed. Errors are punished with death. I figured the sadness would let up as the book series continued, but it doesn't.This is heavy stuff, even for an adult, let alone a child. I think the author is gifted, and the books are well written - but not for kids. Please read these and think about them from a child's perspective before you let your kids read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for all ages","review":"At first glance, these books seem like just another young-adult sci-fi series. However, they are so well written and the concept is so believable that the series truly stands apart from the rest. Haddix has created characters that I can relate with (and I'm 22!). Discussions about the first three books with other college students revealed that all of us were swept away and could not put down the stories - some of us even gave up sleep to finish because we couldn't put them down!Overall, I would recommend this series to any gender, any age, anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"This is a delightful read, interspersed with luscious-sounding recipes. Susan Loomis paints interesting word pictures and conjures up a feeling of warmth and harmony that I found very pleasant. I am looking forward to trying the recipe for her grandmother's rolls, with which she won the hearts of the florists across the street. Enchanting story!One small quibble: the book could use additional editing, the lack of which can be distracting.

I'm a Francophile. It normally doesn't take much quaint Frenchyness to please me, but somehow this book completely lacks it. I just read over some of the low-scoring reviews and feel I have permission to not even finish it. It's just boring! The first several evenings of reading the book, my impression was, \\"she's not a very good writer.\\" I doubted myself, \\"she's a successful writer, how can this be?\\" I don't know. Here's how I'd sum it up: her stories don't transport one to France. I really don't care about how \\"luxurious\\" it feels walking on the in-floor heating in her house. The most interesting thing about this book (I bought a used copy) was the business cards and boarding pass (not for a flight to France, sadly) that fell from it's pages. TryFrom Here, You Can't See Paris: Seasons of a French Village and Its Restaurantby Michael S. Sanders, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cook in France","review":"What fun to go to France, retore an old building and open a cooking school. \\"On Rue Tatin\\" is a great read for anyone who loves France and loves to cook. It makes me want to enrole in the cooking school tomorrow which one can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hey everone--look at my beautiful life!\\"","review":"Lommis does a nice job of describing the details of life in Louviers, providing some pleasant \\"escapist\\" leisure reading for Francophiles like myself. The book has some good French country recipes, but overall is a disappointing Peter Mayle derivative that fails to show us anything new or interesting about France.And when Loomis isn't rehashing the now-trite cliches of adjusting to living in France (driving habits; pharmacists; bureaucracy; difficulties in renovating a house; etc. etc.), she's busy convincing us how happy and successful she is. Her self-congratulatory tone quickly became tiresome after the first few chapters--her perfect/beautiful/wonderful/joyous/lovely friends, family, and house were just a little too \\"Martha Stewart\\" for me. Yuk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book searching for a category","review":"On a scale of 1 to 10, I give On Rue Tatin a 4. I think my main objection is that I purchased it thinking it was a book about France and food as experienced by the author and her family. Unfortunately, it's much more a book about the author who just happens to be living in France.In the end, I'm not sure if On Rue Tatin should be classified as a travel book or a memoir because it does not shine in either category. It fails as a travel book because the author is too self-absorbed to give you any feel for the region of France she called home, and it fails as a memoir because the author's life, at least as related in the book, is far from interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delicious tale","review":"This book is delightful glimpse into the life of an American family living in Normandy France. Loomis' tale of her culinary adventures mixed with generous helpings of the French culture, make a recipe for a delicious story. The easy-to-follow recipes are simple to make but have unique twists for such Normandy classics as Clafoutis and Tarte Tatin."},{"rating":"1","title":"She should have stayed at home","review":"I'm afraid I really disliked this book - I felt that the author was very negative about the majority of French people that she met, and seemed to find more to criticise than to praise. It seemed that a lot of the problems she encountered were generated by her own lack of tact and understanding . I wonder why she moved to live in France when she disapproved of so much. (And I didn't find her recipes very authentic - I have never been served the sort of things she cooks in any restaurant in France, thank goodness)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicieux","review":"Being a Francophile of the highest order I devoured Susan Herrmann Loomis' book avariciously. She captures the joys and pitfalls of living and working in Normandy with charm, wit and delicious recipes. Susan - please write some more; as a writer Ms Loomis encapsulates all that I aspire to food and travel - is there more to life?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book may not be what you are expecting...","review":"A few important words of disclosure about this book: From the title, you might expect that this is the story of someone who worked in a french restaurant. It isn't. The author isn't actually a chef--she is an American housewife who writes cookbooks. Also, the author is (or was) a vegitarian and organic food nut who grows her own lettuce so don't expect many stories about duck confit, truffle studded chicken, etc. in the tradition of Peter Mayle.In fact, this book probably owes its existence to Peter Mayle's success. Unlike Mayle, however, Hermann Loomis seems more interested in writing about herself and her child than France.The book is not particularly well written (or edited) and almost seems like notes for a book. And I was hoping for a French \\"Kitchen Confidential\\". That said, it is pleasant light reading that offers a few insights into life in France. And I'll probably try to one of the dessert recipies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant and entertaining","review":"Okay, this is not a book to knock yuour socks off, but other reviewers have been a tad demanding in asking it to be one. It comforted me with apples. It is pleasant, amusing, well-written and extremely cosy reading. The recipes work; the anecdotes are slight but entertaining. Human life is here, though this ain't Victor Hugo.The genre of buying-a-French-wreck is getting a little shopworn, but I certainly preferred this to Peter Mayle's tiresome and tiring showing-off. It makes a good companion to the fine cookbook Loomis apparently wrote at the time covered by this book (French Farmhouse Cooking). I recommend this to all who enjoy Normandy, food and France."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Club Choice","review":"Being interested in cooking, I enjoyed trying some of the recipes..Had an interesting Book Club discussion on this book. Main question was \\"Why was Husband left so much in the background? He worked his brains out, but got very little recognition! Enjoyed the humorous neighbors."},{"rating":"2","title":"in Normandy","review":"Nice memoir from Loomis, who now teaches cooking in the French village of Louviers in Normandy.She describes her time in Paris at culinary school, her marriage and their move to Louviers, where she and her husband restored an old convent in the center of town. I loved reading about life (and renovation) in a small village in France (the trials and the joys) and how she started to teach cooking.This was good reading and lots of recipes too.There were some glitches and not-so-great writing in the book --- which could have easily been taken care of with better editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than most food expatriate tales","review":"On Rue Tatin by Susan Loomis is in the mold of the Peter Mayle and In Tuscany travel/food book but I found it very enjoyable, quite believable, well written and filled with usuable recipes. She tells of her training as a chef and food writer and the familys struggle to turn a run down convent in Normandy into a liveable home and working location for herself, a food writer and her husband, a sculptor. I have tried several recipes and although not detailed--you need to know how to cook a bit--they were excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"For those who enjoy books about rural life in France this will be a delightful read. Different in style and content from Peter Mayle's books on Provence it makes for a wonderful read. Great for cruise or beach!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book could have been so much better; the author is amazingly unaware.","review":"I was excited to read this book and picked it up at my local bookstore. It started well and then got monotonous. Ms. Loomis does speak of her charmed life time and again without reflection. I can't take a writer seriously if they don't stop and get a clue. Perhaps popping into the nearby church would have helped. Further, the intro to the people of Louviers read like unending introductions at someone else's family reunion. Enough already! We get it. This story looses its way and then never recovers. Ironically, or perhaps coincidentally, Loomis' friend Patricia Wells writes in a similar way. No more for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Otters","review":"Read a very enjoyable story of a playful otter, with questions at the end of the book to make sure you have learned something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pilots Information File 1944: The Authentic World War II Guidebook for Pilots and Flight Engineers (Schiffer Military History)","review":"An excellent publication that recreates for the reader an exact copy of a Pilots Information Manual from World War Two.

Other reviews said \\"going through the motions\\" and that is right on the money. When I saw them back in the day it was nothing like this. To give you an idea of how bad this was, after about three songs (three too many!) this went into to a box to be shipped to Amazon for a trade in.

They, at one time, had a lead singer who had a distinct voice and a unique ability to deliver irresistibly catchy vocal melodies combined with a very aggressive hard rock/heavy metal style. The way it was done however, was quite original sounding.However, this particular performance leaves me confused and disappointed. It doesn't show any of the bands unique talents, and it actually shows Jane's Addiction as a very mediocre and generic alternative rock band, which they most certainly are not. I can assure you- listen to their early albums, and you'll hear GREAT songwriting.Perhaps Jane's Addiction just aren't a great live band, or maybe they didn't have the energy or dedication to rip out a stellar performance on this particular night, who knows?I'm also not very fond of the way Perry Farrell curses while communicating with the audience. It doesn't offend me, but I'd rather he not do that.Anyway, just pick up one of the bands early studio albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality DVD, horrible performance by the band.","review":"Jane's should have died in a plane crash in 1991. They can never recapture the glory of their heyday. It's sad and embarrassing to see them now.

I received my ring yesterday and am very thrilled with the quality and craftmanship of the piece. I took this ring to the mall to compare it with their overpriced pieces and I am so excited about the deal that I was able to get on this ring. It is gorgeous and I saved a lot of money. All of the jewelers were in disbelief by the price that I paid, question the authenticity of it and were very snooty when I shared the price with them. I have to say that I am very happy that I have this ring, and have wanted it for a long time.

There's not much more to this book than that, so don't go into it looking for something other than an easy-to-read story with a fairy-tale ending.

However, as some one mentioned ealier the treatment was not only rushed but the event that brought them all together which was the radio contest was not believeable at all.

It merely kept my interest until I found interest in another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, it was okay...","review":"I really do believe that many authors should either keep tape recorders on them or eavesdrop on everyday conversation, because Ms. Butler is not the first author I've read who has unrealistic conversation. No one says things like \\"...I was thinking that maybe we could grab a bite to eat afterward and continue the engaging conversation we began on the plane.\\" This was the type of wordplay throughout the whole book and I spent more time rolling my eyes than I did reading. I am usually driven to dialogue first, but in this case, I wish the author would've just told the story in biography format. The back stories of the \\"Questions\\" were so interesting (minus Lashawnda's Braces Story...that was wack! Her snide comment to her ex-girlfriend was very gross...ugh!), and William's pay-off was ABSOLUTELY UNREALISTIC. I think the author kinda played her readers for suckers because this book ended too happily-ever-after for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read... Wanted More","review":"Overall, this book was an easy read. TJ Butler has done it again. She brought the characters together, however, I like many of the other reviewers, was left hanging at the end.

He uncovers the Watchtower Society's sales methodologies developed in Europe and the USA. He also reveals the use of demonstrations and the court system in the US to benefit the Watchtower Society through the influence of public perceptions.With Schnell's help, you can begin to understand how idealistic youths ended up as dedicated, underpaid promoters of a belief system which Schnell compares to totalitarianism.I gave the book 4 stars, because I think it has its greatest value as a historical document which may give insight into the origins of the current Watchtower Society. It may be less relevant to the concerns of those who love the JW's of today. Still, a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a red flag for the brain.","review":"the reason why i gladly gave this book 5 stars is because the author was an actual member (30yrs) and his inside information is sound.this is an enjoyable read (pp. 214) for anyone that's interested in this CULT.

It is by no means a terrible movie, and you can see what Leone was trying to do, but he just doesn't pull it off. I can forgive the time shifts and flashbacks; those are easy to follow (if you overlook some glaring anachronisms), but it's the less-than-stellar directing, sometimes wooden acting (especially by the child actors) and the patchy script that I had trouble with. Don't get me wrong, the movie was interesting and I didn't mind watching it for the most part, but to call this one of the greatest films (or even gangster films) of all time, is far too kind. It's a decent movie that is perhaps worth one viewing, with mostly good acting by De Niro and some others, but there are many flaws that keep this off any \\"best of\\" list I can think of. If you're got three hours to kill and are curious - check it out. If you want a masterpiece, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning portrayal of wasted human lives","review":"Director Sergio Leone has produced an ambitious, complex, and moving portrayal of Jewish gangsters in the early 20th century. When the aged former mobster Noodles Aaronson (Robert DeNiro) is summoned back to New York, memories of his childhood gang and subsequent rise in organized crime resurface, as does the mystery of what happened to the money the gang had been pooling since their first days together. The answer to that question--and the payoff to this fine film--renders one of the most moving portraits of betrayal and wasted lives that I have ever seen committed to film. James Woods delivers an explosive performance, as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leone and his America","review":"I first saw this in a severely edited version in a theatre and was dumbfounded. How could Warners do this to a great director like Leone? Subsequently I did see the uncut version on DVD and many scenes that were confusing now make sense. DeNiro has never been better than in his final scenes with Woods who was also excellent (they would re-unite for the last time in \\"Casino\\", a lesser film)and the supporting cast is great with a young Joe Pesci and Treat Williams as a Hoffa like union organizer. My only complaint here is why did they not age Elizabeth McGovern? As the other characters age, she remains youthful.

Being a Jewish immigrant himself around the same time the movie's earlier setting, he felt that he could relate to it. It took me a long time to finally getting around to watching the movie (being as long as it is) and was MESMERIZED by the different settings, the music (Ahhh...the music!) the story itself and of course, Robert DeNiro! After viewing the film, my friend had a difficult time trying to get it back from me! Sergio Leone has the art of focusing on such important and unimportant details of the settings. I particularly loved the scenes of Deborah dancing among the vegatables in the dusty room. I also thought the first scene of the Chinese theatre was beautiful with the elderly woman's face keeping an eye out for Noodle's safety. And the music fit every scene perfectly. All in all, I have to to say that this is one of my all time favorite films. A true work of Art! Enjoy it when you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"A crime drama worth seeing","review":"With the majority of the people here rating this film 5 stars, I have to agree with them.

The \\"special features\\" include a part of a documentary, commentary by a film critic who isn't particularly qualified to talk about it, and \\"cast biographies\\" that consist of a still screen listing other films by six or eight actors, including several(Burt Young, Joe Pesci, Treat Williams) who are only on screen for just a few minutes of a 4 hour film. The cut between disc one and disc two is horrible, especially since an \\"intermission\\" card comes up a few minutes into disc 2. Sloppy, disappointing work. Not worth the greatness of this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has there ever been a longer movie?","review":"Well, sure. Several.This movie is looong, and while it deserves to be seen in one sitting, that's not likely.It's the standard rise-of-a-mob story, enhanced and improved, and even elevated, by the performances of De Niro, Pesci, Woods, and a cast of hundreds.I admire this film way more than I actually like it.

But when I bought it I was shocked at how disgusting and perverted it is. There are all kinds of sex acts going on between minors, and teenage prostitutes, it is just terribly disgusting. There are numerous scenes of full frontal nudity many scenes of rape with nudity and unusual positions (if you know what I mean) during the scenes, it is disgusting. I am a huge fan of Robert De Niro I own The Godfather Part II, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, The Deer Hunter, GoodFellas, Casino, Analyze This, Analyze hat and Midnight Run. But this crossed the line between tasteful and disgusting, see it on television but do not dignify this perverse behavior. The only interesting part is the acting of Robert De Niro, Burt Young, and Joe Pesci."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated and boring melodrama","review":"That's why this movie bombed in 1984 and whether you watch the 139min version or the director's cut, it can't make up for the poor script or storyline. Leone masterfully recreates New York in the 1910s and '30s, but then insists on labouring absolutely every scene, while irritating us with ringing telephones, clinking teaspoons or Morricone's morbid soundtrack. The storyline is weak, with the tedious \\"Our Gang\\"-like sequence showing the young hoods, the Bonnie & Clyde-like 30's mobster sequences and then the wholly implausible '60s finale. The script is poor and doesn't contain a single memorable line. The acting is ordinary, with most of the cast seemingly sleep-walking through their parts, De Niro and Pesci are wasted (Goodfellas this is not), while Elisabeth McGovern seems unable to even open her mouth to speak. This movie cannot be compared in any way to The Godfather (or even Godfather III!).

Despite the fact that there was a real lack of any storyline, it's filled with sadistic and pointless violence. The raping of women and the shot in the eye were just a few things that made me sick to watch this movie. This is nothing like Godfather or Goodfellas, nor could it be compared to it at all. It was slow and boring, trying to make Deniro look like a good guy, when in fact he was a worthless loser. The people he betrayed, raped and sold out were still his friends and still acted like they owed him something. It was 4 hours of boring monotonous drawl and I would rather watch Eddie Murphy's \\"Party all the time\\" for 4 hours straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sergio Go Home","review":"If you think just Leone's westerns are intolerable, try this psuedo-American gangster monstrosity on for size. Clear plenty of time on your schedule, though; with intermission it's four hours long. All of his failings as a film-maker are magnified by the extra time: a complete lack of pacing, a totally unintelligible story line full of papier-mache characters, bad dialogue, too many meaningless close-ups, and yet another insufferable musical signature - this time on a pan-flute, God help us. As Americans I suppose we should be flattered at this type of mimickry but we make better westerns and gangster pictures than a foreign imitator can make. The lesson of Leone's career should be film what you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"An overindulgent mess with nothing to say","review":"Once Upon a Time in the West was a masterwork by a great artist. It was the American west as myth. Once Upon a Time in America is an overindulgent mess with nothing to say that is worthwhile or even interesting. Unlike his earlier jewel, in this movie there are no mythical characters or dialogue and only glimpses of a mythical landscape (the scenes with the utterly gigantic bridge in the background excepted).

It shows a bunch of kids that immigrated over from Israel, and landed on Ellis Island only to end up in the Lower East Side of NTC. They all seem like they're normal kids, and like all normal kids they mess with each other, and grow up to become friends, and then enemies, and finally only opprtunities to achieve what they want in life. Well isn't that what the American dream is all about kids? I will say that the intercourse scene from behind I don't know the significance of the scene other than it showed the person only looking out for himself. I mean he had to do it from behind her as he couldn't even face her. I found \\"The Godfather\\" movies one and two way more respectable than this.

I guess they acted just like any other gangsters of that area so it didn't really matter if they were Jewish or not and seeing Robert DeNiro and the rest spouting Jewish sayings seemed silly.It was a very long movie that went back and forth in time and it was so blah and melodramatic that I'm sorry to say I couldn't wait for it to end. I didn't care about any of them by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opium Nightmare?","review":"This flick may be the reason Leone stopped making them. Its framework is apparently a bad trip from smoking opium. Flashbacks and flashforwards make it hard to follow the antihero. The main characters suffer from low self-esteem or worse, especially the women who are submissive to rough sex and other abuse and like it (?) Never thought that female nudity would put me off, but here it's merely gross and rape scenes do not add to any appeal. Treachery and violence and odd cinematography abound for the artsy crowd. The whole mess could be just a series of bad dreams for all the sense many make; protagonists often have no motive and act contrary to their own best interests, selfish though they are depicted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable, on purpose","review":"One big-time reviewer said of this release, \\"this is what DVDs were made for.\\" Absolutely right. After two decades of silly and heartbreaking truncated editions, this is the cut that finally makes sense out of a towering cinematic achievement. Richard Schickel's adroit commentary track should only be listened to AFTER you've seen the movie, but do listen, for he nails the flick.

The chief one concerning its subject matter ie Jewish gangsters and the federal reserve bank raid portrayed. Was leone delving too deeply into the founding of present day america.

It did poorly at the box office because it was cut from four hours to two and a half and at that length, it was impossible to follow.

There is a scene in which Robert DiNiro goes through a door as a young man and emerges, many years later, as a broken old man.

It puts women in an unnecessarily bad light, not at all showing complexity or self-value - rather, they were shown as bird-brained sex objects who have no sense of self worth. I just feel that overall, the movie did not have a strong enough plot or any justified reason for the sex, violence, and degradation present in the movie. The characters with fairly superficial.

Sybex recommends a score of 80% or better on a chapter exam to achieve proficiency. The sybex certification books are some of the best as they are easy to read and follow, even with my experience I learned quite a bit that I didn't know such the white paper of various printer technologies.

I've been off the field for a few years and wanted to take the certification to not only get caught up, but also clear the new exam as well.I was just a little disappointed that the book didn't adequately prepare me as the \\"Complete Study Guide\\" said it would. There were at least 20-25 questions per exam that were not in the book at all... and to let you know, it takes only 25 questions to miss to fail the exam.The book was a bit disorganized in the new security chapter, and while the rest of the book was organized pretty well... covering only 75% isn't a \\"Complete Study Guide\\" and unfortunately is worthy of only two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the Job done","review":"I used this book in conjunction with pass4sure test questions.

Going to Broadway with more songs by Phil seems like a no brainer. The new songs by Phil are still great. But what makes the show is the actor who sings Tarzan...Josh Strickland. His personal connection to the orphaned boy who is adopted by a mother who loves him no matter what species is very close to his own history and you can hear it in every note. Josh makes the musical. Wish it had lasted longer on the stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Soundtrack","review":"I have not seen the Broadway Tarzan show, but this is a great soundtrack. Tarzan, who is voiced by Josh Strickland is absolutely amazing. All the songs from the movie are there as well as a few more composed by Phil Collins. A definite highlight of the soundtrack is \\"Everything That I Am\\". There is also a Phil Collins version on the album. It isn't quite as good as The Lion King (I don't think anything can touch the Lion King.) but it is an awesome soundtrack and, if you have a few bucks to spare it would definitely be wroth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A wonderful fiasco","review":"It' curious how an interesting history can be not well told by a modern music.

I didn't ejoyed with that CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Rocks OUT!!!","review":"Tarzan is a swinging heep of fun! You will want to jump up and down for joy. Strickland as Tarzan is amazing. He makes the opening so great. And Kala is an absolute knock out!!And Kerchak is so full of rage in his song but calms it down a bit. Terk brings a soulful touch to the track. But the two young Tarzans are weak!!! Jenn Gambetese who plays Jane Porter is a power house! and makes the character worth while!! Phil Collins is amazing for writing this score!! HE ROCKS!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"I wish I could give half-star ratings, because this would get 3 and a half stars, so I erred on the side of generosity. This is not the greatest musical of all time, but it is pretty good. The one criticism I have is of the voices. Kala is wonderful, and Terk is good, but everyone else is bland and flat. There were times when I thought Tarzan's voice sounded like a low woman's voice. Jane sounds like she's trying too hard to affect the english accent. Kerchak is boring. Porter only has one song, so I don't think it's fair to evaluate his performance. As for the songs themselves, I did find myself humming them after I turned off the CD.Among the better new songs (not ones from the movie) are \\"Who Better Than Me\\" and \\"Sure as Sun Turns to Moon.\\" The best new song has to be \\"For the First Time,\\" the ballad where Tarzan and Jane sing of their love. It's truly beautiful.All in all, it was worth buying and listening to.

One of Disney's biggest mistakes of a show to make into a stage musical. While the show was very amazing visually, the story was poor and so was the music and lyrics. There was no pit orchestra and the music was overpowering the vocals. If you want a musical CD go but the Color Purple or Wicked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Awful Musicals of 2005","review":"2005 has been a very slow year for musicals. With shows like Lennon, Lestat, The Musical of Musicals: The Musical, Hot Feet, Ring of Fire etc. Tarzan is one of the worst musicals i have seen in a while. The music is absolutly aweful! The script has many, many problems, acting is mediocre. (One thing that made me mad, is how you could see that Tarzan was wearing a harness and how the vines had carrabeaners on them.) The songs have no meaning, escpecially \\"Two Worlds\\" This is a song that tries to be metaphorical and cute and \\"real\\" but it is pure nothing. Dont buy this album or tickets to this shoow unless you like wasting youre money. (by the way, the set of Tarzan looks like the set of a lowsy high school play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Phil Collins has written a banal, stupid, unmemorable, often uneven score for this Disney dreck musical, Tarzan. His lyrics do not rhyme at all. They often try, but do not work. His music is bland and highly unmemorable. The actor playing Tarzan, Josh Strickland sounds like Cher and Jenn Gambatesse as Jane needs to work on her English accent. The orchestrations sound incredibly synthesized. Nothing acoustical, nothing brassy, nothing remotely good. (Poor work by a usually wonderful Doug Besterman).The show itself is far worse than this CD. The costumes and scenic production are incredibly tacky and lame looking. The book is highly cliched and structured quite poorly. This is a cast album filled with awful music from an awful show. If you wish to hear unmemorable music, bad performers and dreadful lyrics, buy this album. If not, please do not. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Boring on disc...not a true musical theatre score at all!

I can't believe people actually rated that they like this! It must be because they must never heard the original music recording of the animated movie.

After eight months, a tiny link from the mesh band broke near the join of the band and watch body, we had to cut and file at the band (leaving an ugly mark) in order to keep the band from scratching up his wrist.

Since then the watch works, then it stops. It can work for a week, or a month, or a day, then by some mysterious reason, it stops. I had it looked at by the dealer. He told me that the watch would have to be sent out with a fee for shipping, and insurance.After reading a few reviews, I don't think I'll send it out since so many people have numerous problems with the band and battery.

They offered a refund plus a refund of the return shipping charges. That was fine but I would not retract my review on their product. The clasp did not work.

Their satisfaction will not last.The watch is extremely pretty out of the box, but it won't be pretty for long. The face of the watch is hypersensitive to scratches and scuffs. Mine glanced against a wooden bookshelf and was left with a deep scar, maybe a week after I got it.Skagen knows that this is a design defect. A year ago they replaced a friend's scratched watch, acknowledging that the crystal was too soft.

The band is very stiff you cannot budge it which makes it feel like it will breakat any time, and reading the reviews... this is the case.2. The clasp is an absolute nightmare. The inside clasp does not hold, and the other does not either,so it's simply a cute design that looks good on paper but not strong enough in practice. It kept falling off.3. The hands have a green inlay as if it would glow, but they don't, and there is no light.4. There is no second hand which isn't a big deal really.This watch needs a new band, a rethink, if they could change these things, I'd buy it again, but until then,all I can say is stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Watch","review":"Very thin and light watch, almost forget I have it on.

However, it took me about 5 minutes to figure out how to take it off, its not that complicated, its just different from any other watch I have ever had, once you get used to it there's no problem at all.The clasp on the back, however, has started losing color after 2 days use, and since I haven't banged it against anything it seems really strange that this is happening, maybe they should also make the clasp out of titanium...All in all, a pretty decent watch, especially comparing it to the others in the price range..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crystal cracked on first day of wear!","review":"Nice watch, but the face cracked all the way across on my first day wearing it.

I loved the light weight and simple design of the watch, but after only three months the band broke off of the main body of the watch, with no impact whatsoever. It was a good thing I noticed it falling off my wrist, or I would have been out $145. It turns out that the band is simply glued onto the main body, rather than being attached with metal pins.

I can now get more advanced books on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total rubbish","review":"I am amazed at the positive reviews I have read about this book. Unfortunately, I took their advice and bought it.The book tries to follow the approach of teaching by example by developing compiler/interpreter components and utilities in C++. Unfortunately, the book reads more like a computer program printout, and rapidly becomes too boring to follow.There is very little theoretical background to the concepts behind creating compilers and interpreters. Attemping to learn from the C++ code will rapidly confirm that the code is of very poor quality, and seems to be a bodged conversion from C rather than a native C++ development.Avoid this book at all costs. It is especially dangerous for C++ novices as following the code will teach bad practices and lead you to believe that C++ is just C with classes. It is useless for experienced C++ programmers who wish to learn about compiler/interpreter programming techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written.

He is a bad communicator. I'd rather see his talent used elsewhere.The majority of this yellowpage thick book is the source listing. The book comments prior to listing the source snippet, rather than conveying the idea behind the construction.If it intended to be tutorial, it is a bad, cryptic one. It it's meant to be something else, it's neither an overview nor a comprehensive reference.

Other than that, the book was very easy to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"you all are nuts!---first edition is C NOT C++!!!!","review":"Every previous review is obviously about the second edition, much later than 1991.

It in no way resembled the promo blurb, describing the influences of jazz, West Africa, etc. I was very disappointed.Considering how much great clarinet music in all genres is out there, I would not receommend this CD.You like obscure jazz?

It is the fruit of a most faithful ministry, richly blessed by the Holy Spirit. He was a very gifted man, especially in the area of personal conversation, where he combined a deep understanding of the Word of God with a profound psychological and pastoral perception. He had the habit at the end of each day to make detailed notes of his pastoral conversations. Therefore, after more than twenty years, he was able to publish two volumes of the most instructive, remarkable and wonderful stories, all 'real life'. There's no comparable book in this area.I heartily recommend it. Very instructive for ministers and seminary students. The author firmly believed in the Bible as the Word of God. The principles laid down in reformed confessions such as the Westminster Confession, he brought to life in his ministry in a most constructive way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I read this book about 2 years ago. I liked it very much. The accounts are old, but the questions people ask don't change. The pastor works through the difficulties people face until they place there hope in Christ. Some accounts are very short while others are long. I found as i read, i couldn't stop until i finished the account. I read this book while plagued with doubts about whether i was a \\"true\\" Christian. In the midst of all the doubts this book taught me to trust in Christ and Christ \\"alone\\" then i understood the words of Romans 5:1 \\"therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\\".

She uses copious diagrams, accounts of pathologies, and essays by well-known experts to describe the various parts of the brain and how particular areas are correlated with specific mental activities. While I don't agree with all of her claims (her treatment of emotion strikes me as little more than a rehash of philosophical behaviorism), this work is both informative and highly accessible to most people. It should be particularly valuable to those interested in psychology, philosophy (especially the philosophy of mind), theology, and of course, brain science.

The sounds are not annoying either.I gave it four stars for durability because while it is well-made, the red slide easily comes off. It is easy to put back on, so it is just a minor complaint.

He mainly tore off the arc with the \\"P\\" on it to use for teething. Later on he snapped the little barrier arm to the elevator in two-which created a potential choking hazard in the small round piece created when it broke. He does love the magnetic cars, though. He enjoys the sounds the garage makes now that he's 21 months old, but still doesn't really get the concept of running the cars through the car wash or sending them for a ride in the elevator.

I needed it for a retirement celebration and my colleagues and I wanted to sing our own words in French on the original instrumental I will follow him.The reason I bought it is the Product Description that said: Sing the classic songs from the movie musical Sister Act. The CD includes full lyric book (no books was included) and 2 versions of the songs: one with guide vocals and ONE INSTRUMENTAL ONLY. This is not true. We still hear backvocals In English. So I cannot use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bland Experiment","review":"The Philadelphia Experiment should have never had a sequel, but, alas, here it is. The plot is muddy, characters bland, and the action marginal. Many plot complications are left unresolved throughout the film, and the careful viewer may have difficulty seeing connections between the plot. The film is by all means a bad clone of Orson Welles \\"1984\\" and is best described in one word: mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think so","review":"I had read all the reviews already written but decided to get the dvd anyway.

I was never able to find it in a video store, so I ordered it on-line. I had high expectations, and even if the movie wasn't quite as good as the first, I would have been happy. I love Sci-Fi, and especially well thought out stories and movie production. THIS MOVIE STUNK. The story was full of technical holes, the acting was overdone, the villan scenes/alternate history scenes were nonsense and there weren't even any good special effects.

I had such high hopes for this book, the reviews were so favorable and the book won an Edgar Award so I thought it would be a superior story. Not! I had to force myself to finish it, found the story line lame, the action not credible. Joe, face scarred so badly that he frightens people, but the ladies were mysteriously attracted to him? His sexcapades were amazing. There was no mystery involved here, no surprises. I found the multitude of spelling, grammatical and punctuation errors very distracting; I plan to volunteer to proofread books for Kindle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of T.Jefferson's best","review":"Silent Joe is a young man with a sad and violent past. He was attacked and scarred irretrievabley by his father as a young boy, spent years in an orphanage, finally getting adopted by a police officer and his wife, finding a happy home with their family. At the beginning of the story, Joe is his adoptive father's driver and fixer. One night, his dad is murdered while he and Joe are en route to pick up a young girl who had been abducted. This is a truly fascinating look at the life of a complex and sympathetic character---one of this author's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Joe speaks volumes!","review":"Joe Trona is scarred in more ways than one. Rescued from an orphanage by a charismatic Orange County politician, Joe is swept into the maelstrom of power & intimidation surrounding his adopted father's illustrious career.Serving as Will Trona's right-hand man & bodyguard, Joe is trained to protect & defend his father's territory until the paths of his father & a kidnapped girl cross in an alley one fateful, foggy night.Silent Joe is a really good read - much, much more than a thriller or a mystery - it is a deeply satisfying journal of a wounded man's healing & his chance for redemption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mystery","review":"This book was great fun. The author definitely knows how to write a mystery/thriller. Any book that has a good enough command of plot that I don't want to put it down gets major kudos from me. What sets this book apart however is that unlike many thrillers, the characters and their emotional responses to events aren't as two dimensional as in so many books of this genre. The author delves deeply into what motivates the protagonist and his enemies and allies, but he doesn't make a point of it, and so we as readers get to know the characters without realizing it. The depth of the writing doesn't take away from the fast-paced nature of the plot. So I'm glad I discovered this author and I'll certainly be sure to check out his other books soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Depicted","review":"T. Jefferson Parker shows, once again, that he's not only a superb mystery writer, but also a truly skilled creator of stories. His portrayal of the main character's life is deep and thought provoking. The seemless manner in which he weaves his story reminds me of the works of John Cheever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest Copying Ever","review":"The story line is great like all of Parker 's books. The editing is horrid. You ruin a good story with so many copying errors that at times the gist of the story is lost. Please have someone review this book and understand just how bad it is. I feel cheated out of a good read by this machine like reprinting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good from afar, far from good","review":"I have read several books written by Parker and have generally enjoyed his work. This coupled with the rave reviews had my expectations set high. On the surface the main character is unique but as you get deeper he really proved to be bland, boring and a bit unrealistic. The plot is nothing special and the love interest and action scenes just seemed farfetched. As one reviewer mentioned, once you get past the fact that the main character is physically flawed and scared, there is little else of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another reason I'll never move to california","review":"Started off interesting with fast-paced writing, then began to get repetitive. Joe had very little personality and the ease at which hot babes became attracted to him was totally unrealistic. In real life, hot chicks stay away from men with badly burned faces. Another annoyance was how every single women character introduced was \\"attractive\\". Every one. It's possible this was intentional on Parker's part, maybe everyone DOES appear attractive to Joe when he compares them to himself, but it annoyed me anyway. Also annoying was the \\"liberal\\" california feel of the book: white rich men bad; poor latin people good or misunderstood. Like many others, I'm tired of liberalism. Yaaaawn.Silent Joe is enormously overrated. I was disappointed given the rave reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silent Joe Should Have Stayed Mum","review":"One of the worst books I've read through in a long, long time. If it got 43 5 star reviews all I can guess is that the author has a huge extended family to write them for him. In the past year and a half I've read a lot of free Kindle books and this had the sloppiest formatting of any I've come across. There must have been more than ONE HUNDRED missing periods, commas and quotation marks. Talk about slopping spellcheck? Time after time the reader comes across things that look like the jokes one sees about how auto correct screws things up. Even for free this book wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Having been a great fan of Parker for several years I was bored with this book. The fact that the main character walks around wearing a hat and a scarred face,is a martial arts expert and a 4 year deputy working the jail but investigating this case is too much to believe. Will Trona would have been a better story. Sorry, about this but I will continue to look forward to Parker's books especially the Charlie Hood series."},{"rating":"1","title":"MULTIPLE GRAMMATICAL ERRORS IN BOOK","review":"This book has MULTIPLE errors in spelling, grammar, and even several places where a completely wrong word is inserted. All the T. Jefferson Parker books I've read are this way. The stories are great but there obviously is not proof reading involved.This had to have been the worst grammatical offender of the all of T. Jefferson Parkers' books. Really takes away from the enjoyment of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I seldom put books down in the middle.......","review":"...but the plot was sooooooo cheesy, unbelievable and repetitious that I had to give it up. I can suspend disbelief with the best of them, but unless I'm reading sci-fi I want the story to at least be plausible. Look, from my read of the other reviews you're either going to love it or hate it, guess which group I belong to. My advice, if you don't want to take a chance on wasting your time buy something else that has consistently been awarded good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Words for So Little Substance","review":"This really won an Edgar? Seriously? I can only assume it was a really down year for the Mystery genre.The central character in this book, Joe, is painfully boring. Painfully, excruciatingly boring. And yet, Parker feels the need to expound on and on and on about every tiny little detail of Joe's entire life. Parker gives us boundless information about Joe, none - well, almost none - of which is relevant to the plot.Midway through the book, if somebody had just stepped in and killed Joe, I'd have wept with joy. Nice payback for him torturing me with his boring character.If I'd checked this book out of the library, I'd never have finished it. And as it turns out, that would have been for the best, as this book had one of the worst non-ending ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Joe","review":"What a lame thriller ! A great premise is executed with lack of style and sensibility. The protagonist - Joe Trona , has overcome a great ordeal in his early childhood just to become a killing sex machine - good for him. The plot of political and high society intrigues is O.K, but doesn't come close to noir classics, the love story is preposterous and the action scenes are unbelievable. If you really into physical and mental scarred heroes, look for Carol Starkey in Robert Crais' excellent Demolition Angel."},{"rating":"2","title":"None","review":"whoever did the editing for this book should be fired. ok story but it was like a puzzle trying to figure out what the author was trying to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read -","review":"I'm not sure why I got this book. It must have been cheap, as I'm prone to go for books less than $5.00 unless the author is tried/true. I'd never even heard of T. Jefferson Parker. After this book I've ordered three more (all have been enjoyable reads) and am glad that I've found a \\"new\\" author. Silent Joe is a very endearing character, even though he comes across in the first few chapters as being cold and calculating. As the story progresses and we understand what drives him, Joe progresses too, becoming more endearing, more human while at the same time more driven. Solving who killled his adoptive father, an interesting, well conceived mystery was, to me, even less engrossing than Joe's growth. Even his romantic involvement was well done - the final, humanizing touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just didn't grab me the way I expected","review":"I actually read this novel about four years ago and didn't really like it, but after reading all the rave reviews on this site I decided to give it another try. I came away feeling exactly the same way as before, let down. The plot never really grabbed me like I thought it would. Also, I never really cared for the character of Joe. Emotionally and physically scared by an abusive father, Joe grows attached to his foster family, and even becomes his adopted father Will's personal driver. When Will is murdered Joe decides to uncover the mystery behind his death on his own. Sounds like it could be interesting huh? Well, seems like most of you have but I just coulded get into this one. When it was over I was relieved, and that's not a good feeling. Sorry, maybe the third time will be a charm, but I don't see myself reading this again just to come away with the same opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to reviews","review":"I was very disappointed with this book and shocked that it was an Edgar Award winner. From the reviews I expected a first rate mystery but I could never really get on board with \\"Joe.\\" I found the narrator's (joe) voice stilted and awkward, his train of thought difficult to follow. The scenes were choppy and disconnected. It wasn't until page 133 that I was even marginally interested in the plot. The plot line was unique and compelling but Joe was not. I never connected with the characters (translated: I didn't care.) I was constantly annoyed by the cadence and lyric and didn't really enjoy one moment of the book. ... I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Joe","review":"One of the best character studies in crime fiction.

However, like other reviewers have pointed out, the black on the band scratches easily. Also, mine arrived DOA. I took it to a watch repair place and had them check the battery. I was a bit suprised to see MADE IN CHINA stamped on the inside. They had to replace the movement. I am disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"I have had this watch now for over 1 month - wear it all day, every day, only taking it off for a shower. There is no sign of wear, no sign of black coming off, no sign of bracelet damage - just a great watch.I bought this for its slim look - I hardly notice it on my wrist - and the smart black image of the watch.I am delighted with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone wanting a reliable, smart looking watch.Yes, all it does is tell the time - that's what I want from a watch!As regards previous comments about problems with the fastening - I don't understand why folk have problem - hook on, clip cover, clip safety - it is straightforward and easily done with your other hand.A great watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huband loves it!","review":"This is an exact replacement for my husband's lost Skagen.

Women constantly compliment me on how it looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"attractive watch - flimsy clasp","review":"Very attractive watch - clear, spare design - easy to read face with luminous marks that are barely funtional in the dark. The clasp didn't work well at all - I almost lost the watch numerous times because it didn't snap shut properly. I was able to adjust the metal closure hook with a pair of plyers and now it works reasonably well. Does not have a second hand or a date marker. This is a watch more for dress than for everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality, elegant look. Very skinny!","review":"I was looking for a watch that looks elegant, but is light weight. I was also tired of arm bands getting broken at the ends. So I was shopping at the local mall when I saw this. I fell in love with it on the spot! I knew this is what I wanted. I found out that Amazon sold it for way less. I still get a lot of complements.Now for the negative - the arm band is made out of a metallic (titanium?) mesh. I accidentally scratched my hand on a wall and broke one piece of the mesh. It is sticking out and scratches my hand every now and then. So, I went out and bought another Skagen (blue face). I use this one whenever I'm playing sports or doing some 'dirty' work. At the Bahamas I went scuba diving into the salty ocean water and took this baby down with me. For 45 minutes were submerged. I come up and have no problems with this watch. Several months later, no rust. No issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clasp Fail","review":"The clasp failed on mine. I put a coat on and went to target. It disappeared somewhere, of course noone turned it in. I had trouble from day 1 with the clasp. It got lost within a week. People are right, it's so light you don't notice it, and then the clasp unfastens and its gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the fine print","review":"This is a very attractive watch, I've looked for a long time to find it at a good price. But when I got it, the clasp didn't work-it immediately fell open. In reading the fine print in the instructions for the watch, it states that the seals have to be replaced every two years under normal usage. I've never seen another watch in my life with this limitation. It would be interesting to hear from people who have owned the watch for 2-4 years. I sent it back, but it is too bad because I love the way it looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"No go.","review":"The watch is handsome like many Skagen watches but the clasp is delicate, weak and breakable and it lacks a \\"second\\" hand, again, like many skagen watches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I like this watch a lot. It's very stylish. Because of the titanium case it is so lightweight you hardly feel it. That, and the fact that it's very thin. Only four stars because of the lack of a date feature and the water resistance is questionable. (I'm careful to take it off in the shower.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek and Stylish","review":"This was a college graduation gift for my daughter's boyfriend.

I sat down and watched this with my dad one night and loved it. The story of the complex relationship that developed between two VERY different men (three if you include Earvin and his alter-ego!) made for a compelling documentary--funny, incredibly interesting, and sometimes a bit sad. I would definitely watch it more than once, highly recommended even if you're not necessarily a fan of the sport. I'm glad I held onto Larry because he means even more to me now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave and Factual-","review":"In a search for facts I was pleased to find the content of this book painfully honest and written with courage. A frank documentary of homosexuality as related by obligatory homosexuals, which may be uncomfortable to read, but worth reading. If you are looking for a way to \\"get back to center\\" and sort out the confusion, this may help. A compassionate compilation of information directed at true concern for the homosexual in our society, and how the Gay Movement may or may not be helping it's own cause.

But he and others like him provide hope for those suffering from the condition and are desperate to get out of it"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Problem","review":"The problem Socrides faces is that he never is able to explain in a creditable way why homosexualty needs curing. Instead, most of his assertions can also be used to support a view that homophobia has a negative impact on the life of normal homosexuality.Why not try curing left-handedness, red hair, or some other normal variation in human life? I am sure we can find some excuse for asserting that these characteristics somehow damage those who possess them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Speculation at Best","review":"Arm-chair speculation parading as science.

Quite the contrary, it impedes the true scientific process.It is neither liberal or elitist to insist that grown scientists adhere to the same ethical standards we require school children to exhbit in their science classes, and merely reflects the internalized anger of this has-been and his followers. The simplistic assumption presumes that hate and misinformation packaged in \\"clinical sounding\\" terms must be accepted by the majority of the dominant society.While the material is good for a laugh and to show how enlightened society has become, it should not be confused with serious research or medical advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be placed in the \\"Fiction\\" section","review":"A collection of anti-gay propaganda that would make Goebbels blush, all couched in pseudo-scientific terminology"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was pseudo-scientific claptrap!","review":"This book, reflecting Socarides's political agenda of theorganisation he heads (NARTH) is telling.

Why is it bad? What's wrong with it? He just can't answer that question. His reasons for disliking gay people, or thinking gay people are \\"yucky\\" make about as much sense as my distaste for certain green vegitables. Who cares if someone is gay? I couldn't care less! Why does a \\"so-called\\" straight man spend his entire life studying and obsessing over issues having to do with male homosexuality? Gee, I wonder. Looks like Socarides has his own closet-cleaning to worry about. Straight guys, and I mean real straight guys, don't spend their lives thinking only about gay stuff. Think about it.

It could have been written a bit better; it jumped around a lot from topic to topic. The sections on Sinatra and the Kennedy clan were an interesting perspective.HOWEVER, the reason this is getting one star is due to the publisher. I ordered the book and it looks like it was printed on somebody's old word processor. At the start of each chapter, the typesetting and subsequent printing caused the first few words of each chapter to be distorted and over-typed. Poor layout by the editors and book printer have discredited this author's work. It appears Amazon is now printing these as they are ordered, because there is a date printed in the back showing the day after I ordered the book.

We really did not care however, as we were having too much fun. What a great town it was back then. Now this book lets us relive those good old days ! and now we know why most of us occasionally/(usually) got poor seats at the back of the showrooms, and why we were never going to be seated at those empty tables our wives so dearly thought a $20.00 bill would seat us at !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Early Days","review":"A very factual and interesting take on the early days of Vegas.

An impressionable reader could easily come away from this book thinking all Italians are in the Mafia and are out to get you. The author's own apparent ethnicity is no license for this sort of cheesy, dated innuendo.And where was the editor? As mentioned elsewhere in these reviews, there is only the loosest continuity with characters being introduced and then re-introduced over and over again in subsequent chapters.

It is well illustrated, and the descriptions of the knots are full of great information. I have encountered a few knots that I couldn't tie based on the words and pictures, but the vast majority of them are clear and can be mastered with a few minutes' effort.My only real complaint is that, with the book alone, it is difficult to look up a particular knot by name. However, since the Ashley Book of Knots is the standard reference, Google is extremely well suited to overcoming this limitation. For example, the index doesn't mention Monkey's Fist, so I googled \\"monkey's fist ABOK\\" and didn't even have click any links before I found the correct number (2200).All told, this is a great book and I'd recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes Knot Tying to almost absurd proportians. almost","review":"The last book on knot tying you are going to buy.

Also I was disappointed to find out this TC doesn't offer the auto focus feature to work when mated with 150-500mm lens. This is the way it is designed, not a defect. IMO I will spend an extra $250 and go with a Nikon TC. I tried a Nikon 1.4xTC and the auto focus feature worked when hooked up with my Sigma 150-500mm lens, but costs almost $500.

Unfortunately, these claims have absolutely no basis in reality, and a quick trip to the World Heath Organization's Website quickly confirms this...That Pilger would so blatantly lie and distort the facts in a fanatical attempt to impose his ideological view on his readership is, at the very least, a form of journalistic malpractice.

It summarizes the life of 2 young boys living in inner-city Chicago, and the anecdotes that the reporter recounts are simply heart-breaking. It's an amazing read though, it is a real eye opener into the life of many impoverished children, and also introduces readers to the problems of juvenile court."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Left-Wing Propaganda","review":"Well one of the reasons \\"there are no children here\\" is that there are no fathers here. This book is explotative in both the children written about and the role of fathers in general. Barely mentioned, the role of the father is fully dismissed. Rather, society and lack of government intervention is blamed for all the problems of these two young boys. There is no emphasis on personal responsibility nor is there an effort to offer alternative solutions for resolving the plight of similar youths. In short, this is a maudlin, contrived attempt to emotionally manipulate the weak minded individual and duping them into believing that only gov. programs could possibly help."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are No Children Here...Wonder Why?","review":"This book was incredibly boring. I couldn't stay awake while reading. The only people who would want to read this book would be people who live in the Ghetto of Chicago. The book had little action or suspence and the boys were not incredibly interesting. Kotlowitz did do a fair job of reporting and I give him credit. It takes a lot of guts to dodge bullets just to follow a 12 year old kid around.

The only person who would want to read this book would be the family of the characters or author.

I must have picked up and put this thing down about 2000 times, and had to reread sections because of my wandering mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shock and an Eye-Opener","review":"This book is truly bracing, and eminently worth reading. It gives deep insight into life in the ghettoes of America, and stays with you. Like all good books, it enters into your \\"thought vocabulary\\", making it a reference point in the way you see any number of things. I strongly recommend this book to those with an interest in sociology or urban welfare policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book Review","review":"Can you imagine living in the projects in Chicago? Well for Pharaoh and Lafayette it isn't a dream. They wake up every morning knowing that there might be shooting or a gang fights. They live in what used to be one of the nicest areas in Chicago, but not anymore. Now it is one of the worst areas in Chicago. Families are afraid to go outside during the night because a bullet might accidentally hit them.Alex Kolwitz is an excellent writer. He goes into great detail explaining how difficult it is living in the projects. That if you live in these areas you grow up extremely fast because of all the violence that goes on everyday. If you have never experienced living or even gone there then the book would be very interesting to you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Startling Revelation into Inter-City Poverty and Hope","review":"I have read and re-read this book about 10 time in about 15 years. The trials these boys and their families face is so increcibly real -- so heartbreaking. Reading this book makes me want to find these children, bring them into my home, and nurture them into the realization that life actually has beautiful, wonderful things to bring to children. I have recommended this book to so many people, I've lost track. I have six (6) new copies in my personal library, and whenever I hear of anyone who is going through a rough time, I send them this book. Thank you, Alex Kotlowitz, from the bottom of my heart. Nothing that I've ever read has meant so much to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Interesting and Eye-Opening read...","review":"I enjoyed this book... it does have it's faults, but the emotional power of the book and its brutal honesty is what makes it great. Pharoah's innocence (or a desire to keep it) is entertaining, while Lafeyette's loss of innocence is sad and often suspensful. If you live in or near Chicago, this book sould be on your \\"to read\\" list.

It is a shocking and masterful depiction of the plight of urban youth. Kotlowitz does not force his judgements on the readers. Rather, he sets out all of the information and lets the reader decipher and digest it. The reader makes and draws the conclusions himself. It exposes a new side of the problems we see everyday in the forgotten urban America. It provides a perspective of inner city youth that has been long overdue. \\"There Are No Children Here\\" provides the reader with the whole picture, not just a negative 30 second news bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"There Are No Children Here","review":"There are No Children Here is an excellent depiction of life in the inner city projects. This book is about two boys growing up among the drugs, gangs, and violence of a Chicago Housing Project. The boys must grow up fast and learn how to deal with daily shootings, friends dying, drugs, as well as watching friends and family succeed only to fail because life will not let them become more then just a poor, black person living in the Projects. This story gives an accurate description as to the daily life in a housing project. The reader gets to understand what it is like to watch friends die, put a child in prison, watch the father disappoint his children when he comes around, as well how the government reacts towards the citizens in poverty. By focusing on the children the author captures the heart of the reader. It would be hard to live a life like this as an adult, but a child cannot stay a child in these conditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE NON-FICTION BOOK EVER","review":"I have read this book from cover to cover twice and will surely read it again some day. It should be mandatory reading in high schools throughout this country, particularly in wealthy communities. Believe me, I am no bleeding-heart liberal, but the conditions these boys and their family had to live under should not be tolerated in a country of such wealth. The story is not without spirit and happiness, though, mainly because of the endless efforts of LaJoe, Pharoah and Lafayette's mother. I did find myself wishing that she wouldn't be so kind to every person who crossed her path, however, (the scene where the male relative pees his pants in the middle of Pharoah's party comes to mind). The is the best non-fiction book I have ever read, filled with wonderful details of daily life in the projects ( I loved LaJoe's grocery list!).

I do not mind remakes so much, but really this is too much. Whole scenes have been copied directly from the original Peckinpah movie and nowhere is there any improvement. On the contrary! Basinger is not to bad, but I liked Ali McGraw better in the part. Steve McQueen was a hundred times better than Alec Baldwin, Donaldson is no Peckinpah and through it all I missed Quincy Jones' excellent score. The story is practically the same, but without the taut suspence of the original. Michael Madson and Jennifer Tilly steal the show and while they do a good job, they are not supposed to carry the movie. Now you start thinking them the interesting part and the bit about the McCoys running to Mexico with all gangland USA on their tale becomes an anoying sideline. Don't bother to watch this one.

One, it is a near scene-for-scene reworking of the 1972 film and two, it's simply a bad movie. The only difference I noticed was that there was heated sexuality in this which only makes it crude and unpleasant (I don't remember the first one having as many--if any at all--suggestive scenes). Baldwin is acceptable in the lead but has nowhere near as much effortless charm or verve as Steve McQueen. Basinger is awful and makes Ali MacGraw (a rather untalented actress) look like Bette Davis. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boy Alec Baldwin ruins the film","review":"This is a movie that did not need to be remade- the definitive version is with Steve McQueen and Sam Peckinpah.

This remake is fairly better because of James Woods, who is a major improvement over whoever played the Jack Benyon character in the original.The Getaway is really just a teched-up version of the original, with added sex/nudity, a lot more bloodletting and shootings, and more profanity. In the long run, it's a pretty bad movie but it rarely moves at a slow clip as the original did for just about its entire running time. Alec Baldwin is really not bad as Doc Mccoy. As for Kim Basinger, I know she won an Oscar but is she really a great actress? Compare her one Oscar award and nomination to 4 Razzie nominations (she's almost sure to get another with her performance in Bless the Child).

Even the Rudy character played by Michael Madsen. This is adapted from a Jim Thompson novel for cryin' out loud! These are supposed to be marginal characters, not fashion models. Though McQueen and McGraw were attractive (but check out McQueen's crummy prison haircut) they were believable in the role. Baldwin and Bassinger seem like movie stars trying to act like hard cases. Action wise, the robbery scene in the Pekinpah version was about 100 times more exciting and suspenseful than anything in this re-make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the original","review":"I can't imagine the size of Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin's ego's when they thought to remake a Steve McQueen classic.

I could barely sit through the thing. The action scenes are good, yet unbelievable. The sex seens with Alec and Kim are done well. Otherwise, the movie sucks. The basic plot is poorly laid out and therefore vaguely interesting, but the subplots are ridiculous. Alec Baldwin does a crummy job of portraying the tough guy in this movie - he comes off arrogant and smug more than anything else. Kim Basinger is great in her role, but overshadowed by the rest of the poor acting and stupid subplots that surround her. Jennifer Tilly does a good job in an idiotic role. If you want to see Kim Basinger naked, borrow this movie from someone else. Bottom line - don't waste your money on it - you'll be mad at yourself if you do.

No more sad song if you dont listen to this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wack Me With A Violin","review":"While I don't hate Clay Aiken's CD, I certainly can't be described as a \\"Claymate\\" either. Which is probably why I thought this CD was an overall waste.As other reviews have noted, it's comprised of classical music versions of songs sung by Clay, which means that for the most part the tunes are less bombastic than the originals.I'll file this next to my copy of \\"The Cincinnati Strings Do Abba.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"LOL!!!! A tribute to Clay LOL!!!! :D","review":"I was browsing in amazon for a good tribute album and i found this... a string quartet tribute to a guy who was SECOND in a poor COMMERCIAL competition judged by teenagers around USA!!! i just can't stop to laugh... I accept that this guy have a good voice, but nothing else, he just have one mediocre record!...After this album, ANYONE will deserve a tribute....I haven't heard the cd (i don't think i will) but i will give my vote and give you one recommendation based on this: LISTEN THE PREVIEWS BEFORE GET THIS CDS AND THINK IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN 40 OR 50 MINUTES OF THIS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounded Interesting...BUT...","review":"Interesting concept, very bad execution! Puh-lease! Listen to the samples and it becomes clear that this CD lacks one really IMPORTANT thing....CLAY'S VOICE! It's his voice that makes these songs so powerful and beautiful. Not only that, but these musicians have terribly mangled the music. I think some of the instrumentals on Measure of a Man are heartbreakingly beautiful, and this doesn't \\"measure up\\" to them in any way, shape, or form.Are these people just trying to cash in on Clay fans?"},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG, They Must Be Kidding!","review":"Oh.my.God. What in the world is this thing supposed to be? I love classical music, I love Clay Aiken's music, but this bears no resemblance to either.

The depths that greed can sink to........."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am Clay's fan, definitely....HOWEVER","review":"ok...before i make any comments, i would like to say that I have not purchased this cd...i just listened to samples...but...these samples are enough to tell me what a bad bad cd this is. This has no feeling, no aesthetics, no nuance....it doesn't even have good harmonies and melody!!!the bottom line is: This cd is not a tribute to Clay. It's a shame to Clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't throw away your money!","review":"ALL of you that love Clay, please don't buy this thinking it is going to help Clay. This is a shameful attempt to exploit and capitalize on Clay's popularity and name. The only people making money off of this CD are the people putting out it out. I love Clay Aiken, love his voice, love his music, and love Measure of A Man but this is NO tribute it is an insult!! I guarantee Clay would not have approved this painful attempt at music! I LOVE string music but this was unbearable to listen to, many of Clay's beautiful songs were unrecognizable in their choppy amateurish version. There needs to be a disclaimer statement by the sellers that Clay Aiken had NOTHING to do with the making of this CD and buy at your own risk!!! My regret is that I'm not permitted to give it a \\"0\\" stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Watch - Band is really junky.","review":"Very nice design and stylish. Long battery life. Band is very stylish but does have a tendency to fall apart and become sharp - and catch on shirts, etc. Band is not under warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 1 year of use.....","review":"I have used this watch from hiking and climbing, to the office, to out at a club for a year now, and I still love it.It is very durable and has only gotten one minor scuff on the metal, from contact with rocks, and no damage from regular use.The band and face plate are both very light making it easy to forget it is on. The light face plate is also immensely helpful for those of us with thin wrists. Most watches try to turn themselves around on us, and this watch stays in place.The mesh band is very comfortable.I tend to fidget too much, and I have unlatched and relatched this watch at least a thousand times in the past year fiddling when I was bored, and the latch is still as solid as the day I bought it.This is the best watch I have owned, and I have owned many. The funny thing is that this is also the cheapest watch that I have owned. I will never get anything other than titanium watches from now on, I will almost certainly get another Skagen for my next purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite watch","review":"I've had this Skagen for well over a year and wear it most of the time. I had to comment on a few of the negative reviews I've seen. How can you complain about it not having a second hand or date window when you knew it didn't have that when you bought it? As for the clasp, I really appreciate the fact that I can resize it very simply at any time as opposed to going to a jeweler to add/remove links to resize. With this watch, you just lift up the clasp holder and move it slightly, and voila, it's done. Some have said it's hard to read. I've never had a problem. I can even read it in dark movie theaters, with just a little light from the screen. Don't hesitate if you're sitting on the fence on whether to buy this watch. Go for it. You'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Strap","review":"I regret purchasing this watch. The strap is poorly designed and snaps open from time to time -- usually at precisely the moment when you are doing lots of things with your hands and can least afford to deal with your watch falling off. It is nice enough to look at but buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skagen Men's Blue Face Titanium Watch","review":"No second hand and no date indicator are minuses. Nice look for everday watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Battery","review":"The watch is on its way back, because it arrived with a dead battery. Bummer.That said, while this watch is extremely light and comfortable to wear (for the hour or so that I had it on), the instructions say that you can't wear it in the shower - and it's pretty small. I'd have dealt with it because it's a good looking piece, but it's noticeably smaller than any other men's watch I own.Don't miss this detail: THERE'S NO DATE ON THIS WATCH.Aside from that, you can tell this is a pretty nicely made watch...I'm just not paying to have the battery swapped on a brand new watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in under 3 months use.","review":"I bought this for a christmas gift. It was broken in under 3 months. My husband wears it only to work at a desk job. I thought the battery was out took it in for replacement and was told it was broken. The jeweler showed me that if you roll watch in your hands the watch hands jiggle. This is the second like it we bought and the second broken watch we have. Unfortunately I didn't learn my lesson the first time. My husband really liked the look of it so I tried again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Pictures don't do it justice. Beautiful design. Wrist band is extemely comfortable, watch is so light and thin I don't notice I am wearing it.Yes, it doesn't have second hand and day/date indication, but I think it is ridiculous to rate this watch low because of this as another reviewer did - don't you see it from the photo it doesn't have these features? If you need this - there are other watches available. I personally LOVE minimalistic design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...","review":"Let me just say that even a tone-def toddler could re-record this album at the same quality these guys did. It takes NO TALENT to talk to music. And that's what they did here. They talk, and then repeat the same lines over and over. GARBAGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is ok but TISM do better lyrics","review":"Tripe by the bagfull. Sounds are good however there is little mystery to the lyrics. TISM are far better at taking the p..s out of society and rockstar culture. The english are good at this most of the time but this one is undercooked unless you are 14. The subjects are as basic as going to the toilet in your pants.I almost believe these guys believe themselves to be worth the money and that right there eliminates the back and fowrd cool or too cool warble. Could use some mid-range on the guitars also we don't need any more treble and dico beats. HAHA. Relax don't do it.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!!!!!!","review":"I don't think i could ever stop laughing about this album....even just thinking about it. I know i can...i know i can.....i know i can. This is the most horrible band i've ever heard but yet its so amusing, well just two songs are....and after playing them over and over laughing at how bad it is....i suppose its worth buying...yeah sure buy it...its totally worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come back to LA soon","review":"Art Brut is probably the most curious British this year. They are funny and self-reflexive of the whole musical process. They are like one of those French novels that spend more time talking about how they wrote the novel rather than the story itself. The story of the band is actually contained in the first song \\"Formed A Band.\\" Other songs are about discovering rock and roll (My Little Brother), first love (Emily Kane), his penis (Rusted Guns of Milan), getting thrown out of art galleries (Modern Art), getting bored of the Velvet Underground (Bang Bang Rock and Roll), moving to LA (Moving to LA), a robbery (18,000 Lire), and others. Eddie Argos is not so much a singer as a provocateur. It's more like an art club than a band. They came recently to the States and blew everyone away. This is something to check out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets Old Real Fast","review":"OK, I get it. I understand that Art Brut are tongue-in-cheek, and that it's the classic stance of hating rock&roll and loving it at the same time. OH the ambivalence of it all. My main quip is with vocals. Rarely do I enjoy snotty brit twang, and this album did not get a pass. Eddie Argos's vocals are so grating, I hardly got past the first two songs. The music itself is nothing original (much like the lyrics), but is catchy and fun, at times. Basically, the state of Rock & Roll is easy to bash, poke fun at, and criticize. So if you're going to do it, at least have some lyrics that are indeed funny, insightful or otherwise, and not just noting what is already known. As a music and R&R fan, I have to say that this album's worth is overrated and hyped by critics and fans, while Art Brut is laughing at us (rightfully so). If that's what salts your corn, dive in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you want repetitive punk rock that thinks it is clever, buy this CD at its inflated import price. It did not grow on me, and it has chastened me to relying on just the reviews posted here. You'd be much better off getting old Replacements, like \\"Sorry, Ma......\\", if you don't have them. Even the Hives are better than this, and they are tired after two times through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative, original, annoying.","review":"Ok, so it doesn't sound EXACTLY like everything out there. And the lyrics are witty, I'll admit. But I find this album so annoying that I skip EACH TRACK hoping to find the next one more interesting. No luck. This band REALLY LIKES TO REPEAT PHRASES OF MINIMAL INTEREST. I don't ever want to listen to my Art Brut album. It may be better than 99% of what's heard on major channels (both radio and video), but it is still basically unlistenable. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read with caution: There be spoilers here!!!","review":"SPOILER: I'm a woman who has absolutely no interest in wrestling, but this book held my attention due to some interesting character development. That being said...what was up with that ending??? The entire book builds up to the final wrestling match and we don't get to find out who wins?? I was in shock and yelling %$#@(*&^%$#.

I thought the book was well written and that the characters faced some realistic problems. I enjoyed the book right up to the last page. Then it was ruined for me.I actually thought I had gotten a bad printing of the book, I went to the book store and checked out a couple of other copies just to make sure the last chapter wasn't missing. It wasn't.I've been watching for a few years now for a sequel, but to no avail.I had my husband, who wrestled in high school, read the book and didn't tell him about the ending, just to test whether anyone else would be as mad as I was. Yikes! He was really angry and told me to never give him a book like that again.I can't imagine that any student reading this book wouldn't be upset by the cliff hanger. Had he actually finished the story I would have given this author's book a much higher rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty","review":"This review is written for Christians to warn that Pinned contains sexual immorality. If I had known that it did, I never would have wasted my money on it.If only the author had written a clean book!! Because, aside from the sexual immorality, it was very well written and the characterization was strong and believable. The story is very dramatic. However, it is so disappointing that the guy decided to contaminate his book with sexual immorality.

I did not appreciate his pronunciations on some of the words in his Spanish songs, but 'shucks', he is not Spanish anyway, what would you expect ?

Nevertheless, if you are seeking some very basic information on the art of Ninjutsu, this book can be of some value. It covers a brief history of the art, the training and basic skills required of the Ninja, operating techniques, tools and weapons of the Ninja. Though it is not completely accurate in some areas, for the most part, the information is valid and interesting.In conclusion, this is a book for anyone interested in learning something about Ninjutsu.Rating: 4 Stars.

It tells a lot of WHAT a ninja did and not HOW. For example, you get comments such as (paraphrased) \\"Ninjas had a special way of stepping that allowed them to move silently,\\" but that is all; you are not told how this technique was accomplished. You are also briefly told about other techniques or devices that without a graph or illustration are impossible to comprehend. Not well organized or written with a lot of typos.

They always enjoy it and it helps them learn some of the vocabulary associated with that holiday. As to the people who have worked very hard to find any racist thread running through this precious book...What nonsense! The title refers to the main character's clothing and to the transformation that takes place in her heart and demeanor. You are in such a hurry to be offended, much like the old black witch herself, that you've completely missed the point of the story.

The dialogue is amusing, the illustrations are charming, you cannot help but like the sassy, sneaky OBW, and the bad-guys-get-it-in-the-end storyline always sits well with kids.

More and more, HIV/AIDS is being viewed as a chronic health condition even though it can still be a deadly disease. The main character in this movie (Mathew Modine) is outstanding and his drive to identify the cause of AIDS is inspiring. It was also really interesting to see all of the political issues involved in the process of identifying HIV--the scientific community squabbling over credit, President Reagan ignoring the plight of gay men, San Fran shutting down the bath houses, etc. I think the movie is still relevant today because HIV is now a world-wide crisis and it seems that little progress has been made in many developing countries.

Monkey Do. Monkey Dies.","review":"Getting the HIV-AIDs message out was as difficult with Gay Men and Lesbians as it was to the majority of the Straight populase. This was the first TV Movie that was based upon the outbreak of HIV-AIDs. HBO really did a public service by making, then showing a story that brought the subject matter into the living rooms of America.The storyline is acted by total professionals who deliver dynamite performances. The entire production was handled perfectly.Details of the story are available through the \\"Editorial Reviews,\\" on this page (scroll up).If you are looking for a light entertaining diversion, this is NOT the case here. This is factual, reality based scripting and played for a strong warning to audiences, regardless of their sexual orientation.The only other film (of this specific genre) I consider this film's equal is: \\"Longtime Companion.\\"Watch them both..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"If you ever wanted to know more about the beginning of the aids epidemic here in the US, this is the movie for you.

Instead, we receive a watered down, fairly sanitized version of everything which make the book such a knockout.See the film if you must, but you're much better off with the book. If you are interested in the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, I also recommend the film Longtime Companion, which traces the impact of AIDS on a circle of friends living in New York when the disease first began to spread."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a weird movie","review":"primarily because it doesn't take a stance. It argues neither in favor of the homosexual rights groups most heavily hit by AIDS at first, nor Reagan and the Republican Party who refused to allow AIDS to enter the media- it demeans such tenants of modern science as the scientific method and its inherent refusal to practice medicine off emotionalism while having a lot of fun giving people who work off emotionalism grief. It's one long, tortuous \\"I told you so.\\"However, everything else about the movie excelled enough to compensate. The actors, choreography, music, filming, and directing more than make up for a script centered heavily around \\"Whose fault is it?\\" And keep in mind- the subject is AIDS in the 1980s, when inaction made a disaster a pandemic. Maybe we should be asking \\"Whose fault is it?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not abysmal, BUT...","review":"For heavens sake, read Randy Shilts' book instead of watching this mediocrity!

Bach performed by the Rolling Stones?Do not purchase this DVD unless you are either blind or have no intention of viewing the anachronistic and grotesquely out of place costumes.

If you're a parent looking for an age level I would say 3rd to 5th.

It tells you how to survive in the outside world. Claudia (12) and Jamie (8) travel to the authentic Metropolitan Museum Of Art. It is very interesting to see the pair of them try to endure many weeks away from home with only about twenty-four dollars and sixty-eight cents. If you think about that amount of money, and that they have to have three meals a day, that doesn��t seem a lot. Especially when there are two people to feed. After they get a better handle on the basics, such as sleeping, and getting food, they find out about angel. Claudia gets so interested about angel that she went to Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler��s house to find out more about it. She has lots of files and one of them has information about angel.The author wrote it so that you just have to finish reading that book.

I have read a number of Newbery books, and this ranks #1."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this was a good book.","review":"I think this was an adventurous book.

BUT, SURPRISE-----adults will enjoy it too! From bossy, know-it-all Claudia and her gambling, cheapskate brother James to the cynical, eccentric Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, the characters are appealing and real. They have their adorable little quirks and are genuinely likable. At the same time, the idea of living in a famous art museum---sleeping in its bed, hiding luggage and out-smarting guards, is fascinating. It provides James and Claudia the opportunity to return home \\"different\\"---learn about themselves and about culture. OK, that sounds boring, but it isn't ! Learning about art is just the apparent goal; uncovering the SECRET that everyone wants to know is the real one. Guess who James and Claudia must turn to? The writing is FAST, FUNNY AND ORIGINAL . I strongly recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overnight in a Museum","review":"I like this book because I thought it would be good for a little mystery. I also thought that going to a museusm was a great idea for running away. Back then it was pretty cheap to go places. Claudia & Jamie were smart on spending their money.

She takes very little notice of, let alone feels remorse for, the agony she puts her family through when she runs away. She steals money and deceives people. And the resolution does nothing to improve her attitude towards her parents, but in fact gives her even more reason to be secretive from them. I read this book to see if it would be good for my kids. The answer is a resounding NO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it at all. Newberry winner? Why?","review":"I didn't find the writing style or the plot very engaging. It dragged on and on, and I didn't find the conclusion very satisfying.Aside from not enjoying the story, why would I want to hand my child a book about two children that run away? The children are unrealistic and are also rude to adults and each other. They cheat and lie. Their actions have no consequences.

This book allows the reader to follow Claudia and Jamie on their big adventure. One can't read this book, based in the 1960s, without wondering about life in a simpler time.

This time around I read the 35th anniversary edition and I'm glad the author addressed the discrepancies between reading it upon initial publication in 1967 and reading it in the 21st century in her afterword. Sure, there are aspects of it that are outdated, but the story itself is timeless. I can see how it would engage a child and perhaps instill a curiosity about art or museums or New York. When reading it as a child, I remember envying Claudia's independence and spontaneity, and even now, the sense of adventure was just as prevalent.

The story is so boring that you almost fall asleep reading it, and the writing makes even the few exciting parts feel like a long boring speech. The book this reminds me most of is Dragonwingd, which is, if possible even more boring. I think that the person that gave this the Newbery Medal and Dragonwings the Newbery Honor was trying to torture kids by increasing the possibility of teachers making kids read this in LA. Without question, this is E. L. Konigsburg's worst book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not satisfied :(","review":"This is the worst book i have ever read. Just keep in mind that everything i say is true... in my perspective. I don't like this book mainly for two reasons... one is that i read this for school and we had to do a lot of comprehension questions with it... so that just ruined the future of me having feelings for this book. The second reason i hated this book is because it included tooooo much information.

His personality constists of many characteristics. He uses intelligence when he saves money and only spends money on urgent things. Jamie comes with $24.68 of his own money. That will profit you with $20.68. Next, Jamie posseses a great amount of sneakness. Jamie sneaks when he gambles with his freind by cheating.Finally Jamie posseses a great amount of imagination.Also he thinks about camping out in hte woods, and pretended to stay in a resturant.Jamie uses his fabulous imagination. In conclusion, Jamie has a lot of interesting character traits."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"Winner of 1967 Newbery Medal. Konigsburg delights me in this excellent tween novel. Her writing is realistic and witty--often quite funny. She does a superb job on her characterizations of Claudia (12) and her brother Jamie (8) as they run away from home to hide out in The Metropolitan Museum of Art. (They sleep in the royal bed and wash in the fountain.) When a statue of an angel arrives, perhaps by Michelangelo (not even the experts are sure), Claudia makes it her job to discover the sculptor--and discovers much about herself along the way. A \\"must read\\" for tweens. I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs Basil E.Frankweiler","review":"E.L. Konigsburg wrote, From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, a Newberry children or teens book. The book is about two children running away from their house and staying at the Metropolitan Museums of Art. The obstacles they go through to live independently include regrets from going anyway. It reminds you how much you care about your parents. While at the museum the kids find a mysterious puzzle that has clues that to an unexpected conclusion. There are no weaknesses in this book. I read this book because my Aunt is the author. I am not saying this book is good because I am related to the Author but because it is a fantastic and interesting novel. I totally recommend this book to anyone. There is also other books of hers that have won Newberry medals. A movie has been made to go with the book if you are more of a movie kind of guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is great so far. It is full of mystery and adventure. Twelve year old Claudia has run away with her brother Jamie to the Metropilan Muesum of Art. Claudia decided to bring along her brother Jamie with her because he has a lot of money. While they are there at the muesum, Claudia and Jamie come across a great mystery in the muesum that is all over the newspaper. If you would like to find out what this great mystery read this book! Teachers it is also a great book to read with your class. Also edutactional!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Running away from home isn't such a good idea","review":"This book is about a sister and brother, Claudia and Jamie Kincaid. They live in a house with their older brother,Steve. In the house Claudia does most of the work, Jamie does a little and Steve does none. One day Claudia got fed up with doing all the work and chose Jamie as her partner, and they ran away from home. They end up at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and so the adventure begins.This book is written for ages 8 - 12.I do not recommend this book if you re going to read it alone. It is better to read it with other people, like your classmates, because there are boring parts, although I learned a lot about about the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Michaelangelo Bonarati. Also, I learned running away to the Metropolitan Museum of Art isn't such a good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spellbinder!","review":"What I admire about this book is the attention to planning and detail paid by Claudia. I can't stand when characters in books run away with, like, a candy bar and a pencil or something. Claudia had everything neatly planned out. If I had to pick a list of books that every kid in America should read, this would be ranked at a high-standing number two. ( A Little Princess would be first.) Read it! Read it! Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall in love with Jamie and Claudia...","review":"F.T.M.U.F.O.M.B.E.F. is a very humorous book. I grew to love the characters, namely Jamie. I like Claudia too, since I understand her, but Jamie's a funny, cute, caring little brother. It's rather hard NOT to fall in love with him. Mrs. Frankweiler also kept me laughing, with her critical comments to Mr. Saxonberg. And the end very much stunned and excited me. This is an imaginative book that I'd recommend to kids in grades 2-6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Konigsburg really knows kids' fantasies well!","review":"The author strikes true when she writes about the Kincaids running away, living on their own in a big city and all the while remaining anonymous to the people around them. I'm sure most kids have dwelled on a wonderful escapade from their normal lives - to a world where they do and eat as they wish (or at least I did!). Yet this should be no cause for worry for parents who think that this book may be a bad influence - kids' fantasies are but what they are - dreams that keep zest in a child. Konigsburg does not condone running away - in fact she subtly hints of the difficulties it poses (their being frightfully cash-strapped). Kudos to her for telling kids that fantasies like these are really okay - as long as they remain that way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mrs.Basil or Mrs.Bazil","review":"This book was one of my favorite books but the movie was so much different. For one they call Mrs Basil Mrs Bazil which is really weird. Claudia and Jamie look totally different and thy have an older brother steve and no younger brother. so if you really want to read a good book read Mrs. Basil. ( Don't watch the movie )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!! Planning the adventure was my favorite part","review":"because I got all caught up in the excitement of it all! Brother and sister make a great team as they run away to live in the Metropolitan Museum. They cleverly and carefully plan the event, pack, and start off. The journey results in family harmony, and a friendship. Their quest to find out who carved the mysterious statue in the museum's new exibit makes the book irresistable and impossible to put down!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I read this book when I was 9 or 10 years old(I'm 14 now!), and to this day I remember the plot! When I read it, I loved it so much I wrote a short story about how I went to the Smithsonian Museum of Art and lived there until my mom found me when she went to the library with her third grade class. It was complete fiction, of course, and it seemed exciting. I recommend this book to any 9-12 year old who needs a good book report book. This is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time faves","review":"I remember reading and re-reading this book as a child. The story of Claudia and James hit a chord in me that resonates to this day. The need to feel special, the finding of something that no-one can give you and the strength to go it on your own, to prove something to yourself, is a real grabber to any human being. I believe children will revel in the essence of the story and will not need to be told running away from home is something they should not do (children are very bright)... It led me to be more curious and enjoy the pleasure of reading a story that felt like it was ALL MINE. Go Claudia! GO James!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Okay Book","review":"This is a really good book if you like stories about kids running away from home. Claudia and Jamie ran away because they thought their parents were unfair. They hid out in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Near the end of the book, they met the lady who E.L.

Frankweiler, who narrates the book, even when she hasn't entered the story yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome book!","review":"From the Mixed up Files of Mrs. Basil E.

Players can also join groups called guilds and alliances to play and chat with same minded individuals throughout the 3 games (this one, the original, and the expansion Factions).Graphics and sound look good and can be used with almost maximum settings on my two year old laptop. All in all, Nightfall is an okay game to start with and a great expansion to the orinigal Guild Wars game."},{"rating":"2","title":"guild wars nightfall","review":"if you like online games this is a good one , free to play online with hours of enjoyment, nightfall is an wxcellent game either to start with or as an add on to the origanal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"This is the first online rpg I've played, but I've really enjoyed it. The tutorial at the beginning is very straight-forward and it's easy to quickly learn how to play your character effectively. There are more than enough quests to keep you occupied, and the majority of the players I've encountered are friendly. The visuals are wonderful (sticking to the Egyptian theme) and you have a rather broad palette of features with which to customize your character to your specific liking. Overall, I can say I've thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Nightfall so far, and I would recommend it to anyone teenage or older looking for a game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not feel like a MMPORPG","review":"Most of the time I spent playing by myself with no interaction with other players in a party.

But this it's really not a *real* MMORPG.I would not recommend this product if you enjoyed games like Ultima Online, Lineage or WOW.

G. Valens, Cybernaut: A Space Poem (Viking, 1968)What truly amazes me is that Viking published this, and with a blurb from Louis Untermeyer on the back. Good lord. No wonder the major presses shy away from poetry these days.Valens' goal was to take the space program and make something out of it that the average human mind could identify with; to encapsulate the vast distances and utter loneliness of outer space in a book-length poem. In one aspect, he succeeds; his space traveller (an Earthling sent into deep space, to report on what's there when he comes back) slides into insanity as the poem goes on, and when he encounters other humans again, that is quite capably presented. ut there's nothing here to distinguish the language, and it ends up reading like a cut up short story:Can man endure immersed in nothingness?Man canMan's logic tells manIfHe will impact himselfWith those essential things whichAre feed for man's essential parts...It was a try, and not especially a good one. * 1/2"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cute!","review":"My daughter received this monkey when she was born.

Especially when used in conjunction with the mouthwash. There is no chalky after feel (some toothpastes make you feel as if you have been chomping on cement...).

He opens our mind to the unlimited range of possibilities available to all of us. My only complaint is that if one is interested in the pursuit of the path he describes, no real direction is given in this book.

Marc is more popular than Victor in the US. Victor is more popular than Marc in PR. Size (geographical)doesn't matter because obviously we all know where are the true salsa fans (P.R.). Sure Marc Anthony is probably more popular in China from a possible marketing advantage, but then again, how many people out there listen to salsa regularly.Let me finally review this disc.

He did a very good job keeping us updated with all the folks he met while on the trail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought me back to the trail.","review":"As a thru hiker myself, I think that Aldin's book definatly brought me back to the trail. Especially when he basically leaves the spiritual side esentially what you make of it. That is something that I found to be definatly true myself several years ago. Good job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-involved couple make for poor reading...","review":"Just finished this book and was greatly disappointed. Rubin is exactly the kind of self-involved, arrogent charcter that I dread running into while hiking.Furthere, are we supposed to feel sympathy for this wife? The longest these two are apart is six weeks yet she manages to pout, faint and cry hysterically due to the \\"stress\\" of being seperated from her husband. Anyone who has a parent or spouse in the military, foreign service or on a mission or has been in a long distance relationship will find her inability to deal with life on her own for short periods of time tiresome and pathetic.In the meantime, Rubin dishes out just enough guilt so that we don't \\"blame\\" him for his spouses hysteria, yet obviously doesn't care enough about her to get off the trail.This is more a tale of a very unhealthy marriage than of a journey on a beaten path. Less melodrama and more focus on the trail itself would have helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked A Walk in the Woods, you'll love this one!","review":"This book will inevitably be compared to Bill Bryson's recent book about hiking the Appalachian Trail, A Walk in the Woods. This book is far superior. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Walk, but it was mostly just an amusement, without any depth or real insight. Rubin's book gives a far more comprehensive and even realistic account of hiking the AT. For one thing, Rubin actually hiked the entire trail, while Bryson hiked about half--still quite an accomplishment. Bryson's hike is a lark, a way to find another topic to write about. But for Rubin, hiking the AT was far more personal and his reasons for more complicated. That's what we learn about, as we also discover the wonderful, oddball culture that makes the trail so unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointed.","review":"I finally gave this product a try because everyone said that this was the right product for them. It was not the right one for me. I ordered intense red, but it shows NO SIGNS of red whatsoever. It turned my hair to brown-ish colour. The product looked convincing, I loved the bloody red shade when the product was mixed. The result shocked me in a very bad way, because there was no hint - I mean, NO HINT - of redness. I've used cheaper DIY products which showed more INTENSE RED than this product. SUCH A SHAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a bunch of bs","review":"i bought this to dye my hair (also because i was told this is better for darker hair) and each time i tried to color it..this washed right out (i tried 2x but bought 3)!

The examples have nothing to do with conducting an EXPERIMENT that one would present at a Science Fair. The \\"problems\\" listed for each example can be answered by opening an encyclopia. Generally a problem/question that begins with the word, \\"how\\" can be answered in such a way. The purpose of a science fair is to conduct ORIGINAL experiments involving an experimental group and a control group. There are other guide books on the market that take a more scientific approach and steer the student in the right direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere NEAR what I expected!!!!!","review":"I bought this book in hopes of finding a good science fair project that could \\"bring home the gold.\\" But all that I found was a kids science book that showed you what happened to fruit-flies in the light and other stupid stuff like that. It was nowhere near what I expected in such a highly reffered book. If you are looking for a good science project for someone above the age of 10 I would not recomend this book!~SammieG~ -shibby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, These are NOT the \\"Best\\" Science Fair Projects!","review":"I picked up this book for my son in 6th grade after reading so many glorifying reviews about Van Cleave's books and the fact that she has so many books out there. Boy were we ever disappointed! These are not \\"science fair projects\\" that a student can use for doing a science fair project in grades 5 and up, rather, they are trite projects for little grade school children or kindergarteners. How can a project that asks the question \\"what are the parts of a fingernail\\" and for materials required lists only a magnifying glass for the so-called experiment which is consists of a student holding the magnifying glass over his/her fingernail to observe, how can this possibly be a \\"best\\" science fair project? How can this be any science fair project at all? Where is the hypothesis, what is the real experiment, how could a student enter this in a science fair? Don't waste your time with this one, I returned it for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Super Duper Book!","review":"When I read this book, it was very useful to me because I was doing a Science Fair Project and this helped a lot. I have also read lots of other Janice Vancleave books. they were just as fantastic as this one. I think lots of you people would read more Janice Vancleave books if they read one before. This book will really help you at a Science fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent information about embedded systems","review":"I've been reading this magazine off and on since Electronics Now and Popular Electronics went down hill, and have been pleasantly suprised by the depth and quality of information provided.

If you're looking for insights into embedded systems development, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"None better...","review":"There is no better publication if your enthusiasm for making things still equals your desire to understand the digital world - student, hobby builder, or pro.

My personal favorite info was in the section about camouflaging -- Diane gives us abundant tips on instantly \\"losing\\" weight by using makeup, hair, and dressing tricks.This book is full of secrets on every beauty topic including makeup, skin, hair, clothing, exercise, attitude, and others. The book is formatted in an easy-to-read manner, and includes celebrity tips as well as Diane's own practices. As of August 2000, it seems very up-to-date as far as fashion is concerned.For anyone who is interested in having all the wisdom of several years worth of fashion magazines, this book is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in Clarity","review":"On page 40, Diane says to \\"Slough off dead skin cells with a solution made of sea salt and lemon,\\" but she doesn't offer the proportions for each ingredient. This kind of problem is present throughout the book. It's great to read some of the techniques she offers, but it doesn't do a lot of good when she doesn't explain everything we need to know about their application. It would have been more helpful if the author had included an appendix of \\"recipes\\" for the solutions she offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of her advice is actually UNSAFE","review":"I did find a couple good tidbits, but most of her advice was cliched and simplistic. Some of it was downright silly... \\"never chew gum, never drink from a straw\\". Come on now, who really is going to abide by this? She also advocates temporary anorexia for those who want to \\"crash diet\\" which she doesn't consider \\"very bad\\". Ask any doctor and he/she will tell you that it is unsafe and unhealthy. Mrs. Irons needs to think twice before she gives people advice on how to starve themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent idea for a book...if the stuff in here actually worked!","review":"I was very excited to hear about this great book that has all these fabulous home fixes to our everyday beauty problems as women. I became very disappointed when all the fixes I tried DID NOT work for me. I feel like it was a total waste of my money.Perhaps I gave up too quickly, but I do not have any idea where I put my copy of this book since I found it useless. I got more good real working advice from this little cheap book I bought from a bargain bin called Natural Beauty or something. It really is too bad since I love all grandmother homemade beauty recipes and fixes, but Diane Irons just does not work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believeable Transition Can Be You","review":"From just the small description of this book, it has already captured my interest. I have heard more than enough times how we very often pay more than we should for products whose price is based more on name than product. Now we have someone who independently gives true-tested opinions of many things we may even already have in our homes. With what we all can save, this alone pays for the price of Ms. Irons helpful books. I can't wait to get included in the list of satisfied owners of her very affordable and useful books."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better","review":"There are suggestions in this book that I think are unsafe and unproven. As a dermatologist myself I think you can do much better with \\"Looking good at any age\\" by Amy Newburger. She is a dermatologist who really knows her business and the TRUTH about the cosmetic industry and skin care."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic industrial ethnography - highly recommended","review":"This classic industrial ethnography is based on Williams research in 1919 as an itinerant industrial worker in the northeastern United States. Although guided more by a concern to save America from the Bolshevik threat, by coming to understand workers concerns, than a desire to advance labor's cause, it provides rich insights into rolling mills, coal mines, and the complex, multiethnic labor force of World War I America, and the working conditions, living conditions, and cultural dynamics of those who labored there.

Very simple and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-intentioned pap","review":"This is well- intentioned pap preaching the centrality of ' Love' . Buscaglia claims that Love is an unexplored subject, and it seems to me he is wrong about this. But his heart is in the right place, and urging us all to love more, to give to others, to understand that when we share with others we only gain. He too I believe is correct in saying that only if we love ourselves properly can we love others truly.The book is written in a quite simple way. But as I have said Buscaglia seems a very nice and good - hearted guy. And reading the book should not hurt anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talks of Love but fails to define it","review":"The book was content free.

I will now have to look elsewhere in my quest to understand what is love..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe David Weber wrote it.","review":"David Weber is my favorite author. As I read Apocolypse Troll I was stunned. A poor, overworked plot, undeveloped characters and action that was incomplete and not intense. In short, it had none of the features I have come to expect from David Weber. I have to believe that this book was either released in sketch form without Weber's permission, or that it is an old work that the publisher dusted off and printed without giving Weber a chance to finish or re-write it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's time spent not being miserable, but not worth buying.","review":"The first, space battle aspect of the book is good - though coming out after the Third Imperium and Harrington books it feels like a remix of the two rather than something new. From there, as others have noted, the plot is essentially a collection of near-future sci fi standards, with an ending that breaks the story's internal continuity. Avoid, but take this as being the exception that proives the rule that if David Weber wrote it, it's got to be good. A much better standalone is _Path of the Fury_, which I have worn out two copies of rereading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast action, quick read, holds your interest","review":"Here's a story with a unique twist - \\"human\\" aliens so to speak. It's a fun story with characters you'll like. The opening grabs your interest and it's a fast ride from there to an exciting conclusion. This is the first of Weber's books I've read and I'll certainly try another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Its refreshing to come across a good sci-fi with all the elements of adventure. Written with an almost Tom Clancy style, this book is worth the paperback price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever seen The Fifth Element?","review":"I still have a hard time believing David Weber, who's been responsible for so many books I enjoyed, wrote this book. The plot is lifted directly from Luc Besson's The Fifth Element. The name of the main female character is even taken from the lead actress in the film.I generally don't mind finding a lifted plot or character. I've read excellent rewrites of the Odyssey, The Brother Karamazov, and Les Miserables over the years. For that matter, Weber borrowed liberally from Forrester's Hornblower and the history of Nelson to create his Honor Harrington series. Unfortunately, this was poorly done. If you catch the plot similarities in the first few chapters, you'll know everything else before it happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"A male fantasy at best","review":"Hmmmm..., let's see. There's this warrior guy in our world, minding his own business, when (gasp!) all of a sudden, futuristic warships appear and blow the stuffing out of each other. A supersmart, super beautiful, youthful woman (who also happens to be superhuman and a great warrior) is rescued by the said warrior man (Boy meets girl.) I'm sure many of us young men have had the above fantasy at least once. For one thing, Weber already did this kind of story in Mutineer's Moon and to a lesser rate, at Heirs of the Empire. This stuff is so old it's stale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun!!","review":"While waiting my turn at the Honor Harrington series, I picked up this book in order to get a taste of David Weber. I was very happy with what I read. This book is a great deal of fun - lots of action, a great work of military science fiction (read: SCIENCE FICTION to those who are going \\"oh, but this doesn't make sense\\" - yeah - it's SCIENCE FICTION!! Who knows what might make sense in an alternate reality?? Heh - maybe the laws of physics, etc. are different there? *laugh*) and, of course, for those who are interested, just a teeny, tiny bit of romance thrown in. Or lust - maybe you could call it lust. At any rate, it was a very enjoyable read and I'm very glad I picked it up and took the time - I will definitely put it on my \\"read again after I get through the hundreds waiting to be read\\" list. Another I highly recommend to those who enjoy a good military science fiction book that adds a bit of humor, a bit of fun, and whole lot of action."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vastly Underrated Novel, Overshadowed by Honor Harrington Series","review":"I should've reviewed this book years ago. It is an outstanding novel that would probably make a great movie. Unfortunately it has been largely overshadowed by Weber's subsequent Honor Harrington series. Much of the technology that is common in the Honorverse books and the strong female lead character are foreshadowed here.The portions where the human woman (well, mostly human) is introduced to the major governments on Earth (secretly and not including the Chinese) is handled extremely well and realistically with our heroine having to use a vast amount of her \\"phaser like\\" hand weapons charge to prove her claims.And the portions where the \\"troll\\" (the \\"apocalypse troll\\" of the title) gains control of the minds of humans, especially the minds of those in various racist hate groups in the U.S., is quite chilling and effective.The final page of the book leaves the reader both saddened yet fullfilled in a way that the best stories should."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Apocalypse Troll is delightful","review":"In this humorous space saga the inter-genderal space fleet juxtaposes nicely with our all-male terrain military as does the future mind with the not-so-future humans. My husband had quite a ferocious glint in his eyes, so I know Mr. Weber's ingredients have been blended together to make a worthy & potent piece of work. I enjoyed the adventure, the new ideas, vistas & possibilities & I'm not going to give away a thing! You have to read this one for yourself.

But more and more I feel it's style has been fading into medeocrity. The vocals are less out there, the feel is more techno at times (I dont think you really mean it) and even their live show has chilled a bit.With songs like something for nothing, you can tell the band has really been influenced by their own local scene, and while they still rock, they also have lost their comedic edge.If you want songs like Norris that you can rock to and laugh at, listen to a band like Tin Soldier Empire. If you want a slightly serious Post-Industrial album that you can still jam out to with the windows down and the volume up, listen to Friendship Forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-teen fodder","review":"The review below pretty much sums up my opinion as well.

The L-hook is functional for items that have a moderately large haning hole. However, the L-hook doesn't work well for smallish holes that the J-hook would work for, the covering on the L-hook is too thick and more like a foam than a plastic coating(the kind you get on Channel Lock brand pliers). The thicker, tacky coating on the L-hook limits the kind of tools it will hold. If you pull a tool off to quickly the tackiness can cause the hook to come off the gear track/wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for mounting firearms (rifles / shotguns) horizontially","review":"Tried these for hanging rifles on standard slat wall. Problem with these in traditional slatwall is that the extra tab that points straight up will not fit in standard MDF based slatwall that is commercially available (ie Spacewall). But with some quick bending over of the tip upon itself with a vicegrip or grinding it down, the hooks fit perfect. They have a nice heavy rubber coating that doesn't mar the stock or barrel. The Jnis perfect for holding the barrel end and the L is large enough to support a large rifle at the hand guard area. Just very expensive but a beautiful finished looking display and product. Another benefit is the bottom tab. Unlike some slatwall hook that are just supported by a top tab, these don't tend to pull out away from the wall when an item is removed because its captured in two slots. Good product just pricey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Assault on Ul-Drakken","review":"A Drow priestess and head of the house of Vrama wishes to unite the Drow people in a war against the surface world and the pcs are just the pawns neccessary to make this happen.

Pretty weird.....especially the part where the evil brother stopped his brother Cliff from killing the father of the family they've been trying to hunt down that whole time!! The reason for this was...\\"you're lucky I like you!?!?!?\\" OK, they've been chasing this dude down like madmen from hell, now one of them stops his brother from killing him because he likes him? Then they ride off with his daughter, while the father tries to chase them down in a car, and they try to shoot at him on the road. If I were Craig Sheffer and Christopher Lambert, I wouldn't use this one on my resume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the nursery","review":"This is a beautiful, sturdy, high quality changing table.

Unless you toss them in the washing machine after every use, it is very hard to maintain them and dry them.After using for a few weeks, the bottom of the boots began to break. There are holes on the bottom towards the front of the boots (we do keep his nails clipped frequently). They are no longer waterproof anymore. The company's website stated that \\"many dogs have worn their Muttluks for over three years\\", but it only lasted just over a month for our dog. We never use them on dry pavement or concrete.

The intrigue of this book is the unfolding of the story and learning how each woman made an impact on this man's life and how he reacts to that impact. The characters are fun, real, and engaging.

Another short video clip of Joe, Jr. greeting and shaking hands with his fellow Liberator pilots seems to give a glimpse into the politician he may have become had he lived. Watching him, it is certainly clear to see who got the looks in the family. This documentary is also a wonderful trip through recent American history. Whether you love or hate the Kennedys, I think you'll find this program interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for older homes","review":"The book is much too thorough in some ways and not thorough enough in others. It is too through because the author will go on for pages about Ohms and Btus and Watt hours to the point where my eyes glazed over and I found it a very good sleep aid. He doesn't know how to get to the point and put his suggestions in an easy to understand synopsis. Other topics are covered in an almost off hand way or not at all, for example, we own a house built in 1912, and for us this book was nearly completely irrelevant. There is no discussion of the issues facing a homeowner with an older home. So if your looking for an easy to understand, easy to apply book that will help you make your home more efficient and save money, look elsewhere. There is certainly lots of information in this book, if you like sitting down at night with your hot water heater's manual, this book is ideal - but I didn't find it easily understandable or useful and can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tempelriddaren (av Jan Guillou) - Book/Bok","review":"Arn har hunnit fylla 27 och ?r redan en ?rrad veteran bland korsfararna i Det heliga landet.

While it is adjustable, just how it is adjustable is a bit deceptive. The links appear to be held together by screws. In actuality, the links are held together by rivets (for the lack of a better word) that are pressed into a hollow shaft. So instead of unscrewing the pins, you actually have to pry them apart. With that bit of knowledge, it's fairly easy to adjust the size of the bracelet. My personal suggestion is to use a toothpick or straight pin to put a drop of super glue into the hollow shaft when replacing the rivet to help prevent it from working loose. Also worth noting is that because of the overlapping link structure, the links have to be removed in a \\"set\\" of outer and inner links so they'll fit correctly. Now that mine is just a few links smaller, I love this bracelet."},{"rating":"1","title":"good service","review":"I got this bracelet extremely fast. Unfortunuately my boyfriend did not like it.

I don't really need to stay in a certain position to get the steam all over my face. And after I was done with it, my skin did feel very very soft and bouncy.It does its job well and right. Maybe I would like the cord to be a bit longer than it is?!And I do have one other thing like some other people do:In the instruction regarding how many pinches of salt, why don't they just use a standard measurement like 1/3 or 1/2 of teaspoon of salt, instead of how many pinches of salt and stresses again it's \\"pinches\\" not \\"a lot.\\" That cracked me up a bit.So, yes, salt did help generate steam. (I have city water.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product so far","review":"The facial is very basic in operation. The tank is a bit awkward and bulky.

Had I seen it in a store, I would never have purchased it even for $5 let alone $30. Cheap construction and no steam output even after 30 minutes of fiddling with it to get the proper \\"salt content\\" for the unit to operate. The box it came in promoted it as a room vaporizer. The Conair steamer I had years ago did not have the huge tank to double as a room vaporizer- just a little concentrated area for water and a huge, concentrated steam output. Cache Beauty flatly (and rudely)refused to refund the shipping cost for a defective item and I am now out the $8.80 they charged for shipping PLUS the cost to send the piece of trash back to them.

You just fill it to the waterline, add a pinch of salt (more if you use kosher salt), put in the heating element, the plastic facial thingy and plug it in. It starts to steam almost immediately. Lots and lots of steam. The opening is wide enough to steam your whole face. But the steam is VERY HOT, so don't get too close. And the plug gets hot so use it w/a surge suppressor. After awhile, the plug will get too hot and you will have to buy another one. Every 3-5 years depending on usage. (and you WILL get another one). I'm ordering my third one now.

That ranking is by looking at the albums as a whole. Now if you're looking for an album that rocks, I'd recomend 'Oh, Gravity' first and then this one, but i like the overall feel and flow of the music better on this one. The songs seem 'truer?'.

I thought that was one of the most solid, original sounding rock albums I've heard in a while. How does 'Nothing is Sound' compare? Well, most of the tracks aren't as original or artistic sounding as on TBL (IMO), so it will probably appeal more to fans of mainstream rock (and therfore generate way more $$). Don't get me wrong, there's definitely a few tracks on NIS that I absolutely love ('Happy is a yuppie word' and 'The setting sun'), just not near as many of 'em as on their last album. Speaking of 'Happy is a yuppie word', listen to it loud on a good stereo, then turn it up even louder right when the 3rd chorus kicks in... you'll see what I mean! :) If it weren't for those two songs I'd probably give the album 3 stars.

I have always considered myself a fan of Edda Dell'Orso, since I first heard her 4-octave ranged resonance in the early Eastwood movies.However, this album, is to me, more a collection of period pieces--more a compilation of 60's and 70's second-rate B-movie Italian soundtracks than what I'd consider big productions. There's no English whatsoever on the album, or song titles, which is no overly unexpected, but I thought at least the movie titles might be footnoted.The recordings are clear, but lacking in spark, resonance, depth of sound, and in general, are flat in their performance and rendition. I'd offer it up for sale as used, but I don't know anyone I'd sell it to in good conscience.However, if you're a glutton for it, and your curiousity is unending, take it from me for $12 shipped. moredes@hotmail.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"This product belongs on the shelves of the \\"Dollar Store\\".

That sounded great to me, but when I actually read the book, I realized that \\"the lazy way\\" meant \\"hiring servants to do everything.\\" Unless you have a significant amount of disposable income, this book will not be of much help. Ms. Ahlgren's suggestions frequently come down to the same basic message: There is no problem that cannot be solved by throwing money at it. As a young, married professional and student, I cannot afford to hire a housekeeper, a cook, someone to pay the bills, a gardener, and a complete suite of office furniture.

They hold bigger bars of soap, the 250g bars that won't fit in the store-bought plastic boxes. They look classier than the plastic ones too. They hold up well (eg, don't take scratches).The only neg is that they can be very difficult to open.

Large size, closes tightly, and great for my large bars of Reincarnate solid shampoo. It hasn't rusted, and I dropped it on the tile floor a couple of times and it hasn't bent.

Bland \\"good\\" characters being forced into actions (or should I say reactions) by the marginally more interesting evil characters.

The characters are not well written, short sighted and entirely selfish in their goals. Even though the author tries to add interest with multiple story lines, she doesn't keep track of all the characters well, so while one character is doing one thing you have the distinct impression that the others are just sitting around doing nothing. There are hints at interesting cultures and settings, but the author ignores them and focuses on going forward with a plot that I cannot bring myself to care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a wonderful fantasy story that has a very interesting and different plot. Her characters are very well developed. I enjoyed it and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprise Hit!","review":"I saw this book in a local bookstore and was attracted to the beautiful cover art. This book was a pleasant surprise, far exceeding my expectations. It was very fast-paced, but the characters were not one-dimensional, I was sucked into the story and stayed up late to finish it. I felt real sympathy for the hero's plight, and also for the servant girl who was not a servant girl. Kind of nice to see such a strong female character in one of these male-dominated, sword and sorcery novels! This was a very well-thought out plot, somewhat with the feel of George R.R. Martin's \\" A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, without the ponderous, complicated buildup of plots and subplots (don't get me wrong, I love that series also, gave it five stars). This is no Lord of the Rings, but its a heck of an entertaining read, that will keep you up late at night trying to finish it! I look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Book - Intriguing World","review":"I read the Publishers Weekly review and was very excited to read this first book in the series, but on the whole was quite disappointed.While the world is reasonably interesting, and, for some, the existence of magic and limited technology side by side will be intriguing, the characters could not be less compelling. I never got the impression that any of the subject characters had any thoughts beyond those put on the page. They're flat and overly simplistic. Even the politics in the world are extremely simple. Kudos to Ash for not going down the well travelled road of the typical fantasy adventure, but she needs some serious seasoning before she can create people that truly live and breathe in the mind of this reader at least. This reminded me a lot of George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire books, but they're a pale imitation at best. I'm afraid I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for managing to think of using Tsarist Russia in fantasy","review":"The author deserves credit for developing a Russian-themed world as the background for her story. The curse of the principal character is also interesting.And that's about it.Extraordinarily sparse characters and a pointless and uninteresting plot combine to render this book an utter waste of time and money.I'd rather re-read one of the latter Wheel of Time books than finish this book, let alone continue with the series. That's how bad it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"more stupid decisions and plot twists than a bad movie","review":"I love good fantasy. This isn't it. Every character makes unbelievable bad choices at almost every point possible. How can you garner sympathy for any of them? During the climatic battle the ruthless ruler (Eugene) cries like a schoolgirl when his no-longer-necessary protege Jaromir gets killed in yet another unbelievable sequence of stupid mistakes. Sarah Ash doesn't know how to write about male characters, that's certain. She should put her next fantasy novel in a world entirely peopled with females.

It has an interesting premise, but wasn't a page turner. It was hard to get into, but once you get about 75 pages in things do pick up (although not much).As I think others have mentioned, the characterization seemed a bit too convenient at times. I have to say that Gavril's mother really was annoying - such an idiot! Kiukiu seems to change too quickly to be believable - she ends up mastering new skills that take others years to master. And as for the feud? The resolution is unbelievable, as is Gavril's solution to his problem.Check it out from the library.

It allows a full 5,000 gram weight instead of the 2,000 gram weight limit available on most scales. I use my scale to keep track of the weight of my pets, and the higher gram limit really helps. I love that it weighs in both grams and pounds, as I can easily see what a 3,000 gram object weighs in pounds with just the touch of a button.

I tried to see if the book goes around it after awhile but had to stop reading it.It may be factual but there is a lot of synthesis of white men and religion being the point of destruction for the Wappo in their way of life and as a people.I wanted to learn more about the Wappo and their life... not how abusive white men are in the name of the church... or the Spainiards etc.I had to throw the book away because it left such a bad vibe in me that I didn't want it in my house.I love my grandmother even though she has passed away but this book is not such a good idea in terms of transcending the spirit of a people. It only attempts to abash history to make a case for these people in time.Chris Beard"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Being an avid fan of the original Dune series, I was quite excited to see the story brought to a conclusion. This book should not have any claim on such a title. Now I wasn't expecting it to be written like the elder Herbert, but this novel was written like a rehashed, burnt-out version of Herber/Andersons prequel trilogies. Very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book.","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read. Period.Too bad I didn't read the reviews on Amazon before I bought it at a brick-and-mortar store. It covers 19 years of utterly boring non-action, punctuated by a few brief ninja-type murders, written as if by a severely disturbed 5-year-old.\\"Repugnant\\" would be too kind a description. The editor and publisher of this tripe obviously did not read more than the last few pages, which were slightly better than all the preceeding ones, but which had nothing to do with the story! This book is a rip-off of the first magnitude.Any writing awards Brian Herbert has ever received should be revoked, with extreme prejudice.The only good thing about this book was: reading it in bed could put me to sleep almost instantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming qualities","review":"I am usually willing to give the author the benefit of the doubt, but this book is unbelievably bad. The characters are flat, the plot is predictable, the dialogue is juvenile and the pace of the book is slow. While I admire Brian and Kevin for attempting to continue the Dune saga, it is truly astounding that they and the publisher felt this volume does so satisfactorily. I don't recommend this book, even for fans of the series. I refuse to spend any more time on such horrible writing, so I am planning to read an online plot summary for the final installment (\\"Sandworms of Dune\\") and recommend you do the same for this book. Thoroughly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omnius and Erasmus NO!","review":"I almost collapsed when Omnius and Erasmus popped up at the end of this thing.

Yeah, I'm sure Frank Herbert imagined Daniel and Marty as being two slapstick robots who like to dress up like old people. Brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These characters are just plain stupid!","review":"The thing that bugs me about these prequels and sequels to Dune, is that the characters just are just not as *subtle* as Frank Herbert's characters were. It's like a keystone cop parady of the Dune books. What's with the Honored Matre reverend mother's who, after undergoing the rigorous mental and physical training to get through the spice agony, can't control their tempers? Heck, all the the characters in this book are just plain stupid. They do dumb things and they don't behave rationally. _Hunters of Dune_ is kind of pathetic when you measure it against the masterful novels of Frank Herbert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank Herbert's writing style versus Brian & KJ's","review":"I would be interested to read these books since I had always hoped to 'see how it all ends'. Unfortunately when I picked up the first collaberation between Brian and KJ, although the writing was good as to be expected, it just wasn't Frank's Dune.What is baffling me though is where people have complained that Frank Herbert's writing is more of a difficult read then reading the new series of books. Since when has Frank Herbert become a difficult read compared to what...The Cat in the Hat?I only hope that these new books bring more fans to the original books, but who knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong story; perhaps too much new/old integration","review":"While I very much enjoyed this book, you could really tell what parts had been layed out in Frank Herbert's original notes and what parts Brian Herbert and Kevin J, Anderson filled in. The integration Frank's origianl Dune universe with the prequel series by the younger Herbert and Anderson seemed a little disjointed at times. I'd certainly recommend this to any lover of the assorted Dune series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"I love this book and can't wait for the last one!To understand this book, you definitely need to read the Dune Prequals, but it is worth reading all of the prequals and the entire Dune series to get to this action packed, suspense-filled book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peace Be With You Always","review":"This book was okay, but in this hermit crab's view it would have been much better if there weren't so many books to keep track of. After all, this is the 13th book in the series and it still won't end even after the next one! Any series that takes that many books to get the author's point across should be shortened and makes this hermit crab wonder: Is it true that these authors could possibly be using this series to make money, so they can get their own series going? Just a thought! Anyways, with this being said, this book does tie in all the other 12 (!) books together nicely, and i'll read the next one to see how the series ends, but the Paul of Dune trilogy will most definitely be skipped. P.S.: Nobody has mentioned that this story is basically a rehash of the other 12 (!) books in the series, although it was good to see some old friends again. I guess that makes it worth a read, if nothing else. Peace be with you always!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dune, the MOST Briilliant Sci-Fi Series of all times","review":"I have waited for almost 20 years for this book.....and it was worth more than I paid.....can't wait for Sandworms of Dune...Bravo Guys, keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunter of Dune","review":"This book was well up to the standards of the Dune series. I look forward to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"An embroiling read","review":"Hunters of Dune is a sequel to Chapterhouse Dune, but also to the prequels and side stories of the Dune universe, providing the beginnings of close. But aside from the knowledge that the book will end well and with closure, things are not going so well for the books inhabitants.Prepare for suspense and satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the Prequels","review":"I sort-of read all of the prequels as they came out. I got bored and skipped a lot of the descriptive sections. Then I forgot about Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson until I happened to come across them in the public library the other day. Chapterhouse is/was/will be my most re-read book in the Dune series. I've been waiting to find out who Daniel and Marty were for 15 years since I first read the entire series over the course of weeks. This book... well, I didn't skip a paragraph. No, it wasn't Frank Herbert. You could see through the writing far too often. But I never got bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready to Continue...","review":"Other than the bad cliffhanger ending, a good read in the series. Now, a query of the authors: you have given us the back story of most people and/or groups in the Dune series, all except for the history of the Bene Gesserit. As we follow them into the future, it would be great to somehow learn how on earth Serena Butler's consciousness entered the good witches' timeline -- I don't recall any reference to the Sisterhood in that volume. Just for instance.Of course, I'm waiting for the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but weak","review":"Since I love the Dune Universe I was very excited to read the book and discover what happens to my favorite characters, but I had some problems with it.The book is very predictable and has none of the intrigue or surprises of the orginals. I loved Frank Herbert's complicated characters and far reaching storylines. This new series suffers from predictablity and rather bland writing. I know I will continue to read the series but I do not give this a high recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please let it be over....","review":"Well I did it again. I had promised myself that i wouldn't waste my time or money on another bastardization of Frank Herbert's work. Each of the \\"new\\" Dune novels had left me with a progressively worse taste in my mouth. Frank Herberts novels were a study in subtlety, you were forced to THINK about what he wrote. His characters had dimension, they FELT real. Frank Herberts novels were a 7 course meal. The New Dune books are bubble gum by comparison. I almost named my son Duncan...I'm serious. I'm sooo glad I didn't. If there's anyone out there with some talent and a love of the Dune universe, please write a book! I swear on my Frank Miller Wolverine miniseries that I will not buy another Novel that has \\"Brian Herbert\\" on the cover. On another note, what do you think about starting an on-line fund raiser to pay James Cameron to make Chapterhouse?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and transparent","review":"I have enjoyed the Dune series but this was a disappointing read. I'm not sure why the authors felt the need to tie everything up in a neat little package. Since when did Science Fiction stories have to end \\"happily ever after?\\" Frank Herbert may have left notes in a safe deposit box for a reason ...maybe he never intended them to see the light of day.Read this if you've read all the other Dune books, but don't set your expectations too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I don't know what else to say other than i felt taken advantage of after reading this book. Everybody knows that FH never intended Marty and Daniel to be the lame robot characters from the crappy prequels. FH would turn over in his grave. All the characters are cliched and one dimensional if anything people will read these out of sheer nostalgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Frank Herbert's Dune...","review":"I won't try and improve on the several thoughtful reviews that preceed mine. This book in entertaining in the same way a comic book is entertaining. It is all exposition and the characters are like card board cutouts. Brian and Kevin - I have read every Frank Herbert novel, most of them three and four times. Gentlemen, you are not Frank Herbert. I for one would appreciate it if Brian would stop kicking his father's bloated corpse down the beach, and try and make it on his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Narration of the Audio","review":"This review is only concerned with the narration of the Audio.If I were to rate to the story it would be a 1 star. The deficiencies in the book are pointed out by other reviewers and I feel that I have nothing to add.The narration is by Scott Brick. Scott has a pleasant sounding voice and at first I thought he would do a fine job of narrating the book.Scott's style is simple. He reads the book.When the character's are speaking in the book, Scott will slightly alter his voice.With the male character's it becomes annoying that Scott was the only narrator. When Scott tried to alter his voice for the female characters, I had enough.Rather than try pathetically to sound female, Scott should have just kept his normal voice.Absolutely horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, unredeeming","review":"When I first heard that BH/KJA were writing Dune 7 based off some notes they claim to have found, I was all excited. Like any Dune fan after reading 'Chapterhouse Dune', I was left wanting more. I patiently read the Butlerian Jihad and Royal House trilogies, feeling disappointed in both and impatient for them to write Dune 7 already.Alas, this book was better off not written at all. I slogged through it, patiently reading about the struggle between the Bene Gesserit and the Honored Matres, the drama between the gholas on the Ithaca, Duncan Idaho struggling with his addiction, Sheeana trying to figure out her destiny, some drama from the Face Dancers, and a whole bunch of other junk. And then I came to the end of this book. What? After all that drama and meaningless action I have to wait for another book? I was hoping that Dune 7 would be better than the two trilogies penned by Brian and Kevin, but alas. This book holds NOTHING of the essence of Frank Herbert's Dune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"As with the rest of the Brian Herbert/Kevin J Anderson Dune books, this is a clumsy, bungling attempt to continue Frank Herbert's mighty example. The quality of writing is at times so poor as to bring tears to the eyes of any fan of the original Dune novels. Were it not for the weight of his father's reputation, Brian Herbert would surely have been laughed from the world of professioanl literature years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are Earth Based Religions used in a Dune Universe","review":"Why the odd introduction of an Earth based religious entity. Really: Karbala, Judaism Rabbis, Martyrdom are out of place in a fictional Dune universe. Other than promotion, why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT IS ALL A LIE!!!","review":"It is not complicated to see why \\"Hunters\\" and \\"Sandworms\\" are awful sequels. It's based at least half on the novels of BH+KJ, not wholly on F.B.'s. Plus, I thought it pretty obvious that the elderly couple were a highly evoled species of Face Dancers. That most likey was the true threat to humanity. What you need to realize is that Face Dancers are just another form of A.I.. The Robots were never really intended to be a threat. From what I can gather, according to interveiws and early writings, the real \\"ancient enemy\\" were humans using machines to enslave other people. Then there was a religous revolt, stated in the books. SCIENCE VERSUS FAITH. Face Dancers v.s. a new free humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"539 pages for what","review":"I waited until Sandworms came out to read this book so I wouldn't have too long to wait for the end.In the end did it matter, no.At 539 pages this book was about 480 pages too long. In the end nothing of benefit happened. How can they write a book this long without any sort of conclusion?There is nothing in this book that couldn't have been covered by a prologue in the next book. In the last 5 pages they summed up 15000 years of the enemy, had they done this with the other plotlines we would have had a lot more time on our hands to read something with a point, or maybe that was refreshing.Skip and hope Sandworms references this book, just as this referenced the other 12 at great length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brian is not his father","review":"Frank writes at a college level and Brian writes at a middle school level. I was glad the story continued, but if you're looking for the genius of the first 6 books to continue you can forget it. This book is not particularly insightful, philosophical, subtle, clever, or captivating. It's the backup qb that tries to finish the game, or rather not lose it. Things get even more painful in the second book, but all that being said, I'm glad I read them because I love this story more than any other I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"They shouldn't have bothered!!","review":"I have been excited about this book for quite some time, despite my reservations. I read the prequels and wished I hadn't bothered. I didn't even bother with the Butlerian Jihad prequels. But this I had to read because it was based on his outlines. This book was written for twelve year olds who have never even read a Dune book. I'm tired of people saying that Brian should be given a break. He is not a good writer period. I read this thing so fast because I didn't want to waste any more time than I had to ."},{"rating":"2","title":"So tired of Honored Matres and torture","review":"I would be happy never to hear the term \\"Honored Matre\\" again. I didn't read either Heretic or Chapterhouse, but have read all the other Dune books and prequels. In general, I'm fairly happy with all of them. I am getting a little tired of the torture angle, however. It just goes on and on, and a little could go a long way. When you are listening to the audio tapes (which are just excellent, by the way), you can't even skip over the worst of it. I agree with most of the reviewers about this particular book, in that no one is likeable. I sure hope this changes in the next book. But good or bad, it is still a continuation of the Dune universe, and worth it just for that (and the reason for 4 stars).At the end of the tape there was an interview with the authors. They mentioned further prequels, including \\"Paul of Dune\\", which chronicles Paul's entire life. I hope I am still alive when it comes out! I really love Paul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just want to know how it ends.","review":"I suffered through this book just to get to the end of the overall story. It's generally not a good thing when a non-writer is thinking of better sub-plots, while reading, than the author has come up with. All the characters and factions have lost the richness and depth that was in the original stories. I wasn't expecting him to live up to his father's standards, but this falls short of all my standards aside from correct spelling and grammar. I have never seen such bad execution of a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Paul Run, See Paul Fall Down","review":"Forgetting the original series, there is absolutely no character development at all. Therefore, this is much like reading a primer that should be labeled \\"kiddies of dune\\"...slow, repetitious, pedantic. But the reality is that this book doesn't just fail on its own. The original series was \\"an existential metaphore that told a story about the human condition.\\" But nothing can be learned from any of the utterly unrealistic and irrational characters in this book. Therefore, the failure of this attempt is infinately greater not because it fails to live up to the vision of Frank Herbert, but because it fails to even try."},{"rating":"1","title":"ignores the principles of \\"Dune\\"","review":"I am sorry but this and the book before are horrible. I am a huge fan of the original six Dune novels. I have not read the son's Dune novels as I have never been a fan of sequels or prequels written by someone else. I saw both \\"Hunters of Dune\\" and \\"Sandworms of Dune\\" were supposedly based on as 30 page outline that Frank Herbert had left regarding the end of the Dune series. I bought the book in the hopes that I could see some of the deep and intricate thinking from the original six books. I did not. These two books seemingly have nothing in common with what came before. I must assume that the outline was a work in progress as I cannot seem to find the emotional nor logical conclusion to Frank Herbert's work. I advise one not to read this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me try again","review":"The prequels of Herbert and Anderson are truly an abomination in the Dune universe. They remind me of the start of the movie \\"The Player\\" where the camera is panning around a film studio listening in at potentai movie pitches and you hear stuff like \\"The Graduate...Part2\\" - because true Art can't be improved on - especially by men of lesser abilities.The sweep and grandure of the original Dune novel is utterly lost in the terrible writing style of Herbert and Anderson. And their most unforgivable sin ( amongst many ) is the relentless repetion of the plot lines because they assume their readers are stupid.Frank never assumed that. And that's why Dune and Dune Messiah endure and all the post Frank Herbert sequels pale under any comparision.Not sure what happened to my earlier reviews of this book and of House Atriedes, so I am putting in my two cents worth again, back on the side of the real fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can skip this one.","review":"Hunters of Dune is supposed to bridge the gap between Chapterhouse Dune and Sandworms of Dune. It is a simple, repetitious, mind numbing story line with no suspense or surprise. There is no reason to read this story, unless you are going to read Sandworms of Dune. And if you do read Sandworms of Dune, there are enough references in it to the events of Hunters of Dune that reading Hunters is superfluous. If you are a Dune addict, and must endure every word to find out how the series ends, then read Hunters of Dune followed by Sandworms of Dune. If you just want to find out how things wind up, skip Hunters and just read Sandworms. If you aren't a big Dune fan, skip both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good service","review":"I have to commend the seller, the book arrived as advertised, it was actually in better shape than I had expected. It arrived in a timely manner also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been an avid fan of the Dune series since I first read Dune while I was in college about 30 years ago. I have eagerly awaited the release of each book in the series. I was totally disappointed with this installment. This book was a total bore to read and understand. Its plot line was uninteresting and I instead of enjoying it, I felt like I was reading it only out of dedication only. It has been a long time since I did homework, but reading this book seemed like I was doing it again. In the prologue the authors state that this book was written from original notes of Frank Herbert. If that is the case, then he should be glad he did not write this book himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different authors!","review":"I have only recently made it a goal to read all of the Dune novels. I have just finished the original six by Frank Herbert. I was ready to stay away from the additional books by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson when I read all the negative reviews. I could not have been more wrong to even think that! I have read less than 100 pages of this novel and I love it! Bottom line: These books are NOT by Frank Herbert! They are by two totally different authors even if one is Frank's son! It is not fair to even try to compare them! Therefore, I plan to read all of the novels in the Dune universe, no matter who the author is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"If you are a fan of Dune you will like this book very much. I couldn't give it 5-stars (reserved for the original along with Heretics and Chapterhouse). The story is a little too fragmented in that the story could have evolved into 1 1/2 - 2 books; however, it is well worth the read.The Butlerian Jihad through the Battle of Corrin would rank 4.5. Nevertheless, it works as a part of the Dune saga and I very much look forward to Sandworms of Dune to see what Norma has cooked up for The Enemy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunters of Dung Worst Book Ever","review":"The book deserves about a minus 10 stars.This is clearly the worse book ever. The book recounts events that take over a time period of about 35 years and make them seem like eons. Nothing takes place in the book. Most of the characters are murderous thugs who spend their time torturing each other. There is no plot and the characters are boring. There worse of it is the authors bring some of the most interesting characters in literary history and turn then into cardboard cutouts. Most of the book has scenes that involve pointless torture or people doing nothing.Again this is the worst book ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dumbing Down of Dune","review":"This book is simply an exercise in money-making for the authors. Hunters has all the subtlety of an elephant in a china shop. Herbert Jr should be ashamed of himself, debasing his father's amazing literary legacy the way he is... This is like reading Harry Potter after reading Shakespeare. Ridiculous. I've read fan fiction from teenagers that was better than this. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing.","review":"A lot of information is diseminated during this tale that leads the reader to look forward to some kind of climax. It never happens. It's basically unsatisfying and is a shameless cliff hanger. Do not read this book unless you already plan on reading Sandworms of Dune. The writing itself is just, OK, not lacking flow or rhythm, but void of the vivid imaging that was the trademark of Frank Herbert.I haven't read Sandworms yet, but intend to. So I can't just write this novel off as a waste of time, as I'm certain it is a necessary primer for it's sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but...","review":"All these books are worth reading, as long as you understand that Frank ain't writing them. If you start this book thinking it will be \\"Dune 7\\" in the old school style, then you will be disappointed, or releaved depending on how you viewed Frank's writing style. Large chunks of his series did tend to drag.I read all 12 books again before reading this one, and it was actually a bit of a relief to have a change. So what if the revelation that the old folks were the robots from the first books? Just because you figured that out early doesn't make it bad. Frank would go on about a new sect or group for over 100 pages without explaining what it was. I didn't particularly like that.Each to his own, but no Dune fan should go without reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"looking forward to a better \\"Dune\\" book next year...","review":"I first read Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" back in high school back in the 1980s, and loved every chapter.

I think Brian could have made two (maybe more) tightly-novels from this, concluding with his ideas from \\"Sandworms of Dune\\". But now it will only be two books; \\"Sandworms of Dune\\" is scheduled to be released in August 2008.The \\"Dune\\" legacy deserves a conclusion that rates better than \\"okay\\".

What we see today in the missing John Roberts documents. Yesterday in the Downing Street memos. And tomorrow in ...Do you wonder why Jewish and Catholic neo-cons support a born-again President? Why born-again evangelicals support Israel?

Anyone even fairly acquainted with Strauss' works will see that this is nothing better than journalistic ire served up as objectivity. Indeed, if one were to read all works with the closed-mindedness that apparently Ms. Drury brought to Strauss' works, most would fail, and certainly these would include Ms. Drury's heroes of the academic Left. At the very least, obscurantism was not manifest in any of Strauss' books.

Therefore make a list of the hook colors and sizes as these grippers totally cover the size listed on the grip of most brands of hooks.I am disappointed in the sizing in the package. Some of the little tubes are so close in size as to fit the same size hook just more or less tightly. But there aren't enough sizes to cover let's say all the sizes in a pack of new crochet hooks.

The workbook offers answers in the back and the exercises are challenging, yet doable. I also feel that the workbook's exercises help you apply the French that you're learning really well. When my teacher offered worksheets from this workbook to do in class, I found that what we were studying stuck better in my mind.

Now we actually have them on a rubber mat, so they don't move at all. I compared these to similar styles that they have at Petsmart, Petco, etc. The attachment of the rubber to the bowl at the stores looks really cheap, and you can see the glue. The seams on this bowl are very clean, and you can't see the glue. The construction looks much better this way. They do great in the dishwasher. We got the 1 1/4 quart bowls. She only gets a cup of food twice a day, and it is plenty big for that.

The rubber ring is rubbery, not plastic-y, so it does actually grip the floor.I am using this size (1.25 Qt) for water for my puppy and 2 cats.

I was tempted by the price and felt it was a much better value than anything I had seen at the regular chain pet stores. When I recieved the item I was pleasantly surprised. The quality exceeded that of which I was expecting. The bowl was well weighted, and the rubber not only prevented sliding but is definitely bonded onto the bowl. The first day we used the bowl it got pretty dirty but rinsed out like a dream. I purchased the 1 1/4 quart bowl for food.

The chapter on human rights is worth the cost of the book itself, as the west is in dire need of a sound notion of human rights and ought to jettison the ilusory notions of such as promulgated and derived from the philosophies of Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau.It is no surprise that Maritain played a significant role in drafting a charter on human rights with the United Nations.

I plan on buying the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense Reading!!","review":"I don't normally read much crime drama, but this book has turned me into a fan! Great plot twists, interesting and believeable characters, and a story that just won't quit. It was wonderfully gory and horrifying and I couldn't put it down. I am excited to read more of Connolly and see him advance as a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less would have been more","review":"If this was Connolly's fourth book, it would have been exceptional. As it's his first, it's staggering. The main characters are well drawn, especially Angel and Louis. But there are too many sub-characters and over and over again a name cropped up and I had to backtrack to find out who this person was. Also, the whodunnit part of the plot was obvious from a very early stage - I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it. But it was a bit of a movie cliche twist and I saw it coming a mile off. That said, this IS a good read. Grisly, exciting and at times darkly humorous (especially the dialogue between Louis and Angel). But a simpler plot would have made it more digestible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the top!","review":"Every action/serial killer cliche you can think of finds a place in Connolly's book. At times, I even laughed aloud. However, I couldn't put the thing down! Connolly creates a visual atmosphere that is both sickening and engrossing. I will definitely buy and read his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gory clich��","review":"Gangs in every city, painfully and boringly explained. Pitched warfare and lots of deaths all over the USA. Nobody else in America notices. They are only dead bodies. Girlfriend is so poorly charactirized she reads like tissue paper. She is useless in this story. Every one Bird meets is brutally killed but he doesn't seem to care. The trail of bodies he leaves behind are no big thing. He is only after \\"THE TRAVELER\\"!! Clue in creepy music. The ending was ridiculous, the reasons for all this death and destruction was nonsense. If you must read this, don't buy it, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take This Garbage Out To The Trash, Please!","review":"This novel is so bad. That is practically all I can say. The back of the book says an amazing thriller just like Thomas Harris's Hannibal. That I can definitely say is a BIG LIE! I thought the main character was very poorly developed. The book was VERY confusing in the event that it kept going from the present to the past without even telling the reader what time they were in. And suspenseful, GIVE ME A BREAK! I was so bored. Whoever reviewed this book and said it was good, obviously hasn't read a variety of suspense novels to know what trash is when they read it. Sorry Mr. Connolly hopefully your next novel is better, even though I wouldn't read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth finishing!","review":"Charlie Parker reminded me of Dennis Lehane or Michael Connelly's protagonists: all too human, wrestling with the insidious necessity of \\"the end justifying the means\\" when trying to stop someone who seems the embodiment of evil. I loved the tension as Connolly paints in the details of the surroundings before inexorably spiraling in on the horror of the murder scenes. The second half of the book has lots of brooding ambiance and breakneck pacing, using New Orleans and the South as its backdrop. This is a smart, well-researched book, and I hope that Charlie, Angel, and Louis return for another installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner, with only a few holes.","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, even with all the gore. However, I was a little disappointed in the branching off into way too many characters throughout the book, many not even relevant to the plot. But in spite of this, the writing style is good with a true \\"street\\" sense (which really surprised me when I saw the author lives in Ireland). Reading the book, you feel the authenticity of the locales, as if the reader resides in the places he writes about.A good first work. His next will be even better if he sticks to the plot at hand and doesn't scatter off in too many historical details of unnecessary characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Dead Thing","review":"Wonderful characters, exciting twists, and kept me on the edge of my seat to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A most laborious read.","review":"I could easily just say \\"ditto\\" to Mr. Gonnella's review. There was some clever writing and witty dialog in the fist quarter of the book. Then it bogged down. Too many characters, too many flashbacks, too many subplots...just confusion. I did manage to read the entire book and it got slower as it came to a conclusion...just the opposite of what I look for in a thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well researched, but way too dark","review":"John Connolly did his homework before writing this novel, but it was way too dark and entirely too predictable. I had both murderers identified 1/3 of the way through the book. When I finally realized that I was correct in my suspicions about 1/2 way through the book, I stopped reading it. I hadn't been enjoying up to that point and saw no reason to continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every Politically Correct Thing...","review":"...should be the title of this book.

Well-written, but painfully predictable and politically correct, complete with gay assassin and his lover, a thief, who help our hero battle \\"evil.\\" I have spent time around criminals, and I don't recall any of them being particularly heroic.

Since it was his first book, I reasoned that this was the one in which he \\"made his bones\\" in the Crime/ Horror genre. Well, I can see evidence of the books to come in this, his first attempt. However, I found this to be a bit bloated and long-winded. No doubt Connolly wanted to show his \\"chops\\" and start strong but fell into the \\"look how tormented I am\\" school of florid and sometimes silly exposition and \\"can you believe this?\\" piling-on of gore upon gore. We get it, John! Unlikely scenarios are coupled with long-winded psychological babble from who else?: a foxy criminal \\"profiler\\", who, of course, is drawn to our \\"tragic\\" hero. If only...As I said, his later stuff is more finely drawn and much tighter than this. Try one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, Gory and Good","review":"i'm glad I finally picked up this novel. Connolly creates a remarkably American novel, considering he lives in Ireland. He creates a violent, moody, atmospheric novel. This is not for the faint of heart. He creates some wonderful characters--most notably, Angel and Louis, the couple who happen to be criminals. The is probably too long, but the digressions aren't too bad. I figured out the killer (or had inkling), but still enjoyed it. His descriptions and ability to set mood are excellent.

It has too many characters and the plot jumps around TOO MUCH. I will give the author credit for trying to create something original, but in the process created something hard to follow.The opening of the novel was enough to hold my attention, but after 100 pages I could not care what happened, and could not keep concentrated on the many characters, and various sub plots.Despite high critical acclaim, there are better serial killer novels out there.Nick Gonnella"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good editor might have saved this book.","review":"The book is full of idiomatic English not appropriate to the locale - an Irish author writing about locations in the United States. Further, there were numerous technical errors about the operation of firearms. Most notably in the climatic scene. The story line needed tightening. The author's writing has promise when not ruined by the jarring technical flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous gore, choppy abridgement - bad combination","review":"Maybe it is better on the printed page, but the abridged tape of this Shamus First Novel winner left me cold. Maybe the editors chose to leave all of the gorey, grusome aspects of the book in the abridgement and deleted the \\"normal\\" stuff.In all events, my husband (a former policeman/army officer) didn't seem to mind the gore and maybe you won't either. It reminded me a great deal of some of the recent Cornwell efforts in terms of the kinky, bloody aspects.Still, we both found the taped abridgement to be choppy and confusing.

This book rates up there with Thomas Harris and is available NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"intense book","review":"Only want to say, don't be scared off by the reviews that say not for the squeamish and lots of gore, etc. I almost skipped it because of that. IF you've read Patrica Cornwall, Kathy Reichs, etc. this is nothing compared to them. I found it to be intense and a good read. It is not a fast read book. There's a lot going on and I skipped over the parts that were too violent for me. You can still enjoy the book.

Nope. I ended up skimming the second half as it got so ridiculously convoluted. The author kept introducing new characters that were inconsequential. The story could have been told in 10 pages.

Too many characters, too many story lines, and little indication where they would cross paths. I found the hero to be just an unpleasant person despite the sympathy one would assume would be generated by the tragedy he suffered. Put it aside after only a few chapters, which is not usual for me - generally I slog through to the bitter end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For The Squeamish","review":"Sometimes less is more. Connolly hammers the reader with so much violence and gore, that by the end of the book it is almost meaningless and the reader is numb. The plot line is unusual in that one mystery is solved only to flow into another. Although the writing is very good, I didn't find anything else in this story to recommend to others. Definitely not for the squeamish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"This book is a tedious read. The book starts promising: Bird's wife and daughter are brutally murdered and Bird (an ex-policeman and alcoholist) is (most of the time) busy finding the person who did it. The first 100 pages or so the book keeps you spellbound.Looks like a winner ... ? Well, eventually it is not. Bird keeps meeting many (too many) new characters page after page. He travels from place to place, with numerous flashbacks. The murderer is a real lunatic. He kills and strips the victims in various awful ways. But it is all too much ! This book is too complicated, and it lacks a real thrill. There is no focus. This book sure is a page-turner, in that way that you want to finish this book as soon as possible so you can read another, better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough to hold my attention..","review":"I would definately have to agree with one of the reviews already written. The opening of this thriller is superb, but after that the plot jumps around too much and there are too many characters introduced. I really couldn't get into this 'thriller' at all. By 1/4 into the book, I really didn't care who the Travelling Man was or what else he had done.If you are after brilliant thrillers, try Dennis Lehane or James Patterson ( I read 2 of their books in one sitting) while still trying to read Every Dead Thing, hoping it would get better..it didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Debut of a Major Talent","review":"So good, I bought an autographed first edition hardcover without knowing anything about the author.

Combines the best of Raymond Chandler and Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature meets pulp","review":"Reading Connolly is a grisly gruesome experience yet he writes so well that his books would fit as well in the literature aisle as the mystery aisle. I know that is a bit of a nebulous criticism, but perhaps I can explain it better in another fashion. He writes page turners that do not read at all like a page turner. His vivid descriptions, and clever metaphors sound more like Jonathan Franzen than Thomas Harris. I like his Charlie Parker character and I plan to continue reading this talented writer. He is my wife's favorite author at the moment, and she thinks that all recovering alcoholics should read the series. She doesn't expect me to understand that statement until finishing book three, Killing Kind.

Chronicles Charlie's transition from drunk NYPD detective to the snarky, sober,hard nosed PI he becomes after the tragic murder of his wife and daughter. Charlie \\"Bird\\" Parker along with his friends, ex con Angel, assassin extraordinaire Louis, and Rachel help him hunt down The Traveling Man...the serial killer responsible for his wife and daughters murder. A great introduction to this series. A must read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"The watch I received looks even better than it does in the display picture. The hour-marks around the face are notably more silver than the display shows.I have tiny wrists and this watch doesn't dwarf them.I can dress this watch up or down. I'm in dental school now so having the time on hand is very functional but having an extremely sleek wristwatch such as this one lets me feel very professional.For the price, this watch can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"PS, GA","review":"Just wore it to work today. Actually i had a hard time figuring out how to fasten it but looks nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"I received two compliments on this watch the first week that I had it. Nice, sleek, slim and very comfortable to wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible... Sounds way too repetetive...","review":"How can people compare the boring and unoriginal and repetetive sounds of disgorge to cryptopsy ? Thats blasphemy! Not to mention that their drummer is one of the worse in the genre by far besides cannibal corpse's drummer which both are lame as hell... Disgorge's \\"parallels of infinite torture\\" shoulnd even be consider a deathmetal album period, because to me deathmetal is talent,originality, great lirycs ,skilled musicians, which disgorge has none of that whats so ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best band in dm history... Period !","review":"Throught the years of supporting deathmetal and apreciating this genre ? I have to say that, no band has impressed more then disgorge... These guys are technical, fast, and most importand their music is not only satanic, dark , but also brutal to the point of making you go deaf. I recommend disgorge's \\"pararelles of infinite torture\\" for any one into brutal yet intelligent dm the rimends alot of cryptopsy as well. Go buy it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as their past albums","review":"Very different from the Cranial Impalement and the SLG album which had Matti Way on Vocals, and Consume the Forsaken. It's faster and somewhat technical but I didn't dig it.The vocalist sucks. That pretty much sums it up.I wish they could at least re-do the album with Matti way's vocals. I'd probably buy THAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good... but a little monotonous!!!!","review":"I really like Disgorge, the musicianship here is at the top, but the vocals and certain parts make's the album way repetitive, and boring in some parts. So, don't situate them on Cryptopsy's throne, they don't fit!!! The quality of their music is compared for the likes of: Devourment, Deeds of Flesh and etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the disgorge, i once liked...","review":"Speaking from some one who has disgorge's other albums such as she lay gutted, consume the forsaken and their other works... I didnt like disgorge's \\"parallels of infinite torture\\" at all and i was very dissapointed because, i realy love this band but their previous materiels were actullie damn good but parallels isn't. From the first song to the last ? It gets old so quick. Disgorge ? If your read this ? Why you didnt sound brutal like in your previous efforts ? A let down fan. Step up your sounds next time !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and interesting","review":"I used a version of this book as lecture notes when I took Lando's class on combinatorics a couple years ago. The material is incredibly interesting and very well presented--and not too complicated! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for one viewing","review":"I got this as a Christmas gift for a friend who's been interested in Mini Coopers ever since the original model came out. Mistake. There is information about the origins of the car. Portions show like stock footage from an AutoWeek show. Some shots are repeated in different portions of the DVD. Lots of time devoted to scan shots of different meets, especially the 40th Anniversary. \\"Stunning selection of images and photos\\" doesn't seem accurate. All things considered, the price is too steep for what's offerred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for spa's","review":"Bought these granules to treat my a/c drain line.

I've owned it for nine months, wear it every-other night (swap it out with another shelf-bra cami) and wash it 1-2 times a week (cold wash, line dry) and it's still like new.My only complaint is it runs small - - more like a sports cami, but if you're a 36E like me, you need way more than this level of support for sports!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I ORDERED","review":"Just received this....yes it's black like I ordered but has a BIG PINK \\"E\\" in the center of the top...I did not order a YOGA outfit...what is with this??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential 4 BB fans","review":"Tho not the 1st or best in-depth Beach Boys' bio (that's David Leaf's THE BEACH BOYS AND THE CALIFORNIA MYTH, 5 stars), Preiss's book is still compulsively readable, contains a ton of interviews & other material (some of it's new), & is livened up by many reprinted lyrics, & flashy art & photos \\"illustrating\\" the Boys' songs -- & also includes many photos from Guy Webster's originally-planned SMILE-insert booklet.There R few errors -- tho Preiss mis-identifies the vocalist on the SMILE track \\"Do You Dig Worms.\\" Overall, this is a flashy package, with enuf substance & info on the band 2 make it worth the price. & U could do WAY worse -- U could read Steven Gaines' HEROES AND VILLAINS by mistake...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Music Never Stopped","review":"The event was historical and the movie chronicles the evening as well as technology existed at the time. The music/sound is wonderful as you would expect from the Grateful Dead and their production staff. But the video quality lacks, especially if you are watching on a large format screen. The Grateful Dead has always been about the music, so this video is fitting with the band.Enjoy it as one of many, but I would not pick Closing of Winterland if you are choosing only one Grateful Dead video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, wow!","review":"All I can say is wow. The Closing of Winterland DVD is incredibly satisfying in every way. I am so happy to have this show on DVD. I remember watching it as a kid live on KQED and the performance has aged very well. The whole thing has this unbelievable slow burn sort of vibe to it. It's very intense and powerful. The video is as good as can be expected from the 70s but the sound is amazing. Kudos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth owning","review":"The Deads best years for live performances were 72-74 and 1977. This DVD (and all the extra's) highlights one of the best (if not the best) concerts from 1978 with a very diverse and lengthy setlist. Many Deadheads consider this an all-time top 10 concert (I'm not one of them). There are many 'top ten' versions of songs on here.With that said - the DVD (and CDs) are worth owning if you enjoy the Dead and you enjoy them live. The DVDs are packed with many extras and Easter Eggs (look for them). Worth spending the money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Song List itself speaks volumes about this show!!!","review":"To the kind \\"Head\\" who wrote the song list for this amazing show on the Grateful Dead's: Closing Of Winterland DVD. That set list tells every Head right there that this show has got to be a nice trip? Thanks for adding that on. I was almost going to do it myself, but you beat me to it. Good job Friend.I have this show on tape on a decent soundboard, but it'll be nice to actually visually see this show on the night they played this historic concert in Grateful Dead history.I own everyone of the Vault dvd's, and Dick's Picks shows, as well as attending over 50 shows in the course of 15 yrs. & having over 1000hrs. on tape. I could NEVER get tired of hearing or seeing a Grateful Dead concert.For some reason I thought this was coming out next week? I would have been at Best Buy or Circuit City yesterday in that case picking it up. I'm glad I came on Amazon.com to check on it. Keep these releases coming people.

It echos through the entire concert. I will be selling this DVD if anyone is interested. The packaging is the only redeeming quality of this poor product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off key and poor graphics","review":"Donna sang off-key most of the time. I suppose that's what she really did in concert, or at least in this concert, but I don't think this was one of the Grateful Dead's best performances by any long shot.Also, the graphics were terrible and annoying. It looked like somebody took a typewriter and typed over the picture as it was playing. \\"Happy New Year!\\" Ok, we get the idea, now please take away that stupid graphic. The Grateful Dead graphic wasn't even lined up. In general, the graphics deterred from the program, at least for me.It was great to see Jerry and he obviously was enjoying himself, so that is a good thing, but overall, I wouldn't waste my time to watch this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aaaah, The Late 70's, when people seemed happy","review":"The last year or two, i've discovered this and the led zep concert dvd from knebworth. both of which seem like they are new videos although shot close to thirty years ago. both have modern sounding sound, both sound like they were released yesterday to my eyes and ears, it was a magical time, people were healthy, they were happy, they were hedonistic and hearty, they were still alive. a great time for all who are still here remembering and loving those moments captured in time. this is a must have dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reverence","review":"The Grateful Dead always played in the here and now, with an instinctual knowledge of time, place and situation, and that was what always fueled and inspired their performance. That was never more evident than in this show, where they played with a kind of reverence and respect that was so spot on, a tribute to their audience, to Bill Graham and Winterland, to their hometown, and yes, to their past. But nothing here is self-conscious or nostalgic; there's no overtly sentimental farewell to the end of an era; there is, to the contrary, gratitude ringing with every note, and hope for the future. They were right about the future: they gave us a bright one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skagen Watches","review":"I like Skagen Watches a lot.I like the lightweightness and style of the mesh band.I had to return this particular watches because of the dial face.It was to small for me.I did get another skagen, very simuliar style but a little larger face.~Jane"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful","review":"It's a massy Textbook.

So there's that, and the \\"reissue of the jazz/funk drummer's 1976 album\\" in the description.. As anyone who is trying to get the mythical 2008 release would know, Stanley Clarke is not a drummer.

I don't feel it is described well by the manufacturer. I was able to find this item from Escort in two colors: Blue and Red.My corded adapter that came with my radar has a blue light for power and yellow for alert. So I would expect the direct wire \\"Blue\\" cord to have the same setup. Now apply that logic to this item, the \\"Red\\" direct wire cord. What I expected was red for power, and yellow for alert. However, this item is green for power and red for alert.The other indicators on my dash are a combination of red, blue, and yellow; no green anywhere.
