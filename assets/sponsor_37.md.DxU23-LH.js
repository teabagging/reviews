While it might make a passable reference book, I would not recommend it as the starting point of one's study of Ancient Greek--even though I haven't read any other learn-greek books, I am certain good ones exists; this book is just not one of those.Addendum: I have since purchased \\"Teach Yourself Ancient Greek\\" and I find it to be a much better self-study book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed.","review":"I saw some other reviews about the description failings of this GFCI plug.

If you have enough support, I think an enthusiastic novice could do this type of installation with a little research.Great product and company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality for used item","review":"Had this disc previously but it was too damaged to play.

I think this is a repackaging of the same songs, based on the other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE SHOP ACCESSORY","review":"Until I installed this retractable extention cord I had to deal with a cord hanging over my work bench. With this product just a little tug and the cord is out of the way, no tangles and its long enough to reach every part of my 20'x 20\\" shop. Installation was a breeze, I used the celing mount but would work great as a wall mount too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for the price!","review":"I've used this extension extension cord in my barn daily for the past 3 years before the cord started to wear out. Then I noticed it was rated for indoor use only (my barn temperatures range from 10-90 degrees) so I'm thinking it surpassed it's expected lifespan. The retracting mechanism worked well until this past winter when temps were in the teens, then it would retract with the last 1-2 feet dangling. It was fine when the weather warmed. I'm very pleased with this product and hope to find a replacement with an outdoor rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Cord Reel","review":"This is a great cord reel for the price.

Useful for so many things","review":"These are the best sharpies ever. Small enough to clip to your key-chain, but with the same high quality as full size Sharpies, these guys are very, very cool. The color selection is great and spans the spectrum of the rainbow. I especially like the green markers (light green, grass green, and aqua). With one of these on your key chain you will never be left without the means to jotting down a note. Everyone who sees these wants one; that's their only downside. I've had to give away about half of them already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!","review":"Rolling across a very mildly textured wall delivers no measurement. It keeps resetting every inch or so. The wall I chose to try it on is essentially flat, with a very, very mild texture.I used this measuring tool one time after it was delivered. I tried it on 9 different walls, including one with absolutely no texture, and it was not accurate on any of them. It went directly in to the trash after that.I owned it for less than an hour before I threw it away. I will never waste my money on another item from this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites","review":"A nice mix of classics that are soothing without being boring. I have this in my office and have found myself both happier and more relaxed when I play it. Because there are no real extremes in volume I can put it one low and have it in the background during a meeting or turn it up when I'm by myself.I recommend it was antidote to stress and crabbiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cokin P060 Incolor 1","review":"Has a clear spot in the center which has no filter effect. The surrounding area is colorless with diffuser effect.This means that the subject in the center of the picture is reproduced clearly while the surrounding area which is often distracting is changed, usually colored or darkened. The main area of use is for portraits. The transition from subject to background, and also the size of the clear circular area, depend on focal length and aperture. The transition is more gradual when the aperture is opened wider. The circle becomes larger as focal length is increased. The circle becomes larger and less clearly defined if the filter is placed further forward. The distance between your lens and the Center Spot filter can be varied by using the Cokin Modular Hood and a Coupling ring ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The first time a tomato product touches this mat, it's ruined. I rinsed a pan with spaghetti sauce in it, the mat turned red and greasy. I tried putting it in the dishwasher and when that didn't renew the color (clear) I tried soaking it in bleach. The best I could do was a dull pink and as soon as I washed something with tomato in it, it turned red and greasy again. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Intend to Get and Read this Book","review":"I am blessed to be presently working with this wonderful man.

The only thing I'd like to see are Maneki Neko's that are taller! This isn't the only one, most I've seen online are < 4in.

They dont get used as much as my fronts, but they still produce good quality sound. The frame is plastic though so you need to be careful installing them. Otherwise, I am very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"The specs are misleading","review":"I purchased these speakers after reading positive reviews, hoping that they would live up to the specifications. They do look decent with gold-plated spring-loaded connectors. However, basic testing with wide-gamut music such as Erykah Badu showed that they lack both the bass and the treble. The sound quality is very similar to what you get with the standard (not premium) car speakers. Note that the claimed frequency response of 40 Hz -20 kHz does not specify the dB rating. In other words, these numbers do not in any way characterize how the sound output at 20 kHz compares to 1 kHz. I ended up returning the speakers. Maybe I am spoiled by my old floor-standing four-way Panasonics and three-way Technics..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I'm currently auditioning speakers for a new whole-house audio distribution system, so I installed these in one room as a test. The price is certainly attractive. My test room is fairly small with a low-ish ceiling so in my application the speakers must be used at relatively low volume/power. They are fairly \\"tinny\\" at low volume levels, with some improvement as you increase the volume. I would not recommend them as primary speakers for low-level background music. They might be ok for rear surround applications or in a very large room where they must be driven at higher power levels. For the price, they are pretty decent speakers, but not suitable for the application I'm planning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Value - Excellent sound","review":"I bought these to use mainly for background music in my newly finished basement. They were so easy to install, just cut out the circle with a sheetrock saw using the template provided, stuff insulation in the whole, push in the speaker and tighten 4 screws that open the mounting legs inside the hole and you're done. I connected my receiver and CD player to the 2 speakers I installed in my 15' x 15' room and I was shocked by how good the sound was. You could hear all the highs and no subwoofer required - the bass was amazing on these. As an added bonus they even allow you to move the tweeter in the center of the speaker and \\"direct\\" the sound any way you want. This is especially useful if you don't want all the sound blaring straight down on your head if you have a couch under the speaker as I do. So there you go - at around $40 per pair you can't beat these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitched Out","review":"Simplistic, trite, degrading to all who have struggled with this issue.

As you meditate on Christ's life though the sorrowful, joyful, and glorious mysteries of the rosary, you will begin to ponder your own life as a Christian. Your life will begin to change as you use this book. Not only does this book have a wonderful collection of rosary meditations, but you will also find beautiful meditations on the Beatitudes, as well as, meditations on The Way of The Cross that will open your eyes to the way you interact with others. If you want to change your life, read this book! This book is just not for Catholics, but for anyone who wants to change their life by becoming closer to Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad shape","review":"There was an abundance of underlining and markings in the book. It wasn't even possible to read it without being distracted by all of the notes, etc., in the margins."},{"rating":"2","title":"A literate baseball treat","review":"Pound for pound Roger Angell is the best baseball writer living today. Sure, you can follow the stat geeks and daily columnists (and I do), but Angell uses the stats as only part of the story. Writing for the New Yorker has afforded him the luxury of telling the stories behind the game, and it was in the pages of the New Yorker that I first discovered his penchant for weaving great yarns out of the game of baseball, in particular David Cone's disastrous 2000 season with the Yankees which is recounted in GAME TIME.Whether it is tracking down Bob Gibson, attending a College World Series match up between Frank Viola and Ron Darling with a nonagenarian Smoky Joe Wood, following a major league scout, or sitting with the owner of the San Francisco Giants to simply watch and talk about a game, Angell finds the humanity of the people that make the game so great. He even comes close to making me like Tim McCarver, but, alas, McCarver is still the worst broadcaster in sports."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Powers; what else need one say?","review":"I am currently making my way through Powers's books in a mostly chronological manner. I gave this one four stars only because I preferred _Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance_ and _The Gold Bug Variations_ (read out of sequence, of course), but measured against most other writers' novels this would probably get five stars. As someone else said, it starts out more modestly, and I thought I wasn't going to get the mind-blowing intellectual and philosophical richness I had encountered in the two other books, but then Walt Disney and the Japanese-American internment enter the story and things get really strange. This guy is an amazing writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powers guides the reader to an epiphany","review":"This book seems, for quite a while, to be more modest, more confined to interpersonal relations than Powers' other books. Then, suddenly, the reader's mind explodes with the realization of just what the Prisoner's Dilemma is, the realization of the scale of the human problem that Powers wants us--and the characters of the family that are the novel--to confront. This book is not light, casual entertainment, despite the humor that enters throughout. It is a book one cannot forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Novel of Ideas","review":"We can only hope that Powers can one day surpass his wonderfully brilliant Gold Bug variations, but this may be his second best book. The romantic strands and existential depth of this work are more like Gold Bug than that more intellectual, analytic and distanced treatments of Galatea and Gain. There is a real humanity to this book, while the characters struggle with the meaning of life, especially one life, swimming in (or against) the tide of history.Powers is not for all tastes because he engages one at the level of ideas (as well). But if you like that stuff, I'd first get Gold Bug, but then I'd choose this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writer, Story Tough to Follow","review":"I recently finished reading Powers' first novel, \\"Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance\\", and liked it enough that I decided to try some of his other work.Prisoners' Dilemma is a very complex novel. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I felt that the characters were the book's main strength - they are rich, conflicted and masterfully crafted. However, especially toward the end, I got totally lost. I could not follow the story.The first 100 pages or so were engaging and interesting, but the novel kept getting stranger, until at the end I was no longer sure what was going on. It could be that I am not as sophisticated a reader as I should be, but if you are like me, be aware that this book is a tough one to follow.Powers can craft a masterful sentence, and his prose is really great. My problem was that all this great prose never turns into a great story, for me at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"This book is terrible. I read it for my book club and everyone thought the first 100 pages were unengaging. I felt that none of the characters were interesting and only about halfway through the novel felt that the book was worthy of a second thought. That feeling dissipated however after further reading. There is no climax in the novel and thus the ending does little to satisfy the reader. Skip this book, and read Powers' vastly superior Gold Bug instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for all tastes","review":"It's rare that I truly despise a novel, but that's the case with Prisoner's Dilemma. Powers is so steeped in the intellectual tenets of his \\"novel of ideas\\" that he seems to have had no time to spare for things like character and plot development. The result is pretension babble uttered by a collection of stick figures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not half as good as its predecessor","review":"Of the four shorts on this DVD, only one Alkali, Iowa, is worth seeing. The other three have none of the emotional resonance of the three short stories of the first Boys Life trilogy. The acting in Must Be The Music was pathetic and the story almost non-existent. Nunzio's Second Cousin also lacked a purpose, and The DadShuttle was simply annoying. Rent this to see Alkali, Iowa but I wouldn't recommend wasting money buying it. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it save some money!","review":"The moive was good, what little there was, short doesn't begin to describe the length of each story. The film left me wanting to see a lot more, when can we expect to see the rest of these films? My plea to the directors, finsh them please. Each film could easily be a full length production. Oh well, they were good, I'm greedy I guess. I bought 1 too, so I need to sit down and watch it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of shorts!","review":"Here's another great collection of short gay films.

Excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and too bizarre","review":"We felt that the stories (except one of them) were far away from 'boys life (1)' and too bizarre. The surrealistic component was too strong for our taste. The stories miss the freshness and positive humor the ones in 'boys life (1)' have. We would NOT buy it again. The high price is not justified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatachable","review":"I found this movie, a series of short stories, to be boring and uninteresting. Film making is hard work and I congratulate the film makers for their efforts. However, I could not finish watching and do not want this movie a part of my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"My father, was he one of us?","review":"None of the 4 shorts on display are bad, but MUST BE THE MUSIC isn't very inspired, just 4 teenagers out clubbing and that's it. THE DADSHUTTLE is OK, featuring a conversation about mundane things between a father and son. Lots of words left unspoken there. Too long, though.The standouts are ALKALI, IOWA, a novelettish subject worthy of Checkov given subtle treatment by Mark Christopher. NUNZIO'S SECOND COUSIN is an actor's dream, Vincent D'Onofrio hamming it up something wonderful as a gay Chicago cop out cruising, being harassed by gaybashers. Eileen Brennan as his chatty Italian mamahas a jolly old time, as well.This is worth buying, for ALKALI, IOWA alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent product","review":"Holds all my DVDs and still room for more, however I don't think anyone should get anything larger than 400 or 450 because it can become combersome when trying to flip the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kholer Coralais cartridges problems","review":"Like another reviewer, the faucet was great for a few months. Then the handle began to stick for both on/off and hot/cold. It was hard to adjust he flow or temperature. It eventually developed a squeak like a rusty hinge. Kholer has been great sending out new cartridges (3 or 4 in the past year), but they only last 2 - 3 months and have to be replaced again. Who wants that aggravation. Loved the faucet at first. Now I will buy another brand. I have never had this problem with any other faucet. Sorry, but this faucet just didn't measure up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavier gauge = more power!","review":"Unlike the less expensive extension cords that are 14 or 16 guage, this one is 12 guage.

Remember to plug it into a 20 amp outlet and you'll be able to utilize the the heavier gauge cord for what it was designed for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional grade","review":"I have bought 3 of these.

However, it is wonderfully light weight and small and very easy to learn how to use. In contrast to another reviewer, I actually find it almost too hard to erase something. After pressing erase, you have to confirm it with a second toggle. Since I've usually already made sure it was the thing I wanted to erase, it's somewhat annoying. Still one day I'm sure I'll be happy about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Surprise","review":"Having never had a digital voice recorder before, and having only used microcassette recorders to record school lectures in the past, this little unit has turned out to be quite a nice surprise. The enclosed instructions are pretty straight forward and easy to understand. The display is pretty easy to read under most lighting conditions. The controls are few and easy to operate. The biggest surprise was the sound quality during playback; it also is pretty nice. If 4 1/2 stars was an option I would have chosen 4 1/2 stars and not 4. Each function I listed is accomplished rather well, but still not what I would call stellar. I do not say this to be derogatory about the product. In fact, it is in the products favor.

I didn't need the option of data download that the VN-3100PC provides, but it would be worth the extra $20.00 if I did.

The silver is very bright, no dullness at all, and very comfortable. My husband wears this necklace all the time. It's a good price for a high quality necklace. I would recommend this necklace to any woman who wants to buy a nice silver necklace for her boyfriend, husband or significant other."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD player","review":"I started out with a Classic brand CD player, and it wasn't all that great. So I found this one, and decided to get it. #1 it was good looking, #2 it had a lot of stuff that came with it, and #3 it was Philips brand, which I've heard is a company of great products.The CD player itself is pretty good. It looks nice. The headphones that come with it are okay, but I only use them occasionally. It's cool how they fold up so they take up less space when you are packing them. The remote is awesome, I always use it when I'm jogging or walking or whatever. It's very handy. The rechargeable batteries are okay as well, but they do take a lot of time to charge and they don't last forever.The ESP works very well, as does the DBB. The volume on the CD player is great, but with the remote you'd maybe have to turn it up more to be able to hear the same volume as you would without it.This is an overall great CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"ESP distorts high frequenices!","review":"The new technology of powersaving 45-sec ESP Philips has come up in their CD-players is also the bane of their AZ9*** models.The ESP actually distorts the high frequencies! I played Christina Aguilera's \\"Genie In a Bottle\\" and right at the starting part of the song, you could already hear the highly distorted sounds. Of course, these sounds are not present when I disabled the ESP. It is a nuisance that I have to disable the ESP everytime I start the player. (The player, surprisingly, is able to take quite a bit of shock even if ESP is off)For the sound quality (ESP off), the bass enhancement is good (2 steps), however, the treble seemed a bit lacking. Panasonic CD players seemed to have a brighter sound with their more acute treble sounds. The max volume output was also too soft.Therefore, this model and similar models (AZ 9***) are not recommended if you want good and consistent sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sound","review":"I tried this player because I've owned another Philips player (AZ7594 - discontinued) that is still unmatched as far as sound quality, controls, and accessories go. This player seemed comparable on paper, but I found the sound to be lacking -i.e. the bass was not that strong, the highs were too sharp and the mids were not full. Also the volume is definitely not loud enough and distorts the sound when turned up. I would not recommend this player for anyone serious about their music quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound with Extras","review":"The Philips AZ922517 CD player offers a lot for the money. The player provides super clear and crisp sound. And, unlike many other CD players I checked out, this one comes with a power cord and even a set of batteries! The headphones are light weight, cushy, and the head band doesn't squeeze. But it's all in the sound -- really impressive. One slight caveat -- the player seems to be made of light weight plastic so I'm hoping not to drop it or bang it too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this before going on vacation so I could keep my money on me while I was at the beach. It seemed to seal just fine when I tested it after receiving the product. However first time at the beach, my money got soaking wet.

This release seemed to go unnoticed by mostly everyone (including true Zevon fans if I'm only the third person to review it). Warren has never sounded better on cuts like Quite Ugly One Morning, Finishing Touches and the title cut, Mr. Bad Example. Heck, Warren even turns country on Heartache Spoken Here (with the help of country crooner Dwight Yoakam). This is a solid Zevon release. Everything you like about him is on this album:great musicianship, humor and irony oozes from most cuts, lyrical brilliance and good production values. It's easy to let great releases slip through the cracks sometimes, but go the extra mile and give this early nineties Zevon a try.

I recommend this book for all men who want to know what women want and for all young women who need to know what love and romance should be like. Barbara Samuels is such a good writer; she makes you feel like the hero is making love to you. Basillo is absolutely the perfect gentleman, not a rake, like so many other heros. This story is really good, and I enjoyed the plot. I liked the way she wove in characters from some of her other novels, too, but it's the love and romance that steal the show in this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable read","review":"Great book, I like the character's wit, passion and depth.

The story just goes on and on and on......blah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Mates","review":"I enjoyed Basilio so much that it made me mad. I know that romance novels are about wish fulfillment, but Barbara Samuels literally left me aching because Basilio is way too wonderful to be true.That said, what a sensuous, enjoyable read! The settings are so vividly detailed that I felt I had been to Italy, and stood on the balcony with Cassandra (nice touch on her name, although this Cassandra finds an audience for her truths). My only complaint is that the ending was not as vivid, detailed, and thought out as the rest of the book, which makes for a real letdown for a book that you don't want to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"More false readings than true ones","review":"I concur with Douglas E. Wong's review, and Baumgartner's comment to it. This is a very disappointing tool. I get readings all over the place, and have to use common sense to reject the bad ones -- of which there are many (the majority). Furniture and objects that you would expect to be out of the cone of measurement are in fact in it. I suppose if you only make readings in empty spaces, this might be a good value. Otherwise, save your money.As Wong noted, this is a sonic measurer. The red dot is \\"suggestive\\" of what you are measuring. It is EXTREMELY misleading because the actual cone of measurement is very wide (no matter what the specs say), and all sorts of nearer-by furniture will be measured instead.A different defect is that you have to press down the \\"Read\\" button hard to activate the device. The amount of pressure required is enough to make your hand & direction shift.What a pity, it had so much promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for distance to a barn","review":"Since this is a sonic measure it won't work unless your target is big and flat.

Worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Limited Use, Not Worth the Money","review":"As a window washer, I purchased this to measure building heights for estimating what ladder we would need for larger jobs. This device is worthless for that. It barely works outdoors and only about 3 out of every 10 readings are accurate. It has to be exactly perpendicular to the object being measured and nothing can be in the way of the sonic path or you error reading every time. I didn't realize that this was NOT a laser unit but a sonic unit with a laser pointer on it. Big difference! Save the $30 and put it toward a true laser measurement device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable technology","review":"With inexpensive lasers available which are quite accurate, why would anyone rely on the unreliable \\"sonic\\" technology (it is not a laser) used by this unit. Sometimes the measurement is correct, sometimes it is widly incorrect. You never know. The problem occurs with measurements that are \\"sort of\\" correct but not really and are not caught. These innacuracies can cost time and money later on. Buy a real laser instead and get reliable measurements the first time around. This is generally not worth the trouble. However, the little red dot is fun if you have a pet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight-line sonic laser....save your money","review":"Is it 21'3 or 23'5\\"?

Out of curiousity, I decided to buy the Strait-line Sonic Laser tape 50, wonderingif I could simplify my various measurement needs of my projects.My biggest complaint is that this device does not provideaccuracy of less than an inch. My second complaint is that theadvertising for it does not clearly disclose this fact.Due to this lack of accuracy, I can't find any real use ofthis device in anything I do. From my perspective, a waste of roughly $30.00on a piece of garbage.Hopefully there are other laser measure tapes on the marketthat are more accurate....for now I will stick to my old fashioned method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get anything else","review":"IT'S GARBAGE!!! Bought this item today at a big chain hardware store. It was the only non traditional tape measure the had. So unreliable there is no point in using it. I can get it to repeat the same wrong measurement with consistency. About 1 out of 5 times it will get close (+/- 3 inches over an 18 ft distance) but unless your already good at judging distances how can you tell when it's giving one of its better answers. There's probably a ton of technical reasons why it can't read accurately, like it not perpendicular to the opposite surface) but try as I may in my rectangular rooms, I couldn't get it to work right twice in a row."},{"rating":"2","title":"A family saga/romance novel, and so much more!","review":"Just finished [[ASIN:B004C0566W Green Grow the Rushes]. After a somewhat slow start, due to introducing the large and varied cast of characters and giving a basic idea of the personalities of each, this novel took off like a shot.More than just a family saga/romance, this book deals with the changes that the different characters make in response to changes in the times around them, and to changes in their individual circumstances. It also gives an interesting perspective on the very early days of the women's suffragette and trade union movements, and the beginning of the breakdown of the stiff and unyielding \\"class system,\\" all set in the early years of the twentieth century in Scotland.As in real life, there's tragedy in this novel, but also triumph; grave errors, but also redemption.

All of the 'fade to blacks' reminded me of a late night horror suck fest on a low budget cable network (CABIN BY THE LAKE anyone ???) It was slow, had many holes and no plot line but it was still good for a little fright at night. I thought I knew who the killer was but then it shocked me with a twist. That was good.

Everything fell into place just like one of those books.I knew there wasn't going to be alot of gore and stuff, and to be honest I didn't really miss it.

Man becomes immortal in soul/essence; capable of inter-relating to the universe and making the universe conform to our whims and wishes.

Second, the book provides solutions to the odd-numbered problems, but it was not uncommon for these solutions to be wrong (even the units were wrong!). This created a lot of frustration.

The fitting that attached the leg on the cart broke as I turned away from the check-in counter at the airport. The leg was attached to the cart with a plastic fitting - the weak point on the cart. When the fitting snapped the cart was useless because the wheel was attached to the leg.I thought that this would be a good lightweight cart but the construction was too flimsy. If I were to consider a lightweight fold-up cart I would pay more for substantial metal fittings.I subsequently had to purchase a small metal cart for more money.

I carry it in the side pocket of my big suitcase, and when I check the suitcase in, I take out the cart and enjoy the marvel of not having to carry my laptop on my shoulder the rest of the trip.I've seen some posts talking about the cart being hard to open up and close down.

It was explained how the alcoholic drinks could never conquer the world because they take too many resources of land and labor.

Furthermore, maiden fans should know that the \\"original\\" Wickerman on Bruce's 2 CD set is far heavier and lyrically true to Stephen King's vision. Say what you want about the \\"comeback\\" album Brave New World, but recognize the opener for the weak song it is. And you would think that a reunion tour would feature a classic maiden opener instead of this song. Yes, i did see the show and still thought all 3 guitars were inaudible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Famowood great for furniture repair.","review":"Famowood water based wood filler allows you to use it at your convenience.

Can never express just how much that I, personally love archive CD releases as such. Sort of lets us know that SOMEONE out there in the music industry is thinking of us TRUE rock&roll fans. 'Live In...' was originally a radio broadcast that came from Luxembourg. Eleven power house cuts of pure full-hearted sweat-in-your-face glam punk is what the purchaser gets when he/she puts this disc in the player.

She loses all credibility when she makes the outrageous statement that white boxers aren't as smart as fawns or brindles. No scientific data supports this view and anyone who has shared his home with white boxers, as well as the others, knows it is untrue.

I don't know where Ms. Hannibal got her information from but white boxers are at least as smart as fawn or brindle dogs - the original boxers were white, and many white boxers hold agility, obedience, tracking and schutzhund titles.

However, it is this abundance of information 'bits' that frequently left me frustrated and questioning why the authors would so casually drop in an incredible detail and then quickly move on with no further explanation.Nevertheless, the reader who has not studied this side of Japanese history will find new roads of thought in this wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album - BUT DON'T BUY IT!!","review":"This is a great album.

There was virtually no advertising or information about this film when it first came out. It just showed up on the shelves at blockbuster and people had to take a chance on it. I'm glad I did, because it is one of the best original science fiction films of the 90s. Charlie Sheen was terrific as the nerdy scientist Zane. Zane works for NASA and when he brings some strange readings to his bosses they ignore it and fire him. Unwilling to let it go, Zane travels to Mexico to uncover the truth, and you won't believe what he finds. It's a strong cast and a great story that is full of surprises.

Also, it doesn't have the three exposed screws on the either side or the concave groove at the front. Instead it is completely flat and has \\"ALLSOP\\" written in white.

When I'm typing and my desk shakes, or even from the vibration of music... the stand will wobble so that the computer monitor sways forward and back. I find this to be quite a nauseating experience. I feel like I'm getting seasick on a boat. I think I'll return this in favor of something more solid... or a couple of phone books.

I then picked this up for 6.99 and thought it was cool, then I was caught off guard by some songs (in a positive way), and this quickly became a constant fixture in my CD player... this is much rougher, faster, emotional, aggressive than its predecessor, and it's a really musically tight album... Damon moving to drums was a very smart move by the band, as he did a perfect job filling in for Travis from Blink on last year's tour... and his style fits Fenix TX perfectly. The new guitarist, James Love doesn't appear to be much of a punk band by the comments about him in the liner notes, but he definitely influences this band to go much harder, and they do it really well. This is a very strong offering by the Fenix TX boys, who have finally let go of their xerox-of-Blink-182 label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guys, What Happened???","review":"Fenix TX had one of the best albums of the year with their last effort, now they drop this album of semi-angry, non listenable radio rock on us?

Compared to their previous disc, this fell on it's face. There is almost no distinct punk sound, most of the songs are basically metal with some cheesy arena rock in there. You know, the kind that a studio band would make up for a pretend band on a tv show or movie. If you liked their self titled disc (which I loved and still listen to religiously) or you like bands like Blink, New Found Glory, or Allister - DO NOT GET THIS ALBUM - it sounds nothing like punk or pop/punk. Regardless of what some reviewers said, this is NOT punk, I mean, listen to the samples. Hopefully, they got this out of their system and can go back to making great music. (PS - if you don't already own their other disc, buy it. Every song is great.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Man-oh-man, why did spend [dollar amount] on this?","review":"I really dig punk and emo music. Ive heard about these guys for awhile and have even heard their infamous song, Phoebe Cates many times. So I figured what the heck it only has to get better. Boy, was I wrong. Several of the songs seem to be right out of the pop metal era. Play song #8 with your eyes closed and you'll swear you're listening to Tesla.I gave the album a shot. 2 of the songs are fantastic ( 1 and 7) so I fugured the rest would be the same calibur. I was very wrong. The rest of the cd seem to be Bsides of pop metal. The guys voice is great and its obvious they're very good musicians, just not at all what I expected. Don't confuse these guys with the Ataris or New Found Glory- they're much better.Here's some advice for future buyers: If you scoff and make fun of hair band music, DO NOT play this with your windows down. Unless you like wind blowing through your mullet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did it all go wrong?","review":"Their last cd was great and when they were riverfenix they were a lot more catchier and funnier. This cd sounds like they all have no emotion and it's disappointing. The punk is gone and in return are some cheesy hard rock riffs almost like on something bad is gonna happen. Phoebe is an excellent song, but overall I was disappointed with the cd. Even the hidden track is hard rockish after you get through the annoying minute and a half beep."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good buy","review":"I do agree w/ others who have written reviews: this cd is definitely a different sound from the self-titled.

I happen to like this cd a whole lot more than the self-titled while still thinking the self-titled is awesome. \\"Lechuza\\" is one of my favorites and I haven't gotten tired of it since the day I bought it. I had heard \\"A Song For Everyone\\" on the Drive-thru Records website and fell in love w/ it. To this day it is still my all time favorite song.

But their second release Lechuza does. They've changed their sound and for the better. They now instead of using the same basic cords experiment with heavier guitar riffs. And the songs are well written and performed. They over the period of time from the self titled album have gained alot more talent as an group. Now instead of stupid fricken songs like The Rooster Song,they have songs like Katie W.(best song on the c.d.),and the single Threesome. Fenix Tx has even surpassed their mentors Blink 182,and they did it so quick with such style you can't help but love Lechuza.

I'd definately recommend this to any Fenix TX fan disappointed by their first 2 releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sophomore Album","review":"This album far surpassed my expectations of these so-cal punk rockers. After listening to the Self-Titled for months and months and memorizing every lyric and every bass line, I was beginning to become bored. I also started worrying that this album might be a sell out, much like Blink's followup to their great Dude Ranch. And then this comes out and I am in awe. What was once a simple surfer/skater punk band has now become a full blown band of musicians. No more catchy riffs and easy licks, now its into three part harmony throughout and a variation of keys throughout the songs. This is much better than I had expected, and I wish Fenix TX luck with their musical careers.

Lechuza is less pop punk, more plain rock. As soon as I put Lechuza in my CD player, I noticed a big change from the self titled. I browsed the booklet and realized they had traded in their old guitar player for a new one. They lost the pop punk sound and thats what I liked about the self titled. I can't listen to more than the first 5 or 6 songs on this CD before I get sick of it and put something else in my CD player. I recommend downloading songs from this album before you buy it. I have to give them props for the song Something Bad Is Gonna Happen cuz its a good hard rock song and I also admit to liking Abba Zabba. Its not horrible but I think you could do much better. I wish I hadn't spent hard earned cash on it... save money for something better.NOTE: Threesome is the easiest song to find to download but don't be fooled, its one of the better songs on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked their first CD, you'll hate this one!","review":"Fenix TX's first album was great; it had a new, original punk sound that was energetic and powerful. Their new CD is the complete opposite! Fenix TX has changed a lot since they replaced their drummer with their guitarist and got a new lead. Their music now sounds like everyday alternative music made for the radio. The first five seconds of each song are interesting and then it switches to the same old alternative lyric style. Their music has become boring and uninteresting. If you loved their first CD, I recommend you buy New Found Glory or Less Then Jake, and NOT this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok movie, some good acting","review":"The beautiful Gigi Edgery is in this film, you know her from the Farscape TV Show.

No fancy special effects here, it's pretty low budget in that respect. Gigi, Jason London, and Cody Bell save this movie, since they are the best actors, and their scenes carry the movie along.

They'd been used for about 50,000 miles and it was long past time to replace them. I bought these because with the rebate they were as cheap as regular copper plugs and the designs seems less likely to foul (yet to be seen). But honestly, a plug is a plug for the most part.There's not too much to say, they fit correctly, installed easily, and the engine still runs. The truck seems to perform a lot better than it did before I changed the plugs (expected for any plug) and it feels about like new. I'm convinced that they're good plugs, but unconvinced that they make any difference over copper (other than in longevity, platinum lasts longer). If the price is right, by all means buy these, that's why I bought them.

The seat is extremely comfortable but it wont help you if your bike is uncomfortable as a whole.

I was hoping that the \\"extra gel\\" on this seat cover would relieve the pain in my tailbone; however, this cover makes the pain worse.

Imogen Stubbs was absolutely brilliant as Viola -- I found the scene where she confesses her love to Orsino without his knowing it heartbreakingly poignant, (\\"My father had a daughter ...\\"), yet there were plenty of laughs in the absurd situations. Nigel Hawthorne was also incredible -- both funny and somehow pathetic in his delusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare at His Comic Best","review":"As one who minored in English and got an A is Shakespeare, I have made it a point to attend as many of the comedies wherever performed for many years, including at the Folger in Washington. But this is my all-time favorite film. As often as I have watched it, it always gets better each time.Unfortunately, the intimacy of a Hollywood staging strains the credibility Viola's impersonation of a boy (since in Elizabethan theater all female parts were played by boys), but every major character is well cast, and the authentic British acting is superb throughout. I am always pleased by Shakespeare's way of developing at least three plots fully, holding the suspense until the final scene, and then matching up everybody perfectly, even better than if they had made their own witting choices, in this case.Lovely story, lovely leading ladies."},{"rating":"2","title":"To good for words!","review":"This was the first and definatly not the last Shakespeare play/movie I have seen.

This adaptation d-r-a-g-s. Shakespeare should be about the language and the action, not the setting and mise-en-scene, and I kept waiting for the actors to talk and the camera to turn from scenery to faces. Perhaps my expectations were overly high, since the cast and director come with excellent pedigree. Try the \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" with Kevin Kline and that skinny girl who played Ally McBeal -- it's a hoot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trevor Nunn's 12th Night Fails Miserably As Comedy","review":"AVOID this movie. The tone, pace, and casting of Shakespeare's second most performed comedy is fundamentally off the mark. Nigel Hawthorne's Malvolio is the only comic highpoint in this inexplicably slow-moving and melancholy piece. Ben Kingsley seriously misinterprets the part of Feste which is the comedic backbone to the play. Nunn's Twelfth Night does not succeed as a comedy and more to the point, as a movie. There is some fine acting in here, notably the aforementioned Hawthorne as well as Stubb's Viola, but this film may altogether be more useful to students of Shakespeare in the same way that Cliff's Notes are; it's not entertainment. Twelfth Night is one of my favorite Shakespearean comedies and I was personally offended by its unfunniness."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who find KING LEAR too cheerful","review":"This dismal film conveys scarcely any hint that the play on which it is based is a comedy. Many of the jokes are gone, and the survivors are damped down--if you are not already familiar with the play, you will not realize that they ARE jokes. Moreover, the play's theme--which may, with extreme succinctness, be expressed as \\"you have to keep on enjoying life, even if bad things happen\\"--has been replaced by one of \\"remember, you must die.\\" The atmosphere is solemn, with death and decay omnipresent. In brief, this is TWELFTH NIGHT as interpreted by Malvolio. You may be tempted to watch it anyway, because of the many fine actors in the cast, but their efforts are suffocated in the general gloom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad................","review":"I love Shakespear's comedies and would very much like to have this one, but previous reviewers have prevented me from making a mistake in purchasing it, as there are no subtitles!!

I have seen it now three or four times and find it to be a loving and professional production. I will address my one quibble: as someone else has remarked, the sound quality is flawed; even though I have been through the play a number of times now, in varous formats, I still have difficulty with the dialogue in this film. The acting all around is indeed superb and the sets are a visual feast. Ben Kingsley provides a lot of \\"extras\\" in fleshing out the role of Festy. I would place this film on a level with Branagh's \\"Much Ado\\" if it were not for the sound. On the other hand, this is a film that I shall watch repeatedly and I suspect that the dialogue will become clearer with each viewing!

The actors do a lovely job of bringing to life all the joys, sorrows, and mishaps of the many love triangles layered within the play. There are simply too many favorite scenes to list, however, Malvolio's discovery of \\"Olivia's\\" letter is a classic. One of my favorite scenes to compare to other performances. High schoolers find the story engaging and relatable, although they do get impatient at the end when Viola and Sebastian take 30 lines to confirm each other's identity - hehe! The filmmakers also follow the original text almost entirely, with only a few minor omissions, making it an excellent companion to a close reading of the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful comedy","review":"For anyone who enjoys good acting, wonderful plot and enjoyable drama this is a must.

I find most historical romances have a \\"hook\\"to the plot...murder, scandle, mystery, but few are just love stories about people; some with histories, some with luck and a good heart.

The bread knife won't stay in the far slot as you slice unless you go so slow that you can barely slice through the bread. And, the guides aren't even as long as a standard loaf of bread so you can only slice about half a loaf at a time.

After reading a lot of reviews on this and while some had some valid complaints I got it anyway. Yes, it can slide a bit (I put \\"sticky\\" tabs on the 4 corners and that stopped). Yes, the plastic isn't as strong as possibly metal guides but it's a good bit less expensive too. If you're careful and not try to muscle it around or force what you're doing there isn't a problem with it at all. My bread knife is just barely long enough but I'll simply get one that is longer! That problem is solved too. The crumb tray works well too. I just don't see where some of the complaints were coming from. If you're careful it works just fine. If you want to spend a whole lot more than do it. If you just need something to help guide bread machine loaves to be cut straight then I see not one thing wrong with this one.

The person or persons who designed this obviously suffer from Anal - Cranial Inversion syndrome. The choice to use acrylic for the tines was a disaster as they break constantly and I keep super gluing them back on. Doesn't fit my bread (too wide) and I had to find 12 in. knife to use it. Too short the other way and i have to stop cutting, pull out 1/4 of the sliced bread and move loaf down again to finish cutting the bread. I find it outrageous that someone would attempt to market such a poorly designed piece of junk. These people don't even care if it works as long as they can make some money off it!!

I have sliced anything from sandwich loaves to french bread to bagels. Works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy not worth the money.","review":"Very disappointed in this product.

The first problem was that the front piece of acrylic came loose and fell out, multiple times. We used cellophane packaging tape to fix that. The second problem was the first slicing guide tab snapping off. We think this happened because the guide is far too wide for a standard 2 pound bread machine loaf sliced with a 10 inch bread knife. When another tab broke we started looking for a better bread slicer, and found the Presto Bread Slicing Guide Model 08615, which is made to fit bread machine loaves. There is one for 64.95 on Amazon, but I found a gently used one on the mother of all auction sites for less than $25. It is sturdy, constructed in one piece, easy to clean, and is the right size for bread machine loaves. We can use either a regular 10 inch bread knife or an electric knife without bumping into the tabs on the backside of the guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Hot","review":"It worked about as well as the executive branch of the federal government.

I am a farm to table business, and I buy whole loaves from a nearby organic farm. I wanted a slicing guide to help me cut straight slices so I would stop wasting bread. This guide broke the first time I used it. The slicer requires a very long bread knife (which I have) However on the second cross stroke, the knife escaped the slot and bumped the acrylic slice guide on the backstroke. There was no real pressure, but the guide tooth snapped off. I sent it back because once I examined the structure I realized that there is nothing but a little strip of plastic holding the slicing guide teeth to the base. The plastic is too brittle for the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Requires Extra Long Bread Knife","review":"Basic design does what it is supposed to do, but the width of the unit is a little wide, so that an ordinary length serrated bread knife keeps slipping out of the grouves.

I have used it many times and it holds up well and is easy to clean. If I had to change anything I would like to see it have an additional set of sides that would make thinner slices of bread.

Other than that it works very well for my bread and I would recommend it for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"As noted in my e-mail, the space across the base, between the guide sides, is inadequate. My large bread knife only extended 1/4 or 1/2 (I forget what I noted on the e-mail) inch beyond the far side guide. The knife provided the the bread maker had less overlap. This inadequacy forced the user to use very short strokes in the attempt to slice bread.

Bread machine loaves are shaped so that when laid in the slicer they reach the top, and make it very difficult to line the knife up in the slots. I found the plastic part itself to be much flimsier than I had anticipated, and the crumb catcher has missed many crumbs, which end up on the counter top. I wish I could say this is a great product, because I have found no other options for uniformly slicing bread machine bread, but I am greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"handy bread slicer","review":"This is quite handy.

If you wanted thick slices you could always use every other slot. As it is, you don't have a choice. The acrylic guides attach to the wood base with screws, which makes it difficult to clean.

I have only one worry and that is that the wood used at the base is a little light weight with my sharp bread knife and the slicing is causing the wood to also be sliced.

The spacing between the sides is too wide so a soft loaf of fresh bread still moves back and forth with the knife. The slots are quite wide, and a bit too widely spaced. There is no way to adjust any of this.The crumb catcher seems like a nice feature, but it's not really that important if one has no more than 2 or 3 loaves to slice. There is nothing to interlock the removable end wall into the side knife guide walls, so it pops out rather easily during slicing. The walls must be attached before first use, as they come laid down flat to save on shipping space, and it's reasonably easy to attach them.Unfortunately this item has fallen into complete disuse in our house--and not because we don't bake bread any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knife size","review":"It is easy to assemble and clean.The only problem is that normal knife lengths are hard to use.

On the other hand, it's too short to slice the (already short) loaves from end to end. Because of this, I must hold the loaf by hand anyway and focus on keeping the knife from contacting the super-fragile guides.The only reason this device is not in the trash is so I can use it enough times to be thoroughly aggravated.

When I got it, the wooden slats were all warped, which made the floor of this product totally non-flat. It took me less time to cut the bread by hand, which totally negates the purpose of this thing.

Besides the slicer not being long enough it is also not high enough which makes it harder to start slicing each slice of bread, one would think you could put the loaf in and the slicer would be higher than the loaf of bread allowing you to put the knife in the slicer to slice the bread.

Second, the plastic of the guides sort of catches on the knife blade, preventing a smooth cut. Third, it bounces and slides all over the countertop while you're trying to use it.

Effectivley you need to somehow hold the end of the bread whilst holding the sides tight from the top which ensures the end won't fall out and even then if you manage to master this handspan(thank goodness for all those piano lessons) you are still going to get less than perfect slices.

I do not like that I muck up the wood with my knife every time I make a slice, but honestly I think that would happen with any wood, unless you have a slicer made of cutting board material, in which case I would expect the price to go up significantly..... So for a cheap solution this does the trick, I am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So not worth it!","review":"Save your money! This is the worst thing I have ever bought!

You have to make each slice with dozens of 1\\" knife slicing motions. That's at least 30-40 for each slice of lovely crusty French bread. For our needs, the bread slicer was worthless. That's not counting the arm muscle spasms that resulted from the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I bought 2 of these (one for my daughter too) and they were both broken when they arrived.

I ordered anyway because there just is not any other viable but affordable consumer level bread slicers out there. My primary complaint is that the end plate does not stay in place. With any kind of pressure from pressing the end of the loaf of bread against it the end plate falls out of its track. There are many ways to remedy the problem with minor design changes... Such a flaw would be obvious to the manufacturer... They are either really dense or just don't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Handy Thing","review":"This is a great bread slicer. I like that the base is wood and that the slats catch most of the crumbs while slicing. Easy to use and to empty, too.

I can't even imagine the horror of all the women who have had to deal with his rotund naked awfulness. Now we have to deal with his more rotund, aged and just awful appearance clothed. He can't act, he's not interesting and he's downright a movie ruiner. But, unfortunately for this movie, he didn't ruin this one; it was ruined far before he was cast in a role. This is just another ultra low budget poorly conceived and even poorly executed zombie concept. People randomly show up at a house, then find they're hunted by zombies, then attempt to deal with that situation. No plot whatsoever to establish any realism or believability. Do yourself a favor - save your eyes from the irreversible danger Ron Jeremy can do to them, and save your brain from the uninspiringly lame story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash that's not worth your time","review":"I have to agree with other comments about the low-budget, no-talent quality of this, er, film.

I guess the thinner plastic should have clued me in - also the bell is not nearly as loud.

Also, absent handles, It is difficult when wearing oven gloves to move the unit from oven/grill to counter top without spilling hot liquid fat. There is no good place to hold it. A heavier, larger drain plate with handles is definitely needed. Finally, it does not feel stable enough. I worry about it tipping over b/c of the small base.

Very heavy duty.The pouring spout is nice as is the flat back. The only improvement I could think of would be if the handle was stainless steel. This is really only important for those of us who use the bucket in salt water. The very heavy gauge handle on this bucket should last a very long time.If you search for Little Giant Bucket you may find the exact same bucket available via amazon prime.I got the Teal since it was least expensive, and (fortunately) I don't care about the color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This product looks great on my counter and is effective at prolonging the life of my garlic. Amazingly, it arrived with no breaks or chips despite the fact that it was poorly packed by the manufacturer (just a thin cardboard box with no padding). The only real gripe I have is that the lid does not sit flush on the top of the keeper. The hole at the top of the keeper is not perfectly round so the lid sits tilted to one side. This does not take away from the effectiveness of the product since garlic requires air circulation, but it detracts from its aesthetic qualities - one of the reasons why I picked this particular product in the first place. If it were not for the flawed lid, I would have given this product a five-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive and Keeps More than Garlic!","review":"I love this product. My garlic keeps for weeks and the keeper is large enough for several bulbs. It prolongs the life of fresh ginger and shallots as well.

I have it in the same location as the previous jar and it keeps my garlic fresh for months (purchased in 2010).

I listen to the mp3 and find the note and play it just as the instructor plays the note and says it. This is a great way to memorize notes on any instrument. It's just shy of an hour long, so one day's practice is in this album. This is for ear training, I know. But, I find it works better in the previously described way. I'd be bored to pieces if I just listened to train my ears. This is boring,but, extremely practical for any beginner not wanting to hire an instructor. Put on your headphones, go to your instrument and play the notes after he says them.

It does, however, seem to get a bit snarled at the ends sometimes after shampooing and wrapping it up in a towel. I was hoping for a light-to-medium conditioner that made it easy to comb through my hair. Unfortunately, this so-called detangler didn't seem to make any difference at all. In fact, regular conditioners like Aussie Moist or Neutrogena left my hair easier to comb out than this stuff. I also didn't care much for the scent of it, which reminded me a bit of the old Flex conditioners from the 80s.

The bottle I received even looks different. It does not look like the bottle pictured on the Amazon page nor does it look like a bottle found at a salon. Yesterday I went out and bought another bottle from a salon and it is the same wonderful Detangler I have come to know and love. I wouldn't buy it from Amazon again.

The obvious solution would have been to have had a CD in the book, containing the played examples or have them downloadable from the Berklee site. I contacted the author, Jack Perricone, Chair of Songwriting at Berklee to ask him if he could supply me with performed techniques. He replied \\"Unfortunately, no. I am in the process of writing a book that will have a lot of audio, but I don't have it for the Melody in Songwriting book.\\" I suggest you wait for that book.

I have been totally ripped off!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it looks","review":"I don't know what I expected but the last french bean slicer I had came from a company called Spong and it clamped onto the table via a suction pad. What that did was lift the dispensing shoot above the table which then gave room for a plate to catch them - easy one-man machine (alas no longer on the market and mine was lost years ago).This one was sturdily built but didn't fit onto the counter top. I tried a table but with either way you cannot turn and catch at the same time, so the beans landed on the floor. I was still prepared to work with it, but as soon as we - husband turning, me feeding - put 3 beans in the hopper - it ceased up and something/cog maybe, broke and the thing no longer works. Total usage - maybe 5 mins. Mine is going back and I will continue to cut the beans with a knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"The slicer does not work. I cuts beans into mishapen strips that look horrible. It is hard to use. After attemting top french only a few beans my hand was hurting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norpro: A Poor Choice","review":"This is the most worthless piece of product I've ever bought. The mechanism to attach to a table is too small to use on a counter--I finally found an old wooden table that it would attach to--using a pair of pliers, that is, to turn it tightly enough to hold. Then, I used it twice---it will take only one bean at a time and then on cutting a plump bean, the Norpro just quit cutting. The handle refused to turn the inner blade. I DO NOT recommend this product.The positive? Amazon stood behind the product and within just a few days, it had been returned and credited to my account. Thanks Amazon--No thanks Norpro!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with most of the others.","review":"I agree with the rest...it doesn't clamp onto any kitchen surface we have and it definitely works better with two people operating. We were more disappointed with the size. The picture made it appear to be more like a meat grinder that would handle more than 3 or 4 beans at a time.

It just plain did not work. I couldn't return it to Amazon because it had come from another company. I had bought two of the items, and returned them both.Unfortunately, they didn't both come from the same company. The company I mailed them back to called and said they would mail the other one back so I could return it to the right company, but that has been months, and I still don't have it.So, you might say I was unhappy to say the least.Patricia Baker"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used this Bean Slicer for 2 Years","review":"We have used this for 2 years. The pluses...only one. This is about the only thing out there that french cuts green beans 3-4 at a time. The minuses are numerous. It can't be attached to just any edge and cannot attach to our wooden table or granite counters, which makes it very difficult to use. My husband and I often work it together so there are 4 hands to hold it down, shove beans in, and grind all at the same time. Beans do get caught up inside and need to be re-positioned. Hard to clean. But still we use it because it is easier than slicing one bean at a time with a knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste You Money on This","review":"We recently purchased this item and found it to be nothing but a hassle. It was difficult to find a place to clamp it to. You have to position the thing on the side of a narrrow table or cupboard edge and then put a pot or pan under it. It only slices 1 or 2 beans at a time or else it cranks extremely hard. Even arfter they are supposedly frenched the beans are still thick and so often they have to be put through the frencher twice. This is not a good product"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lost opportunity to document Toronto's architecture","review":"This books walks the reader through the history of Toronto with special emphasis on its architecture and city planning. We're introduced to various neighborhoods, and Fulford discusses specific buildings that he regards as either assets or eyesores, often including a bit of historical background on how that building came to be. The great flaw of the book is that there are only 16 pictures. When Fulford discusses a building (for instance, the Commercial Bank of the Midland District at 15 Wellington Street) we're supposed to be able to picture it in our mind's eye, a daunting challenge even for Toronto residents. In the same vein, an entire chapter is dedicated to criticizing the CBC Broadcasting Centre, but nowhere is there any illustration of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armik's Genius","review":"Armik's style transcends parameters circumscribed by Spanish guitarists as he takes his music beyond the realm of imagination.

I thought it served it's purpose well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel Wallet","review":"Great Wallet. I carry my passport with me all of the time and this wallet holds it and my credit cards etc. perfectly. I owned other similar products made out of a cloth like material and they wore out eventually and were also subject to mildew growth due to the humid climate where I live. The Samsonite wallet is covered with a soft type of material that appears not only to resist the mildew here but is water or should I say rain and body sweat proof.

Even more, they forget howforbearers of the modern freethinkers they condemn so easily and hate somuch, men such as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and Thomas Paine,struggled and sometimes suffered to promote and defend the radical notion ofa government neutral in religion which respects everyone by not elevatingone belief above another.If you are a non-religious American, this gift to the world is yourheritage.

However, not every secularist was hailed as a hero, and even forgotten by history thanks in part to attacks from orthodox religion and conservatives.Today, Jacoby notes, there are no great speakers for secularism, and the Right has a lot of power and clout. Secularists need to be heard, and add emotion to their arguments (facts and logic do not seem to sway as many people when emotion-packed preaching can get a group into a frenzy).Today, more than ever, we need more Paines, more Ingersolls, more Jeffersons, otherwise the separation of church and state may crumble before the weight of the religious right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freethinkers: A Polemic Ripped From Its Context","review":"The book tells us more about Jacoby's 21st century world-view than the role of skepticism and secularism in America's history. This is a polemic disguised as history. There is no context to the book, as it makes no attempt to contrast secularism with the impressive contributions of religious figures and institutions to American life.

It's not only full of good information, but it's very well-written, presenting that information in an entertaining and enjoyable manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"what got left out of your history classes","review":"An excellent, well-researched history of secularism in America. It provides excellent details of the secular foundations on which the USA was built (a history that has been twisted or ignored over the years), and the constant attacks on the separation between religion and the state through the present day.

Slightly malty flavor will stand up to being enjoyed straight or with a little sweetener.Test your amounts. You will be surprised at how little makes a full strong pot. As the saying goes, strong enough for the church mouse to walk over. Overbrewing is not an issue, so it can make a rather good iced tea (hot, let cool to room temp, decant, refrigerate), but you can make it a bit too strong with too much tea.Side note; this is a cut & tear leaf tea, meaning a coffee grounds like texture. You will need a mesh filter like the bodum press pot, which is great for tea. You -can- use a standard filter coffee maker. Clean the 'roof' by the water outlet and the filter cup throughly, removing all the coffee oils. Something to do regularly anyway. Then put a measure of this tea in a paper or mesh filter per normal.

Not complaining because this is my fault: the length and width was clearly stated by the seller, so I should've known better reading all those positive reviews. But in reality this chain is not suitable for any sizable pendant or necklace. If you are a big guy with big neck it would choke you. And you can lose your pendant at any time since the link is not strong at all, it can break any moment. I guess there is no substitute to visiting a professional jeweler and paying in the neighborhood of 150 bucks for a good sturdy sterling silver chain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Bonita Springs, FL.","review":"I give this product (5 stars) for the secure way it was shipped and the timely manor.

This chain is a disgrace to Sterling Silver products of any kind. I went out to a local department store and purchased a beautiful 20\\" Sterling Silver chain for only 10 bucks and it doesn't rust.

It's a very dark woodsy smell that gives you chill when you breath it in. It's cold... there's no warm to it at all. There is a hint of Jamine maybe but that's counter acted by an intense bitter root afterglow. After wearing it for a couple of hours I'm not happy to report that I actually became nauseated. I really tried to embrace the diversity of this scent, give it a shot and not judge it to harshly but unfortunately my physical reaction won out.

His style, harmonies and melodic phrasings are both refreshing and unique. At the same time, he carries the mantle of great jazz guitarists who have gone before him, such as Django Rheinhardt, Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, Jim Hall and Barney Kessell. The harmonies are rich, the melodic riffs incredibly expressive, and the ensemble blends together marvelously to make this a tremendous contribution to the canon of jazz guitar albums. Be sure to check out Pete's recordings- he is one of the best jazz guitarists out there today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative - Med to Advanced Techniques","review":"Great product.

The film was choppy and the sound quality was horrible. I wish I would have noticed that it is black and white before I purchased it.The movie opens with a few photos of adolescent girls, including one with a clear genital shot bordering on pornographic. The main character is a 14-year old girl portrayed by an actress clearly over 18. The only thing immature about this girl is her acting ability and the script.My girlfriend thought the movie accurately portrayed the insecurity and lack of self-confidence most 14 year old girls feel about themselves and there bodies. Maybe if the actress at least appeared to be 14? Maybe not."},{"rating":"1","title":"iPod AV RCA Audio/Video Out Cable","review":"This product was intentionally marketed to be misleading.

If you don't understand what that means, this book is very likely not for you...start with Coe's excellent \\"The Sedimentary Record of Sea-Level Change\\" instead, followed by the classic American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Memoir 26. I personally found Armentrout's paper on the Plio-Pleistocene Gulf of Mexico biostratigraphy very pertinent; Figure 12, the Chronostratigraphic chart of Plio-Pleistocene depositional and biostratigraphic events is most useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to love?","review":"I only recently started to explore the blues so before hearing this collection, I had only heard one or two songs by Mississippi John Hurt. I came across this CD when it was playing at a listening station at a record store and from the first notes, I was mesmerized. The guitar picking and the vocals were so wonderful that I did not know what to do with myself there in the store. This was an amazing discovery. If you like bluesy, folksy, country or rootsy music, I can't see how you would not love this album - even if you have never heard of Mississippi John Hurt before today. I like every single song on the album, including the unusual vocals of Victoria Williams. Favorites include Chris Smithers, Lucinda Williams, Ben Harper, Mark Selby Beck, and Taj Mahal."},{"rating":"2","title":"a worthy tribute","review":"Hurt was a unique bluesman - funny, laid-back, and unassuming. There would be no value in merely imitating him. But at a time when many tribute albums are filled with third-rate performers parasitizing first-rate songwriters, it is a delight to find a tribute that justifies the word. Each artist tranforms a MJH song to fit his/her own style, and the results are memorable, and often outstanding. I especially liked Gillian Welch's spooky version of Beulah Land, but the entire CD is good (how often can you say that). If you like any of these artists, you will probably love this album. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Cool...But...","review":"It's a great-looking Futurama collectible, but you can tell it's not very durable.

I found it invaluable whenever my swing was little off.Although the illustration was good and better than most golf books you can buy, I still thought it could be better.

I consider this more of a reference-type book. The way the book is structured - listing 80 common faults - can confuse the beginner by overloading the head with too many details. Golf is a hard enough game as it is and filling one's head with so many swing mechanics will definitely make the game more challenging and discouraging even. When professional golfers are asked what their secrets are and most of them will answer by saying: \\"keep it simple.\\" For me, I try to keep only three things in my head while going through the pre-shot routine.This book is more suitable for intermediate and advanced golfers who want to refine their games by targeting weak areas, and book will help you do that. The golf swing should feel natural and uncluttered with details.

This has the excellent illustrations of Dave Smith which are now trademark of Leadbetter's book.Might also check out John Jacob's books, especially the Swing Doctor."},{"rating":"2","title":"An great book for improving your golf game","review":"Leadbetter has taught golf for many years. Nick Price and Nick Faldo are among his more famous pupils. Faldo credits the author with re-inventing his game - hardly an insignificant accomplishment given Faldo's success as a professional golfer prior to working with Leadbetter.This book would appear primarily useful for somebody who is looking to address certain challenges with their game. Each of the eighty problems he lists is located facing the page where the solution is clearly described. Hints and practice drills aid the reader in un-learning the bad habit that typically created the problem in the first place.Though I am a new golfer, of all the books I have seen thus far, this book has personally helped me the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Mega Watts\\" delivers!","review":"This Video is a must for any fanof Andre Watts.

Starting with two Sonatas by early keyboard virtuoso Scarlatti, Watts takes the listner on a journey through various periods in music. His reading of Beethoven's \\"Moonlight\\" Sonata was haunting. His performance also included Chopin , Gershwin, And Debussy. Watts closed his concert with Franz Liszt's Etude d'Transcendante, showing why he is the premier interpreter of Liszt. For his encore he played 2 etudes by Chopin which included the famous \\"Revolutionary\\" etude. That earned him a much deserved standing ovation. This video is a must for any fam of Andre Watts.

My favs are \\"Real Fine Place to Start\\", \\"I got What You Need\\" and \\"Love Has Something to Say About It\\" - All of them cool rock songs with deep lyrics.You won't get disappointed in investing money in this cd - it's awesome! and if you own Radney's previous works you'll soon notice that this' his best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't imagine how good this cd is until you hear it...","review":"Radney Foster is without a doubt one of the finest singer/songwriters in country music today.

Everything I know about japan comes from anime, go, and manga...But what do I know about Korea? Nothing. I think we can safely ignore everything from M*A*S*H...As a go fan, I was roped into this book from page one.

In truth, this happens to anyone that gets really into the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea that was \\"lost in translation\\"","review":"The original book was written, so I understand, in Korean and was translated to English. Maybe it read better in Korean, b/c it's rather difficult to read through what is essentially at times, broken english.I liked overall idea of the story. A young boy who revolts against traditional values, finds love in Go and a woman; however, the execution of the book left a lot to be desired. I'm attributing a majority of the errors, poor connections between paragraph thoughts and broken ideas to a \\"loss in translation\\".I was rather shocked at the high ratings given of the book. If you like Go, the book is okay for the sake of Go. If you don't know much about Go and want to learn, I highly recommend Janice Kim's, \\"Learn to Play Go\\" series. If you are just looking for a good read, STAY AWAY from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating portrayal of Korean GO","review":"I am about half way through this book, but can whole heartedly recommend it to anyone interested in the world of GO.

Firstly, as an adult watching these, the voices are incredibly annoying and the storyline cheap and corny. Be that as it may, many children's movies are not geared for adult enjoyment - I can handle that. Unfortunately, the way they talk and the relationships between the cars is really geared more for teenagers. Cars talking about how hot they are and baby this and baby that - definitely not recommended to anyone.

I have to agree with other reviewers here who state that some of the more important influences were skimmed over. For example, no mention of Grandmaster Flash's \\"Wheels Of Steel\\" - both the man and the track being very influential and pioneering. Nowhere near enough of Kool Herc either. Also, what's with the spelling errors on screen - \\"DXT\\"?? It is \\"DST\\" as in Delancey Street, there are quite a few of these careless errors which challenge the DVDs credibility somewhat.It does seem overly biased towards the current/recent scene but perhaps that footage is just more accessible to the producer.Not bad for 10 bucks, but I suspect that price is indicative of the fact it's not the best DVD of it's kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made....BUT....","review":"Very well made and entertaining documentary that fails only in it's representation of the true pioneers of the craft. Far too much time is spent on Bay Area DJ's (QBert, Shadow, etc.), and while those cats certainly deserved their propers, there is absolutely no mention of Philly legends like Cash Money, Jazzy Jeff or Spinbad. These guys were absolutely pivitol in elevating the art of scratching to new hights (I'd even go so far as to say it's tantamount to ommiting Louis Armstrong from a history of Jazz). My only other criticism is that I sometimes felt the filmmakers were a bit too ambitious with their subject matter. There are far too many angles to cover (the scratch dj, the beat digger, the producer, etc.) to cover each one succinctly within it's 90 or so minutes. I've heard that there were interviews with Cash Money and perhaps others that were left on the cutting room floor. Hopefully they show up on the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL DONE","review":"I saw this movie once and I knew I had to own it. It is a very clear and sequenced movie about the art of Hip Hop and turntables. I love this culture. I think anyone and everyone can enjoy the catchy beats and styled rhythms that make this movie more fascinating. It has a good flow as well, it is not a quick watch but after you see it a couple times through, I will play it in the background because of the music. It was well produced and that is why I say Well Done."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY INTERESTING DVD","review":"I really liked this DVD. The world of the scratch DJ opened my eyes. Most people don't know much about the scratch DJ, but it's definitely a legitimate art form. Loved the interview and profile with DJ Qbert. I'm a little biased cause I've known him since middle school. Hehe. But honestly, this DVD is really interesting. A lot I didn't know.

Iomega says that it will, but will just burn at slower speeds using a USB 1.1 NOT SO!!! Have no complaints against Iomega in general...just their claims..leading to uninformed purchasing.

Either way, it's cost me extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It says Mac compatible, but is it?","review":"The short answer - if you have a Mac, don't buy it. I bought mine and sent in the rebate - which required the UPC seal. I found out later that I couldn't take it back to trade on a different machine. The problem is that the \\"Hotburn\\" software will not accept long file names as are common in Mac files. I found this out after an extensive session with Iomega technical staff.

The picture is very crisp and bright. The instructions for setting up to sound systems, cable boxes, VCR's and DVD's are very concise and accurate. The optional stand is a must because the TV by itself is quite low to the ground. Once you set the options and remote to control all your other pieces of equipment, you won't even need other remotes. I have an apartment and the TV is just the right size- not too big but big enough to justify the purchase! The convergence feature for tweaking the color tubes is worth the wait. Just a simple button press and the TV goes to work converging the colors with a simple 10 second procedure.

Light, pleasant, NOT bitter.To those compaining about the particle size; if you strain it after it is brewed, many more particles will be removed AFTER the tea swells from rehydration. If you are then somehow offended by the few particles remaining, filter it.To those compaining about bitterness; I wonder if they know how to properly brew a cup of fine tea. Do NOT use boiling water. Use water heated only to 180 degrees, or allow to cool first to 180. Water much hotter than that will bring bitterness from tannin release. That is true for most teas. Buy a thermometer.I steep mine for 3 to 4 minutes in 180 to 185 degree water, then strain, then reheat the strained tea to serving temperature.

Great concept- not perfected yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well, for a while.","review":"I found the Norpro professional meat tenderizer a very useful tool for effectively tenderizing less tender cuts of meats and also for pounding seasonings into meat. I liked the long, sharp prongs much better than the usual shallow, dull surfaces of other tenderizers. This tenderizer has a retracting platform that protects the user from being injured on the spikes. However, after a few months' light use, the spring on my tenderizer broke and no longer controls the platform. The spikes are now exposed at all times, resulting in several minor injuries to hands, or whatever body part comes in contact with it. This product was wonderful while it lasted, but now is a hazard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal needs oil to keep from rusting","review":"I like this tenderizer better than any I have ever used. It's only weakness is the plastic guide for the spikes tend to rotate occasionally and block the spikes from passing through. It would be nice if the other metal parts were make from a good stainless steel to keep it from rusting. I learned to spray it with cooking oil before I use it to keep it from sticking in the meat. After I wash it I also spray it with cooking oil because it keeps it from rusting. If you do not it will rust quickly at the base of the spikes which is apparently make from a cheap steel. For the price it is excellent. I would pay more for one made from quality stainless steel throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great... at first.","review":"I'll start with the good, it does tenderize meat very well. Makes even cheap ball tip steaks tender, and works equally well to better marinade chicken. Unfortunately it is designed in a way that dooms it to a very rusty and unclean death within a year. The handle fills with water as soon as you get it wet, and once that happens the metal spring inside rusts (see picture). Also like others have said, meat juice gets trapped inside which can't be good. I was thinking other reviewers were exaggerating until I saw how bad the problem was. SO I guess I'm saying it works, but it will eventually fail due to the design.

So, keep that in mind when you order. You need about 2-3 of these or you could bore more holes and cut your own dowel rods to accomodate more noodles.

I'm afraid I got rid of it and replaced it with one of the ones where all the (plastic) arms spiral out, and the tripod feet retract in straight -- and that has tucked into the center pole a really handy rod for hanging and unhanging the noodles, which I find surprisingly useful.However, if you were thinking about getting it, and storage is not an issue for you, and you don't mind fooling with it a little bit to get the dowels to stay firmly in place, there's no reason you wouldn't be happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pasta drying rack","review":"This drying rack is wonderful!!

Don't use super wide-angle lenses. The smaller the lens aperture (and the further the Pre-shaped frame is from the front of the lens) the sharper the cutout shape. The distance between your lens and the Pre-shaped frames can be varied by using a Cokin Modular Hoods (255) and the Coupling ring(308).

It's not really dishwasher safe, so scrubbing roast turkey drippings off every nook and cranny of this thing is tedious, to say the least. Plus, as you scrub the burnt pieces off, what also comes off is the black coating. My hands were covered in flaking black coating after washing it this most recent time.

Not for hot ovens!","review":"I used this to roast a chicken at 450 and the nonstick coating melted onto the bird. Had to throw away my dinner and the rack both. I see from other comments that you're not supposed to use it over 400, but you have to wonder how much toxic material is being released into your food even at lower temperatures-- short of actually freaking melting the coating. And anyway, a \\"roasting rack\\" with that kind of temperature limitation isn't of much use to me.At any rate, I'll be seeking out a stainless steel rack, since in my experience stainless is really not that hard to keep clean, and has zero chance of filling my kitchen with fumes or painting my food with god knows what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth much!","review":"This roasting rack is worth every penny you pay for it - in other words, not much.

From the beginning it was difficult to clean. I've always cleaned it by hand, never in the dishwasher. Despite that, and like many other reviewers here, the non stick coating began peeling, almost after the first use and washing.

Sure, there are a lot of Barry's standard songs on this CD, but they are updated, and the depth and maturity of the performances is amazing.

The \\"stoner\\", throughout the book was doing multitudes of drugs, acid, marijuana, hash, cocaine, etc which was understandable enough. But after she goes thru rehab she's fine.

I dont know, i dont think the story was really worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Koertge's Greatest","review":"I read this book in two sittings, and though it had some humorous points, it wasn't at all poignant, which I'm sure it was intended to be. I felt the characters were unrealistic. I don't think that MTV's generation could relate to the character's since they're habits were of this time, but their attitude's and style are stuck maybe in the early '80's? Ben's constant attempts to make every sentence into a sarcastic remark tired me a tad. I felt there was no plot structure, sonsidering nothing really happened, and all through the store I felt like Koertge was constantly forcing the reader to give Ben and Colleen pity, which isn't fun for me. I was forced to read the book a second time, because I thought maybe, I hadn't comprehended or missed a part of the book. But to my disappointment, the story was just how I thought it was. I would reccommend this book to the younger teens, despite the drugs/sex, but I don't think older teens could relate."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"i really don't see what is so \\"AWESOME\\" about this book. it .... the ending especially .... the only way i would actually be able to enjoy this book is by getting really drunk and bored. bad mix. the book's story line is very uninteresting and it seems like the whole book is written in a monotone kind of way (if that's possible). oh well... if you're looking for a good read this is not the book. look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Stoner and Spaz\\"","review":"I have CP like the main boy in the book (though nowhere near as severe, you can hardly tell I have it) and I thought it was an excellent portrayal of the everyday challenges people with CP and other movement disabilities face when trying to fit in with \\"normal\\" people\\"Stoner and Spaz\\" is about a romance between 2 oddities, Ben Bancroft, a boy with spastic CP and Colleen Minou, a young druggie. Ben is very insecure within himself and mostly just mooches around at the movies rather than face the jeers and taunts of his fellow peers. It is not until Colleen comes into his life that he attempts to go about the usual social activities of a 16 yr old boy. With Colleen he smokes, drinks, goes to dances and has sex. This book is an excellent read which makes the reader cry, laugh and gasp all at once. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent...","review":"The book basically starts you off with a predictale plot,boy meets girl,but the fact is the girl is a drug addict,a pot head, a druggie. This caught my attieon not knowing any of the author's books. ANother thing Koertge did was make the other main character have a disability. This madethe book a bitmore interesting, but the descriptions were plain dull. The plot was good,but was too boring, he didn't bring out the full potienal of the piece. The bookwasalso too short,itshould have been expanded, I finished the book within a day.The story basically took you through little ups and downs with Colleen and Ben, nothing that seemed out of the ordinary from the boy meets girl stories.If you want a short read,key word short, read Ron Koetrge's Stoner and Spaz and brace yourself for one hundred and sixty something pages of 80's styles, drugs, for a little sex, and horendous imagery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced","review":"The model/instructor, one, needs to loose the teeth, she grins stupidly through the whole exercise and two, it would be better if she were positioned in a real chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst video I have EVER seen!

The pages are the nice glossy kind too... okay, so enough about the aesthetics...The content was so educational, spanning all of history and discussing the relationship between sexual activities and spirituality / religion. This book covers so much, so I will simply list the chapter heading, and give a little synopsis of each one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for someone ready to take on souffles.","review":"This book explains eggs perfectly. It even has a section on properly separating your eggs, so it's a perfect book for someone new to cooking. Particularly with eggs.I was very worried about making a souffle. However, following the White Chocolate souffle recipe with raspberry sauce, I made my first souffle perfectly. It was gorgeous, breathtaking, delicious..... everything I dreamed a souffle should be.The other recipe I used was the Southwestern frittata. I agree with the previous reviewer that the chemistry didn't seem right. I felt like it needed at least one more egg to cover all the chicken and veggies. However, it turned out ok, and still tasted wonderful. Next time, I think I will add less chicken.All in all -- great book, even for beginners. I recommend this book for someone wanting to try their hand at eggs. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"omelettes, souffles & frittatas","review":"Another Lou Pappas recipe book that is a hit with me, I find the recipes are wonderful and easy to follow and make. The book is easy to read and beautifully illustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Secret\\" Worth Letting Out","review":"Those who first heard the song 'Kiss Kiss' were probably wondering who the heck that was singing this weird little song. Well, by now you probably know she goes by the name Stella Soleil, and if you like 'Kiss Kiss', you'll probably love the rest of this extremely solid debut. 'Pretty Young Thing', 'Imperfect', and 'Runaway Crush' come loaded to bare with hooks to spare, and those are just three of the highlights. Soleil's voice is somewhat of a hybrid that lies between Gwen Stefani and Siouxsie Sioux, with a little Cyndi Lauper thrown in for good measure. It's definately an acquired taste, and her voice comes across as somewhat untrained at times, but overall the vocal work is decent. If you can move past some of the vocal tics, you won't be sorry you picked up this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"I heard of Stella Soleil when her remake of Tarkan's \\"Simarik\\" came out (aptly titled \\"Kiss Kiss\\"). I did not much care for her version, but bought the album nevertheless. I was extremely surprised! \\"Kiss Kiss\\" is not a fair representation of the album. The other songs are brilliant! There's not one song on there that I skip. Her voice is wickedly fine and the music has variety. Standout tracks are \\"Imperfect\\", \\"Runaway Crush\\", \\"Twilight\\" and \\"Angel Face\\". It's a shame that Stella never took off. So many other tracks could've been singles (and could've been hits too!) If you want something different, give this album a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pop Nightmare...","review":"An immense disappointment considering that her first cd \\"Drown Me In You\\" was so brilliantly written and produced with a sound truly her own. As regards to \\"Dirty Little Secret\\", there was not a single decent song to be heard, though I tried desparately in vain to like one. If I could have given zero stars I would have. Stella, if you are out there...we miss you!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined a Great Song","review":"I was highly disgusted when I heard \\"Kiss Kiss\\" and realized that Stella Soleil had taken a song from the Turkish pop star Tarkan (called Spoiled) and ruined it. The English version is taken out of context with the music and the song should only be performed in Turkish to begin with. Thumbs down for this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stella Soleil = ONE HIT WONDER","review":"Stella has a nice voice, but...there is only three good songs on the album. And they are \\"Kiss Kiss\\" [...], \\"Pretty Young Thing\\" and \\"Stand Up.\\" Other than than...downtempo is too fast!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good cd....boring!","review":"the music and her voice are all over the place on this cd. in all the songs are very boring and her voice is needs some work. not cutting edge at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cheap Rip-Off!!","review":"This album is terrible. I cannot believe how Stella Soleil butchered such a wonderful song like Simarik and turned into a piece of trash like \\"Kiss Kiss.\\" The original was so great, now it is just laughable. Buy the album Tarkan, by Tarkan instead; not only will you get the great song Simarik, but you will also have many other excellent songs on the album. Naturally they are not in English, they are in Turkish, but they are still great and you can understand all of the emotion in each one. That is the important thing. And Dirty Little Secret certainly has no emotion whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money on this cd","review":"this cd content and cd cover is a very poor attempt of trying to make a hit. the turkish version of her single kiss kiss is a huge hit in europe and she is trying to ride off of someone else's success. i would give her credit is she did a good job at the remake, but her version is so bad! the other songs sound like 80's pop, there is nothing interesting about this cd. she could afford to take a few vocal lessons. don't waste you time and money on this one. wasn't she part of an unsuccessful grouip prior to this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who writes this chick's lyrics?","review":"I really can't stand this new \\"Kiss Kiss\\" song. Sure, it has an awesome beat--actually, the beat is taken from a Turkish song, \\"Simalik,\\" by Tarkan. The song has been huge everywhere but in the US, and even if you have no clue what he's saying, his lyrics are bound to be better than these. Don't waste your cash on this cd--buy the Tarkan version instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"(2-1/2 stars) I'm trying to remember why I bought this","review":"Though she may not be remembered, Stella Soleil came out in 2001 with the album Dirty Little Secret. I don't think this album did much for two main reasons: the music is far from accessible, and Stella comes off as a poor man's Cyndi Lauper.I don't think anyone can honestly sit through this album without wondering what in God's name is going on here. To be perfectly frank, this album is embarrassing. The lyrics tend to be sleazy, cheesy, AND watered-down, which is pretty obvious with titles like \\"Love You To Death\\" and \\"Let's Just Go To Bed\\". Also, the production on this album leaves nothing to the imagination, because many of the songs on the second half on the album sound like carbon copies of songs on the first half.\\"Dance With Me\\" is aiight and \\"Kiss Kiss\\" is tolerable, but they're not standout tracks or anything. There's no such thing on this album. In short, Stella Soleil gives new meaning to the word \\"uncanny\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all...","review":"I got this for Christmas as a joke because my sister got it free with some club by accident so I got it in my stocking. All of her songs are about sex and thighs rubbing and so forth. Kiss Kiss I can stand...I guess. But all of the others are uncreative with no diamonds in the rough. I think the girl has talent with her voice, but the music and words are terrible. And look at the cover! Trying to sell cds to guys much?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i miss the ol' stella","review":"apparently peoples don't know much about stella's earlier work in a band called sister soleil. her lyrics there were more honest and threatening, desperate and angry -- and meanwhile a sweet glimmer of hope and thirst for peace. ANYWAY -- the music was alot more intense and stella's voice absolutely shimmered. but alas! something has happened to her and while she makes creative use of guitars and plays her voice wonderfully -- i can't stand this candypop plane she's built herself onto. i applaud stella for her work nontheless, she's a great artist with intense attitude and an honest heart. but her music this time around is a bit lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I thought all the tracks would be like the first dance single, Kiss Kiss. I was wrong. Most of the songs are not even upbeat. Soleil has a nice voice, but the songs are boring. Buy this if you have trouble sleeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful!","review":"WOW. This cd totally blew me away. I have never heard a first album from a newcomer sound so good. From the fast songs to the slow songs, Stella will have you mesmerized. Some of the tracks that really stand out for me are 1, 2,3 5,6,8 but the others are just as good. Her voice is like nothing you have ever heard, but that is not a bad thing. It is a GREAT thing. She manages, to keep her sound fresh and new sounding, but without being repetitious or copying everything else you hear on the radio. Buy this cd and listen for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stella still has a presence that grabs!","review":"Many remmber Stella as main member of the Chicago based band Sister Soleil. Well, if you were hoping to hear the hard industrial rythims heard on \\"Soularium\\" or\\"Drown Me In You\\" you are in for a shock. Stella has moved on to more poppy pastures, and she has done it wonderfully. I too miss the unique sound that Sister Soleil created, but I can't help but be addicted to this sound. It seems as though Stella is gearing toward the Gwen Stefani/Moby fan base. If that's what she wants who are we to get in her way. She still sounds fabulous! Especially on songs like \\"Twighlight\\", \\"Imperfect\\" and \\"Runaway Crush\\". If only Stella showed off the amazing vocal ability that old school fans will crave, again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Musical taste is subjective.

Rolling Stone only gave it 2/5 which is beyond me. The booklet is quite sparse and contains no lyrics and does not have a list of whom plays what.

No weak cuts and so many strong ones. Most people probably were drawn to this album because of the song \\"Killing Moon,\\" a great song for sure, but in my opinion, not close to being the best song on the album. There is a haunting feel to this album, that like many other Echo albums, defies categorization. What were Echo and the Bunnymen? Alternative, Pop, Post-Punk, Rock, Techno, All of the Above?

There aren't really any highlights, just different shades of lowlights. The problem is some of the ryhmes don't make sense, such as claiming that rappers that came out well before her stole her style, she spends way to much time trying to attack other female rappers that are out of her league (Foxy Brown and Lil' Kim), and brags about having a life style, and reputation that she hasn't built.

She comes back form 97 now in the 2000 claiming she's the badest in the streets (lol) and she owned and started all the styles before anybody else. This album is a waste.

You should spend it on real albums from real artists like Eve, Foxy Brown and Trina."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conversations with Queen","review":"Her debut was probably the worst female rap album of all time, so why she decided to put out a sophomore album just boggles my mind. Despite the fact that her 1999 debut My Melody went gold, Queen is an atrocious rapper. Her insane jealously twards rap's leading ladies Lil Kim & Foxy Brown is repetative and annoying and the fact that she claim's they stole her style when she came in the game 4 years after them is pathetic.Despite strong guest appearences by Prodigy, Amil & Cam'ron and some tight production from DJ Clue, this is the most disgusting and humiliating garbage to ever be released by a woman in the industry.

I've listened to it 4 times in a row and am only sick of the 'The Joker' song. I feel as though it's his Top 40 let's make some money song. At least it's properly placed as the last track.

The thing is, this album kind of put it into overcharge.

That pretty much follows through on all songs. It is hard to find a place to just chill on this album.I give it SOME credit though, as if the monotony was taken back a bit, it would be OK.

I love breaks and am a big fan of big beat. I can listen to this album and recognize it is well done and will be considered very good by some, but you can't think of it as \\"Oh new Fatboy song, better go ahead and pick up more goodness!\\" Almost more of a dub style.

I thought this presentation was bizarre and awkward. It would have been better if she herself talked into the camera and engaged the audience.

I wanted the ascending alarm function, and it works very well. Sure beats getting a heart attack when a regular alarm goes off. The alarm starts with a click, then a pretty quiet alarm and gradually it gets annoying. It is a full-size table clock with easy to read hands. The snooze button doubles to illuminate the face at night. The brand on the clock says Elgin.The downsides to this are the light which is too bright, and it flashes on when you hit the snooze button. The alarm is difficult to set accurately since the hand is small and the dial is quite a distance away."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading subtitle","review":"i have also bought its 1997 edition not knowing that both book are the same, only their subtitle are different, the one : transforming power of mystical experience, the other : walking the mystical path in everyday life. its disappointing from a \\"sufi\\" writer.

If we today are to aspire to having such a close relationship we should start with reading what Andrew Murray shared. In an age that is preoccupied it seems with the \\"pursuit of pleasure\\" (hedonism by another name), and the more sensual, depraved, shocking, and titillating the pleasure, the more many desire it, we need to realise it all passes away and our time on the planet is limited.

After only a month of use the moter developed a problem. I thought that I had purchased a defective unit, so just bring it in for service . While walking back to the service desk I saw on the counter what was left of a MAC500. It had several bullet holes in it . The service tech informed me that Makita buys the moter for this unit from another company, and it is junk! So it cost me $60 for labor to fix a 3 month old compressor.

However, it lacked wit in the dialogue, the plot was limited and the heroine was a bit of a twit. It needed more monstrous monsters, more horror and action and some soul from the main character. Apparently she lives a life where very few thoughts wander through her head and while she admits that, I did not find this aspect of her sympathetic or interesting. I do not understand how so many reviews gave this book five stars. This was cute and included a few unimaginative creatures that is the extent of it's charm.Give me a tough, sexy, mouthy heroine and lots of truly evil creatures such as Anita Blake's adventures or Kelley Armstrong's many strong, imaginitive female characters and I can see giving them 3 and 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Slay Me","review":"A strong page turner.

Then our heroine trips and falls and catches herself by grabbing hold of the body, where her hand just happens to land on the murder weapon, still in the body. She inadvertently removes the murder weapon just as the police walk in and see her standing there with a bloody knife.I can't tell you what happens after that, because at this point, I threw the book across the room.

The Characters and story could have been so much better in some other author's hands. The female lead was whining, annoying and made so many stupid choices.

Instead she blithly walked into another Dragon's weyr and got into trouble. Jim, her demon provides comic relief and Draco is to die for.

Dragons, witches, and demons frolic alongside gung ho cab drivers and nosy police inspectors in this romp from the author of Sex and the Single Vampire and A Girl's Guide to Vampires. This novel takes place in a well designed alternative reality with laws that carry over from the previous works. The characters are creepy, warm, and oh so tempting. I can't wait for the next trip with Aisling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, Funny and Really Enjoyable","review":"I'm not a big fan of the 1st person writing style and not a fan of detective type vampire storylines. However, this paranormal romance novel is written in a humorous 1st person format that worked well. The writing was incredibly easy to read, and the story itself is fun. It has colorful characters with bizarre situations and a compelling mystery.Aisling is funny and quirky and Drake is a \\"Dragon Wyvern\\" who is a cool and delicious bad-boy.

She actually reminded me a bit of Kathryn Janeway in Star Trek Voyager and I don't think she made one sane decision in the whole book. I am sorry, but she totally ruined a book with a lot of potential.I started another book one of Katie MacAlister's books a while ago and returned it after a few chapters and if it hadn't been for a buddy read I probably would have given up. I just wanted to push trough it and that is never a good sign! It reminded me a little bit of \\"Ordinary Angels\\" but that book was refreshing because there was no TSTL-moments. Just shows you can never trust the ratings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun","review":"I thought this book was a lot of fun - plenty of humor and a solid plot.

What a mistake and waste of money. The audiobook version is simply horrible. The narrator Barbara (sorry, forgot the last name) reads it so fast that it's hard to listen to. The French accents sound authentic but are extremely garbled so even when the character is speaking English you can't understand them and the sound lowers so you have to turn up the volume. Also, I don't know how old this Barbara person is, but she sounds like she's in her 600's and Aisling is supposed to be 31. This Audoibook was a complete disappointment and I never did finish listening to it. I wanted to get the whole set of these in audiobook but if she is narrating them I'll pass and get something else to listen to in the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guaranteed Fun!!!!

This series is such a delight and so much fun; it is a perfect pick-me-up for any occasion!I admit I blushed each time I had to go to the Romance section in the bookstore to pick up a new book (Honestly, since when do a few bodice-ripping love scenes necessarily make a book a \\"romance novel\\"? There's more gratuitous sex in Laurell K. Hamilton's books, and they're under Horror!) But just as they say \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\", don't judge this book by its section! With fantasy, humor, mystery, and of course romance, there's a little something for everyone! Plus, they get better every book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"Frustrating read. I like the world and the secondary characters, but I hated the heroine and did not enjoy continually watching her make a complete fool of herself.That sort of thing can be funny, a la the Pink Panther movies, but it requires the author to stick to it. I can't be expected to point and laugh at the dodo at one point and then take her seriously at another. I think the first person narrative was also inappropriate. If I'm supposed to connect with her, don't make her an utter fool. Rather than laugh with her, I was cringing and skimming ahead.Also, for something billed as \\"paranormal romance,\\" it lacked romance. Aisling scarcely interacts with Drake in the book. There's no connection between them beyond the lazy Fated Mate trope.I made it 3/4 of the way through the book and just couldn't take any more of Aisling's poor choices. I skimmed through to find out whodunnit and tossed it on the 'donate' pile. I was so disappointed. I really wanted to like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya gotta love dogs.","review":"I have read the entire series. And, I'm pre-ordered on book #4.

Aisling Grey rivals Stephanie. Great fun, lots of interesting characters, guys to drool over, decisions to ponder and cheer for - with just a bit of fantasy to bind it all together. I have read some of MacAlister's other romancy novels, but this series is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive! Follow the white rabbit!!!","review":"Great book! I downloaded the sample of this book for my Kindle and had to read the rest immediately!The female lead, Aisling, is a great character. She's spunky, determined and has a sharp sense of humor. There were more than a few chuckles as I flew through this story.The \\"otherworld\\" created here is just full of magic and fun and the back drop of Paris in the summer added thick atmosphere. The characters and beings Aisling runs into were the right balance of quirky and the romantic lead, Drako, was very sexy. He made a perfect match for Aisling's character.The mystery was dark, but handled with an amusing perspective. The writing was descriptive, light and fun. All the ingredients have left me totally addicted to Ms. MacAlister's writing style and Aisling as a heroine.All in all, the book ended too soon. I can't wait to read the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big waste of money","review":"I've just finished reading the Sookie Stackhouse and Rachel Morgan series' and I was expecting this to be another great read, but it is VERY disappointing. The main character talks out loud to herself constantly and is not funny or endearing at all, just annoying. Very cheesy storyline. I couldn't get past the first 10% of the book. Even though I spent money on it, I don't think I can suffer through it. Charlaine Harris and Kim Harrison set a very high standard and unfortunately the writing in this book does not compare.

It is very indepth and accurate, covering many different areas concerning the progression of weaponry throughout the ages. I highly recommend it for the medieval enthusiast, for even though it goes through other eras, it does have a central concentration on early Europe. Its a fascinating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, but confussing","review":"I found that this book serves the purpose I bought it for to its best. However, the author seems to wander off at times, following his line of thought towards other directions from those he's pursuing, fact which can become tiring. Also, if you're looking for illustrations this book is definitely not for you. The content is very interesting and detailed, and he covers many subjects, although he says his main interest is the Medieval Era. I recommend it, but it would be best if read in conjunction with another book with more illustrations and less historical fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Be Called \\"The Archaeology of Swords\\" & not Weapons","review":"I bought this mainly for what I could learn about fighting axes. What I got was a description of 3 vague axe types without any new (or much old)information about them. Thats not much in 330pp. I was disappointed from the second I opened it and leafed through it. Obviously there were a great many axes used in these times periods yet you wouldn't think so reading this book. The 95% of this is on swords. If you were interested in much of anything else from that time period, forget it. If swords are your thing this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Archaeology of Weapons: Arms and Armour from Prehistory to the Age of Chivalry","review":"This is a very informative book, written clearly and delightfully free of arcane references. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because most of the illustrations are drawings rather than photographs. The drawings are good though. This is a good reference book for dating the styles and innovations of edged weapons up through the end of the 15th century--Particularly for a collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work! Broad and insightful.","review":"This is the first design book that I have read where the author makes a real effort to share his considerable experience.

You'd need a lot more help, and knowing how Osborne/McGraw-Hill pushes books out the door (very fast and lightly edited, if that) I'm not sure I'd trust everything in here as gospel.I did find a good white paper that covers some of the same material from Cisco (called \\" Gigabit Campus Network Design--- Principles and Architecture\\"; I know there are others up there)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as described.","review":"I too found about about this from America's Test Kitchen. I had an old tenderizer we used for pounding out meat. The problem was that it tore up the meat. This doesn't it does a great job of flattening without leaving ragged edges.

While I usually agree with the assessments from America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated, this time I do not. Before writing this, I went to their site to re-read the review and saw that they had declared this Norpro model the victor from among only five models tested. It IS heavy; it IS well-balanced; it IS easy to grip. However, the jarring force exerted on the cook's hand and wrist at the point of impact is pronounced, and I'm no 90-pound weaking. I can feel it in my bones! A pounder with the weight (and impact) positioned away from the wrist by a longer handle to the side is much easier, more efficient, and I'd guess, much safer to use. This one is OK for smaller projects, like one or two chicken breasts. It causes too much discomfort in the hand and wrist to be used for much more at one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deserve 5 stars","review":"The handle on this meat pounder is very short. Even before I used it on meat, I tried it out on a folded kitchen towel. Every time I pounded with any force, my little finger hit the top of the stainless steel disc. I sent it back and will purchase another one designed more like a hammer.

The weight is ideal -- heavy enough to assist in the pounding but not so heavy that it becomes tiring.I've used it on pork tenderloin to produce schnitzel and boneless, skinless chicken breasts to produce cutlets with excellent results.

It is also lightweight, appears very sturdy and is attractive looking. Drag is smooth as silk. I'll know for sure as soon as I hook my first 20lb dorado on it.Update: Used this reel in saltwater and later it locked up on me so that the handle wouldn't turn and the spool wouldn't release. Fortunately, it performed fine on the saltwater trip and the Pflueger company was excellent in handling the problem, sending me a brand new replacement. I am going to fish Costa Rica next year and this will be the test.

The only thing that film has going for it is the strong cast-totally wasted on this script, though. A better third installment would be \\"Desk Set\\" or \\"Without Love\\".

The time and effort it had to take to thoroughly investigate each pilot as well as the history of the squadron must have been monumental. The book is very well written and put together.

Nor is there a good explanation of why the U.S. Apollo program succeeded while the Soviet moon program failed- at least, no technical reason.Because, this book isn't about the technology, it's about the persoNALities. Because everything is, like, y'know, personal.So, if that's what you're looking for then you'll find this book a delight.

We tried spraying cooking spray on it, but that didn't work. And then of course it's awkward to clean since the batter sticks to the metal, even when you soak it, and it's hard to wipe off the inside.

Be aware that raw to medium takes much longer than medium to hard boiled. The timer changes color very slowly at first, but once it reaches the halfway point between soft & medium, it will change color VERY quickly, so at that point stay near and keep close or you'll have overcooked eggs.2. I find the soft boiled marker to be inaccurate if your goal is semi-solid \\"spreadable\\" eggs. If removed just as the timer indicates soft, you'll have tepid yolks with runny translucent whites- but a good \\"soft\\" egg is produced when the timer is 3/4ths of the way to medium.Overall this is an incredibly handy kitchen item- worth buying for yourself and gifting to egg-loving friends and family (My elderly grandmother reacted much the way I suspect she reacted to seeing a microwave for the first time!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect eggs","review":"i wondered about this product when i ordered it, but the reviews i read made me go ahead and order it. i'm glad i did....i hated boiling eggs because i never knew when they were done, but now i do!! now if it would just ring to remind me i have the eggs on the stove!!! the reviews i read talked about a bad smell that lasted for about 3 uses, but i never smelled it!! so, if your scepticle about ordering this product, don't be!! you'll be glad you did it!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad...too bad","review":"It's not working.

I make a batch of half a dozen eggs twice a week, and my only complaint is the plastic smell. But honestly, the eggs are so good, I don't even care. At medium hard, the yolks are creamy with just the tiniest bit of dark yellow at the center and the whites are firm and smooth without being rubbery. I actually get excited about talking about hard boiled eggs with my friends. I plan on getting everyone one for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cool!","review":"My best friend has one of these-and now I have to get one- they're fabulous!

Eggs were supposed to be hard-boiled, but they were decidedly medium - a big mess.

Top and bottom layer have separated so the color change element doesn't work at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"Since I consistently overcook my eggs, I bought this as a visual aid. I figured it would be foolproof. It works perfectly as advertised, with one major flaw. When it is heated up in the pan with my eggs, the pan, eggs and water smell like burning acrylic. If you are finicky, as I am about the smell of my food, then pass on this, and use an old fashioned timer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stinky but Effective","review":"There is no getting around it - this product stinks to high heaven. Rest assured that the smell is worst on the first use and decreses thereafter. I just used this for a large pot of boiled eggs and every egg but one came out perfectly (the last egg was very slightly undercooked). As some have mentioned, it is hard to read the timer as it becomes steamy and covered with water and bubbles as it is rolling around in the pot. I found that I needed to lift it to the surface with a spoon to see what it is reading, but it's a small price to pay for a perfect egg."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more guessing","review":"Everytime I attempt to make soft-boiled eggs, I was never very successful or had to use some obscure method of cooking them. Of course the results were never consistent, so I stopped trying to make them. After I got the timer, I've been able to cook soft-boiled eggs on a consistent basis. I do have to say that the first time I cooked with the timer, I got distracted and didn't pay attention to the timer. By the time I remembered the eggs, they were already to medium. If you hate to cook (like me), this makes the job a teensy bit easier"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...While It Lasted","review":"When I first bought this handy little gadget I didn't know how I had ever lived without it. After using it about 15 times however, I removed it from the pot to discover it had split completely in half along a line where it had been fused together. I had bought one for my mom as well and her's did the same thing about two months later. Very dissapointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible epoxy smell","review":"I used it once. It did work well as a timer - the eggs were cooked medium, as it indicated.But the horrible epoxy smell this thing gives off when it is sitting in boiling water worries me. Even after removing it from the water, the smell was still coming from the water, which means that the chemicals from this thing are leaching into the water, and probably into the eggs. Eggshells are porous, after all.I let it sit by itself in boiling water for a while, hoping the smell would go away after a while, but it's not. I don't think I'll use it again, and would definitely not recommend it. Get a timer instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong burning plastic smell!","review":"A strong plastic burning smell covered the kitchen when boiled this with the egg, chemicals must be flowing into the water when boiling.

I have little kids and with all the fuss about BPA this is definitely a candidate for some more research what happens to one using this timer. I will get a good olf fashion clock with a ring. The timer also does not make a sound so you have to watch the eggs and \\"enjoy\\" the stink. Norpro what are you thinking??"},{"rating":"1","title":"The plastic smell is pretty strong","review":"At the recommendation of a friend who had used one of these for years I found these online and bought 4 of them: one for my friend, one for me, one for my dad, and one for my sister.The first time we used the timer I got a headache from the plastic fumes smell. My husband did the next batch of eggs when I was out of the house and told me that the air still filled with the smell of burning plastic.The eggs don't taste like the plastic smell, but I really hesitate to continue use of this gadget given the impact on my air quality and the worry about what it's dumping into the cooking water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly cooked eggs every time!","review":"Read my title...what else can I say?

If you have trouble timing the perfect egg this is the solution. Put it in the water along with your eggs and it tells you when they are done to your taste.

I was afraid I had lost it forever until I discovered it here.

After it being in the boiling water for less than 2 minutes I began to smell a very strong plastic smell. This product CANNOT be safe.

Maybe once every 10 times the eggs came out the way I like them. Usually they were too soft or too hard. I could cook the eggs for the same amount of time each time, but they did not seem to come out the same each time. I am THRILLED with this product. Since I started using this, my eggs came out exactly the way I like the EVERY time, without fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few kitchen items that I don't mind having only one use!","review":"I try to not fill up my kitchen with items that can't have multiple uses. But there are those few tools that so well do their job that they make it all the more worth it.I've boughten two of these. And the only reason I got a second was because one time I was making boiled eggs with my grandma, I pulled this out and put it in the pot and she was so impressed I let her have mine and went back out later to get myself a replacement.

Excellent video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mp3 is not the original release version","review":"I loved the original lp and wanted a digital version, in particular \\"Tunnel of Love\\" which is just an amazing live recording. So imagine my shock listening to the mp3, everything seems fine until I get to \\"Tunnel of Love\\" and it is not the Alchemy original recording but some inferior bootleg version with the crowd noise up front. It's not a compelling version and it runs 11:52 whereas the original is 14:34. Very strange that just that one track was switched. Also the mp3 includes \\"Love over Gold\\" which was not part of the original release but was a b-side to \\"Solid Rock\\". Nice addition but clearly someone cobbled this together. The sound quality is noticeably different for these two tracks to the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I am an older person (in my 60's who had never listened to the Dire Straits until 3 years ago when a close friend kept telling me that I should listen to their music.

I don't smoke, drink or do drugs, never have, never will but I am sold on these guys. I now have my own collection although some are remasters but nobody will ever twist my arm into letting me loan them out. I only regret that I didn't give them a try years ago.

If you're not then you should get it on disc. I spent a lot of hours listening to these songs and trying to get some of those leads down on my own. So I know it well enough to tell beyond a doubt that the version on Amazon's MP3 of Tunnel of Love is not the version that's on the original album. I know that's totally geeky but shame on Amazon for not labeling it accurately and for replacing one track with an inferior cut. What's one song, right? A lot if you know what you're missing.

I'm a big fan of the group and their original studio albums have been a permanent fixture in my collection for the last 20 years or so, and I also saw DS live in London in 1985 - a superior concert to this one, shame it was never released on album.

I have used it to run all types of nail guns, impact wrenches and other air tools. It has perfromed flawlwessly. The only drawback I have seen to date is that it uses more amps than others in its class--a trade off I am willing to make. This is probably due to the fact that its CFM rating exeeds all the others as well.

It's got a lovely, pleasing taste. It has more prominent citrus notes than Earl Grey, but is overall less intense in flavor and doesn't get bitter as quickly. I like to have a variety of tea flavors around since I tend to drink two to four cups of tea per day at work and like to switch things up a bit, but this is the one tea that fits every mood and helps to melt some of my stress away.

It's distinctly different and if you think you would enjoy a bit of citrius in your tea but with a smooth flavor that is similar to Earl Grey but still Unique all its own, then Lady Grey is for you. You can get similar blends at tea shops and pay a great deal more but the base blend of tea minus the additions in this one is a much better blend of tea than I personally have had elsewhere. It's not bitter, not too smooth and weak tasting as some I've had and I think it makes a great morning tea.

This is the tea I drink when I'm having a bad day and need some soothing and comfort, like a mother's cuddle; it always does the trick. I cannot stand earl greys in general, finding them too strong and the aroma/taste too obnoxious and perfumey (like I'm sipping a bottle of cologne). That's not the case here; the black tea base is mild, (just right, not weak), and the citrus & spices aroma is pure yumminess. (As it turns out, Twinings Earl Grey tastes almost as good, IF you let it steep for a few seconds only. The Lady Grey can steep forever and there is no problem.) I'm a bit of a loose tea snob, but not so much that I don't have some bagged teas in my collection as well.

The first one is Kardinal seems to copy many other MC's both lyrically and topic wise, and most of his beats fall extremely short. It's too bad, he is a very talented MC, probably one of the best out of Canada, but he just couldn't resist screwing up this debut album.

I hadn't heard any of the tracks, but thought that I would take a chance. To say I was not disappointed is an understatement. So much of the subject matter in hip hop today is designer labels, money, and misogyny. Kardinal's positive approach is different, and his blend of West Indian, American, and Canadian influences is a refreshing change. Standout tracks on this album are Husslin (rap over a hiphop beat with a dancehall bass-line), Maxine (pure dancehall), Bakardi Slang, U R Ghetto (hilarious), and On wit tha Show. He represents the T.O. and is an exciting voice in hip hop today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent backup power source","review":"I bought one of these to use as an emergency AC power source when losing power at our house.

The author has personal knowledge of the Indochina and knew most of the protagonists by first hand. He also had the chance to interview General Giap in 1991 and also to study the archives of the French Army and the French Foreign Legion. The story flows like a novel, the details are excellent and not at all boring and the suspence excellent although you know the end. The only drawback is the absence of detailed maps with olny two of them to show the whole of Indochina in 1954 and the French strongpoints in the Dien Bien Phu valley.

It's cartoonish and juvenile; in fact, the entire story is more like a fairy tale (especially the over-the-top ending) than any type of believable motion picture.I rented Joe's Apartment solely because the members Rockapella (at the time) are in the roach chorus. The songs are hysterical, but don't expect to recognize any voices, because the recording is sped up a la \\"The Chipmunks.\\" Still, it's interesting enough...Actually, I think that the story idea minus the roaches might be a more entertaining movie. The opening scene (multiple bus station muggings) was hysterical and led me to believe the movie would be a lot hipper than it was. I guess it's hard to build a credible story around anthropomorphized bugs.Still, if you have a few hours to kill and nothing else is available, this isn't the worst movie ever.

However, this book just didn't deliver, in my opinion. The slim volume was half composed of pictures which didn't seem to be arranged in a particular order; also, potential readers should be aware that some of the pictures from woodblock prints contain rather adult material, one or two being quite graphic.This book didn't do enough as either a written resource or as a pictorial one.

It trips every time the compressor kicks on and again when it kicks off. It continues to trip so long as it is cold outside or if you are using an extension cord. If you buy this compressor it would probably be a good idea to hire an extra person to stand over the compressor and push the circuit breaker button everytime it trips. It is without a doubt a serious engineering flaw. This was my first Hitachi tool and it will definately be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very loud, and died early","review":"First, as other reviewers say, this particular compressor is *very* loud. It seems like it could be quieter. Second, I find that in any moderate tool use, it cycles quite frequently...maybe a higher SCFM would be better.Most importantly, this has to be the least overworked tool in my weekend remodeler's arsenal, yet it's the first one I've ever actually had die. I've owned it for maybe 4 years, but it only gets used a couple times a year. I took care of the oil, always drained the tank, and never kicked it over or dropped it. Yet recently the pressure control switch has failed. Now whenever it charges up, after the switch cuts off at max pressure, some sort of relief kicks in and bleeds off all the pressure it just built up. Useless. I could fix this for about $60 by buying a new one on the Internet, but I'm not happy with the quality so I'm going to switch brands.Maybe low quality is why this thing is discounted so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real happy","review":"I bought this after looking at the specs, It will not deliver what it says.

I read the manual, went to fill the oil reservoir, and noticed a spreading pool of oil on the floor of my garage. The oil reservoir cover was shattered. As Amazon has no customer service number to call, I'm not sure how I'll get satisfaction. This may be a great product, but I'll buy my major hardware purchases locally, so I can return broken products. If a book had arrived with a creased cover, no big deal, but I needed this for a job, and there's no way I can get this replaced in time to do it.

I encountered the following problems.1. The pressure regulator leaks air. You can hear the air leak when the working pressure is set below 90psi. At higher working pressure, the leak is not as noticeable. It also seems that Hitachi uses non-standard thread as standard 1/4\\" hex nipple does not fit. I had to reuse the hex nipple came with the unit.2. The unit does not hold pressure. Over a 12-hour period, it lost about 20 psi of air. I have noticed the unit will refill the tank periodically even though it is not being used.3. The unit fails to run sporadically. The motor makes a humming sound but the compressor will not kick in.

Each of our compressors has failed in the identical fashion, his multiple times. I think the basic compressor, i.e. the electric motor and vane compressor, is quite solid, but the control circuit which turns the motor on and off is quite cheesy and prone to failure. It is also *very* expensive to replace.Since this has happened to us a total of 3 times now, this is not just a case of random failure, but is a systematic problem. A shame, too, because the rest of the tool seems quite robust. We are shopping for new compressors now. I can tell you one thing - they won't be Hitachi."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 pathetic things","review":"What would have been a great compressor (aside from regulator placement) is spoilt for me by 2 things: 1) for about $1.50 a muffler could have been put on to reduce noise by 25-30 dB (to less than 1/4?) and 2) the unloader valve that is supposed to relieve pressure from the cylinder head after the compressor cycles off is poorly designed. When it fails, the motor has to try & start with the head under pressure, which mostly it cannot do. This is also likely to burn out the motor. This same thing may also be the cause of all the poor starting in cold weather etc. I have a simple fix. If you (or Hitachi Co.) want it, email paul@pthompson.com I have since bought 2 Makita 3.5hp compressors, and now having fixed this I shall probably sell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but delicate","review":"The are a few downsides to this heavy compressor. It is very loud. Although most of it is made of cast iron or metal there are several key components that are made of delicate plastic. Such as the components nearthe regulator, which include the on/off switch. And the filter housing. There is nothing wrong with them being pastic but if you transport your compressor regularly in the back of your truck, then you can count of them breaking almost everytime and the compressor stops working soon after that. If your compressor stays in your garage then this is okay. But for twice the money, you can buy a thomas compressor that has more power, is a lot less noisy, and a much better machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compressor - but hard to start when cold.","review":"This is a great portable compressor - I've been using it for over two years almost non-stop with no major problems. It has its quirks, though. As others have noted, it doesn't like to start when cold. Typically, you'll either need to bleed off air pressure so there's less resistance when it tries to turn over, or you'll need to keep cycling the on/off switch until it finally catches. I did notice a big improvement when I switched the oil to Mobil 1 0W/30 synthetic. The compressor calls for 5w/50 oil, but for cold-weather operation, the lower weight synthetic oil works great. In the summer, you can switch back to the heavier stuff if you're in very hot weather, but it probably isn't necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for granddaughter","review":"I bought the Chinese jump rope as a birthday gift for my 8 year old granddaughter.

But then I got to the chapter on the Palestinians. Here the author talks about the Israeli Haganah lining up Palestinian families and shooting them dead. According to my Dad, who was part of the \\"Stern Gang\\", no such thing happened. She talks about other disasters that befell the Palestinians, without giving context. For instance, Kuwait expelled its Palestinian workers, but there was a reason. The Palestinians had welcomed the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. Another disaster was when the Lebanese turned against the Palestinians. There was a reason for that too, the Palestinians had taken charge of the Southern Lebanon area and abused its inhabitants. The author should not be too credulous when talking with refugees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"Did I receive the correct DVD?!?!

However the battery page is no longer accessible from eReplacements (maybe after I complained by phone).

Yes, I believe breastfeeding is a good thing for mother and child but this doesn't mean (as Ms. Blum reveals) that it is always a joy.

Earphoria was originally released in 1994 to promote the Pumpkins awesome live footage video, \\"Vieuphoria\\". On this CD you will find every song from Vieuphoria exactly the same as on the video (just without the video part).I love this CD. The Smashing Pumpkins are definitely so much more powerful live and you can feel that by listening to this awesome album. \\"Disarm\\" sticks out more than any other. The version on this CD is an electric version played with the full band. The power the pumpkins bring into the atmosphere is amazing.

I found that MANY passages flow like poetry. If you are interested in Lowell and his times, you will not be able to put this book down. My favorite period is the mid-to late fifties in and around the New England area. It was an extremely fertile time: Richard Wilbur, Ann Sexton, Sylvia Plath and on and on. The country was coming out of the deadening 50's and moving on to the New Frontier 60's with all it's social and cultural upheavals. If you're a teacher of any grade, tell your students this book has somewhere in the neighborhood of 1400 footnotes. That might stop their complaints when they have to make ONLY 2 citations. More than 'just' a biographer, Mariani is himself, a writer and a poet, and he uses his skills deftly to bring Lowell to life. An excellent read!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is my item????

It's unfortunate that promotion was absent. He worked with some of the best producers at that time: Babyface, Al B Sure, Sean Combs. He even had songs written by Babyface and Faith EVans.

They walk into the studio, hook up a huge amplifier, start playing random chords and [bad] drumming, and grunt out some lines about sticking knives in people.

You actually think the guy can growl that low? Of course he can't. Those are almost below possible levels of speech or growling. What Mortician (and many other death metal bands do) is scream, record it, and use computer software or technology in the studio to pitch shift the sound way lower than it actually is, also using harmonizers. This is an age old trick. I can do it on my own computer as well. It's all effects, not real."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst death metal band in existence...","review":"This is not a death metal release, this is a joke and a disgrace. The untalented members of Mortician know about three chords, hook up a drum machine, and create about an hour of the worst death/grind metal I've ever heard in my life. Featuring vocals so altered by electronics they are lower than the bass guitar, no musicality at all, nothing but disconnected two chord riffs over a drum machine, and a weak overall sound, this really bites it. The lyrics are silly horror knockoffs, and really epitomize why death metal has gotten such scrutiny. Don't buy this unless you have a sleeping disorder, guys. Stick to real DM acts like Cryptopsy, Carcass, Malignancy, Morbid Angel, Immolation, Nile, or Pessimist. These guys are just imposters. and if you want grindcore, check out Carcass's first album.

The vocals are some of the worst attempts at growling that i've ever heard. The guitar consists of repeated chords with distortion and no solos. Bass?! Hah, that's a good one. There is no drummer because they use a drum machine, which shows that they are lazy. The horror film clips in their songs end up being longer than the songs themselves. This band has to be a joke.

Nasum can play fast and still be musical.

There are no riffs on this record), and the most phoney Death metal vocals Iv'e ever heard. Woohoo! Oh, and in response to the reviewer from France I give him this comment: Marduk and Enthroned are light years ahead of these guys in regards to songwriting and musicianship. You'd have to be pretty strung out to find this band entertaining. Check out Immolation's \\"Close to a world below\\" instead. I personally find it superior in every area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mortician is a really bad band","review":"I love extreme metal, but Mortician just doesn't cut it. First of all, why use a drum machine? There are plenty of drummers out there that can match the speed of Mortician's computer (ex.: Nick Barker). Guitar-wise, it's heavy and unbelievably repetitive. Vocally, they illustrate why most people think growling and grunting is dumb. It can be a great thing if done properly, but the guy in Mortician just doesn't cut it. The final verdict: Buy some real death/black metal instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not very useful, but pretty book...","review":"I really wanted to like this book, because the photographs are good, the writing is good, and there is at least SOME useful information. And, it's a good pre-trip motivator. The problem is, it's the kind of book that should NEVER have been structured as a guide - instead, with a bit of rewriting, it could have (and should have) been a high quality coffee table book. To be fair, I found the overviews of each trail segment and the trail profiles to be quite useful. But, after hiking 430 miles of the CDT in Montana/Idaho, I have concluded that: 1) this guide is nowhere near detailed enough, 2) it is, unfortunately, not adequately set up for north to south hiking. My approach now is to sift through this book and extract whatever useful information I can find and add those tidbits to Jim Wolf's excellent, detailed, and comprehensive guidebooks, which are continually updated with new trail information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"I received lots of compliments.

This short paperback covers the syntax of nouns, verbs, particles and clauses, discussing the basic syntactical functions of each. The examples, though sometimes unclear, are sufficient, and specific Scripture passages can be referenced with the index provided in the back. Perhaps of greatest practical value in this work is the index of particles and prepositions located on the last page. It is difficult to find a good discussion of particles and prepositions outside of major reference grammars, so this is a welcome addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Princess and the Goblin","review":"This classic 19th Century fairy tale still holds up 100 years later.

Soon, she finds herself in a twisting plot full of trechery and danger. This book was exciting to read and made you feel the need to continue on. I would reccommend this book for many reasons. First of all right from the start the book is full of mystery. For example the author makes you feel the need to read on to discover the characters more. Also the book is crammed packed with action.

I had to try to cut them out with a knife, but they looked pathetic. Some good pancakes were sacrificed. Lets have a moment of silence for them. What's worse than making pancakes? Making eggs. It'll just fall apart. I lost all of my eggs. My poor babies. They turned into such a scrambled mess. HOWEVER, for the price, I suppose you get what you paid for. I used them once, and I've already stuffed them in some drawer where they'll never see the light of day again. Oh, one good thing: they're fairly shiny and smooth when they first arrive.

It's a human book, that ropes in all of the thoughts and dreams we all have, no matter how they play out. Even if you've never dreamed of going back in time and changing your past, this book will make you think about it, and will make you think about the consequences. It seems like a slightly cheesey sci-fi book on ths surface, but underneath it is a story about the hopes and dreams we all have, and about the time-travel we would all love to try, but secretly fear. I love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable and Thought Provoking","review":"This is a remarkable book. I wonder how I missed this when it first published in 1988? I love time travel stories. There is something special about this story for those of us entering our 50s and 60s or more, that will make you really appreciate it. We are all looking back at the choices we have made in our lives, whether we might have been happier or more successful or whether we found the right significant other. This story casts a revealing perspective on those questions, and what is the meaning of a successful happy life. I can't recommend this story strongly enough for those asking these questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"Not only did I find this book exceptionally entertaining, but it also made me think about what I would do if I were in the main character's shoes...and that is a question I now think of at least a few times a year.

It is beautifully written, moving, intelligent and thought-provoking. One of the best I have ever read in my life. What a tragedy this guy died so young. It transcends SF genre immediately and is a beautiful experience, though saddening. With each time loop the protagonist gets wiser and wiser about what really matters in our lives (however many times we relive each day). In the beginning he does the obvious -- goes for wealth and sexual excess. By the end of the book he has learned a dozen valuable lessons. This book is very instructive without ever being didactic.I'm 66 and wish I had read this when I was 20."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quiet Place","review":"I purchased this book after reading the cover and thinking it had a really neat premise.

There's no explosions, car chases, and he never seeks world domination with his knowledge of the future. He's just trying to find what makes him happy and the writer has a beautiful prose. A good read that deserves to be read in a quiet place."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF ONLY...","review":"This is one of my favorite books....has been for awhile.

Thousands? Tens of thousands? I've read fiction, non-fiction, school books, magazines, etc. in the many decades of my life, but this books stands out as one of the best I've ever read.Ashamedly, I have to admit this book is part romance, and I don't read romance. I read this book for it's science fiction plot, but the love story part of this plot was so compelling that it bought tears to my eyes, which I had to hurriedly blink away. The book is also very well written, I'm actually sure that many of you have often thought about the same thing happening to you, but the author did such a great job with the writing that he brings you along the journey seamlessly, without you questioning any part of it, along the way.If you are a romance reader, or a sci-fi reader, or even have a drop of romance in your blood, you must buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Tale","review":"In my youth I was an avid fan of science fiction and fantasy. As I grew older I continued to enjoy the genre, but I became more selective. I consider myself lucky to have found two excellent time-travel novels over the past two years. The first was \\"The Time-Traveler's Wife\\" and the more recent but older novel is \\"Replay\\" by Ken Grimwood. \\"Replay,\\" originally published in 1986, is an imaginative take on time travel that reads as well today as it must have in 1986. The story is entertaining, avoids the potential pitfall of becoming repetitive, draws you into the choices that the main characters, Jeff Winston and Pamela Phillips, must make, and forces you to think about the decisions you might make in a similar situation. Good fantasy and science fiction always reignites in me a fresh appreciation for the creativity of my fellow human beings, and \\"Replay\\" is a wonderful example of that creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"Most books you can read once, put them away and be satisfied. There aren't that many books that reach out and demand that you re-read them, but for me, this was one of them. I've recommended \\"Replay\\" to numerous friends over the past couple of decades, since I read it when it first came out. Why? Because as I read it, I really cared about what happened to Jeff Winston. Ken Grimwood's writing makes you care about the characters, about the losses they suffer when they die, are reborn 25 years earlier and all that they have accomplished in the previous replay is as if it never happened. The premise is interesting, the characters are complex, the story is good. Find it, read it, enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising emotional depth in a time travel story","review":"Perhaps the most surprising time travel story I've ever read, not because of the plot but because of the deep emotions and introspection it elicited in me. A wonderful book, solidly written, with all of the elements I love about time travel to the past. It's everyone's fantasy: to relive your life knowing in advance what's going to happen. All of the fun of betting on sure things, building up a fortune, avoiding mistakes, and taking full advantage of the situation. But that's only the beginning. Having hooked you into what you think is just a harmless romp, Grimwood then shifts gears and takes the story to a level far more profound and soul-searching. I was concerned that he might be spoiling the fun, but I was wrong. Grimwood really pulled it off. I couldn't put this book down until the very end. \\"Replay\\" made me look at my own life with fresh eyes, and maybe it'll do the same for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replay, A Must Read Novel","review":"I've purchased well over 50 copies of this book, both used and new, handing them out to family, friends, and co-workers. I too have loaned out my personal copy, only to have it disappear as it was passed on to another reader.

We had great fun discussing the book and the inevitable \\"what if's\\" that it presents. Do yourself a great favor and buy this book. I guarantee that you'll want to loan it out to your best friends as soon as you finish with it. I re- read this book every year or two and enjoy it more each time. I have just ordered 5 more copies, nuf sed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book of ALL time!","review":"This book was totally killer. My dad let me read it dispite its adult content because it was so amazing to him that he had to have me read it.

So satisfyed that i went at it again, reading it once more. This is a truely amazing book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape reality with \\"Replay\\"","review":"Grimwood creates an interesting concept in Replay, reliving one's life over and over again. I was glued to this book after the first chapter. Replay is one of those rare books that allows a person to escape their present life, and become enthralled in the life of another, in this case Jeff as he lives and relives his life. Escaping reality and getting lost in a book is one of the main reasons I enjoy reading, if you are at all similar in this respect, give this book a try. Part of what makes this book successful in my opinion is Grimwood's superb use of imagery. He uses imagery so well that the scenes and situations become tactile and real, in a word, believable. I am a highly visual person and as such imagery is always a technique I look for in books, so well done Grimwood. Take a look at the other reviews for this book, all great, I could not agree more! If you enjoy \\"alternate reality\\" books, than you must consider Replay. Read it just to escape your own reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I read the book several years ago and wanted to read it again. when I discovered there was an audiobook I was very excited. I am an audio \\"bookaholic\\". I drive a great deal and live for my audiobooks. anyway. this is a very cool story line. not sure if it would make a good movie, but is very cool. Sadly I read that the author passed away in 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Exploration of Second Chances","review":"Any book that begins with the main character dying young in the first paragraph is either going to be very bad or else go somewhere unusual. This book is unique and fascinating--The kind that nags and nags at you. It takes the old thought \\"If only I could live my life over knowing what I know now\\" and plays it out over and over. Having died middleaged with an unhappy marriage and a stymied career, our hero wakes up in college with his whole life before him. He promptly makes himself rich and famous but then he dies again and is reborn again. What makes the novel fascinating is that the author does not cheat. He does not stop. Our main character seems trapped in an endless time loop--or is he? Suddenly, new factors enter and...well, I won't spoil the plot. This is a must-read and would be a great novel for discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fascinating adventure of \\"what ifs:?","review":"I first read this book about 5 years ago, and passed it along to a friend-- was so taken with the concept that I bought it again--- and again passed it along to a friend. Finally bought it for a 3rd time... (Am I in a replay here?) I'll hang on to it this time. A fascinating exploration of the concept \\"what if you could live your life over, knowing all you already know?\\" A good, one-sitting book. Even my friend Abby (who usually takes months to finish a book) stayed awake long enough to read it in three days!Nancy Moore"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"I read this book in one sitting. 'Nuff said.Well, I'll say a little more. This is not a story of big ideas (although the central idea is interesting) or big adventure, but it is an interesting exploration of human nature that has a unique emotional resonance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this book!","review":"I first read Replay back in the 80's and was profoundly affected by it. I re-read it perhaps 3 times before losing it, and, believe it or not, forgetting the author's name. For several years I searched bookstores with no success. I remembered the author's name started with a \\"G\\", but the staff I asked drew a blank every time. I assumed that the book was not widely accepted, and that my reaction was more or less unique. When I decided to visit Amazon.com for the first time, the first book I searched for (I read hundreds of books) was Replay. Imagine my delight in not only finding the book, but also in reading many other reviews like this one. I'm ordering my new copy immediately. Definitely one of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIFE ALTERING","review":"I STUMBLED on this book the very day I had a conversation with a friend about living your life over and the changes you would make, if any. I just finished reading it for the 4th or 5th time and was ready to begin reading it again immediately. I've lent this book to several people who then got their own copies and bought friends copies. I plan to get a spare softcover copy. Do yourself a major favor and read it BEFORE the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I read this book back in the early 90's. My sister lent me her copy and told me I had to read it. I absolutely loved it. Over the last 10 years I've thought about different parts of the book occasionally; considering a lot of the what ifs. I realized recently that Amazon probably had a copy and I'd really like to own it and re-read it. And now I'll have my husband to read it too. I'm surprised no one has made a movie from it yet, but I'm glad they haven't. I doubt they would do it justice. I highly recommend this book (along with a long and distinguished list of others.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I wanted very much to like this book, being a reader who typically enjoys time-travel stories, but such was not the case. I found it to be choppy, largely unstructured despite the built-in chronology, and peopled with unconvincing characters. Jeff was okay, but Pamela was (to me, at least) thoroughly uninteresting. The dialogue throughout the book was authorese rather than the way real people talk, and the quite intriguing first half deteriorated into a morass of repetitive and boring mini-travelogues. Far from being \\"in the tradition of Jack Finney,\\" as the book jacket would have us believe, Replay was an amateurish mess. Don't waste your money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unknown Book to be Treasured","review":"Previous reviews have said it all, including the comparison to the wonderful movie comedy, \\"Groundhog Day\\". Ask yourself, \\"What if you could return to a previous point in your life, with all your knowledge and memories intact?\\" Then add the question, \\"What would be the purpose of doing it over?\\" It can make for a better conversation than most, and much of it will be spent on all the personal enjoyment and/or riches that could be had. The discussion, like the book, should eventually reach the deeper questions about what is really important to the individual. I don't presume to suggest that there is a \\"right\\" answer, but the search is what the book is really about. It succeeds astonishingly well, perhaps because the tale is told so simply and believably. I have reread this book a number of times, recommended it to many friends, and have come to learn that it now enjoys a status akin to that of a cinema \\"cult classic\\". Do yourself a favor and find out why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting concept, hard to put down, deeply moving","review":"This book has an interesting concept wherein the main character dies of a heart attack at the beginning of the book, then wakes up again as himself when he was a young college student. Through the story he keeps dying on the same date and time and coming back as himself -- hence the title <i>Replay</i>. Through the story he falls in and out of love during various replays, examines the meaning of life and love ...This was an engaging read. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because somewhere in the middle I felt like giving up the book all together. It was becoming a little repetitive. My husband read it before me and I actually said, \\"just tell me what happens in the end, I don't want to read this anymore.\\" He refused to tell me. Well, I finished the book and was glad I did -- riding through the few pages that weren't enjoyable, the pages that dragged. It was very deeply moving and in the end was well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put this book down!","review":"This is a really great book! I recommend it to everyone, whether you're a sci-fi fan or not. It really makes you think about what you would do if you could live your life over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty here to contemplate","review":"I will say this for \\"Replay\\", it does provide plenty of fodder for thought and discussion. The question of what you would do if your could live your life over with all your present knowledge intact is both fascinating and gut-wrenching. So for story idea itself \\"Replay\\" gets high marks. The writing however does tend to get bogged down in a new-age eighties kind of way. There were certainly some \\"cringe worthy\\" passages that unfortunaly left the story with a rather dated feel to it. That said it's still worth a read and does provide much to ponder. 3.5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! This book caught me off guard...","review":"During a birthday party at my house, two friends raved on and on about 'Replay' and asked me what I thought as they picked the book off my bookshelf. Gee, had never seen the book before! After their reviews, I decided I better read it. I could not put the book down! I have recommended it to many friends and have given the book as a gift. For a week, I contemplated what I would do in a replay situation. WARNING: DON'T FINISH THIS BOOK BEFORE YOU GO TO BED!

Great imagination, though it was bit predictable. It kept me interested all the way to the last page. Recently I have found few books to do so.

But it did make me think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Premise that delivers","review":"Looking at the reviews, I see there are of Replay fans, so I guess I'll just chime in with the rest. I got this book witout knowing anything about it and was amazed with how good it just kept getting. Great premise (I loved Groundhog Day too), but there are also some twists and turns that keep the story evolving in unexpected but satisfying ways. The author delivers a nice ending that totally fits.... Then, I spent the next few days thinking about how I would replay my life (the bets, the stock picks), as well as maybe coming away with a bit more appreciation for the life I have and have left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding !","review":"I LOVE this book! It's one of those rare books that I had a hard time putting down, couldn't wait to get back to, and dreaded the inevitable end of it. I've been an avid reader for many years and count this among my top five favorites of all time. It was very well written, and filled with adventure, emotion, and great visual effect. It also opened the very fun door of \\"What if.....?\\" Just an overall excellent read. Grab your slippers and a comfortable chair for this one. It's like curling up with an old friend. Unforgettable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely strong premise","review":"With over 300 reviews, it's clear this book has struck a chord with readers. I found it in a charity book store, and was intrigued by its one sentence 'hook' about what would happen if you could live your life over and over and over again.For the first three quarters of the book, the author delivers 5 star material. In particular, the 'second time around life' of the protagonist is rendered in exceptionally compelling and believable detail that kept me turning pages with scarcely a thought about anything else.The book goes off the rails a bit in the last quarter. However, I cared about the main character and his love interest all the way through the book. Moreover, although their is a fantastic premise at the heart of the book, I would not classify this book as fantasy or science fiction. it's really speculative fiction, done well, off of a heckuva premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down ending....","review":"I agree with most of the reviews - it was a great book. After many repetitions of the theme, I had to wonder where it was going. I am not going to spoil the ending, but will say that I was disappointed, apparently others were not. For me it was anti-climatic. It built up to a let down.There should have been some sort of explanation for the phenomena. Maybe the sequel will cover it, or the movie!?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Went Terribly Wrong","review":"This story begins well enough and the author delivers much promise as to what will come, but something goes terribly wrong along the way and it becomes more self-serving to the author than promising to the reader. It left me with nothing to think about and because the characters were so self serving, I really didn't care what happened to them. By the way, this was a book club suggestion and I couldn't possibly recommend it for a book club selection, although it may provide an interesting discussion regarding the why of it all. I will say no more in that regard for those of you who wish to go ahead and read it for yourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dialogue straight from a poorly written soap opera","review":"The basic plot is interesting enough, and there are plenty of reviewers who described it well enough... my beef is with the characters' dialogue! Much of it could be right at home in a paperback romance... Halfway through the book I began laughing aloud, and it wasn't during any intentionally funny parts. It's as if Mr. Grimwood intermittently handed his manuscript over to a 16-year-old wannabe soap opera writer and said, \\"Take it away!\\" Stuff like, \\"He breathed into her tawny hair,\\" and the woman coyly asking the main character, \\"Why aren't you looking at the scenery,\\" followed by his ogling, \\"I AM...\\"Ugh! After that I pretty much skimmed through the rest of the book to get to the resolution without my eyes rolling out of my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I could not put this book down when I originally read it. The book is totally absorbing and emotionally provoking on a what if level. I had borrowed this book to read it and now I have purchased it to re-read it and share it with others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci Fi book or New Age mumbo jumbo?","review":"I read and read and read through all of the different Lives this character \\"Replayed\\" and yes, it was interesting but I was really hoping for a Big Payoff; to find out why exactly this was occuring but We never do and I felt cheated because of this.Instead we get some convuluted thing about appreciating what we have when we have it.That just didnt do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, just rather slow....","review":"After reading the reviews here, I was ready for a great book. Unfortunately, I found myself rather bored after the first loop and almost left it on the plane 1/2 way through. (Ending up finishing it on the return flight since our movie was broken).The concept of exploring alternative ways your could live your life is quite intriguing, but the story didn't click for me. Believable characters, just dull.Of course, I generally like fast-paced techno thrillers and this was a slow, drawn-out, very non-technical drama. I would've much preferred if the bad guy they meet was much more intertwined throughout the plot to at least explore different perspectives on replaying one's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too gritty","review":"This book has an exciting premise, but I felt like I was slogging through too much muck. It is very gritty with superfluous swearing. It doesn't add to the story and it drags one down. Not an easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have missed something","review":"I noticed that the first couple of reviewers state that they are not big science fiction readers, but found the story line interesting, intriguing... so on and so forth.Well I am a science fiction reader, a science fiction watcher (movies and tv) and a complete computer geek and this book really doesn't do anything impressive.I may be the 252 reviewer for this book, I think it needs to be said.I have seen/read this same material handled with much more humor and emotion than this book covered. A very simple example would be StarGate SG-1's episode where they are stuck in a time loop.There are parts of this book that were simply just not interesting and others that are trite. This book did not cover anything interesting, or add anything original to the concept of traveling back in time.My final comment = If Back to the Future were made into a book, it would be infintely more interesting than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could live part of my life over again,","review":"I would spend the time that it took to read this book reading something else. Pros: Harmless, parts were well written. Cons: Sappy, preachy, and uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my usual, but entertaining","review":"I'm not a sci fi expert so I can't compare this to other similar titles. However, the reviews were primarily positive so I dove in. I thought it was a fascinating premise and I liked what Grimwood did with it. I read so many books, I often forget aspects of a plot within a few weeks. But this plot stuck with me, and that's a good sign. What a study of human nature this is, as the decision must be made over and over again what to do with an astounding power to seemingly change history. It made me think about what I might do in that position. I thought the pair showed a lot of smarts as they began coming to certain realizations. It was suspenseful as the intervals of their repeated chances began diverging and they sensed the possible heartbreak of losing one another and losing an opportunity forever. If you're the least bit confused by my strange blathering, pick up the book and prepare to be captivated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favortie Book of all time","review":"I read this book 15 years ago. I don't reread books but I have read this in paperback so many times that the binder is broken. When people ask me what my favorite book of all time is. I always say this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing Experience","review":"I hate to admit it but I don't read as much as I should but after reading Replay in record time for me (two days) I am already looking for my next book. The story and relationships projected deep into my soul and made me take a emotional glimpse of how I live my own life. I'm astounded at the way this novel made me feel about what is really important in this brief time we spend on this planet. Choices, Relationships and Priorities. I hope that it effects others as well. We can only hope that Mr. Grimwood is creating more stories like it. I honestly didn't want it to end. Lets hope that Hollywood doesn't botch up the film version. I recomend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I first read this book 5 years ago. Since then I picked it up in various libraries, but couldn't find it in a bookstore. After discovering Amazon.com, this book was in my first order. Something about it just struck a cord with me. Maybe it is the fact that the characters are so real. Real people with real failings dealing with problems that are out of the ordinary. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"In a word... \\"OUTSTANDING!\\"","review":"Replay is one of the top 5 books I have ever read and I really can't say I have enjoyed another book more. The replaying concept is very compelling as are the various problems associated. Problems you and I might never have conceived. This book is a must read for anyone and everyone.For those of you looking for a similarly outstanding read check out Memoirs of an Invisible Man by H.F. Saint."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could just live my life over...","review":"What would you do if you could live your life over? What changes would you make? Especially if you knew what you know now! Could you prevent the Kennedy assassination? Bets on Super Bowls and World Series would net you a fortune. How about financing Bill Gates when he was just starting out and becoming a billionaire? What would you do"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"Go back and do it all again knowing the mistakes to avoid and the opportunities to take advantage of, sounds great right? Jeff Winston thinks so and uses his knowledge of future events to greatly improve on his former life. But, despite all his precautions, he dies again on the same day at the same time as before...only to awaken in his 18 year old body again. All his gains, financial and personal, erased. A blessing or a curse?Who hasn't entertained the fantasy of reliving their life? \\"If I knew then what I know now...\\". REPLAY tells you to be careful what you wish for. Grimwood's tale is very original and thought provoking. Yes some story lines seem to go nowhere but it didn't stop me from enjoying this story nor it will it stop me from reccommending it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Very Best...","review":"As a fan of science fiction in general, and time travel stories in particular, during the past 50 years I've read perhaps 1000 SF books, and I must say that \\"Replay\\" ranks right up there near the top of the list. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One my VERY favorite books, ever. Would make a great movie.","review":"The idea of this book is brilliant. The concept is not new, but it is written with wonderful characters and possibilities. The main character dies only to wake up in his college dorm. Lives to a certain age every time, and --replays. I really loved this book and have read it at least three times. It would make a great movie in the right hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING AND LIFE-CHANGING","review":"This book truly can change your perception of life. The more lives the character lives through, the more comfortable and relaxed you become about your own life. Simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"Like the protagonist, this is a book you need to read and reread again. Time travel books are not always easy to do (see Crichton), but this one hits a home run. It draws parallels to to the movie Groundhog day, and it reminds me a little bit of the great flick Memento as well. I wish Grimwood would write more often."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book I re-Read every 5 years.","review":"This is by far my most favorite book of my life. I read about 30 books per year. most of them best sellers with 4 to 5 stars.This book is a 10 Stars book.Each member of my family that read the book, lost a night sleep. Couldn't let it out of their hands.A must Read and must must have, since you will re-Read it time and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great critique to the New Deal programs!!!","review":"This is Hoover's response to the New Deal programs, and it is based on his view that the programs would undermine the respect that individuals have for both freedom and liberty. It turns out that he is correct, but in this work Hoover offers a great insight into how these programs change the nature of citizenship. He argues that these programs replace self-sufficency with reliance upon government. That, he further argues, makes people come to view themselves in terms of being wards of the state. These programs just work to extinguish the self reliance that made America great, and that is why they needed to be repealed then. This book is important because it shows that Hoover saw what would occur with some accuracy. Get it and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"1060s?","review":"This is an invaluable source for anyone researching this time period. Whether studying Damascus, Syria as a whole, the Crusades or the major players in the Crusades, (especially from the Islamic side) Ibn al-Qalanisi is indispensable. Of particular interest to me in my studies were the writings about Zengi, one of the earliest leaders of the Muslim counter-Crusade, who was more preoccupied with capturing Damascus rather than attacking crusader lands. Qalanisi's writings on this character are far from the panegyrics associated with other chroniclers of Zengi (such as Ibn al-Athir).If you have any interest in the crusades from the Muslim perspective, pick this book up. And just to clarify on the other review listed here, the call for the crusades from Pope Urban II did not occur until 1096, I think he meant that the Qalanisi covers the crusades until the 1160's?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The other side of the story!","review":"Just as the title says, this book provides a view of the Crusades from the point of view of a Damascene. Consequently, most of the events are related to those where the rulers and/or armies of Damascus were involved. The book covers the early history of the Crusades up until the 1060's AD.The book sheds much light on the dealings between Muslim rulers and does a pretty good job at telling events. However, it is at places superficial and leaves you wondering about the reasons for a change in a ruler's behavior or the motives for a certain action. Nevertheless, it is an invaluable reference to the events of the period it covers as seen by a contemporary.I highly recommend this book, not just for the information it provides, but also for some of the beautiful descriptions that it carries. It is one of the few resources available to scholars to learn about the Crusades from the Arab point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rare and wonderful source","review":"Damascus is one of the most fascinating cities from the Crusader era. This book provides some deep insights into that city during the early era of the Crusades. There are some selections from this chronicle in Arab Historians of the Crusades, but this is the only place you'll find a complete English translation. Totally indispensable for a Crusades scholar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloth already torn after only a little over a year.","review":"Bought this 16 months ago and the cloth is already torn. I replaced the last one which lasted a decade and this one is already crap. Do not buy this if you want to have to replace it again in a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Built like a tank !","review":"I just got this from Amazon and so far I am really impressed. It is very well built, the controls work smoothly and, like every Honda engine I have owned, it started right up. It comes completely assembled ! All you need to add is compressor oil, motor oil and gasoline. It sits low to the ground so is pretty stable (how many times have you pulled over one of the high riding compressors when you tried to get just a few more inches away. It rolls around pretty well but is a little tough on very rough ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would that I could get back those minutes I squandered","review":"There's cult schlock that I appreciate and then there's just schlock. As soon as I saw JJ Walker appear, I knew the deal was sunk. As the potential enjoyment of the film lay bleeding profusely at my feet, Mark Hamill arrived on scene and kicked it in its head. I gave it 2 stars because it had its moments and Jeffrey Combs was in it. He had a bit part but he just cheers me with his presence."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Anime Guyver was great but the live version [is bad]!","review":"I love the Anime version of the guyver. But this movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I mean they took a great concept like the guyver and made it into a B movie. If you have watched the anime series don't watch this movie. The backstreet boys scare me more than the monsters in this thing did. If you have watched this movie and are thinking about getting the anime series do it, its like 100x better.I have said my peace..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Guyver: All-Around Best Action/ Sci-Fi Movie","review":"For those of you seeking action, the \\"Guyver\\" should be #1 on your list! This movie has great martial arts moves, superb special effects, and great top-notch actors. Although a little corny at times, the movie tells what the Guyver is truly meant to be. Don't skip out on \\"Guyver 2: Dark hero,\\" either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad ... \\"Watchable Bad\\" though","review":"I just want to be as clear as humanly possible. This is NOT a good movie by any standards. The actings awful, the script is terrible, the costumes are goofy looking, the score and music are low-rent. The whole film's production value was somewhere around an above-average 'Power Rangers' episode.Having said all of that, this is a rare instance where the film not only accepts its cheesyness but seems to embrace it. I was actually suprised the production team didn't try and get a PG rating. It would have made a good post-Saturday morning cartoon movie.If you were looking for a good 'B' movie to entertain yourself with, this fits the bill. Any movie with Jimmy \\"Dyn-No-Mite\\" Walker in it is always going to be entertaining on SOME level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman's alien brother","review":"You ever have a film that you keep wanting to watch over and over again? That's what I felt when I watched this for the first time; I wanted to see it again and again.Although some might think that the title and the movie in general is a bit campy, \\"The Guyver\\" has a magnificant history in Japanese anime. The film takes the dark anime and makes a dark and violent film with some big name B-movie actors (Jeffrey Combs and the late David Gale, for example) and created a great back bone for a sequal, and solidified that Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man weren't the only superheroes in the world.The Guyver is a superhero for independent anime lovers and people tired of the same old \\"cape and cowl\\" or \\"friendly neighborbood\\" stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a good ,but not very","review":"I mean c'mon. Mark dies at the end!You don't kill the real star of any movie! His performance was just as superb as always. Wish I could that about everyone else in the movie. I hate to say it, but this movie is definately the one that took down Hamill's career."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened????","review":"The guyver, what the hell happened. The orignal anime and comic book story had totaly been stripped away and what was left, a crap no action camp American film. The suit looked crap and the zoanoids?? Come on the story is there but the way the director goes about the film kills it. Oh and mark hamill, stick with luke my boy, at least he dosent turn into a cockroach at the end of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Poor Mark Hamill!","review":"Yuck! What a lousy movie! The writing's atrocious, the story's absurd, the costumes look like a bunch 'a kids raided the junkyard for Halloween... All has going for it is fact that A. Story has potential (till you actually watch the movie) and B. Mark Hamill's in it. Poor him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I just watch?","review":"So I'm sitting on my couch and this movie just came on the action channel. I turned on about 45 minutes into it and I immediately said to myself, \\"Wow, this looks like the lamest movie I will ever see. I am intrigued!\\" So I watched it and sure enough, it was incredibly cheesy. For the year and their budget, the costumes were pretty sweet. I mean, I don't think I could've made anything any better. Gwar could, but that's another story. The fight scenes were almost as bad as the acting and the Jimmy Walker alien rapping was painful. All that being said, I still watched the last hour or so of the movie and as stupid as it was, it was entertaining. The Zoalord was pretty cool--he was some kind of giant,alien, antelope/praying mantis half breed. I'd have to say that my favorite part of the movie was the very last scene because Jimmy Walker alien was smoking a blunt with a black guy and that's just fantastic. What an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok...but the Anime are a lot better","review":"I remember when I was 10 I first watched this and I thought it was great then I saw the sequel which I thought was cool too. Couple years later though I saw all the anime and it was a lot better than this. If you really want to know anything about the Guyver story line, seriously stick to the Anime and Manga(which I never read but was the origin of this so it has to be better) The suits in the first and second film did look cool but it doesn't overcome the bad acting and horrible plotline they cover. It's not even scratching the surface of what the guyver has to offer. I highly suggest grabbing the Anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for all Guyver fans","review":"This film is not as good as the second one, but it is still a pretty decent one, for a film that uses rubber costumes. Worth watching for the action sequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst piece of crud, ever","review":"I can't even give it a single star, but since I have to give it, I give it 1.This is so far away from the brilliant original comic and animation series that you wonder how these filmmakers got a hold of the rights to mess it up to this end.I was thoroughly disappointed that the filmmakers decided to monkey around with the monsters and make them into the Stooges - why do they always make things pedantic like that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't ever see this movie.","review":"My opinion is if you your a fan of Mark Hamill, watch The Star Wars Trilogy, Time Runner, Amazing Stories VI, or one of his many others. This movie will only cause heart ache, ( when Hamill's character dies at the end,) and cause you to lose your lunch. So rent any other Mark Hamill or sci-fi movie. And complain to your local movie house that if they have this movie, chunk it. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"CD","review":"Love this song.

I like the music so much that I have been buying copies to give to my sister and my children. My sister says that she plays it over and over again. It's a shame that more people have not heard of them, but I guess that their genre (New Age) does not get any airplay on most radio stations dedicated to rock, country, etc., although Josh Groban did get a lot of airplay when he covered their \\"You Raise Me Up\\" song (from their \\"Once In A Red Moon\\" CD). I think that you should at least preview the songs on this CD to see how excellent they are.If you like this music, you should also try music by David Arkenstone (especially his double CD \\"Visionary\\"), and Keiko Matsui (like her \\"Deep Blue\\", \\"Whisper From The Mirror\\", \\"Dream Walk\\", and \\"No Borders\\" (originally titled \\"The Wind And The Wolf\\") CDs)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely, lush, CD, but it SURE sounds a LOT like Riverdance","review":"The only reason I don't give this gem 5+ stars is the fact that some of the songs sound so much Riverdance it sounds as they might be plagarized. The song that sounds nearly identical to one of the songs in Riverdance is song number nine.

Bleach is an amazing anime and I plan on reading the manga very soon for everything left out of the anime! <3Also, this season, one of the later episodes, has the best fight scene that I have ever witnessed between Ichigo and Kenny (<3 Kenny).

As Ichigo battles various other soul reapers, it gives a little background on how they know Rukia or how they became who they are today. Some battles are a little drawn out, Rukia doesn't appear very much, but the humor is still there. It's a little more serious than the first season but no less entertaining. The reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because of the long drawn out battles. Some of them are downright annoying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleach Season 2","review":"I was pretty happy about this box set. Compared to other anime box sets this actually comes with some special features that are pretty watchable.

Plus, Robert Pattinson is very nice to look at.Also, this is a decent sized poster, so be careful when handling it. If you're worried about tears/rips, be careful about what you use when sticking it up on your wall because if you ever have to move it, it may become hard to get down without it taking any damage. I guess if you liked it enough, you could laminate it; at least that way it should protect it. Or get those poster frames/plastic holders.

It is still a great sound from the uptempo \\"New and Different Way\\", the bluesy \\"Do You Want to Dance, the ballad \\"Seeing You for the First Time\\", or the jazz influenced \\"Love is Here\\".

Maybe it works in the north where cold makes honey hard, but here in Houston, where honey stays runny, it's impossible to fill unless it's totally and completely empty (which never happens with honey) so you always end up with a mess no matter what.

This dispenser is just not worth the trouble and mess, no matter how great the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handel not Stainless Steel as described","review":"I just recieved my honey dispenser and was very disappointed with the plastic handel and plunger mechanism.

Unfortunately, if I had read the reviews, I would of picked up on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy handle for the price","review":"The handle and pump mechanism for this dispenser are cheesy plastic - they will not last at all.

Don't waste your money on this poor quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing when used","review":"I actually put this on my wish list, thinking that it was absolutely the most unique honey server I'd seen. When I received it as a gift, it was even cuter than pictured. However, when I filled it, and used it the first time, I was incredibly disappointed! The plunger that holds the honey in is lifted when you press the handle, but it doesn't lift far enough to let more than the tiniest trickle of honey come out. Took FOREVER to get enough honey on my piece of toast. It looks wonderful, but if you want to eat your toast before it gets cold, this is not going to work for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely useless","review":"Unless you pour boiling water in the lower part that holds the dispenser, and thereby heat the honey until it's the consistency of syprup, the amount of honey that comes out is useless. The orifice through which honey pours is too small for honey of any consistency thicker than syrup."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks","review":"I bought two of these dispensers and they both leak.. so the value is 0 to me.I tried putting the unit in hot water, hoping that the heat might \\"re-form\\" the seal, but, that didn't work.After several more tries at soaking the unit overnight in hot water...pot on stove on low, I seem to have reduced the leak to almost nothing.Maybe a couple more times doing this will fix the problem.They should have included this method in the instructions.I will try this with the other unit.. I would like to use it to dispense maple syrup on pancakes..it ( the maple syrup ) is less viscous than honey and the flow should be faster.Dan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Near impossible to fill without creating a mess","review":"Bad Design! To fill, the dispense mechanism must be moved, resulting in an opening at the top of the container, in order to fill with honey, but also results in an opening at the bottom of the container where the honey dispenses. To fill, put your finger over the dispense opening, pour the honey in, using your one free hand. Then the mechanism must be reinserted, resulting in an outflow of honey! What a mess.As others have mentioned, the dispense assembly is poorly contructed with plastic, which is not mentioned as advertised in the product description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honey/syrup dispenser problems","review":"Neat idea, but baffling to see how to fill. Factory was no help. Finally figured it out - it's awkward but do-able.DO NOT TIP the dispenser after filling or in use.IF USING MAPLE SYRUP and you refrigerate it, any syrup left in the bottom opening after use will crystallize, restricting or blocking the opening on next use. Any crystals left around the stopper when you shut it off will make all the syrup drain out into the drip catcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norpro Honey Syrup Dispenser","review":"I saw this product on Pintrest and went searching glad I found it on Amazon where I am able to find everything I need. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Honey Dispenser!","review":"Best Honey dispenser, I have ever used! Keeping the water warm in the bottom \\"cup\\" that the dispenser sits in is just the ticket for keeping the honey flowing. Otherwise the honey has a tendency to go to sugar. But we are at a disadvantage on this one point because we use raw honey. Regular honey at the grocery store flows better. The main nice thing is that the honey does not drip and it is easy to direct the flow especially on toast! Liked it so well we bought several for our adult children as Christmas gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most","review":"I think this dispenser is better than the honey bear that you buy in the grocery store. My objective was to find something that wasn't as messy as the bear dispenser and the Norpro is a great improvement. While you do have to have two people to hold the jar while you fill it. (someone has to hold their finger over the hole at bottom) It still seems to be slightly leaking from the rim at top, but not as much as the bear dispenser does. I can still grab by the handle and come out sticky finger free. I didn't find any leaking to the dish below, unless I was using the hot water in basin to make the honey more liquified. Then some did spill into the bottom but less than 1/4 tsp. Nice that I do not have to wipe the counter all the time, unlike Mr. Honey Bear. The lid on the Norpro is only plastic but durable enough. I wouldn't advise putting any of it through the dishwasher however."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this even with its few flaw","review":"Pondering back and forth on whether to get this after reading other reviews, I decided to go for it. Every other honey dispenser I had was SLOPPY so my reasoning was that it couldn't get worse. I'm glad I did because it is cleaner and easier to use.The only flaw I deem worthy of mention in the design is not so great that it renders this product awful. It is a minor issue and is only slightly troublesome when you need to fill it. This does take a little effort because, as stated by others, the plug is removed when you open the top but it did NOT take 2 people to fill it. You can either set the opening on a towel on the counter or while holding it, place a finger over the hole. I have become quite proficient at the latter and fill the dispenser with little mess. The alternative would be to go back to the other much more sloppy dispensers - nope, not happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"As a beekeeper I'm always looking for better ways to dispense honey. I saw this on recently and thought it was genius! Then I took the top lid off to fill it and thought it was the an incredibly stupid and not very well thought out design. In order to fill the dispenser you need to remove the top which also opens the bottom so as you are pouring the honey in the top it is flowing out the bottom. I thought maybe I could fill it from the bottom but that would mean having the top off! Bad bad bad design! Don't waste your money! If they at least sold some kind of small plug to fill the bottom hole so you can add honey to the top that would solve the problem but they didn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Plastic","review":"I was tired of pot metal or plastic syrup dispensers and decidedI would pay top bucks to get a quality item.

And where is consciousness? You have to look in some other book.Finally, he lets us know wich kinds of deaths there are ( the good, the bad, the so and so ) and how we'll feel death.

And sometimes the characters' motivations are kind of difficult to understand (I mean, let your enemy die already!) Explosions, cackling insane villians damaging toy elephants (is that supposed to be symbolic or suggestive of the later animal damaging that goes on?)... this book was weird.

I personally enjoy a little change of pace, and Pipestone delivered. This is my first Pipestone purchase. It has a nice round dance flavor, and they pretty much cover the pow wow circuit 'love life'. My favorite track has to be 'Wally's World'. I thought I was the only one who loved Walmart, but Pipestone digs em too. My favorite line is \\" Without you I'd fall apart, thank God for Walmart\\". Amen to that Pipestone! Also I really liked 'Strollerz', 'Teepee Creepin'. 'Kiss Goodbye', but really The entire album is fun and light. You can't miss with this one. Aloha.

It's a gadget, a toy, and it is a prized possession of mine. I found it easy to use, easy to download music, great to carry around and take music on the go without carrying a cumbersome CD player and CD's. Maybe if I was a techno-freak I would have knocks against this product, but for the general consumer I think it's a great toy.Just wish it came with a case or clip so I could more comfortably take it running."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is *not* an MP3 player","review":"almost too shocked for words - the advertising and packaging clearly mentions MP3.

Three days later I returned it. First of all, the software is not compatible with my computer (a Dell Inspiron 5000). I could rip songs from one CD and then it refused to recognize the drive. I'm sure it works fine with a Sony computer, just not with mine.Additionally, I thought a memory stick walkman would be a nice addition because my Sony digital camcorder also uses memory sticks. However, you have to buy a magic gate memory stick to use with the walkman, which costs three times more than the already expensive regular memory sticks.For the money, Sony should really do better. I have since purchased the Nomad Jukebox. I have had no problems at all, plus I don't have to worry about losing a collection of memory sticks since I have 6 GB in one solid piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has proprietary power supply and data storage","review":"After having this product for a year, I'm shopping for another MP3 player. I've realized that by this product having proprietary powersupply and storage, we are initially forced to stay loyal to this product at exhorbitant prices (i.e for replacements or accessories and sotrage). It gives me the impression that such companies are insincere towards customer satisfaction in the long run or are not far sighted enough to maintain long term customer relations. My next Mp3 player will have AAA or AA batteries, which I can change anytime without having to replace the entire rechargeable unit after it dies, it will have standard storage as per what market requirements are either MMC/Smartmedia/Compact Flash. If would be ideal if it also has an FM tuner on it. It should be small and light weight and can be clipped to the belt or arm for purposes at the gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality sound...very bad software..poor Sony support","review":"Three times the software has locked up the computer and then when I rebooted found that it had trashed my drive. I had to rebuild it from scratch each time. Very poor. I have since upgraded my computers to Windows 2000 which Sony seems to think noone is using. They don't support Win2000 or WinME both of which are far more stable than Win95/98. So, I have shelved my unit and purchased an IGO MP3 Player which is far easier to use, works with modern OS's and is supported. Sony has failed it's customers because of it's lack of timely upgrades, poor/non available support and lack of support for other operating systems. If you're smart, stay away from this until Sony changes their bad behaviour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware if you have Windows 2000","review":"So, you buy a Sony product and expect that the company will support it. Well, beware! I have a new computer and can no longer use my MP3 player.

Thus, any MP3's you might have already on your computer would need to be converted to the ATRAC compression system first. Unfortunately, this causes a lot of hassles, and if you already have a huge amount of MP3's (legally, of course) on your system, you might want to look at another of the player's out there.However, if you are looking to digitally manage all of your music on your computer, and you have a huge hard drive, then this is the best player on the market for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashware","review":"I bought the music clip version of the sony players. These products are a total waste of money. True, they have a sleek, compact design but are functionally worthless due to the multiple limitations of the software (open MG jukebox) which must be used to download or convert files. As best I can tell they are not really MP3 players but only play reformatted MP3 files. As a result you must clog up your hard drive with all of the converted tracs in addition to the original MP3 files. To make matters worse, you can only check out a song from 1 computer to one music clip player. But wait, it gets worse. You can only check a song out to that specific player 4 times. This is SONYs effort to protect copyrighted music for which it has a vested interest. But the ads are misleading and the product worthless to me. This is SONYs next Betamax. I've gone back to my prior, somewhat chunkier player which is convenient if slightly larger"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and Useless","review":"Sony has made a nice piece of hardware, but you can only get music onto the thing using their sites when downloading emusic. And, if the song is fairly popular, chances are, you will have to pay to download it. The real surprise is that you do not get to keep the song, you have to check in and out of Sony's mainframe to \\"check in\\" and \\"check out\\" the songs, plus, they will erase your song if they decide you have had it too long. Basically, its an MP3 player that is expensive, and you can not even get the music you want. I bought mine, and returned it furious 3 hours later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really MP3 - or Windows Media Player Compatible","review":"I own this and I really wish I had not purchased it at all. I use windows ME with Media Player and have a fairly extensive collection of MP3 files recorded from my own collection of CD's. I purchased this for use while traveling due to its size and storage capacity. The box and advertising is extremely deceptive with respect to its use of the ATRAC3 format instead of MP3. Even the windows Media Player site would lead you to believe its compatible with MP3 directly - it is not. Sony's OpenMG software is very primitive and hard to use compared to other Juke Box software packages. I really dislike having songs taking up my hard drive in both formats. I own a lot of great Sony products. This is one I wish I never purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betamax redux","review":"What a useless piece of junk. Impressively cool looking, it requires you to jump through Sony's copy-protection hoops to play music that you legitimately own. It also requires special MagicGate memory sticks, which are much more expensive per megabyte than other storage media.If you want an expensive toy that forces you to endlessly convert files and pay homage to a technology that will disappear in a year you should by this player.Can you say Betamax?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective design.","review":"I received two sets of the color trend flatware for christmas.At first glance I was pleased.

Then the second tree wished that he could be made into a strong ship to carry kings and sail in strong waters. Then the third tree wished she could just grow very tall and point the way to heaven. The years passed, the three trees grew strong and tall. Then one day three woodcutters climbed the hill. I think you would really like this book. I love this book because it's about Jesus.

And, as the years pass, \\"the three trees nearly forgot their dreams.\\" Yet each eventually gets its wish, although not in the way it had foreseen. When that happens, each discovers that things turned out just the way they should have. This is a moving and eloquent story. Its illustrations are simple yet powerful. Readers will be reminded that God has plans for every one of his creations, that He never loses sight any of us. Children will learn that when they don't get what they want, it may be because something even better is in store for them. Adults will understand the concept of true happiness coming when we align our will with God's.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOWHERE near as good as other versions!","review":"This version is really bad comparitively. The trees are all the same, and it doesn't tie in the meaning of the book for youngsters as well as the version by Catherine McCafferty. In her book, each tree is a different type showing its own strenghths, and it states clearly that God has fulfilled the dreams of the trees but in much bigger ways than the trees could ever dream.

I could talk about the dated synthesisers, the poorly used drum machines that seem to lack any sort of low end, or the fact that this seems to be music at its most tame. There is nothing about this album that evokes any sort of emotion, it just limps along lifelessly as if specifically designed to be ignored.Not only is it mind-numbingly dull but on top of that it has aged horribly. This worst of 80s music production is out in full force here. It is way too overproduced and the typical keyboard/synth replacing anything that could be called a bass.

I'm sure there are some brilliant tips and suggestions and insights here, but I wish he'd left his \\"come to realize\\" moments about his own idiotcy on the editing floor. I don't mind a personal approach where authors share their own frailties and insights at pertinent points in a book. But I don't want to be awash in their own self-flagellation. I confess. I became so annoyed half-way through this book I put it down and haven't finished it. I got the sense he was explaining his \\"come to Jesus\\" moment of insight about his own idiotcy to someone and they said, \\"Gee, you ought to write a book about that.\\" (Probably so they wouldn't have to listen to him talk about it anymore.)Sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty mediocre","review":"This book wobbles between weak attempts at humor, brief examples of Idiot Bosses which aren't used to demonstrate any points, and inane advice on how to get along with \\"idiot\\" bosses.

Their blend of engaging pop rock hooks, introspective lyrics, tight harmonies and energenic performances mixed with bagpipes and a didjeridoo make them one of the most unique musical offerings out there.This album, commonly referred to as the Black & White album, was their first. Unfortunately, not much of what I mentioned above is present here. The harmonies are good, but the material is substandard. There are a few minor highlights, but overall, Brother comes off as one of those anonymous 80's bad movie soundtrack bands that you hear on cable TV late at night.Hey...every band has to start somewhere.

The skills, as others have suggested are essential to living a healthy, happy life, regardless of one's 'problems.' While most modern day psychotherapeutic techniques preach change, Linehan's work centers on centering. Acceptance balanced with change. Emotion balanced with logic. It's a wonderful new perspective on treating psychological disorders. And as an added bonus, in the age of managed care, it's one of the few treatments rooted in a humanistic understanding that will be readily reimbursed by HMO's. As both a therapist and a consumer of psychological literature, this work stands as one of the most helpful available. Well worth the money.

The author offers advice on adapting it to be used in individual therapy however. Linehan is forging a place in the mental health field as the foremost clinican in dealing with BPD. The reader is immediately aware of the extensive amount of research that went into this workbook. The author is not writing about opinion, she is writing about the results of years of extensively scrutinzing the work of herself and others. In my practice I have found that the use of the book, especially the handouts in the back of the book, could be in nearly ever session I ever have with someone battling with Borderline Personality.

Would recommend purchasing the heavier presses that are a little more expensive but probably better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats hand rolling!","review":"This tortilla press is very easy to use (in fact it's almost fool proof). I lined both sides with wax paper so the pitas and tortillas would be easy to remove. Usually 1-1.5 oz of dough make the proper thickness and you will also want to make sure you place the ball slightly towards the hinge. The one downside to this press was that the side closest to the handle tended to be thinner. I combat this by pressing once, turning the pita the other way in the press (so the thinner end is next to the hinge), and pressing one more time. Despite being thinner near the hinge, my tortillas and pitas are MUCH more uniform using this press than rolling them by hand and it only took me about 25% of the time! I would recommend this press to anyone that makes tortillas, pitas, or flatbread at home. It has really streamlined my bread making process!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"Do not waste your money on this press.

You should first presume that angry customer didn't/can't read the directions. This is a wonderful tool in the kitchen. However, I use a storage bag--not wax paper which I can taste--cut on three sides. There is no nuisance as with plastic \\"Saran\\" wrap. Tortilla making is not a violent process. It would be very difficult to break this unless the dough you're using is too dry. Keep the dough moist with a damp towel over the bowl. I use a small ice cream scoop and form all the balls of dough before I start pressing, cooking the tortillas as they come off the press. Lard, of course, enhances the taste. I expect this item to last the rest of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond compare","review":"Don't buy this product! I'm sure this product works in theory, but in practice, it's just plain bad. The surface area is way too small, the handle is rickety, and it fails to produce a consistent thickness (tortillas become prone to punctures)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly large or easy enough","review":"I purchased this product because I am embarking on a gluten-free diet, and wanted to be able to make tortillas at home. This is an inexpensive press, but creates really small tortillas, to the point where the best use is probably small tostadas and quesadillas. Even as a press for taco shells, it is small. Also, I found that in order to get a uniform thickness (not skinny on one side and thick on the other) I had to rotate the dough several times after pressing in order to ensure the right thickness and uniformity, so the press didn't really make it much easier than hand-rolling the dough. If you're looking for something useful for burrito and enchilada type tortillas, I'd recommend going with a larger model."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Store Bought Tortillas For Us","review":"I was thrilled to receive this product...no longer wanting to buy tortillas filled with stomach-turning fillers. Anyway, I researched a number of products and this one looked like a good entry model. The price point was fantastic. It arrived in perfect shape and we made our first tortillas the very next day. Many recs are made or whether to use parchment paper, wax paper or plastic wrap as a liner. Thus far we have tried wax and parchment and the parchment won hands down. Prepared (add water and stir) masa harina is found in your grocery flour/baking aisle. Now I will say that I have not found a non-gmo masa harina on our local shelves. Will have to order that product online."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for making fresh corn tortillas","review":"I used this for the first time last weekend. It works pretty well provided that the dough is the right consistency and that you use plastic wrap to line the press. Don't bother using waxed paper to line the press. I tried that and it soaked up moisture in the masa mixture so the tortilla stuck to the paper.Making tortillas is a time consuming process but our patience was rewarded. This product is a must for people who want fresh tortillas but have no local torilleria from which to buy them. Once you eat fresh tortillas you'll never want to buy them at the grocery store again."},{"rating":"2","title":"TORTILLA","review":"works great couldn't be happier, fast shipping and very well packaged make sure to use a gallon size ziplock cut up so it doesn't stick to the press"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does everything it's meant to do","review":"This is a very good tortilla press. At home (I'm from Mexico) we used to have a much heavier/sturdier one. It used to be slightly easier to make tortillas with that press since they would come out more evenly pressed than with this one. However, the difference in quality/ease of use is very small, and this one is cheaper, lighter and better looking. To top that, even though it feels less sturdy, I have put it to stress tests and I now think it was built to last. Very good product overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average product, not for beginners","review":"This product is definitely NOT for beginners,the circle is too small and I don't know why the tortilla shape is not circular but oval. You have to find a trick to make the tortilla shape completely circular. Also, you spend more time making the tortillas due to this defect. Once you get use to it the product works fine, but there are better tortilla presses.EDIT: 11/1/12 I HATE this product, I had to purchase another other, this one is just too flimsy and not heavy enough to make good tortillas.

However, I don't think it's as strong as cast iron. I haven't tried the cast iron but from the reviews the grease issue turns me off. This press works fine but you do have to press fairly hard to get a thin tortilla. Make sure you mix your dough on the softer side otherwise you'll end up with hockey puck tortillas. It does make small tortillas, not 6 inch. You're lucky to get 5\\". So if you're making enchiladas it'll be more of a challenge to roll them. But there's nothing like a fresh tortilla."},{"rating":"2","title":"So","review":"As a product, it looks great. Came a few days later than anticipated, but it wasn't urgent, so not really an issue for me. I was expecting the tortillas / rotis to come out a little bigger. However, it does come out evenly, so I'm reasonably assured of evenly cooking it. Sticking a piece of parchment paper in between makes cleanup a cinch. And if it's not perfect, that's ok because I didn't spend a whole lot on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"this item was not as pictured, the jacket i recieved gathered at the waist like the sleeves.......I would not have ordered it if I knew....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty tough","review":"I use this for metal working in a small shop and it hasn't melted yet even after grinding down hot welds.

In this book, he does a great job of explaining how Buddhism grew out of the Buddha's responses to the various religious and spiritual options available in 500-400 b.c.

Gombrich also does an excellent job of explaining the specific spiritual problems Gotama attempted to address with his philosophy and practice.

Any magazine is better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Magazine Ever!","review":"'Teen tested, parent aproved.' That is the motto for the newly created Justine magazine. Following the footsteps of mary-kateandashley magazine, Justine uses basic colors and simple page layouts to 'relax the reader.' The magazine, as promises, is squiky clean through-and-through. Not a single advertisement is printed in all 68 pages of the debut issue. The only celebrity photo is the entire issue is a picture of The OC's Adam Brody, which, considering the reputation of the magazine, seems like a print error. Moms approve, teens don't. I reccomend spending your money on a subscription to Seventeen, a worthwile investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wholesome, refreshing magazine for teens!","review":"I've always loved New Moon, but sometimes I want something with more makeup/hair tips, clothes, and celebs.

In the latest issue (Holiday 2004 -- sadly, this terrific magazine features surfer Bethany Hamilton, a guide to skiing, a story from a reader, as well as a story about a teen broadcaster! Stories are interesting, inspiring, and trendy at the same time. Gift subscriptions should be a hit with your teen girls!The only real flaw I've found in this magazine is the lack of honesty. True, everything is non-offensive and \\"safe\\" but it would be nice if they addressed world issues, such as politics.

At home, the latest issues of all our other subscriptions are dated January 2013. We see on the Justine website the Justine December 2012 issue already out on the newsstands and has been since the first of December. We have not yet received it. Aren't subscribers supposed to get their issues before it hits the newsstands? In order to get the latest issue, we finally decided to just cancel our subscription and buy directly from the news stands. Honestly, the liberal lean of this magazine is also just a little worrying. The recommended books are geared more for older teens and young adults, rather than middle-schoolers drawn towards it by the feature on celebrities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb. Sublime.

I won't waste anyone's time by repeating them, but I will join my voice to the chorus who give this recording 5 stars and rare, high praise. I find this CD to be a sublimely relaxing and hauntingly beautiful series of compositions, with an emphasis on shakuhachi flutes, and koto. I have played it repeatedly for a couple of years now and still find myself reaching for it often when I need to relax or meditate, or simply want to be surrounded by blissful, healing sounds.

You won't hear anything like this anywhere else. My personal fav tracks are \\"The Last Time\\", \\"Louie's Return\\", \\"Didj Jam\\" and \\"The Serpent\\".Highly recommended to any celtic music fans out there, or anyone looking for something a bit different.

I find it strange that the first two reviews complained that it did not help them because it did not deal with starting a concierge buisness. What you need to realize is that the buisness is all about customer service. The fact you never say no you find other solutions. You must be tackful and know your stuff.

I found it to be textbook-instructional regarding concept and practice, as well as a general guide for setting up one's own concierge operation - whether that be in a hotel, corporate office building, or other high-profile \\"hub\\" service environment. After having spent more than 20 years as a NYC hotel manager, I found this book a refreshing read.

Harvey and Bjork. They're all excellent artists, and I was hoping that this CD would retain a little of their original magic. That, or recreate the songs in a new and interesting way.Well, the 'singer' on this album definately recreated the songs. However, she's also butchered them to a point where they sound unrecognizable, and just plain terrible. The vocalist sounds like she's about four years old, and the songs themselves are bathed in horrible techno and synthesizers. Just listen to 'Human Behaviour' and you'll see exactly what I mean.The only semi-decent track on this album is her cover of 'Baker, Baker', but even that pales in comparison to the original.Words cannot express how terrible this CD is."},{"rating":"2","title":"DUH, of course they are covers...","review":"This is a TRIBUTE album, which means someone singing covers of said person/people who are admired.... and yes...

So, back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Careful What You Wish For...","review":"I make the original \\"Joy of Cooking\\" pecan puff recipe from the 1970's cook book. It took me while to find this since it is not in the newer editions. I searched for for a scoop that would make small, bite sized cookie balls, and decided to get the Norpro Stainless Steel Scoop, 25MM (1.5 teaspoon). Although very well made, the dough stuck inside and didn't come out easily, even after refrigerating for an hour. It was almost too small to work efficiently. The release arm inside didn't push the dough out until you clicked it several times, when make a hundred cookies, that get very tiring.To be fair, this is the only recipe I've tried it on, it's mostly butter and chopped pecans. Maybe it would work better on other recipes. I did like the size of the balls it made and will try it on future recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small for cookies","review":"I sent it back.

Superior to no-name import rubber hoses which can have a strong petroleum smell, this hose is Goodyear \\"Horizon\\" synthetic rubber. Rubber is superior to PVC for cold weather, below 50 degrees F PVC can get very stiff, while rubber is supple and lays flat. Polyurethane hose is another good option, much lighter than rubber, and good in cold weather, but rubber has even less shape memory, so I don't mind the extra weight, urethane hose is very expensive also. Working up a ladder with the weight of the hose hanging down then I'd want urethane. But both rubber and polyurethane are far better than PVC hose for any purpose though.

I bought this book even after reading the less-than-rave reviews of other fans. I wish I had took their words to heart and left this one at the store. This book lacked the usual sizzle associated with this author and I had a hard time believing the roles of hero and heroine.

This story has everything; intrigue, sex, suspense, violence, love, and a great ending. Anyone, male or female, over the age of 16 will find this book hard to put down. Attention to detail in the New Orleans setting is wonderful. As always, her characters have been brought to life and it's hard to let them go or to forget them when the book is finished. Action is ongoing and makes this a real page turner. Only thing I find lacking is some 'old fashion' Sandra Brown romance"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best...","review":"I've read all Sandra Brown's books since the begining and this was not one of her best. It might have been a good mystery but, let's face it, most woman buy Brown for her sizzling, sexy romances. The main characters didn't really meet until almost mid-way in the book and where was the sizzle -- the passion? The heroine was not very interesting and there was virtually no chemistry between them.

So I would have to say that it is a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Trash","review":"If you like trashy novels, then Sandra Brown is an author to recommend. FAT TUESDAY is a knight-saves-damsel-in-distress story set in contemporary New Orleans. The knight is a run down ex cop; the damsel, a convent-educated daughter of a dead whore. The story is trite and predictable and not worthy of its best-seller status--or the list price."},{"rating":"1","title":"stick to romance novels","review":"I'm normally a mystery reader.

She has everything, and you either love her at once or you never understand her at all.What Sandra Brown fails to realize is that New Orleans embraces all walks of life with the same enthusiasm. Yes, Pinky was a crook and a bad guy, but in New Orleans, he'd fit in just fine with the elite.I might have bought the good cop takes on the bad guy in some other city, but, not in New Orleans. In New Orleans, they sit side by side at the Acme Oyster Bar.Besides missing New Orleans' character all together, Brown's story really isn't too tightly woven. I didn't really feel sorry for Pinky's trapped wife and I really didn't much like the crusading cop.To me, this book just flat misses the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being a huge SB fan, this was excellent.","review":"For \\"cop-turned-outlaw\\" Burke Basille, and for beautiful Remy Duvall, trapped in a loveless marriage, New Orlean's Mardi Gras offers the last chance for freedom and each other!

No excitement felt by this reader--no interest in stereotype hero and villain, and the heroine (if one can call her that) is unbelievably shallow and boring. New Orleans also comes across as flat and boring. This story could have taken place in Dallas, LA, or Minnewanka for all the sense of place present.

I just wanted future buyers to know that!!!!!!!!!!!!! Girlfriends is the Best show ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Legendary is a new collection of Dolly Parton songs. It contains 50 of her hits, ranging from her career which started in the 60's, to the 90's, and everything in between. In essence, this collection is a breath of fresh air, after many greatest hits albums released in the 90's, that seem to lack her biggest hits. This collection covers many of her years of hits, very complete, perhaps the most complete collection out there. This is where a newer fan of Dolly would like to start their collection, with a nice collection of her hits. I highly reccomend this CD, very good bargain for what you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the best thing I ever read, on bets of music..I win","review":"This book is the best I have ever read, it is useful for my radio show on KSGO..It is one of the best resources I have, I read it everyday.there are things I did not know. and when I get into music trivia..everyone wants me on their team..and I am never challenged...GR.

Three months after starting my first job as a programmer straight out of University, and now I'm the main person in the firm with Reporting Services knowledge - and it's all thanks to this book.The writing style is actually excellent for beginners, as I was terrified by the prospect of reading such a mammoth. But these guys make it fun and interesting to read (right down to the jokes and sidenotes) and really do touch on everything you need in a useful manner without boring you.And excellent resource that now never leaves my desk. I can only hope these guys do a SQL Sever 2005 one. I cannot recommend this book enough for those starting on Reporting Services. It really is the book to read.And if you are looking for a book on SQL Reportin 2005 - I would still recommend this book to give you the basics and introduction which is unbeatable thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Reference Guide!","review":"I moved from Crystal to Reporting Services and had no idea how cool Reporting Services could be. Peter and Bill don't skim the surface on how to do basic things; they give in depth instruction on how to make Reporting Services work hard for you. They give ideas and example on how to create reports that will impress anyone. Between the book and the website, I have been able to solve the tough problems that have arisen from what report viewers want. Most books give basic instruction on how to do things that anyone could figure out in a week of working with the product. This book goes to the next step and teaches you how to really use Reporting Services and also gives shortcuts to help you accomplish your projects faster. The DVD, which comes with it, has a \\"Guide Me\\" section and it is full of examples, tips and tricks that helped me quickly move to the next level. I love this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny, tiny, tiny","review":"I could not believe how small this was when I opened the box. Too many pieces to clean for each use.

And I can say that the book is comprehensive, correct, and informative. The book contains very brief definitions and functions of the most important car parts, how they work and quick tests to help the readers memorize, so it is perfect for anybody who doesn't have reading hobby, like me. I specially found the \\"Money Saving Tips\\" at the end of the book are quite useful. One wouldn't become a car expert after reading this book, but it provides a large amount of vocabularies and professional terms, so one would easily understand his or her car's problems when one goes to a car dealer. He or she could also be able to make good decisions on what to buy and save thousands of dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is useless","review":"I was planning to perform all the maintenance work on my 2 cars, an Audi S4 and a Honda CR-V. I have done oil changes and air filter changes in the past but I wanted to do more. I bought this book and the \\"Auto Repairs for Dummies\\" book in addition to the specific service manuals for the 2 cars. This book gives very very brief explanations with big text fonts and big pictures (not much meat) of how things work so don't hope to perform any actual work by following the book. If you just want to know how cars work and don't wish to perform any actual work then this book may be is for you. I highly recommend the dummy book and forget about this book if you do plan to perform work on your car. The dummy book has a lot more details and it actually shows you how to do the work. I often turned to the dummy book when the service manuals are not explaining things in detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much old crap and unnecessary info!","review":"The diagrams in the book where nice, but man this guy isn't an author. You can tell he knows what he is talking about but he just uses a lot of lingo. Thankfully, there is a glossary, but it takes too long to look up every word. He just tells you the different parts in mechanisms. He doesn't really explain how anything works. By the way, he has like 5 nicknames for every part. If you are a beginner too complex, if your an expert you probably know this stuff. If you have the money and your an amateur go ahead. If none of the above I wouldn't suggest this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definetly CHEAP fishing line...","review":"This line is just cheap line that is almost not worth spooling up on...

I use very low weight fishing line in order to make some of my most intricate beadwork designs. Because it is monofilament, I do not have to worry about my crystal and harder beads breaking the line and it doesn't fray either, unlike some of the expensive threads that are available. It is also so inexpensive, which makes it so much easier to design with.

This is a great book, there are a lot of them out there, but when you look below the surface and actually see that the author himself takes part in putting people in the margins, it makes a normal person ask \\"what's going on here\\"?The author lives in a town that marginalizes women in the first place. Portland has more strip clubs per capita then Las Vegas. In the mayoral debate held at Imago he addressed the issue of the sex trade with all three candidates as being a problem, it is.But in his own church, the practice of the \\"good ole boy club\\" lives on and women are not allowed in certain leadership roles, such as preaching. You cannot marginalize and then speak of it being a bad thing.

His skills with the guitar made him a stand out and in my opinion in the same league as Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, and other jazz guitarist greats. It seems GB has never been satisified with his success as a Jazz musician. His occassional flirts with or forrays into what is popular at the moment, perhaps seeking pop fame or a mega hit, has resulted in some very, very weak recordings. 20/20 epitomizes the depths to which he can sink when he follows the wave rather than follows his heart.I say the following in the most sincere way.

I read the two reader reviews and decided to purchase this book as they were both positive reviews. After reading it - I realized I had read basically NOTHING. I can only guess the writer was badly in need of money to write this. If she did indeed care for Bogart, and there was an affair (which I'm not convinced of after reading this fluff), then why would she want to hurt his still living wife and children, knowing it would be something he would never have wanted, would have in fact been deeply hurt by?

Wether or not this affair actually happened or is just \\"wishful think\\" on behalf of Ms. Thompson is open to debate. The author has quite a few unflattering things to say about Ms. Bacall who I believe is one of the few actresses left in Hollywood with any real Class which is a rarity these days. One gets the impression that Ms. Thompson was and is very jealous of the fact that Ms. Bacall was Humphrey Bogart's Legal wife and she wanted to be that instead of just being his mistress.I do find it very sad and pathetic that some unknown hairdresser tries to \\"cash in\\" on a deceased celebrity's fame who is not around to offer his version of events.

Ms. Thompson was sitting at the bar that Saturday afternoon, dressed the part too, hat and all. It was a show to watch and a story to hear. I was struck how sad it is that she is now alone with her memories and has only the past to keep her company.

It does more than recount the accident and its aftermath; it devotes just as much attention to the valuable science that took place aboard STS-107, reconstructs the lives of the seven amazing men and women of Columbia's crew, and takes notice of the efforts of many folks behind the scenes of the mission. The book isn't just about the mission's terrible end; it's also a tribute to sixteen days of successful science, research and exploration, and to all the efforts required to sustain human space flight.There have already been a few books written about Columbia's final mission, but Mr. Chien's encyclopedic book is going to be hard to beat.

Pretty much the same results with a potato. I tried the ripple cutter with the potato and shredded a fingernail.

It would be a great book for children who have a sibling with disabilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much T.V.","review":"Welcome, so you're thinking about reading Tru Confessions by Janet Tashjian? Well, I have some information about it. First I'll talk about Tru.She is a 12 year old girl that is really energized when she was watching T.V. There was a commercial about a new network in town. Then Tru really wanted to have a T.V. show. Eddie, Tru's brother, is handicapped because when he was a baby his umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck. Eddie is the camera man for Tru's T.V. show.Their problem is getting Tru's tape (T.V. show episodes), to the cable company. When Tru's mom is at work she goes on the computer and tries to find a cure for Eddie.The book doesn't tell where Tru and Eddie live, but somewhere in a city. The good thing about Tru Confessions is you learn more about mentally disabled and challenged people. They can be more nice and caring than you can see. I don't think people should read this book because it needs to focus on other things than just her brother, Eddie, or Tru's T.V. show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tru Confessions is Better for girls","review":"Hey all you girls! Do you have a brother that you love but wish was different? Well that's what Trudy [Tru] wants in the book Tru Confessions by Janet Tashjian. It is written in journal form and is packed with details.

I don't know what you will think of Eddie but I loved him, he was funny. Especially when he played Monkey Man! In the book Tru enters a contest presented by the cable company were if you win you get your own show about your own idea!So read Tru Confessions by Janet Tashjian. This is a great book for girls. I think that this was a good book because it shows how the life of a handicapped person really is. You will also find out if Tru's tape pleases the cable company or doesn't please them. Read Tru Confessions by Janet Tashjian to find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly wonderful journal format of a novel!","review":"I am book-A-HOLIC and was truly sick of the dumb, books dealing with girls and their boyfriends or crushes.

Her main concern is her brother who is mentally ill, and wants to find a cure for his illness. Through this remarkably written, corky journal of Trudy you find that life has some rocky twists.

These candy bars are NOTHING like the original Marathon Bar's from the 1970's, except in appearance. The chocolate coating is much to thin on the Curly Wurly's compared to the original Marathon Bar's and the caramel has a distinct buttery taste which the Marathon Bar did not.

Those Marathon bars were much, much larger.These Curly Whirly bars are better than the Marathon bars that I remember. I like the almost delicate configuration of these, and the slightly more sophisticated flavors.P.S.: I came back to update my review, because I learned that we did indeed have a larger Marathon bar in Southern California - so I'm not crazy! :) For some reason unknown to me, a 15\\" Marathon bar was marketed in Southern California during the 1970s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmmmm....chocolate and caramel","review":"I've had these in the freezer for about a year and I'm more protective of them than the Girl Scout cookies.

The first pan of cookies it worked flawlessly, but on the second pan as I squeezed it to release it skipped a gear and the clearing mechanism partially came out of the bowl. Each consecutive scoop it skipped another gear/prong. I WAS able to get it back to the original position, but for every pan afterwards I had to repair it at least once. If it breaks on cookie dough, I can't imagine it would work for ice cream or anything else.

Unfortunately, I just do not like this tea. I agree with the reviewer who said it had a sharp peppery finish, but that is about the only taste it has. The smell of the tea reminds me of black licorice and fresh mowed grass - a nauseating combination for me, not pleasant. Since this tea has garnered so many great reviews, maybe it is just my taster. Also, I have never tasted any other Darjeeling teas other than this one by Twinnings to compare, so maybe I just don't like Darjeeling tea.

There is a brooding, dark and eerie sound to the songs. \\"Dancin'\\" has an almost funky vibe to it, \\"The Lonely Ones\\" is a Roy Orbison redux and is an absolutely magnificent song and \\"Western Stars\\" is a lilting ballad. Mr. Isaak has a deep, smooth voice that adds a density to the songs while Silvertone plays songs in a way that seems on the surface to be quite simple but are full of nuances.

My son, who can barely speak, has limited speech capacity and he is able to distinctly verbalize these words and sounds. I really don't care if some educators are against learning in this way. It works.

I am probably too dumb to avoid this \\"smart choices\\" or to tampering around the few setting options to avoid them. So you may end up with a blank media, being also asked to create a label for it(how dumb is that?!?), wasted time and HD space. if this is the NTI \\"Gold\\", it didn't convince me to buy the NTI Platinum.

The gentleman who plays the cop seems destined for the next Hercules cycle. Mugs mostly. At the beginning of the film, he seems to disdain the thought of gay sex. He sure does change his tune in a hurry, and without much fanfare. Oh, and the mystery aspect? The buddy did it. That's certainly original.The little guy who plays the hustler holds his own.

Ed Corbin stars as a vice cop that is hesitant to take a case involving drug traffic in a gritty gay bar. There he befriends Dane Ritter the hustler and the two fall in love. Suddenly both are plunged into a nightmarish hell when a murder is committed and the cop risks his job for his new found lover insisting he is innocent of the crime. Soon the hustler becomes the hustled when he becomes the target of a murderer. What remains is the two attempting to stay alive amid corruption and greed in a seedy suburb of Atlanta.

Because he didn't want the police to know he was a hustler, and providing drugs to his chemically dependant strung out sister. He eventually falls in love with an undercover cop, and they go off into the sunset together, after a few interesting moments. The cop (corbin) has these eyes, that widen like he is in a hypnotic trance. Lots of scenes of men in a gay bar, and the ones hanging on the streets, look like they are all on queludes.

Things get interesting between Micheal and Nikita and so many classic Section One moments that you won't want to miss!

The actors are all of the highest caliber and the plots/story lines are so engaging, you'll be hooked after just one episode. If this series had been on a major network at the time it originally aired, it would have been on MUCH longer. Alias doesn't hold a candle to this show (as a matter of fact, they steal a lot of their stories from LFN). Jennifer Garner only wishes she was as believable as Peta Wilson is in this type of role. Roy Dupuis (Michael) is also an amazing actor and is HUGE in Canada. This was a show that believed it's audience to be intelligent, but can be enjoyed by everyone. It has the right mix of romance, action, intrigue, and technical gadgets so there is something for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This show was so original","review":"A show that kept a storyline going,stayed fresh and interesting,great characters and acting.

Season one is the very best in my opinion, but the rest keeps that same flow .(2and3) four and five will surprise you a little but they redeem themselves.

From the end of Season 2 on, it takes a very different direction as Nikita gradually becomes a willing member of Section 1 (Division). Also, this show makes frequent use of graphic sadomasochistic themes, and there seems to be at least one torture scene in every episode. In fact, Section 1 often behaves more like the Gestapo than a rogue branch of the CIA. The suggestion here is that this is justified, and there is a strong neoconservative political undercurrent to the show. Many of the episodes end in tragedy, and I found this series to be a major turnoff. Two much better programs in this genre are \\"Alias\\" and \\"MI-5.\\" I would recommend both of them over this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"La femme nikita season 3","review":"This was a great DVD I always liked watching la femme nikita on tv i'm glad it's on DVD now.

Cupid isn't quite that sharp, a little rougher, but still impresses.Although I have fondness for this CD and bought it back in 85 and Provision shortly after. Today I still reach to listen to \\"Oh Patti\\" and \\"Lovesick\\" perhaps because of the technical superiority of that album rather than delving into Cupid and Psyche 85.

And all I can say is the music is still as catchy and pop-driven as ever like I perceived it back in my high school days. Green has definitely composed some infectious pop/R&B ditties on this one! The ones I keep listening to are \\"Small Talk\\", \\"Absolute\\", \\"Lover To Fall\\", \\"Hypnotize\\", and of course, \\"Perfect Way\\". I'm glad to hear that Green came out of being a recluse after retreating from the music industry (from what I've read, him being disillusioned with the music industry and all) to record \\"Anomie & Bonhomie\\".

The synths are played like the real musical instruments they are, with respect and love.Here is none of the fake 90s authenticity or earthiness, this is pure unadulterated enthusiasm and childlike genius.Green Gartside pulls something very rare off with this album, it has instant appeal AND almost endless debth."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like \\"Into Thin Air\\", but in the Ocean.","review":"Imagine sailing a 70-foot yacht in an 80-knot hurricane wind in for 58 hours.

The Quick Winder RAP-100 is perfect. The handle makes it easy to move and store. This is a fantastic device. The cord uuwinds easily without tangles saving time and frustration. Depending on which end will be connected first, you can wind male/female first. I am well pleased with the Quick Winder and I feel it is well worth the investment.

I absolutely hate dealing with cords, especially my 100 ft one. It knots up no matter how nice I am to it. This, once you figure out how to set it up, eliminates all cord problems. The only thing I don't understand is that there are alot of openings in the top, hard to figure out which one to put the cord through, and there isn't a good sample picture that shows, however, once I figured it out (my son did rather) it was fine.

They can also can be made ahead of time and kept in fridge - then you can warm them up in a pan with butter and cook to desired doneness. You could add cheese or a cheese sauce or add vegetables like brussel sprout leaves, carrots, peas, mushrooms, etc. You can also make a date and bacon spaetzle and cook the spaetzle in the bacon fat...soooo good! There are so many combinations. The product is easy to clean and forms perfect, little dumplings.

This album is just one great song after another. I love the singer's voice! It's a shame these guys didn't get more exposure back in the day, and they rarely even play anything other than 'New Girl Now' (from their first CD) on the classic rock stations, but I think this is their best stuff right here!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD-Buy it today!","review":"I actually owned this on cassette years ago, still I vividly remember that all the songs rocked, and I mean ROCKED! I remember one of my friends looked at the album cover and was like \\"man that's gotta suck\\" but after loaning it him for a few hours so he could hear it-I never got it back.

As an example: One of her Negative Energy Removing Spells requires one white candle, Jinx Removing oil, Uncrossing incense, an athame consecrated Holy water, a hematite, Lady Luck Oil, Good Luck Incense, and a red mojo. As you can see..how do you get Good luck incense??? Or Jinx removing Oil??? ETC.... The whole book and every spell is like this one. You can get some of these recipes from Cunninghams' Magical Herbalism IF you like making oils and incense from scratch. This book was such a diappointment, so many spells, but none to cast.

The spells all require oils that everyone in my circle has never even heard of. The same may be said of most of the incenses. The author refers to Cunningham and Malbrough in the sources area... then comes her favorite shop.Maybe my expectaions were a bit off. If someone is looking for true color correspondence this is not it. I wanted a better grasp of the blues, and a clearer understanding of shades and blends.

Simply said, even though the game is not OS X compatible, the graphics and sound are pretty wonderful. I also enjoy being able to talk to other characters in the game. That said, the puzzles are hilarious, in that they make no logical sense. Success is basically based on guesswork and luck. Sometimes it's also necessary, in order to get more \\"clues,\\" to talk to the same person about the same topic, even though that topic has already been discussed and is blacked out.

Her material is not that musically intricate so one wonders why little attempt was made to do the same. The sound quality is iffy at best - there is an annoying sax on some songs which does not belong. Technically the overall mix is poor and not worth the purchase price.I played a Remastered Bob Dylan CD(\\"OH Mercy\\") after listening to ONJ and found the sound significantly better.There are remastered recordings of her songs available- one CD will be released on July 12th- and perhaps that's the way to go if you want original recordings properly remastered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever Can't Act","review":"Talk about bad acting.

If you are in any way interested in what goes on behind the scenes during a presidential campaign, this is for you.

I well remember the critics raving over this on television, but why is beyond me. Mostly, I was just plain bored. There simply was no depth at all, just bunches of short takes and wise cracks. Bush was just downright dirty, making insults and slurs all over the place, something I do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be President. And it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that Mary Matalen, the deputy manager of Bush's campaign and very acid-tongued (maybe she wrote some of the slurs Bush used), is now the wife of James Carville, top strategist for Clinton's campaign, and basically the star of the movie. But all the scenes were focused on the funny quip, the bon mot, no long scenes of the nitty-gritty work, or any answers to any questions about Clinton either, for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clintons true colors?","review":"Did you believe the lie? Forty three percent of the voting public did. Love Bill Clinton or dislike the man this shows his true colors.

This is a riveting true life behind the scenes look at the not so glamorous hard work that goes into a presidential campaign. This documentary shows the emotional highs and lows of what it really takes to win. James Carville was truly the mastermind of Clinton's win in 1992 and his forsight of what it took to run a presidential campaign was quite impressive. Loved it and would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the real political process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see for campaign junkies.","review":"This is an outstanding documentary of the campaign team that changed presidential campaigning. One does not need to love the results of these changes (I personally believe that this campaign was the beginning of the end of democracy as we know it, even as I marveled at the talent and loved the outcome of the election) to appreciate how Clinton's 1992 campaign, as seen in this film, changed the American political world.\\"War Room\\" should be seen along with more recent documentaries (like, for example, \\"Staffers '04\\") to see the difference between a campaign that used techniques to achieve a goal and campaigns that use the same techniques as the goal (to be elected rather than to govern). Hopefully, it will encourage you to do what you can to return political campaigns to discussions of ideas rather than the useless, mind-numbing, dumbing down assessments of candidate traits (like \\"character\\" or \\"integrity\\") we seem to have resorted to in the past ten years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good -- Quick -- Reasonably Balanced","review":"I admit to purchasing it even though I didn't really want to see it. I figured it would be just a pro-Clinton hack job. It is actually reasonably balanced given that it is after all about Clinton's 92 campaign. It flows quite quickly and gives an interesting perspective on a presidential campaign. I enjoyed getting a background peek at meetings and behind the presidential debates. For some reason I enjoyed watching something so simple as Clinton trying to decide which tie to wear for one of the debates. I struggled with not knowing who people were, or where the meetings were, or on when during the campaign the events were taking place, but admit that tossing the text in as a \\"subtitle\\" on the screen to explain those details may have taken away from the first-person feel of the documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Politicos - Rejuvinate!","review":"As those of us who actually work in politics instead of just reading and watching movies about it can testify, the job can really run you down phyiscally, mentally and emotionally, completely draining you and can take all the fun out of what you do. Well, when that happens, pop this movie in! Time and again when the job has me at wits end and ready to give up on politics (and go into something more profitable), I'll watch how Carville and Stephanopolous defied the odds and got President Clinton elected. By the time George is talking to the President-elect on the cellular, I'm beaming and completely rejuvinated. This is a must-watch for any political staffer, junkie, or amatuer who wants an insider looks at how campaigns really work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video","review":"I enjoyed seeing the inside of the political game.

If you do one side at a time, you actually have to fry one side, take hold of the cool side of the tortilla, and flip it over and fry the other side because of the configuration of the handle, you can't just turn the thing over. You have to flip the tortilla itself. Still a timesaver if you're used to molding them in the pan with regular tongs. I do wear a leather work glove on the hand I'm holding it with, though.

Payne's humanity is almost painful in its vulnerability, and yet Payne exhibits more courage and integrity than the ostensibly sane characters populating McGuane's work. The writing is original and unconventional, but for those of us who like to be challenged, entirely satisfying. This is the book that turned me on to McGuane's great talent (later confirmed when I read Ninety Two in the Shade). One of my favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific, offbeat,and interesting","review":"Complicated, challenging, endlessly entertaining and very amusing.

But a strange vision indeed. No Blacks what so ever. A clean white South, just as some would have liked it to be and as it has never existed. This enables the director to show Yankee villains since they only have one objective : to conquer and govern this rebellious South. But it is hilarious in many ways and there are some elements that are good. The trick to make old teetotallers drink alcohol is banal. But the dog is very good and has been well trained, just like these Southeners who become supermen when they hear their Southern national anthem.

Well, I certainly got what I paid for. The leather palm strap came apart after installing approx. 10 joist hangers. The entire body is plastic, and my hand started to ache with vibration during the rest of the project due to it's feather weight. Had to clean it three times as well.

I felt I didn't receive any kind of personal growth or knowledge from this book. It was mundane and biases. I felt she made known too many times through out her book her political views. It was a very one sided look at life. I was looking more for a spiritual take on issues. I didn't think this book was going to be a soap box for her to make a political stand. Pointing the finger at certain groups made me feel it was missing the heart of the law with is love and mercy. I will never ever purchase another book from this nun. It's a shame Because I happen to love the Benedictine Way and nuns. I have an aunt who is one for 58 plus years. I am glad she doesn't write like this.

It is a little tricky to put it in the charging stand but after you do it a couple of times you get the feel for it, and it's not a problem. The one important thing is that you must adjust the audio input of the device that you are using it on. I purchased it for the TV in our bedroom, and I keep the volume on the cable box on 100%, and I lower the volume or mute the TV.

If you just wanna watch an episode of a tv show without disturbing your roommates, then you might not care so much. all this thing, or ANY wireless headphone product does is transmit a signal from digital to analog similar to a radio station, cordless phone, etc... its only gonna sound so good no matter what you do. many other people would be happy with this.

They're very directional.I bought a pair of Sennheiser RS120's for about the same price and man, they are 100% better. I can go anywhere in my house and get excellent reception.

I have always liked Amazon for the great price breaks one can get here, so I did a search and decided that these, with the Sony name, at that price was an unbelievable value. My dad always told me that whatever seems too good to be true usually is, and that was definitely the case in this instance.

We owned a similar pair of headphones (2 years ago) and they recently went bad. I assumed it was due to them being dropped. So I decided to buy what looked like the same quality earphones from Sony. They are VERY disappointing. They produce static at any range. The range is very short, and they create loud popping noises as you walk around. Come on Sony... listen to your customers and quit putting out trash.

This headphone proved my notion wrong.The sound quality is awfully bad. I get lot of noise and distortion even at 6 ft distance within line of sight.The phones have no treble or bass. Its good only for TV audio.The battery life is ok. But the battery started losing its charge after going through 10 to 11 charging cycles. Now, after an year, they don't even last for 10 minutes of charge. I don't want to buy an expensive battery for these waste of money headphones.Never ever buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Sony Product I've Ever Purchased","review":"This is an unbelievable disapointment.

My fathers transmitter had an intermittant problem sending a signal so I took them to my house to see what was wrong. After several calls to Sony I finaly got it to transmit for a while. Boy was I disappointed. Constant hiss, by the time I found a spot where there was a clear signal I could no longer see the TV. The volume control is so small you have to take the headset off your head and use your finger nail to turn the dial. If that wasn't enough, just putting the headset back on the recharging pins of the base took about 5 attempts.Needless to say they are both being returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony name don't mean a thing on this junk","review":"I replaced a cheaper pair of Acoustic Research wireless headphones with this more expensive model from Sony. Bought it at the store without researching (bad move) and largely on the strength of the Sony brand name (I should know better).I have been very disappointed in their performance. There is hissing and noise all the time. There is no on/off switch. The tuning dial is not conveniently located for me--I keep having to take the headphones off to adjust the dial. And they don't fit very comfortably either.Steer clear of this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I got these as a gift from my parents.

The old ones worked great, so when I bought a new LCD XBR Bravia, I thought it was an easy match to buy these headphones to go with it.I was shocked by how badly they worked. Dropped power on the base unit, popping, hissing, and mediocre, hard to adjust controls; basically everything that others have already said in previous reviews. But, they look great and they are very comfortable to wear, they have Sony's elegance in design. The problem is they are just a crummy product. I'm really surprised at Sony for letting something like this out the door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific product.","review":"Usually I have found that wireless headphones are very suseptible to local interference. I am using these headphones not for stereo but from my amateur radio receiver. I run a very high power but legal radio station. I never cease to be amazed at how interference free these headphones and their wireless link are. It could only be attributed to superb engineering. I bought these because they were on sale and had the name Sony. I have not been disappointed.73 Tom"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst experience ever had","review":"I never thought i will write such a bad review on a Sony product.This product really sucks. You can hear only static and sometimes it works fine for a maximum of 5 seconds and God only knows when it will work fine. I tried all suggestions given by other reviewers here to get rid of the static and failed miserably. Thank god i got with a refund policy and has sent it back the second day.Don't buy this product if you really want to use it. I am giving 1 star because there is no option for 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"signal keeps cutting out due to auto on/off feature","review":"There is no ON/OFF switch on the unit. When you put these on your head they switch ON automatically. Then when you take them off they switch OFF automatically ...but this feature doesn't work all the time. Sometimes just shifting your head fools the unit into shutting OFF thinking you took it OFF especially if you are on a recliner leaning back and not sitting up straight. Then you have to remove the headphones from your head, turn the volume down, and back up again and otherwise fiddle with the unit to get it to switch back ON again. It would have been easier to simply have an ON/OFF switch. I finally got sick of these headphones and threw them in the trash. P.S. I also had the problem getting the headphones to line up with the terminals on the recharger, and the first day I gave up on that one and used regular batteries....a hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"wireless headphone review","review":"The product performs very well. A little more to it than I thought it was going to be but not complicated. The one draw-back is that they are very bulky. Not heavy mind you but bulky. Uncomfortable to lay in bed and watch TV with the headphones on next to a sleeping spouse. Today headphones don't have to be so bulky to be effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor implementation","review":"The multichannel headphones are a good idea. But the transmitter/receiver are so underpowered, that even at 5 feet, simply changing the position of your head can cause the signal to disappear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Sony","review":"I get a lot of interference, painfully loud popping sounds in the earphones (maybe from wireless car security devices in my densely populated neighborhood). I can alleviate this problem somewhat by reducing the earphone volume drastically, and then increasing the source level to compensate. Still annoying, but not painful.Placing the earphones on the charging interface on the transmitter is very difficult and frustrating. After trying to do this for an extended period on one occasion, I was tempted to throw the whole pile of c@*! into the trash.I've owned many Sony Products, and until now, thought they were all excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product blew my confidence in Sony electronics!","review":"Hard to describe how disappointed I am in this wireless headset! Problems: #1) No mechanical lead-in for the alignment of the headset to charger base. Can't be set in correct position on charger without extreme attention to detail and both hands. #2) The RF band (ISM) used for signal to headset is used by so much other consumer electronics that I have noise interruptions about every 10 to 15 minutes on all frequencies it uses (Cordless phones, Crib monitors, Security systems, local Fire department). #3) Use distance is very limited, and Head orientation will wipe out signal. I find the usable distance is less than 20 foot. If I want to drop volume 6 db, all I need to do within that 20 foot range is turn my head 30 to 45 degrees from the \\"clear signal\\" head position.In the past I always choose Sony with confidence, NO more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely useless...not worth even a penny","review":"The noise and the hissing sound is terrible. Even if I move the head 5 degrees away from the receiver (at a distance of 2 feet), the sound fades away. I tried all the three frequencies, reception was only on one and that too very faint with tremendous hissing sound. I bought these last evening and I am returning them now. Absolute waste of money and time.Aligning the headphone on the base station was painful and time consuming requires adjusting each time you place the headphone back.Don't waste your time and money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy and inconvenient. Avoid these turkeys !","review":"These headphones seemed like a good idea at the time. I got them for late night TV listening, and occasionally they sound wonderful, but their background hiss is intrusive, varying from almost OK to maddening, depending on head position (even if you are 5 feet away from the base), and is usually worst when you in the optimal viewing position. Nothing seems to improve it - moving the base, changing channels, etc... Also it usually takes a couple of minutes of fiddling around to set the stupid things on the base correctly so that the battery will charge. Altogether a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable, but useless.","review":"These headphones are very comfortable. Unfortunately I have a very difficult time with the headphones as they typically drop the audio signal at least 3 or 4 times a day, cutting to static - which can be painful. To get the signal back I must unplug the base station and plug it back in.Most often I must turn my head to a specific angle to get the signal clearly, as otherwise there is a constant static in the background of the music.The sound with a clear signal is decent, and gives OK sound in the lower range, but the highs are not as crisp as I would prefer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mistake","review":"I bought these at a local store, not really knowing what to expect. I tried them out the first night and was only able to get the hiss out for a few minutes at most. The sound was adequate but I had to have it turned up to minimize the interference. In its defense however I have numerous devices that could be causing the interference (baby monitor, cordless phone, LCD screen etc...).... Needless to say I returned them the next day and ordered the Pioneer SE-DIR800C. I know a huge price difference (I'm sure my wife will kill me when the credit card bill comes in), but with IR and the great reviews I feel it was the logical move...I can't wait til it comes in."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"there is a lot of static.the distance of reception is not very far. i have a $20.00 set that works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I usually don't pay attention to these reviews because I feel they are put in by employees of the company that is promoting the product. I am making the effort to right a review of this product because I just wasted a lot of money. I lasted two days with these headphones and now they just sit on the shelf. Major problems with reception and static pops. Just giving you a heads up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied!","review":"Sony MDR-RF960RK 900 MHz RF Wireless Headphones are full of hiss,even sitting stationary the hiss will come and go. The volume on my receiver must be turned up loud to get anything close to get halfway decent sound out of them. Over priced! After the Sonys I purchased Acoustic Research 900mhz Wireless Headphones AW771, they are less money and much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphones - no / Earmuffs - yes","review":"It is a mistake to call these things headphones. I purchased one pair and returned it. I purchased a second pair and returned it. The problem is static. Regardless of how close or how far you are from the base unit, you can not get a good, consistently high quality signal. The headphones have auto tuning and other controls to \\"improve\\" the reception, but they just don't work. Don't waste your time or money on these headphones, unless you live in a cold climate and you are looking for an expensive pair of high tech looking earmuffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony MDR-RF960RK","review":"Just received mine today. After I charged the batteries the headphones work very well. Before they were charged I could hear lots of static but that went away after charging. The only real problem is that the rechargable batteries that come with this unit don't appear to be very available. I looked online but couldn't locate any. I guess that it is a good thing that any AAA battery will power the headphones but the headphone system charger is designed not to charge them thus the reason why I only gave them 4 stars. These work well all over my apartment and do exactly what I need them to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality reception","review":"This product was advertised as having a very long range which made it very attractive. I get static when I'm standing only a foot away from the base and the auto tune does nothing. It definitely does NOT perform as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendously Bad","review":"This may be the worst electronic product I've ever purchased. Extreme amounts of static and electonic noise, when you turn your head, or move, or walk somewhere else, or sit still, or when the music gets quiet, or when a random number generator says it's time to start sounding like an old broken AM radio.(And yes, I do have the source volumes turned all the way up, using the headphones to control the volume. Doesn't help. And yes, I know about the tuning button and different channels - that can sort of help for a few seconds until you move slightly.)Unfortunately I was dumb, and not only paid full price at Radio Shack, but also tossed the packaging before trying them out. I'll probably rip it apart and see if I can attach something to extend the antenna and see if that improves things. I'd feel too guilty trying to sell the piece of crap on eBay."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Program on the CD solved my problem.","review":"I've tried to use the internet as it was intended, a free and open system where I could surf, send e-mails to friends and business associates, and generally tried to be a good internet citizen. Why is it then that about 60% of the e-mail I receive is trying to sell me investments, medicine, a phony degree, or enlargement of certain body parts, some of which I don't even have.The answer, of course, is that it's free to send out e-mails in any quantity to any list of addresses. What I don't understand is why the congress has allowed it to continue, but they do.The answer is that you have to be prepared to defend yourself from these unwanted intrusions. I thought I was doing pretty well, until a particularly nasty adware program managed to get into and install itself in my system. One of the packages included on the CD in this book solved the problem, that alone made the book worth its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vertical Poultry Roaster","review":"Fabulous chicken, every time; moist, tender, and full of flavor.

In this case you get the lyrics, but you don't get the quality, the essence, the talent, and the music behind our Amelda Marcos of Rock and Roll (Tori Amos).

It is of course not as good as that album, but it is still a great album. The album finds Prince exploring the psychedelic sounds of the 60's. The album has a mystic, kaleidoscope sound with some vivid lyrics. \\"Raspberry Beret\\" is a classic pop song and one of Prince's best. \\"Pop Life\\" and \\"America\\" take a political bent with the former being a particularly great song. The album closes out with two songs \\"The Ladder\\" and \\"Temptation\\" that have Prince exploring religious views. The album became his second in a row to go to number and showed that Prince was as versatile an artist as there was in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"AFter the Rain must come planets of oddity...","review":"I dig it, but this is not the album for the fake O(+> fan who wants to hear \\"1999\\" and \\"Purple Rain\\" but has little or no appreciation of the many angles to the multifaceted prism we know as the Artist. This album is angelic. \\"Paisley Park\\" is a song that just catches me. \\"Condition of the Heart\\" is soooooooooooo ill. His creativity is hydroplaning down deserted roads of eerieness. Yes, eerieness, indeed. I have a tape that I bought b4 I had a CD player and side B or from \\"America\\" on is a tad hard to listed to. But then again, so is John Cage and I am addicted to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting chiefly as an historical document.","review":"After the mega-success of \\"Purple Rain\\", Prince was visited by the demon of Temptation. As he said in an interview, \\"Do you know how easy it would have been for me to just do another version of Let's Go Crazy?\\" But Prince smote the demon and posted a Dilettantes Not Welcome sign outside the purple clubhouse with this willfully peculiar record. That took more guts than I'll ever have, and the Skinny M.F. gets eternal props from me for it.Unfortunately, the music doesn't hold up. Except for the perfect single \\"Raspberry Beret\\", these songs just sort of slouch all over the place, never really coming together. But great days were coming..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BELOW AVERAGE","review":"THIS IS ONE OF PRINCE'S WEAKEST ALBUMS TO DATE AFTER GREAT ALBUMS LIKE PURPLE RAIN, 1999, CONTROVERSY, DIRTY MIND ..

The rest finds Prince in a transistion, trying to to move past the Minneapolis funk of PURPLE RAIN. While, that is respectable, most of the songs can be hard to sit through, without pushing the button on your cd player for the next song."},{"rating":"1","title":"so/so","review":"aside from raspberry beret a classic and pop life a funky bass line the rest of the disc is second rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Prince fan...but, this one covered too much range","review":"I had heard so much about this album for years and was hoping to prove wrong...I grant the creativity and attempts, but in a commercial environment, it disappointed compared to his others."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is so beautiful.","review":"I love Prince music. Some looked at this album as a step down from Purple Rain but that is complete b.s. It is more of a creative artistic move from Prince and The Revolution. My personal favorite track is The Ladder. The back up vocals are superb from Wendy, Lisa, Susannah, and Taja Sevelle. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychedelic Prince","review":"\\"Around the World in a day\\" has now become my favorite Prince recording, even gaining advantage over his other five flawless records-\\"Dirty Mind\\",\\"1999\\",\\"Purple Rain\\",\\"Parade\\" and \\"Sign O'the Times\\" since it features some of Prince's most adventurous and challenging pop songs.Since \\"Dirty Mind\\" that he'd established himself as a polymath of pop, bringing together whichever styles he felt adequate, but for \\"Purple Rain\\"s successor he delivered a record steeped to its neck in psychedelia and retro pop that surprisingly sounded fresh after its multi million selling predecessor's lavish grandiosity.And it boasts over half a dozen formidable tunes to add to his already exceedingly fruitful catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"always liked this one","review":"Wasn't this considered a disappointment back when it came out? Despite the Raspberry hit. I liked it right away. It is a veritable symphony of Prince's talents. The introspection of Condition of the Heart has always been a favorite. Tamborine is quite an amazing little song. America rocks. Temptation had me cracking up with god sending prince to hades for his lasciviousness. I think there are probably a good number of people out there who like this one, but if you don't know it, check it out. It is quite a unique musical odyssey, one that only the uniqueness of Prince could deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychedelic Prince!","review":"His psychedelic album! And it's a good one. Has the standouts \\"Raspberry Beret\\" and \\"Pop Life\\", plus the gospel-influenced \\"The Ladder\\", and \\"Temptation\\", featuring a conversation between Prince and God himself. It's a good album, with great songs, and it's worth checking out, even if it is weak in spots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong album for everyone","review":"I always wondered how Prince changed instruments used on this album, from the usage on Purple Rain. After it's success, only a few musicians are brave enough to make this. And Prince - as always - did it ! I think the second part of the album from Raspberry Beret is better than the songs before. Other good works are America ( the funkiest one on the CD ), The Ladder and Temptation, The Artist's most psychedelic song ever. I recommend this album for non-Prince fans too, because quite enjoyable and various in styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a Little Work","review":"I have to say that I bought this album and really only liked one song. Really I think people should buy the purple rain album.It was a big hit and every song is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest Rizwan Muazzam Album","review":"This is the weakest of the traditional Rizwan Muazzam albums. Firstly the recording quality is bad, it was recorded in pakistan and is extremely muted. The upper half of the frequency spectrum is completely absent.Nusrat fans will recognize song 1, which Nusrat called \\"To Karimi\\" which is on the \\"final recordings\\" album. The last song is the traditional \\"Rang Hai Nai\\". The rest are new Rizwan-Muazzam songs. There are seven songs on this cd, about 10 minutes each, which means they have to squeeze in the performances. This makes for lackluster performances of the songs here, not too much improvisation. The singers don't seem in improvising form during this recording.I'd recommend getting \\"Sacrifice to Love\\", for those who are just exploring this group."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pirates who didn't steal everything","review":"This CD was produced in England and is a pirated version of the original 2-disk vinyl set.

Then when we open the doors, we will not be suprised to find Mary, Joseph, and baby Jesus.I purchased this book based on the 2 other reader reviews and was let down. The quality of the book is good but the content and the order of it needs review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evokes unpleasant images of Thomas Kinkade art","review":"I bought the book for our young children on the basis of other customer reviews. It is a great idea - one set of doors a day, opening to text from Scripture - but the art work is embarrassing, and reminded us of second-rate art, Kinkade style. With so much great art in the Western canon done around the Annunciation and the Christmas and post-Christmas stories, it is a shame that the producers of this book didn't use some of those settings as backdrops for the text. The Christian faith has inspired some of the very greatest art, music, and literature and I want my children to see that the Scriptures and the faith we are raising them in, is capable of those heights of greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!!!!","review":"This is a great book! It's not candy coating the story of Christmas or Jesus' birth. The authors made sure to tell the story just how the bible does. This is the book for you and your family if your looking for a biblical account of Jesus birth, with beautiful art work, and if you'd like to start a wonderful tradition with your family.

Writing such salacious things about someone AFTER they die sure makes it easy to avoid lawsuits. Blair mentions interviewing hundreds of people who know Savitch, yet offers no names for some of her most damaging claims against Savitch. She even admits that no one ever admitted to seeing Savitch take any drugs. Savitch was a woman whose accidental death happened close to a couple \\"blooper\\" moments on TV.

This book focuses more then half, on Networks, and broadcasting in general, following mostly NBC, but does include something about all the networks. I would rather have heard more about Jessica herself. If you have seen the movie with Ron Silver and Sela Ward, that pretty much sums up the portion of this book that is actually devoted to Savitch. Though she was admired for her aggressive role in the female aspect of tv journalism, you see first hand that she wasn't qualified to do half of what they asked her to do, and was simply a pretty face who read copy that was written by other people.I find her emotional issues very relatable (anorexia, drug addiction, abusive relationships.)

Rudy Sarzo is the undisputed BASS master of the World and Carlos Cavazo pulls more emotion out of a guitar than most people ever dream of.For a Rocking Good time - make sure you add \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" to your collection.

You have to buy batteries for this thing every day, it eats through the most expensive brands in an hour, the memory is ample except none of the recording features work unless set to a high quality which limits you to about an hour of radio or an hour and a half of voice record time.

The MP3 encoding is inadequate, particularly at low volume levels. Lots of digital artifacts in the sound.Radio reception is poor, even for strong local stations. You won't want to record the radio if there's constant noise when you move around and change reception.Still, it is just about the smallest and lightest recorder I think you can find right now, which means it is more likely to get carried around than devices that weigh more.The microphone accessory (with a preamp) is pretty good, works when plugged into the line input of a laptop for very good quality recording.

We had firmware issues at first but after he did an update it has been great. I don't think that it eats batteries anymore than any other MP3 player does. There are several quirks that used to annoy me, but I've learned to live with them. It's size is nice for working out with, but I do however wish that the ear plug cord was longer for the left ear.

The biggest problems I have with this model are the skipping and sound quality. The skips are random and don't occur on the same tracks or CDs. They occur with standard audio as well as MP3 files -- all this while I'm sitting still. The various EQ settings are a joke. The remote really should have a hold switch and a volume control. The only true redeeming quality is the backlit display, which is hard to find on a portable CD player at any price. In any case, I returned the VP04 and spent an extra ten bucks on a comparable Sony, which is much better and it does NOT skip, even when I play the same CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 5 months","review":"When I first bought this product I was happy with it.

I called the company and they offered to fix it for $15 more or I could buy a new one (didn't even offer me a discount). I said no thanks. The technician I spoke to even said that there were some models out there with a defect in them and they supposedly got them all. I do not reccommend this cd player at all.

I've tried differenct cd brands, sizes, burning methods, wma files, etc. All end up with the same results. I emailed Virgin for help but just received one of their witty responses that make you chuckle but don't solve anything in the end.

It looks good, and the features seem to be there, but sadly it does not live up to my expectations.First of all, the included earbuds are horrible sounding. I would think Virgin could have included something a bit better without breaking the bank. If that were the only issue, I would be forgiving (as I simply switched to using a better set of headphones). However this player skips on regular CDs even when setting on a desk. Plus once in a while, you often hear a loud burst of sound between tracks. Plus, while maybe minor, I'd like to have had a volume control on the remote control.This player was a good idea that sadly does not live up to it's potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won;t play CD-R MP3s","review":"I bought two of these units at Target and neither would sucessfully play MP3s burnt onto a CD-R.

But, in saying that, I have to admit that the parts I did find interesting were worth the 4 stars in and of themselves.In reading the Diary of Anne Frank one of the things that you don't realize (or at least I didn't) is how thoroughly it's been edited. Otto Franks took great liberties in deciding what would and would not be shared with the public and after reading this book those edits, and the truth they hid, really shine through.More than that, I found that Otto Franks to be as fascinating a person as his daughter (even if he is not as likable) and that fact made this book very enjoyable for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Pictured","review":"I purchasedPirate Eyepatch and Earring Setfrom Think Fast Toys (fulfilled by Amazon) as a Christmas gift.

Second, since when does a cat that HATES the undead and makes it's feelings known throughout the story, decide to leap into the arms of a vampire? Not happening.

Beautiful and inspirational galleries after each project show you more advanced artwork using similar techniques and opening your eyes to endless possibilities.Each project includes a materials list and is demonstrated step by step with photos and sometimes illustrations. Helpful tips for each are also included. Though the instructions are good, there are no templates and some artistic talent or experience is necessary for many of the projects. My favorite projects include a washi doll, twisted paper box, and a pulp painting.In the back there is a nice list of suppliers and websites as well as a few organizations and educational programs. There is also a directory of artists with contact information.

Singer-guitarist-songwriter David Bazan has never let dogma contaminate his artistic empathy; there's nothing haranguing about his love of Jesus. Nothing has changed with Progress. The songs are solid. Yet on the heels of Winners Never Quit earlier this year, these four tunes showcase a melancholy that borders monotony. Bazan's voice, pleasant as it is, has a ponderous ache. He needs lighter settings than those he's given himself here, or more uptempo tracks to vary the pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good nails; meager packaging","review":"I bought a new Bostitch N80CB framing nailer from Amazon, then had difficulty finding a local source of coil nails here in Silicon Valley. So I ordered these nails in the 400-pack from Amazon also.The nails came in two coils of 200 nails each, in a corrugated cardboard box; I expect the 2500-pack to be similar. There was no other packaging, and my coils were a bit squashed after shipping. I had to unwind the full 200 nail coil and rewind it to fit smoothly around the spindle of my nailer.How did the nails work? Very well, after recoiling. I had no jams; no problems at all. A few cardboard cores to keep the coils from getting squashed in transit would help a bunch. I might well have had some feed problems if I hadn't straightened out the connecting wires before loading, so I deducted one star. But the price is decent, and Amazon's free shipping can't be topped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Damaged","review":"I bought these, and a box of Bostitch framing nails. These came bouncing around in a flimsy, dented box that was too big for the nails. I easily opened the box and found 11 out of 12 coils of nails were smashed to the point I had to \\"work them out\\". The Bostitch nails were actually less money, and they arrived in a stout, perfectly packaged box, in perfect condition, a day sooner than these. These nails worked fine after \\"fixing\\" them.

While I found many of the stories interesting, over all, the book was poorly written.

Thank goodness it was free, and mercifully short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish and boring","review":"Was Silverman trying to be another Paul Harvey?This seems to be written for teens or younger. The chapters answer questions such as \\"Was there really a chicken who lived without a head?\\", and \\"How was Kitty Litter discovered?\\" or \\"How was the zipper invented?\\". Each chapter ends with the author asking the question \\"Useless? Useful? I'll leave that for you to decide.\\"The question should be \\"Interesting? Not interesting?\\", etc. The answer is mostly, unfortunately, not interesting. The writing is childish with more than required parenthetical remarks that seem to be asides written to a preteen. I read the chapter from which the title was derived, \\"Einstein's Refrigerator\\", and wondered why it was even in the book. There were no great secrets, nothing to stimulate you or make you say \\"Wow, thats' interesting\\".I struggled to make it half way through before I realized it was getting worse, not better.Paul Harvey's reputation has nothing to fear and, now you know the rest of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting :)","review":"While reading this I found myself rambling on what I was learning to anyone in the room that would listen...even the dog.

The step-by-step method makes it really easy, but you need to spend time assessing yourself, because a training plan has to be customized. There have been some reviews that criticized the the book for its periodization approach, but that's how the pros train, and just because you peak for two or three times a year doesn't mean that you won't be in great form for the rest of the season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technical Training Made Easy","review":"I competed in Collegiate swimming and own 3 Physical Therapy Clinics. Joe Friel has done an excellent job of taking some of the complex science of high level training and making it very easy to read and apply. Application is what it is all about.

Friel's approach to training is excellent, and easy reading for someone who WANTS to race faster. Friel himself is a very accomplished bike racer, and his son Dirk is on fire this year (just raced against him in Arizona.) Now, if this New England snow would just melt... NOTE: Ths book is for experienced, motivated cyclists, probably too much too soon for beginner cyclists or those w/ little patience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Joe Friel did a great job at creating a book with information needed for the cyclist looking to step up their yearly training program. It includes everything from some of the basic physiology knowledge of metabolic pathways to goal setting, proper nutrition before/during/after event, and even the training and off-season. I am in my mid-20's with little thought of the aged cyclists, but he takes into account the young 10/12 year old cyclists, my age, and the 40+ training program. He gave me knowledge and a base to create my own yearly training program, prioritizing my A, B, and C events. Within this yearly scope, there are workouts suggested for each week and tests to measure the training progress. The knowledge is great and gives the reader knowledge to create their own personal plan. A great book and must-have for any cyclists interested in becoming more competitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference","review":"This book gives additional background on how to train and peak for races. It gives more detail than \\"Training and Racing with a Power Meter\\". It has stretching and weight training sections as well.

When I readed this book some years ago, I was amazed at how easily Friel could explain vital training concepts and how his words make you instantly realize the value of an structured plan. He then gets through a plan custom-made for you, and helps you to learn which athlete you really are, and what your weakness are so that you can work on them to become a better athlete. There are better books for giving workout examples, but I'm yet to find a better book about making your periodization/planning of your year-round training, specifically for cycling.

However, if you are willing to read the book, do the tests to determine your fitness, and then develop your plan, and stick to it, it will make you a much better cyclist. I went from the back of the pack, struggle to keep up cyclist(got dropped several times) last year, to a front of the pack, much stronger cyclist this year. A buddy and I put togather a program last fall, and followed it thru over the winter, and now we are much better and stronger. The only other factor in my improvement was probably my Computrainer, which I rode all winter long. The workouts, along with the computrainer did the trick. The only downside to the book is that to get the full value of it you need some way to measure watts, and if you don't have the needed equiptment, you may not get the full benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"VIRGIN PULSE 10.4 Inch LCD/DVD","review":"Checked this out as thought it would work well in home as well as car and the price was right.

It had never occured to me before reading this book, which so sedulously, so inexorably rings with sentiment and shows such a vision as to be beyond all possible blame for its solipsism (and certainly beyond all past sentimental and solipsistic achievements in verse), that poet was, in fact, a four letter word.

The next morning the itching had stopped but I had bright red bumps almost everywhere, and didn't fade until the end of the day, but I still had little scars.

It was a shame to see those fish floating at the end of winter last year..."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked good for one year","review":"I bought and used this item in my 370 gallon pond 4 months out of a year and it worked great,but the second year of use it did not work,I did nothing different from the first to the second year and handled and put it away in it original box during storage.I did the direction thing about putting it in a freezer to reset a thermostat,which it did work for a short time but froze itself in the pond ice,so unless you like spending money annually for a fairly decent deicer when it works or did work is up to you.Myself i am trying something else and hopefully lasting for more than a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't really open much space","review":"I was not quite sure to expect, so maybe my expectations were different from what should have been, but this product does not really open much of a space on the surface, it barely is an inch larger than the product itself. I am told it is plenty to keep the fish healthy and safe, but I am skeptical. I am careful to keep the waterfall fully operational and the fish seem okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned up after 1 year","review":"I guess surrounding an item that heats up in plastic is not such a great idea. Should have known. Purchase an Allied brand. Mine has lasted for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 a star","review":"It melted through the plastic so I contacted Farm Innovators and they traded it out with another one. Actually, he told me they'd never had this happen before. (??) The new one also melted the plastic on the bottom of the heater but not right away. I was able to use it for about a month and a half which considering the price is really bad. Plus I was afraid the exposed wires could harm my fish. I thought about returning it again but if they are all just going to melt why bother. I ended up going to the local feed store and got a floating tank heater for $14.00 which works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated and Disappointed!","review":"I have to agree with everyone else who has written a review -- it works great for one season and then fails to work the second. I have owned two of these units. The first worked for a winter, then stopped working. I sent it back and the company sent me a new one. I used the second one last winter and it was fine. I plugged it in today (it's 20 degrees today and I NEED it to work) and it shorted out. So now I'm looking for another heater and, trust me, I won't be buying another one of these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed twice due to water getting inside","review":"I bought this unit as it was exactly what I needed for my pond. It worked great the first year. Luckily I was able to have Farm Innovators replace it under warranty as it was just within the 1 year period. Again, same thing, the replacement unit worked great the first year but some how got water in it(like the first one), now it melted through the bottom of the unit and is useless. I did not submerge the unit as it floats on top of the water but it appears that the seal around the plug cord going into the unit is poor and lets water seep in....luckily I have a small pump circulating the water that keeps a small opening in the ice so the fish are still swimming. I have to look for different unit for the real cold weather, what a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Product","review":"I didn't buy this product on Amazon but rather through another vendor. Although it kept the ice away, when I checked it a few weeks after putting it in my pond I noticed a hole on the bottom. The heating mechanism had burned right through the plastic. The vendor sent me a free replacement but the same problem occurred less than a month later. Look elsewhere for a pond heater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a little while","review":"I bought this to prevent my koi pond from freezing over totally. I followed directions to the T and it did work for a couple of weeks and then I noticed it was floating funny.

It's very user friendly as pertains to setting the time and alarm. The time keeping is nearly perfect. The reason I bought this watch was because of the convoluted method of setting the alarm and time on my previous digital watch, a Timex.It's inexpensive, but if you want a watch that keeps great time... buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased with watch.","review":"This watch meets all my expectations. It is similar but better than a Casio watch that I had some years ago. It keeps very accurate time- much better than an Omega self winder that I received as an appreciation gift from my employer in 1973."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch; bought it again","review":"I first bought this watch about 10 years back, and it's served me faithfully. The battery finally ran out and my fat staticky fingers zapped the circuitry when I tried to replace it, so now I'm buying a second one. The watch shows the time, day of month and day of week, and has an alarm, chronometer, and very bright backlight. The alarm runs for 20 seconds, which has always sufficed to wake me up while traveling. Only downside is that the metal bracelet has a tendency to catch my armhair; but since I always carry the watch in my pocket (and the band collapses very well for this purpose) that's not an issue for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I expected.","review":"Works exactly the way I wanted it to. I enjoy the backlight - evenly lights up the whole face with a pleasant blue color. The band doesn't catch my arm hair nearly as much as I expected - it's actually a fairly rare occurrence. The display is easy to read. I love the 80s styling.I'd love it if I could buy this same watch with a metal casing instead of plastic, but I haven't noticed any scratches on the case.The only thing I don't like is that to clear the stopwatch, I have to turn on the backlight. A silly thing, I know.I would recommend this watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulls Hair..Too Painful to Wear","review":"I thought I had found the perfect watch for me.. But after less than 2 hrs of wearing it, I had to take it off because of the PAIN it caused from constantly pulling my wrist hair, and I don't have very hairy wrists... I had to return it because it's not practical to wear a watch that causes pain.. And NO, I would not recommend this watch to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design of the band clasp.","review":"The watch band is a nightmare to put on, the ad pictured a different type of clasp.

I'm very content with the purchase of this product :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch for a great price!","review":"I liked the retro look of it and purchased it for $17.99 ,the next week price went for $18.99...The light function is great ,stopwatch works good ,the battery should last for 7 years,it is light and comfortable to wear.This watch is more accurate than Omega Swiss ETA quartz!I tested it over 2 weeks and it shows correct time,it is consistenly +/- 3 seconds per week ,which is great!!The bracelet was a little bit rough at the beginning ,but I sanded it with fine grade sandpaper ,so now it is really smooth and doesn't irritate a skin>Great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DECEPCION ..

The only thing I didn't like is that not all the straps are adjustable."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite!","review":"This is one of my favorite albums and definitely my favorite Al Jarreau album. I had it on cassette and was thinking about some of the tunes the other day and ordered it from Amazon. I got the MP3 album and within a few minutes had a CD to put in my car. Ain't the Internet wonderful?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best live recording ever!","review":"I'm normally don't like live recordings, but this one is awesome, maybe the best ever. Al Jarreau shows what a magnificent artist he is. And everything in the concert is great. The powerful intro of \\"Raging Waters\\", the groove of \\"Black and Blues\\", the crying in \\"High Crime\\" and the incredible feeling in the two concluding songs, \\"Teach Me Tonight\\" and \\"We're In This Love Together\\". All of the musicians are performing at their best. Maybe for a Non-Al Jarreau-fan this is nothing special, but for a HUGE fan like myself it's superb. What else can I say...buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required listening?","review":"I've had a hard time digging beneath the surface of this album. I keep expecting obvious brilliance, but it's not leaping out of the speakers, grabbing my by the collar, and shaking me like a rag doll. So why 4 stars? I'm humming tunes from it for hours after listening. It's nearly always in my CD changer. I hear echos of it everywhere. It's growing on me, there's no denying, and its becoming one of my more treasured albums in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than 5 stars","review":"5 stars almost seems like an injustice to this great lp. This started a whole new movement in music for good reason, it is a unique sound that is labeled alt-country but I have never heard country kick this much butt. Buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"No Depression\\" music doesn't sound like this...","review":"This is the album that started the alt.country / \\"No Depression\\" movement?!?! When I first heard it, I thought it was a punk rock record (or as close as the 90s could get to punk). So what that they sported a Midwestern drawl and played acoustic guitar on a song or two. This thing rocks. It rocks hard. It rocks good. It rocks emotionally. It rocks with depression. It rocks with unemployment. And yes, it rocks right out the screen door and into the world. All music should be this good."},{"rating":"1","title":"An attempt to sell folky sounds to teenage grungers.","review":"There's plenty of great alt country/ folk bands out there but this lot are very overrated. This may well be the only way to get young metal/ grunge heads to listen to any sort of countrified sound but I'm not buying into it. Jay Farrar has a great voice and is capable of pretty emotional stuff, like the second track 'That Year'. The majority of this LP is drab country grunge though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Raven Fan, but this stinks!","review":"I am the BIGGEST Raven-Symone fan. But this CD is so cheap. I've heard that the bonus videos are on YouTube, so when you put this CD in the computer a site opens up. BOOTLEG! Raven is soooo far away from this. It doesnt even support her, so why buy it? Go buy \\"This Is My Time\\", thats a great purchase"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL for kids","review":"Everything about this movie looks like it is for kids except for the PG rating which can be overused these days so I didn't think much of it.

I really thought that the movie would be much better than it was. I would never rent it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad...","review":"Let's be honest, if two little girls were kidnapped by gross old men they wouldn't be acting so smart-alick and stuck up.This movie is boring from the start. You can tell their trying to make it entertaining, but it's far from.And who is the black horse on the front? Neither the horse or pony is black coated. Come on, if they don't even realize that they put the wrong horse on the cover... maybe they shouldn't have made a movie.Not for a younger audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie is in Bad Taste","review":"If your child is under 11, I would advise against this movie. Aside from the very poor acting, which is forgivable in a children's movie, there are many problems with it. We turned it off about a 1/4 of the way through. One of the more disturbing scenes shows two creepy looking men observing children at the playground. This precedes the uneccessary scene in which you think someone is sneaking up to one of the girl's bedroom window while she is asleep in her bed. Another inappropriate scene shows the pony dreaming of his mother getting hit by a drunk driver, (yes, they show the drunk man driving the car while guzzling a bottle of something). This movie is in bad taste. Too bad, since the horse scenes which we saw were adorable. There are so many wonderful horse movies available for the young horse lover in your family, but this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad taste, bad production","review":"One of the most appalling films I have ever seen. Contrary to the above kids' reviews, my kids absolutely hated it. It's is poorly done on all levels (acting, direction, editing, and writing) and it is so bad it is actually disturbing to watch. When it tries to be funny it is not at all. When it tries to be suspenseful it is boring and, worst of all, when it tries to be cute, it is in bad taste. A movie has to try very hard to be this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrifying! Not for the 7 and under crowd!","review":"My 7 year old daughter and I rented & watched this movie last night. We should have shut it off. For some reason, we thought it would get better, but it never did. At first, it looked like it would be an entertaining tale about 2 girls being kidnapped by a couple of buffoons. However, there was nothing entertaining about this. It was just, plain scary for my little girl. The scenes where the 2 goofy kidnappers stalked the girls were much too suspenseful and realistically scary. The pony's recurring nightmare of his mother being killed was also very frightening and disturbing.I wouldn't really recommend this movie to anyone. It wasn't well done at all and it wasn't one bit entertaining. Furthermore, it petrified my little girl. I wish I could give it zero stars. I have nothing good to say about this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kidnapping??","review":"My daughter is 10 years old and kidnapping, however portrayed, is terrifying to any kid, isn't it? (not to mention to parents as well). We had to turn the movie off in the beginning when the kidnappers were scoping out the young children coming out of school. Seriously, I don't understand why this was a theme in a movie geared toward kids. Nothing like instilling paranoia... I know it's rated PG but so is Shrek and many other 'kid friendly' movies. We were really disappointed and had hoped for a fun adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two-Bits & Pepper","review":"I thought it was full of adventure and exitment. When I first saw it I was scared the horse was going to die and the girls were going to get kidnapped. I won't tell you what happens though.

(Me, I'm waiting for a BVSC-edition Palm handheld.) But the design of this CD box jumped out at the record store ... for its lack of anyone puffing on a stogie, or similar; it *looks* like a cross between a theremin album and a scene from *The Cabinet of Dr Caligari*. So I gave it a spin and I was hooked. Parts definitely old Cuban, parts that are new and refreshingly rootless; and it all hangs together and works. Excellent, and it's now one of my most-played albums.Only four stars rather than five, though, because over twenty more minutes worth could have, and at least ten more minutes should have, been stuffed in. Oh well, if I want more I'll just have to buy the man's second album -- as I shall, in a flash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A low mark of an excellent franchise","review":"I own every single Buena Vista CDs and this is the one that falls short of all the other CDs.

If you really want to buy it, buy it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good example of Cuban Jazz","review":"This CD is, at best a mediocre example of what Latin jazz should be. Granted, Cachaito is an excellent performer; his classic Cuban style comes through in spite of his lackluster fellow musicians. Unfortunately, you cannot put an album together with a single good \\"contrabajo\\" player.This entire album sounds as if it was put together in a hurry, with a hodge-podge of amateurish players and sound effects; electric guitar with heavy use of distortion pedal, synthesizers providing \\"atmospheric\\" sounds, serve only to make us yearn for the good music of pre-Castro years.I guess I shouldn't be surprised; If Ray Cooder could get away with inserting Hawaiian sounds into Cuban music, why not a wah-wah pedal?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Covering all the basses, literally.","review":"This is a VERY impressive album. There is something on here for everybody. Straight Buena Vista style to modern hip-hop mixes, it is all here. I could go on, but just go buy this one.Great recording from a engineers point of view. Great mix puts you right in the music.Orlando Cachaito Lopez passed away on Monday February 9, 2009 in Cuba after complications from prostate surgery.RIP, hermano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rythmic and sonic wonders from a true master","review":"This is such a good CD, I worry about playing it too much and getting sick of it. It is very interesting, a deep Afro Cuban grounding with all sorts of fascinating diversions into reggae, hip hop bee bop and ambient jazz.

This is the only song of theirs I've come across that really doesn't let them stand out and is an obvious product of the Cheiron factory. It really doesn't belong on NSA because it doesn't take them where they want to go.

The US army closes in and...well, it's all over. Sort of. There's a random scene with a recluse novelist and the book closes with yet another sci-fi con and a filk (I didn't have any idea what this was until I Googled it and the author never really explains it) song.

I really enjoyed the little bit of 'magic', and the legendary/mythical element ie Atlantis, the Faery Folk, Merlin, Hill people etc. Combine this with the real historical and geographical references, and it becomes an absorbing read. Like other reviewers have wondered, what happened at the end? ie. I assume Arthur makes a comeback in the next book, but it doesn't appear to have been resolved in Aneirin's lifetime, as he becomes an old man with the mystery still unresolved. And then it ends. Guess I'll just have to get Pendragon and hope I get some answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Approach to the Arthurian Legend","review":"This book takes a different approach to the legend of King Arthur. Most notable is the absence of Lancelot. Saying this however, the book is still an interesting and enjoyable read. Lawhead weaves some of the legend into his tale of Arthur, with the sword in the stone as well as the Round Table. I particularly enjoyed the way he divided the book into three parts, each narrated by a different individual. In this way, the different stages of Arthur's life are better portrayed. The main reason that I didn't give this book 5 stars is the fact that this is more a work of fantasy than an attempt to place the Arthurian legend in British history. This is just my opinion, however and should not prevent anyone interested in Arthur from picking up this book. Most enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For God and for Britain!","review":"I, personally, liked this story. It was more of a battle book than the other two, but the battles are so exciting and fresh the reader cannot help but wonder how Arthur will defeat the new adversary. Lawhead presents some ingenious battle tactics; perhaps the marines should read this. *j/k* I gave it four stars because of the loose ends that are left unresolved. Pelleas remains unfound, and we never find out what happens to Lile. She was very intriguing. The reader is left always wondering where she dissapeared to. The end is unsettling, and the reader is left reeling. That can be good or bad, depending upon different tastes. I liked it.Amidst all the turmoil, there is one especially touching scene. That is when Cai and Arthur climb the mountain, and Cai comes back down and reveals that Arthur carried him to the top.

Some of the new ones didn't work; the gophers filled them with dirt without springing them. I tested the triggers with a postal scale and found that the good traps would trigger with less than two ounces of force, while the bad ones took up to six ounces. I bent the hooks on the trigger wires (the wire the gopher pushes) until I got them all to trigger at under two ounces. I also filed some down a little. Now they all work very well. I am catching a couple of dozen gophers a year. These traps don't work on the moles in my area, because the moles go under them instead of entering. The traps are durable. The wire is either stainless or some rust resistant alloy. As others have said, you have to dig a significant hole to set these. If you are trying not to disturb a lawn, it is best to dig out chunks of sod and keep them cool and damp until the gopher is caught. Then you can replace the chunks in the hole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good results","review":"In my limited use I have managed to catch one gopher.

We have the other 2 pests here too, but their habits are different, and we'll have to get something else for the moles.We had tried everything to repel or remove this critter, and finally ordered one of these traps after reading good reviews here. To my great surprise, we got the pesky Pocket Gopher the very next morning after setting the trap. We did use the carrot trick at the back of the trap, as shown on the instructions.So much damage was done to our yard and shrubs, and it appears it was just this one pocket gopher all along.

First, you have to locate the main gopher tunnel which is probably the hardest part of the process.

Should you place one trap in each direction of the tunnel? Should you cover up the end hole? the top opening? Should you place bait? Should you wear gloves? Should the joint of the trap and the tunnel be air tight? Should you use it in the main run? Or can it be used in the lateral openings? No help on any of these items in the instructions.Anyway, I set the trap 3 times, and each time the little critters filled them up with dirt.

After researching how to set box-style traps, I tried for a week in various locations throughout my yard where there was recent activity. The problem wasn't finding the gopher, but it was that the gopher would push dirt into the trap and not set it off. He was essentially pushing about three inches of dirt into the trap and sealing off himself from the plastic intrusion. The lever to set off the trap is even further back from that, so he never got far enough in the trap to do what it's supposed to do.
