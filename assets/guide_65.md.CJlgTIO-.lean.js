I can't tell you how many times I sang along to She's On The Left and All Because of You and its spare sections! Can't Go Back on A Promise I still like! The other songs like One Love, One Dream, Cindy, You Can't Get Love from A Stone are some other super efforts. Jeffrey Osborne had his 5th best album after the '82, '83, '84 and '86 albums with this one. I never thought that he would pull this one off in a year that Bobby Brown, Keith Sweat and Al B Sure dominated R&B but he proved to be just as competitive. One of his finest works as an artist and a more mature sounding effort too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underpinnings of economic anthropology","review":"This book provides a nice discussion of the philosophical and historical underpinnings of economic anthropology. It shows how three perspectives have predominated in economic anthropology: whether people are selfish, moral or self-interested. The book traces the trajectories of each of these stances back in time, making interesting connections. The result is a work that makes one think hard about assumptions and limitations. Less attention is given to detailed discussion of formal economic models. The writing style is accessible, the voice active and the touches of humor (e.g. the drawing that depicts \\"academic strife\\") refreshing. This book might deserve a spot next to a favored ethnography or economics textbook on your shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This DVD was very disappointing and I expected much more!

I looked through the book once and then threw it away.

I love the sensual beauty of the human body, both the male and female forms are evocative in their own way, something that Stephan May captures beautifully.His 1996 collection titled Beauty is actually what drew me to this book. But Minded (1997), Sola (1997) and Women Only-II (1996) have quickly become some of my other favorites. This book offers a small representation of his collections, of which I have only mentioned four.

It was refreshing to see a stage production that wasnt effected by the Tyler Perry craze going on. Sometime people want to be entertained without having to learn a moral lesson.

The bookcase I used it on is now absolutely GLEAMING. This oil is made to be used on wood that is dull and dry, where the finish is wearing off. Furniture that already has a good finish on it will only end up greasy with this.This will make your furniture oily and greasy if you try to use it like ordinary furnitrure polish. Think of it as a deep conditioner. I spray this on dry, dull furniture liberally, wipe it around, and let it sit for several minutes before buffing the excess oil off with a clean cloth. This allows the oil to sink into the wood and you don't end up with a slick, gross, dust-magnet surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"revitalizes furniture","review":"My friend told me about Pledge Revitalizing Oil with Natural Orange Oil and how well it did on her furniture.

It's a shame this film didn't receive the recgonition when it was first released back in 1988.

Like in La Balance, Swaim's European sensibilities mixed with his American pacing makes this film not only one of the great suspenseful thrillers of the 80's but perhaps one of the most original. It's Meg Tilly's hottest, sexiest film and Rob Lowe's most convincing portrayal of a complex and contradictory character. Aside from being incredibly sexy, the film is full of twists and turns that keep the audience guessing. Why don't they make films like that, anymore? And what ever happened to Bob Swaim?The supporting roles are fabulous, particularly John Glover and Dana Delanny who give one of the best performances of their careers. Truly a classic, this underrated film deserves to be re-discovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still own this book","review":"There aren't many things I have left from my childhood, but this book was one of my favorites and was kept.

It's also wide enough to offer some protection on her shoulders. I like that I can fold it up and keep it in the diaper bag without it getting ruined.

It's more practical than stylish, but still pretty cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too floppy","review":"We tried this and the Flap Happy Sun Hat and ended up returning this one. The brim is too floppy, so my baby hated it.The Flap Happy hat was all around better for only about 3 bucks more: stiffer brim which stayed off her face, UPF 50+, organic cotton, made in the USA, etc. We also got the XL even though our baby is only 12 months old. The looser fit will be cooler on her head and the straps will keep it in place.I'd recommend going with the Flap Happy over this iPlay hat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, did not bleed","review":"I'm very happy with these hats.

She's 3 months now and I am STILL in love with it. It's still loose, but not really too big (It doesn't fall over her eyes), which is fine by me because it means it'll last longer. As long as you wash it before you let your baby wear it it doesn't bleed, but definitely wash it first (Like any new baby clothing item).

It's funny on her, but pretty useless as a hat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality hat","review":"Very good quality hat. Since the price was one of the cheapest on amazon I was not expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. My son is only 3 months old but I bought him the larger hat because I'd rather he grow into it.

I'm not sure how this company can justify manufacturing a sun hat with non-colorfast dye that will be used by children around sweat and water. The very first time my daughter wore this hat it bled all over her shirt where the brim touched it. It took me a while to realize that it was the hat that had caused it. I couldn't really believe that it would have been made so poorly but rinsed it in the sink anyway just to see. The first time I rinsed it, red colored water just flowed from it. Ridiculous that something made for children wouldn't be made color fast, especially a sun hat!Positives are that the chin tie allows it be fairly adjustable and that the brim is wide.However, the negative of the fact that I can never trust that the color won't bleed all over my daughter's clothes makes it unlikely that I will ever actually use this hat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't breathe","review":"I like that this hat blocks the sun. However, if you are using it for the purpose of blocking the sun, it is probably hot.

I recommend not wasting your money and purchasing a cotton breathable hat instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big for a newborn, not really adjustable","review":"I bought this in summer 2010 for my baby, born in August. I purchased the 0-6 month size but it was way too huge for her.

Troward's work is so intense I often am underlining and making notes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome..Crais' best yet...","review":"This is my fourth Crais' book and by far my favorite. The book is like an orchestra that is tuned beautifully by Crais, the maestro. It is one of the better thrillers you will read. Oh, sure, the concidences are many, but it really does work. The multivoiced narrators work beautifully (even more strongly than Demolition ANgel). The tension builds and the twists don't stop coming. It is mysterious, exciting, and as many of these books are about redemption. I read that this will soon be a movie with BRuce Willis. I'm sure that will be fine but I can't believe the movie will be better than this fantastic book. Crais keeps getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why six stars?","review":"Why six stars to this book?1) It has too many people involved, but the book explain perfectly who they are and you know exactly what are they doing and why.2) It never goes out of the story and it has three different stories that will keep you very busy.3) You will be interested in all the people of the book, not only Talley or the terrorists.4) You won't be able to put down the book until you finish it.5) It has no sex scenes that many writers write just to fill pages.6) IT IS A GREAT BOOK, JUST FOR THAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"sooooooooo long a nd boring. huge disappointment from an author who has written some very good books. i absolutely hated this one. too predictable. terrible writing. for example, i counted 12 exclamation points on one page. don't waste your time on this dredge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.......","review":"Not much to say other than this book was a big letdown after Demolition Angel and LA Requiem.

The Elvis Cole novels just keep getting better. And this non-Elvis effort, which reads like a brisk blueprint for the action film it has just become, really pops. No, it ain't high literature. It's just damn good fun. (And based on the review in this morning's Variety, you may want to read the book and skip the movie--or at least, read the book to see what the movie could have been.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I got this book at the Atlanta airport while my flight was delayed.

It was exciting and had enough twists to keep you guessing until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crais strikes again.","review":"As a loyal devotee of Crais' Elvis Cole series, I waited a while before reading this book - his newest \\"stand-alone\\" book - after the immensely entertaining DEMOLITION ANGEL. This was silly of me, as HOSTAGE is one of those books that you just really don't feel comfortable putting down, due to the irrational fear that something might happen while you're not reading.Mind you, HOSTAGE is not Crais' best work, nor is it a book without flaws. Quite frankly, the book is absolutely riddled with cliches. What makes Crais a fascinating writer is the way he transcends these cliches and allows us to get caught up in the intensity of the situation. There are even certain moments in the book where the main character, Talley, has to take a second to laugh at the absurdity of the situation.But, like all of Crais' work, this book is exciting, intriguing, full of interesting, real characters, and you just don't want to put it aside until it's done."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULD HAVE BEEN A TEN!!!!!","review":"What a book!!!!!!! Have read several books and I don't remember one I enjoyed any more. Police Chief, Jeff Talley, formerly with LAPD SWAT unit, finds himself with three men in a house with three hostages. As the book progresses we find out the man who is hostage is also CPA for part of the mob. He has records in his house that can send them all to prison. Now the police want in the house and the hostages out, but the people there for the mob just want in the house to get the computor disc. The story will hold you on the edge. There is fake FBI people, cops on the side of the mob, raw policeman and then there is Jeff Talley. The book has a few surprises and a twist at the ending. I did not want to put it down. It was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Boring!!","review":"This is a REALLY boring book.

Mr. Crais is a fine writer. This story which I've read is to become a film starring Bruce Willis was thoroughly enjoyable. It centers around a California police chief involved in a hostage situation. The plot grows complicated and the stakes grow high. I would've given Hostage five stars if Elvis Cole had popped with Joe Pike in tow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Reading A Great Script","review":"Robert Crais ventures again from the familiar world of Elvis Cole and Joe Pike, and writes a page turning thriller that will soon be in a cineplex near you. Written with rapid fire dialogue and minimal character description, Crais gets right to the heart of the action with a recovering hostage negotiator attempting to put a rather harrowing failure behind him. But soon he's reluctantly drawn back into his old role and with much more at stake than ever before. Crais is quickly becoming a master at the thriller genre, and I found this to be even more nail biting and suspenseful than his previous novel \\"Demolition Angel.\\" But it's definitely a plot driven piece, so don't go in expecting in depth character development. It's a fast fun read and will make a great movie, Bruce Willis having secured the rights before it was even published. Still I can't help but hope that his next book will be find him back to the Elvis Cole mysteries. They're still in my opinion his best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight, fast crime story.","review":"In this tight, fast-paced police thriller, Chief of Police Jeff Talley would like nothing more than to start a new existance, leaving the shattered pieces of the life he once loved behind him. However, there were bigger forces at work, and Talley would soon find his quiet little suburb in the midst of multiple homicides, kidnappings, and hostage takings. Even more disturbing, however, is that these are the least of his problems.In Hostage, Robert Crais takes his second stab at the 'damaged cop with a painful past' story (the first Demolition Angel), and does a credible job with the tale. The characters are a decent combination of primary characters with emotional and literary depth and secondary characters of sufficient variety to keep them all from blending together. A coupld of the plot twists felt a little contrived, but not so much as to ruin the credibility of the story.All in all, a worthwhile read. Fast and engaging, with all the right elements for a crime thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"The characters in this book are exceptionally well developed and I found myself rooting for Jeff Talley, the former SWAT team member and hostage negotiator who is at the center of this story. Several of the other characters also lept off the page at me, especially the children. This novel is fast paced, and very suspenseful and I found it hard to put down, even though I wanted to make the experience last! It's a long time until the next new Robert Crais, but I'll be going back to read all his novels that I've missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Great fun, although there is a problem. You might not be able to put it down. The story is one cliff hanger after another. It starts out as a simple home invasion but then quickly morphs into much more. I also enjoyed that there were several differt perspectives happening simultaneously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Crais' work, for the most part.

I had read Demolition Angel last year and thought it was okay. I had read a few Elvis Cole books and thought that they were fun, but not exciting. Then I read Hostage.Hostage had me hooked on page 1 and had me flipping pages until I reached page 373. I have been reading it before going to work, at lunch, and every spare minute at home.

I read to suspend disbelief, but in this case the whole story was unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for tv novel.............","review":"I have read all of Robert Crais' novels and have enjoyed them all until this one which I found extremely disappointing. I think it belongs on some night this fall as the 'movie of the week'. However, I hear that Bruce Willis bought it. This means automatically that I have no interest in seeing it, if and when it comes to the 'big' screen. Too bad someone did not bother to buy some of his earlier stuff that was worthwhile seeing on the big screen or in the case of HOSTAGE, on the little screen where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your best Mr. Crais...","review":"Fans of Robert Crais will be disappointed in this one.

Great pictures also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and entertaining","review":"Although not a travel book per se, there is a lot of useful information on the areas and people that Palin visits.

One can feel the sights and sounds of the intriguing and mystical land of Africa, as Michael Palin with his British accent, tells the story of his journey. I found myself transfixed and transported back into time, invisioning myself in Morocco in the 1920's with camels and dark mahogany wood. This story inspired some of my home decorations...

Good thing the cute monster is on each page because the words of the story are pathetic. The author has no idea how to write for a 2- or 3- or even 4-year-old child. The words and phrases are all wrong, and quite boring. We change the words and I try to involve my son in the pictures instead of what is written. Very disappointing. Clearly they expect the book to sell because Elmo is the main character and little care was given to writing for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, but poorly-placed humor","review":"My review hits the middle of the gamut of earlier reviews. Not a hunter, with no desire to be one, I still thoroughly enjoyed the suspense and details of the stories recounted here. I also love the variety, from lions to German cruisers to man-eating leopards. (I must admit to being less favorably inclined to the story of Bell's elephant killing, as those huge animals were less of a threat to humans than the tigers, leopards, and lions described elsewhere.) Overall, these stories have significant WOW impact throughout and I found myself wondering how I would have fared in similar circumstances. My guess? Rather poorly!However, I must agree with the negative comment about the oddly-placed humorous comments. Even as I smiled at some of them, I was struck by the incongruity of the words.Still, I've recommended the book to many friends and don't hesitate to recommend it here, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snide-sighted/hindsighted","review":"Capstick could easily have inspired J.K.Rowling's character Gildiroy Lockwood.

Yes, the recommend using a piece of tape to remove dust, but each time I lifted it to do so, more dust seemed to appear, until I finally removed it and tossed it out.

I had hoped that this movie would contain interviews and footage showing what Bobby \\"the Brain\\" was like not only on camera, but off camera as well. Sadly, this is just a collection of audio/video clips of some of Heenan's more memoriable quotes. Things that most wrestling fans have already seen at least a dozen times.Additionally, the interviews add little insight into what Heenan was really like. Most of these interviews consisted of co-workers and family members making comments on \\"how great he was\\" or \\"how he had so much talent.\\" Which of course if your watching this movie, you probably already know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book For Dream Working","review":"I loveeeeee this book!.

Unfortunately, much of the book steers you towards what you should do in response to a dream rather than just interpreting where the dream may have come from.When I set out to interpret my first dream, I couldn't find most of the components of the dream, so I gave up. I.e. - the index of symbols is very limited.Also, the author avoids some of the more interesting dream contents, such as sex. Dreams about sex are described as your interest in \\"combining forces\\" with another person.

Upon finding a similar word to define, the meaning/definition, it was then so far off from my dream that I was frustrated and having to recall even more symbols to try and clearly define my dreams.

If you are looking for hand climbing spikes you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"2pc ninja hand claw climbing tigers spikes","review":"I train a martial art known as ninjutsu. I bought this spikes in order to train for an exam. (as well as have fun). In my opinion the actual metal part and claws are really nice. My really big problemwith this product is the quality of the wrist guard. For one the attaching the claw to the wrist and hand is really not user friendly. Secondly, it is not sturdy, after only like 2 days of barely using the claws thefabric began to tear around the part where you secure the wrist. In my opinion it is not worth buying unless you want to replace the entire fabric of the claw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor For Climbing; Need Work","review":"Using these claws for the purpose of actually climbing a tree is an absolute pain, in both the figurative and literal sense. The strap that goes around the wrist is short; I am unable to secure it before putting my hand through, and have to fumble with the strap with one hand after placing it on my wrist. The ends felt very sharp, but still have trouble digging into the bark of most common-variety trees. One needs to 'hug' the tree to get a good grip with the claws. If the claws are able to hook in, any pressure applied away from the fingers causes the thick metal loop to dig into the back of your hand, quickly making it too painful to climb anything. The only things that keep this from getting a one-star in my book is that they can be climbed with, and could serve as okay hand-to-hand combat weapons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for business","review":"As a few of these guys said, they will dig into your hand but padding works as a deterrent for this. Climbing is much easier without them, I'm a freerunner, so I thought this would give me an edge, but it really hinders your performance.

The tips were extreamly dull so i decided to drasticly change the shape of the tip with a metal grinding tool they are alot better but still can barley climb anything let alone a tree/ice-wall. They have a fey pretty big design flaws. They're a big piece of mettal and were so wide that i had to were big work gloves to fit my hands and my hande are roughly three inches wide the norm is like three to fore inches the mettal on the tiger claw's are Fore and one half so they are pretty big. The wrist strap is about one third the size of the one in the picture and fall off alot. The main piece of mettal is kindof thin so it cuts the back of your hand. i was not to pleased with thease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, Bad product","review":"I bought these hand spikes in hopes of using them to climb trees but sadly they do not work at all.

I bought these not realizing that they were not worth the metal they were made out of. I guess I should have read the reviews. Like the others said, they will not work for climbing, as they will cut the back of your hand when any weight is applied. The oval where the spikes are is much too large to be comfortable. The points are not sharp, which would be okay if the rest of it worked as it should.

The first fifteen minutes has alot of storylines going on so it can get confusing and seem like there is about three stories going on. The first kill was very well done, the killer favors slashing the throats of the majorettes and then baptizing them into water. It also has faint religious overtones but this film has so much going on that its hard to follow. One girl was set to inherit half a million dollars and that story gets lost in the shuffle. Overall, it can be an enjoyable film but has way too many stories going on and it can get confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Brewer and Shipley wrote all but three of the songs on this CD that covers their two albums. \\"Weeds\\" plays very much like a symphony, with songs moving artistically into the next.

The wife discovers fragments of a manuscript containing medieval motets similar to those in the \\"Old Hall\\" manuscript, a valuable and controversial colletion of medieval music. She claims they have been written by Henry V and is accused of fraud by a leading English music critic. Her husband is accused of collaboration.

If Klein now make this tool from a single steel bar it will withstand the heavy use that it's supposed to bear, but I doubt they'll bother to correct that issue.

A number of other reviews here complain about jams and breakages, but I have used it nearly every single day for the last year, and never once had issues.As the instructions explain, if you run it without beans in the hopper at a small grind setting, you will literally rub away the grinding burrs!The little knob that operates the grinder pulls right off.

Unfortunately that one only ran for two weeks then stopped running.Oh, and the front bin doesn't fit well and was difficult to remove and place back in. Need I say more?Very overpriced for the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Poor fit, poor grind, bad adjusting wheel, ill fitting bin. It looks great but that's about it.

Two stars only because of the oily bean problem. Come on, now, for $200 you should get a near-perfect machine. I should have bought an $80 Capresso grinder.Pros:Looks nice; makes an even grind; low static cling; heavy duty motor; replacement parts available from Baratza; polite and responsive service department.Cons:Frequently has trouble with oily beans, the grinder spins but won't grab the beans. You have to shake the grinder to get it to continue grinding. This is after making the factory recommended adjustment to the slowest gear speed.Knob falls off. Baratza sent me a new one, but the new one is still not quite tight enough.The hard plastic ring inside somehow went bad. A $12 replacement part from Baratza."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for dark roast beans; knob falls off constantly","review":"I was given this grinder as a gift. I like that it is relatively quiet and that there is less dust than other grinders I've owned. But if you like dark roast beans this grinder is not for you. I've tried all the recommendations suggested by the manufacturer but to no avail. It takes several minutes of grinding using a utensil to get this grinder to produce enough ground coffee.A small irritation is the knob falls off on almost every grind. I could live with this if the machine could actually grind beans.I was shocked to learn this grinder costs $200; for this price there should be no issues with grinding dark roasts. Do all Baratza machines have this problem?I am now in the market for a replacement. Please comment of suggestions if you have time. TIA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy part quality, low durability under normal use","review":"I purchased this product to grind beans for espresso and Chemex (drip) coffee.I worked well for about a year, then the plastic burr flange snapped in half.Repair parts are cheap, but a $200 product shouldn't fall apart after less than a year of normal, everyday use.Contrary to Baratza's claims, it's a PITA to take apart, too.Look elsewhere for a high-end burr grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Mess!","review":"I owned a Maestro Plus for 15 years, used it daily and loved it. When it finally decided to quit (a long slow death), I ordered the Virtuoso last summer and have been using it daily. I like most everything (speed, noise), but it spits out residue all over the counter. There seems to be no way to reduce the static electricity so you get lots of 'cling' to the hopper. Grinds also drop out of the bottom. I believe the grind quality is also inconsistent with lots of 'flakes', no matter the setting. Whatever the differences, this is not the same quality as the Maestro Plus...not even close. While I may get another Baratza product, it will NOT be the Virtuoso. In the meantime, I am buying my coffee already ground (yikes!)at the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"FFLLIIMMSSYY!!","review":"I bought this grinder about 6 months ago and have been trying to make it work properly and justify it's price ever since. The first thing to break was the instant-on button on the front, then the knob on the side slid off and never has stayed on once turned or moved, the alignment indicators for the burr are not right and so the grinding is inconsistent, and now the french press settings(35 to 40) are inoperable. I am terribly disappointed, people reviewing this item said the customer service dept. for this company was great but I have never heard back from them. Sure would like to. Last month a friend gave me the KitchenAid Pro-Line nickel grinder and it is state of the art. I'll never go near a Baratza product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN AWAY FROM BARATZA PRODUCTS...","review":"If you are the type of person that likes to get a new item and then take it apart because it isnt designed to work with a decent espresso machine, then this is the product for you!I have a gaggia baby and both of the Baratza Virtuoso grinders that I have dont work with it! They are simply NOT designed to grind espresso beans fine enough for the Gaggia machines. The companies solution? Take it apart and start playing with the screws inside until its good enough...I cant emphasize this enough.. this grinder is total crap and you will be asking yourself \\"what was i thinking?\\" when you realize just how terrible the design on this grinder is.Agree or not, please dont say that you were not warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This is the second Baratza grinder I have had; previous was the less expensive Maestro model which I much preferred.

You literally can not turn them on or off, a reset does not fix it. You then have people that just can not turn lights on.

Steamy, sensuous and unabashedly romantic ballads like \\"Love Is In Your Eyes\\", \\"Share\\", \\"For Your Love (I'll Do Most Anything)\\", \\"There's A Place Where Love Never Ends\\" and \\"The Right Night\\" are vintage-flavored and (despite the subtle use of programmed drum machines, keyboards and synthesizers) make for a truly enjoyable listening experience.

From my point of view is just great rock 'n' roll performed with soul and conviction, that's all. Iggy was just trying to survive, making his way in a music world ruled by blockbuster nerds such as Phil Collins or Michael Jackson. Above all, it was a reaction against the commercial concessions made in the aforementioned album. Maybe \\"Instinct\\" is not a masterpiece but it's a must for the fans of Iggy's solo career, as a matter of fact, it was his most aggressive and boisterous album since \\"Raw Power\\", enough said.Play it loud and enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great rocking album","review":"there is not much too add to what earlier reviewers wrote who, with the exception of 1 on 8, delighted in this album. With the aid of former Sex Pistols Steve Jones on leadguitar and songwriting Pop succeeded in performing more hard rocking songs but stays within the confines of his Popsound, meaning easy recognisable and not too complicated lyrics, mostly dealing with big city life. So far the better. Outstandng tracks are \\"Cold Metal\\", \\"Tuff Baby\\", \\"High On You\\", \\"Easy Rider\\" (could have been incorporated on the sixties film of fame with that name) \\"Tom Tom\\" and so on.

They are best described as monstrous combat machines in the guise of animals, dinosaurs, or insects. They are represented here in toy form as motorized (windup or battery powered) scale models that you assemble yourself.As Zoids go, Gustav is not the most interesting one. It has no guns, no legs, and moves about using hidden wheels. It is unique in that the armor panels that make up the shell expand and contract when the Zoid is moving, along with the rotating radar and waving antenna. It also has two trailers to carry other Zoids, and a variety of cranes, work platforms, and other \\"support equipment\\".It's a fun toy.

Mostly, it covers the most mundane metaphysical material - reincarnation, karma, astrology, and so on - from the standpoint of a \\"trance channeler.\\" Perhaps its main virtue is the effort to bind the message with relatively recent developments in physics.

No attempt is made to understand these phenomema; her sole purpose is to inspire anxiety about some kind of conspiracy of elitists determined to undermine all that \\"good people\\" (i.e., those who agree with her ultra-conservative politics) hold dear.Seeking to inspire disdain rather than to inspire understanding, this book has no value in anyone's library.

The first fifty pages are among the most intense I've read in any fiction. Dekker writes with a good grasp of human emotions and is able to comunicate those with unique skill. His treatment of drugs and 60s Atlanta culture could use some beefing up, but thier relatively simple treatment does not detract. This is a story of raw, unadulterated love, and that story shines over these minor weaknesses. His previous novel, Heavens Wager was strong but this one ups the ante. Full of action and suspense as well, but it is the love story that got me. I read a lot of fiction, and very few authors can work my emotions the way Dekker does.

Frankly, I was relieved when I finished the book ."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Had Me Weeping","review":"OK, I enjoy a good tear-jerker every once in a while, but boy oh boy, I wasn't ready for this one!! It's definitely a ten-hanky book--that's the maximum score I'm aware of. When Jan . . . well, I don't want to give away the story, but some INCREDIBLE things happen near the end of the book. And at the start of the book. And in the middle of the book, for that matter. This may be the most incredible story of redemptive love in the history of literature. Don't, I repeat, DON'T miss out on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it very much.","review":"While I didn't find it as inspiring as the previous book in the series, (perhaps because I identified more with Job than with Hosea) I did find it interesting and fairly gripping. It is a wonderful love story, the one between God and Man more so than the one between Jan and Helen, but the one between the mortals is pretty good too. It starts out with a bang and ends with a smaller bang. It is an interesting premise the retelling of the love story of Jesus and His bride or Hosea and his bride in modern terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impact","review":"Impact is the one word I will use to describe this book. The message in this book is a basic but too frequently forgotten one. It is one that Christianity is based on, yet we seem to set it aside in favor of tradition and theological disputes. That message is LOVE. Do we really understand the way Christ loves us? Do we understand the degree of His love? I don't think so. I know I don't: I think even a glimpse of it would kill me. That is why I was so impacted by this book. It made me really sit back and look at my relationships - my marriage, my kids, my friends. How can I change the way I love people around me. Do I take quick offense, or do I choose to move the way Christ moves? I know I would prefer to do the latter. READ THIS BOOK! If you need a good challenge to go with an excellent read as I do - this book will do it for you. It can be life-changing if you let it be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Find Cd Found!!","review":"I bought this as a cassette when it first came out. i loved the heavy percussion sound with the harmonica and the sultry voice of the lead singer. To find it on CD even makes them better and the bonus tracks at the end are a nice extra."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG PIG is HUGE!!!!","review":"When I first bought this tape back in the 80's, I thought I had found the perfect band! Big Pig 'Bonk' was one of the first albums I found that had everything I was looking for in a sea of mindless 80's junk. By far, my favorite songs are \\"Hungry Town\\" and \\"Nation\\"! I was surprised to find \\"Hellbent Heaven\\" and the other remixes on this import since none of them were on the album in the United States.(\\"Hellbent...\\" was a b-side on the 45 single of \\"I can't break away\\".) BONUS, baby!! Big Pig is not for everybody, but it sure gave me some great tunes, as it still does now!! If you hear that the group is composed of 7 people, 5 drummers, 1 keyboardist, and 1 harmonica player...and you say \\"COOL!\\", then this is your band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely timeless...","review":"This album is a rich mix of beat, synth and sampled sound, which vocals that give me goosebumps. Definitely a desert island choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful book!!!!","review":"I checked this book out at the library and renewed it twice because I couldn't bear to part company with it. I searched the stores for a copy and finally ordered one. This book touched me profoundly. I have re-read this numerous times. I can not wait to read more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference","review":"Clearer, newly typeset, and better-indexed than previous editions. Still has the comprehensive integral tables and a good trig reference section. The D.E. reference is still a little obscure. Good series section, good statistics. A nifty, if hardly \\"standard\\" topology/ knot section. All in all, keeps most of the good stuff, reorganizes, and resets old versions - due to the ambition of the new sections and scope of the reorganzation, a little bit disorganized. But it'll certainly be taken care of in the next edition by CRC, which consisently produces high-quality handbooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference for the abstract based mathmatican","review":"The reference covers many topics covered in higher mathmatics. Extensive list of definitions, theorems, formulas for many topics in mathematics - algebra, discrete, analysis, geometry, continous mathematics, many classifications for functions, and statistics. Some of the higher advanced topics include graph theory, abstract mathematics and differential geometry. The material presented is geared towards the serious mathematican than an undergraduate student or basic math user (why 4 star rating).

Buy it......you won't regret it. Then, buy Walk Among Us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not the best, but great anyway.","review":"Legacy Of Brutality is one of those albums where the recording and production are the only thing keeping it from real excellence. If you are new to the Misfits I would advice you not to choose this as your first purchase. Static Age is the superior of this album in the sense that it has almost all of the same songs, though with better sound. It's not that this album has a particulary bad sound, it's just that there is such better quality available from the Misfits. Though for the true Misfits fan, this album is an essential purchase as it contains songs found no where else and always makes as a great listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remember halloween!","review":"Tthe misfits are an awesome punk band.

It arrived in an envelope. No problems. My system now color profiled from scanner to printer and monitor with a Spider from datacolor.

The editing and publishing are mediocre and there are many other areas of NT that I would love to see the authors apply their impressive investigative skills to.If you are interested in understanding as much about the internals of NT as anyone that doesn't have access to the NT source code can, this book is well worth examining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for understanding the war in El Salvador","review":"This work by David L. Spencer is excellent. It describes in much detail the FMLN's use of special forces to conduct their guerrilla war against the El Salvador government from the early '80s until the early '90s. It is interesting to note that the FMLN sapper program was a direct copy of the Vietnamese effort and brought the FMLN much success. The reader also learns much about the Cuban involvement in the war and how Cuban advisors instructed the FMLN in sapper and combat swimmer operations and even participated on rare occasions in the fighting. Spencer must be given much credit for his excellent use of primary sources which included the interrogation reports of captured FMLN guerrillas and captured guerrilla diaries. This is truly a unique, fascinating work which is a must read for any student of modern guerrilla warfare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you love about her books and more!","review":"Earlene Fowler's Books stand out because of the relationships of her characters. This book gives you so many insights into her regular cast of characters that this alone is worth the read, but this book really surprised me. I had several things figured out pretty closely and then she threw me completely. By the end I found myself tearing up on the plane as I read the end of the book.Hud, Gabe, everyone else show us new facets of their characters and the new characters are the keys to a lot of this. One character I really hope to see more of in up coming books. The mystery is a good one, it held a surprise I didn't see coming but as always, the real gift of these books is the time spent with characters who have become like friends over the years. This was a great addition to a wonderful series. I won't go over the plot here because other reviews will and I don't want to know that much before I read it, just if it was a good read, this is a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delectable Reading","review":"All our favorite characters are back and it's like reuniting with some old friends. You can read a synopsis of the book above but there is more behind the story itself. The relationships between various characters grow and change and will leave readers looking to see what the future holds for each character. I have loved each book in this series and look forward to more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst in the Benni Harper series","review":"This was by far the worst book so far. The story line was weak and predictable. The characters are annoying (Is Benni ever going to stand up to her grandmother who keeps \\"volunteering\\" her for things? Is Benni ever going to trust her husband and stop putting herself in danger with murderers and other crazed criminals? Is Hud ever going to GO AWAY!!!). The editing is terrible -- Fowler puts a whole disclaimer at the beginning of the book about how it takes place in 1996 and then has one character tell another character to \\"Google it.\\" Um, Google was not around in 1996. It was founded in 1998 and the term \\"to google something\\" did not enter our vernacular until well into the next decade. Other spelling errors and typos were prevalent.I have enjoyed the books so far, but this might be the last one I read. The stories are becoming too annoying, sappy, and predictable for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, Love It, Love it","review":"Benni Harper fans will not be disappointed in this delightful, and interesting read. I have read all of this series, and read many mystery series, this book is a must read for all. If you are a fan of Benni, don't believe any of the negative reviews, can't miss with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Dialogue","review":"I liked the first of her books in general but I think the writing is getting almost childish, especially the dialogue. There is too much dialogue. It distracts from the story and I believe most of the dialog in a mystery should propel the story forward and offer some clues. It is too difficult in this one for me to read through the banality in the dialogue to discover clues. I found myself skipping huge parts of the book because it was boring. And I'm also getting tired of the \\"keeping things from Gabe\\" story line.I read a lot of mysteries and Ms. Fowler's writing needs some toning up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, hackneyed, and sacchrine but reasonable plot","review":"I listened to the audio book for Delectable Mountain from beginning to end and while it may appeal to quilters of a certain ilk... it certainly wasn't the best book I've read; not by a longshot! What kept me listening is that the plot was quite interesting.The author renders Bennie as very egotistical albeit cloaked in Christian decency. Bennie knows everything, anticipates everything, reads into everything, psychoanalyses everything, understands everything...she is cloyingly \\"everything\\". Detailed beyond imagination, one cannot blow one's nose without understanding the fibre of the tissue, the content of the mucus, and the use of the hand/fingers to manipulate the tissue. Ms. Earline may be a recognized author with a decent plot however, her writing could be tightened up, less verbose and certainly render her protagonist as 99% less egotistical. It was enough to make me gag."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Mystery with this One","review":"I usually like the Benni Harper series however, I had the villian pegged from the minute he walked in the door. It was so disappointing. I have rarely and I mean rarely looked at the end of a book, but I was so sure I was right I had to look. Sure enough I was right, sorry to say. Really spoiled it for me. Hopefully the next one will be better. I realize their are mostly light reading - but I do like a little mystery a long the way. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much religion","review":"I usually enjoy this series, but I am starting to dislike Benni. She is just too \\"sweet\\" for me. In my opinion, she loves herself. Gabe should dump her, and he's not one of my favorite people. Yes, definitely too much religion for my tastes. The writing is good, but not much of a mystery in this one either. I have really enjoy past books in the series, but it will be hard to continue when I definitely dislike the heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it.","review":"Red-staters may accuse me of something - atheism, maybe - but I could not read this book. In places Fowler's writing is beautiful, but I couldn't sustain any interest in the characters or the plot. (I kept having to remind myself that the characters lived in California -- it seemed way more isolated than any part of California I've read about). There was just plain too much churchiness, too many quotes from psalms, too many religious conversations, topped off by kids putting on a play of Pilgrim's Progress. It made me feel claustrophobic and glad (a rare thing) to be part of the Big Bad City."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last one I ever read, and I've read them all","review":"As a quilter and mystery reader, I enjoyed the previous books written by Ms. Fowler, but this one is flat, too mired in her own religious beliefs and the interplay between the characters was dull at best. I missed the realness her characters usually had and it seems she traded that for the \\"goodie two shoes\\" attitude. I won't waste my money or my time on another of these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This is a frivolous, trivial, crummy book, devoid of substantive information.

Instead, the backstory is revealed thru a scifi device -- the daughter of the murdered woman is a sound engineer who happens to plug in her equipment at the cottage her mother was murdered in -- and hears sounds and voices from the past. Naturally, it leads to the killer. Red herrings misled me and I was fooled. And everything comes together nicely at the end.I suppose the timetraveling sounds were too readily accepted. And I would think it would be difficult to figure out so clearly what was going on based just on sounds. If you're not the suggestible type, you might dwell on these and not be able to lose yourself in the story the way I did.For me, there's much that shines in this gloomy film. Structure. Dialog.

I hate to say it but The Stones dynasty has finally come to an end. Voodoo Lounge was a step down the ladder, but the guys have fallen off it now. With this shocking album, you can only cringe upon hearing songs like 'flip the switch', an absolutly terrible rock track. You have to ask the question, Where has the edge gone? Where is the percussion? The backing vocals? I don't know, but those used to songs like 'Under my thumb', 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' and 'You can't always git what you want' could curl up and die upon hearing this album. Lets face it. The Stones have stopped rollin'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burning Bridges","review":"I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to the post-Exile Stones. However, Bridges makes Emotional Rescue sound like Beggar's Banquet. I bought this CD used but am passing it onto someone else. I thought I'd first make a tape of the songs I do like, but couldn't even find 45 minutes worth of music I'd want to keep. Why \\"Baby\\" and \\"Saint\\" were the singles is anybody's guess. There's better stuff here than that. Most disappointing is Keith Richards contributions on this CD...he has absolutely nothing to say lyrically, mumbling his way through 3 embarassing numbers. The final song \\"How Can I Stop\\" makes me cringe. The best numbers are the 2 ballads and the two shortest songs. I'd settle for a good 30-minute Stones CD anyday than an hour-plus of this lame stuff.

The utilization of hip-hop/flavor of the month producers, rap crap in the middle of songs, shows the last pathetic gasp by Mick to make the Stones contemporary circa 1997. What is the point of being contemporary, if what is contemporary SUCKS?!? With the exception of Anybody Seen My Baby, there is really nothing redeeming about this album. When I first heard it 10 years ago, it struck me as contrived and tepid. Now, I was going thru a bad patch personally at the time, so I thought I'd give it another shot. NOPE. It still smacks of desperation, and was VERY unlike the Rolling Stones I know and love.

Flashes of wit and, really, more polished playing than any previous album. Hopefully, the legions of session musicians are not responsible for this. Fewer truly weak songs than any album since Tattoo You, maybe even Some Girls, but without the brazen power and knowing attitude of each album before Steel Wheels. This diminishment may not be as noticeable to non-native English speakers, since this album seems to rate more highly with foreign fans. Wish I could ignore the insipidness of Always Suffering, etc. Still, a level of ambition is there, even on the Keef songs, though give Jags the credit for branching out.

If anybody enjoys listening to this gar-bage it only shows how successful the media machine is in conditioning people. The band members are literally dilapidated human beings.

First off, the songs are terrible. It doesn't even sound like the Rolling Stones I'm used to hearing. It sounds to me like they were a little short on cash and made a new disc to make a little extra money.When you think of the Rolling Stones does this CD come to mind? If it does you have probably have never listened to Let it Bleed or Sticky Fingers. In these two CD's they sound like a totaly different band. My advice is to not by this disc and instead go buy Let it Bleed or Sticky Fingers. The difference is there.

The cliche titles say it all: \\"Out of Control,\\" \\"Too Tight,\\" \\"Flip The Switch.\\" Ugh!!!!

I think it would be fair to say that when you talk about longevity The Stones have few peers in the Rock and Roll world. Just think about how long they have been making albums/cd's (whatever you want to call them).They have been at it for over 40 years, non stop.I mean think about it these guys have staying power.All that said everything they do is still compared to their incredible run from the late 60's through the 70's. And everybody expects every album to be another Exile on Main Street.And because of this, great cd's like Bridges to Babylon do not get the respect they deserve. This is one killer peice of work by the boys, a finely crafted studio album of high quality stuff.If you do not have this album and like The Stones you are missing out on a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ...as always...","review":"This is a great album....Do not compare it with previous Stones material....just compare it with some of the stuff that is being produced these days...I think \\"Out of Control\\" alone makes the price of the CD. And..., excuse me...I really think they are sounding a LOT better with age....."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stones at their best!","review":"This is My favorite Rolling Stones album next to Hot Rocks. This CD has a song for anyone who likes music at all. \\"Saint of me\\" is one of the best songs ever done by The Rolling Stones. Other highlights of the album include \\"Flip the Switch\\", \\"Anybody Seen my Baby\\", \\"Low Down\\", and \\"Out of Control\\". Stones albums just keep getting better since dirty work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"There is some great stuff on this album. \\"Anybody Seen My Baby\\" is great, \\"Too Tight.\\" I actually didn't like \\"Out of Control\\" very much, until I saw the Stones perform it brilliantly on the No Security tour. \\"Saint of Me\\" is one of the best compositions they've ever done...but, there is that lack of a sloppy Stones feel to it. It wasn't until I looked at the musicians credits for the song that I understood WHY it lacks that feel: Keith Richards does not play on it! Well, you are missed on that song, Keith. It's still a good song. But it would have been brilliant if he'd been on it. (Although the Stones are capable of playing great rock without Keith. He didn't play on the song, \\"It's Only Rock and Roll\\" either.) Anyway, there are good slow songs on this, too. Unless you are one of those people stuck in the past, who refuses to like any new Stones music, I think you'll like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good but not their best.","review":"I'm a Stones fan and I think it's a good C.D. but I think it could be better. I would still recommend buying it for your collection.

The tail went first, then the feet, after that the ridges on the back and then the squeaky !!!! My dog loved it!!!! I paid $7 for the cuz and $7 for shipping for a total of $14. Not very economical for two days of fun......The hard rubber really isn't that hard.

Imagine that Syd Barrett wasn't insane, but just a Brit having a good time making fun of Yellow Submarine. Over all one of the best Psychedelic albums since Endless Summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flesh Number One","review":"He stole the show when he opened for R.E.M., and I've been a fan ever since. This album epitomizes Robyn Hitchcock's style: jangly, funny, refreshing, and clever. This album has a sort of mystical air to it, broken only by visualizations of fat men, floating and and then exploding, leaving debris of skin and lunch leftovers on your sleeve. For me, highlights include the fun 'Tropical Flesh Mandala', 'Balloon Man' of course, and the nice little perfect pop number, 'Flesh Number One (Beatle Dennis)' which illustrates that when Robyn sets out to write something meaningful and a tad bit commercial, he can still do it without compromising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late 80s Alternative Pop Ear Candy","review":"There are 3 songs on here that sum up 1988 when I was 23 years old: Flesh Number One, Balloon Man, and Devil Mask. I was glad I was able to see Robyn perform at the Cubby Bear in Chicago in early 1989. Michael Stipe, Peter Buck, and Mike Mills were in the house and helped out on a few cover songs. Robyn could really turn a phrase and was so prolific for a few years then. His catchy melodies, unpredictable chord changes, and bizarre song topics really spoke to me during that time. To me this was his best effort, but has been out of print for many years. Bought it here on Amazon used."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff, but i like the electric version better","review":"...on the whole. mind you, some of the acoustic ones have beengrowing on me lately, so perhaps i'm in a transitional phase orsomething. anyway, while some of the other songs have better titles (luminous rose indeed!) or tunes, \\"sleeping with your devil mask\\" will always be my favorite song from this album. though perhaps a rerelease with the other version of GoF would change my tiny mind..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith, a most complex issue.","review":"Living faith is ensconced in systems of belief.

My daughter reads it often. It was a gift for her dad. He loves it too. Anyone who loves the Georgia Bulldogs would love to have this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent primer on Chinese cooking.","review":"Consider this a must-have reference for Chinese cooking. Not only did my mother buy it at her mother-in-law's recommendation thirty years ago, but now both my sister and I have our own copies. You'd think we'd know how to cook this stuff just by hanging around the kitchen - well, that's easier said than done. This is a perfect first book for both Chinese and non-Chinese chefs (or those just trying to make dinner, like me.) Bon Appetit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have at any price","review":"I have been studying Chinese cooking of various styles for 25 years, and I have found only three Chinese cookbooks that truly are essential references. This one is in my collection of three while dozens of others have been discarded. It is a winner. Buy it. I am shocked to see prices hitting $50 to $150 for used copies, with new copies approaching $500 for a spiral bound paperback. Yes, I would buy a good used copy, even at these prices, although I paid only $17.95 in 1994. I am glad my copy is in new condition, and I will take extra care to keep it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girl Power, who are they trying to fool........","review":"Inane Lyrics, dire backing music, stilted dance routines. Welcome to the Spice Girls.This kind of blatent commercialism is totaly trashing the music industry and should be avoided at all costs.I can understand that this music appeals to young girls and boys, but the fact is they are being exploited by fat-cat record chiefs out to make a quick buck!!!Music is about self-expression, mood, soul, life and desire... Its not about image, barmy personalities and tacky product endorsements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and funky!","review":"I'm not a closet Spice Girls fan. In fact, I'm proud of it! This was the first album and a great introduction to the Spice Girls. I'll admit, sometimes it gets a little corny with all their references to friendships...but why shouldn't they write their music about it, if that's the way they really were? This CD cheers me up whenever I'm done, all the songs are wonderfully mixed and the lyrics are smashing as an early effort! I really enjoy this debut album."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE GREATEST EXAMPLE","review":"One of the greatest examples of \\"marketing-pop music\\" of our century: this is a project, not a band. This isn't about musicians playing something: it is about machines making industrialized music with one single puposse: to get rich the fast as they can, then disappear into oblivion, before people see that they have been fooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flashes in the pan","review":"Skillful marketing and risque clothing may make a commercially successful group, but take away all of that and you have a bunch of pretty pathetic, cookie-cutter dance songs. That should be enough for anyone to stay away, but throw in the fact that pre-pubescents like my 10-year-old niece are trying to emulate their sleazy, whore-like looks and slyly suggestive songs, and I have to give the big thumbs-down to this outfit. Ten years from now, someone will say to you, \\"Remember the Spice Girls?,\\" and you'll both have a good laugh and wonder, \\"What was I thinking at the time? Good riddance!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring me back","review":"This brings me back to late elementary school when I heard half of these songs at family rollerskating nights. \\"Wannabe\\" was my favorite of the Spice Girls. The Spice Girls movie is pretty good as well. 1990's music with the Spice Girls. Gotta have it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun pop music","review":"the year was 1997 and I was a hardcore fan of r&b/hip hop and wasn't interested in the spice girls at all though I thought what they were doing was kinda cute. But when I receieved this as a present I gave the album a try and realized many of their songs had an r&b/soul groove to it and I grew to love this album and will still put it on time to time for old times sake. Sure their voices aren't the best but each of them had their own identity and style and I'm sure every girl no matter how young or old could relate to at least one of the girls. Ginger and Scary were my favourites with their in-your-face attitude and funky hairdos"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nellie's review","review":"the spice girls were the best band ever, but after Geri left (aka Ginger) their music SUCKED!!!!! It's too bad that I was too young to appreciate them when they were together. the best tracks on this album are Wannabe, Say You'll Be There, Mama, and Love Thing. THis is a great CD, Spiceworld is also good, but it does not even come close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spice Girls not very good","review":"The spice girls have the worst messages possible.

Their songs are stupid and meaningless. They are a completely manufactured band and they care more about performing than their singing.

This cd was ok. I loved the Spice World cd. On this cd I liked wannabe and if u can't dance. I liked if u can't dance because of the cool spanish verse. I thought that was H-O-T-T hott.I went to their concert and the best song was their rock song sisters and mama. I usually don't like mama because it's slow and boring but everyone was into it at the concert. Overall this cd could have had better songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"The Spice Girls were fantastic on their debut album Spice. The album is very dancable and great. Lyrically it has no deph or originality but hey is not supposed to be like that.It has 10 great pop tunes that are well written and produced. Their voices are also good. It also has a great wibe to the whole thing. Though you hate or love them you can't deny that some of these songs are fantastic.Released in 1996 this album became a huge smash all over the world. The Spice Girls were everywhere. In all the magazines, on radio and on MTV the world were turned upside down by them.This album topped the charts in 33 countries and sold over 26 million copies worldwide. It contained 5 smash hits and made the spice Girls the biggest pop phenomenon ever. However they never made another album like this one and in twenty years this remains a pop classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Rocks!!","review":"Now listen up!

Makes me remember of my young self 10 years ago doing the dance to \\"Wannabe\\" every time I came across any steps.Some of my favourite songs from Spice are the mellow \\"2 Become 1\\", rnb flavoured \\"Last Time Lover\\", attitude-filled \\"Who Do You Think You Are?\\" and the lounge-ish \\"Something Kinda Funny\\".Spice Girls were such a phenomenon... It'll be difficult for any pop 'girlband' to upstage this quintent... I mean, they had everything didn't they - Posh, Scary, Baby, Ginger, Sporty with huge personalities, great dance moves and a (questionable?) fashion sense! A sure fire winning pop formula!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me of being little","review":"The Spice Girls were my favorite group when I was little. My sister and I would sings their songs quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still fantastic","review":"The Spice Girls albums have really stood the test of time. And while their debut isn't quite as good as their sophomore release \\"Spice World\\", it's still packed with great tracks. There are only 1 or 2 here that aren't hit material. That isn't to say they're bad. They just don't pop the way the rest of the songs here do. That's the only reason I'm giving it a 4. But even if it isn't a 5, it's still a classic that you should have in your collection if you're any kind of pop music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spice Girls Rule!","review":"Yeah, Spice Girls!

All the tracks are really good and catchy, except for the mega annoying Last Time Lover. I personally don't think that it would be very different without Geri on this album, so I think that their third will be bigger and better than this one and Spiceworld."},{"rating":"1","title":"the lowest point of the british pop industry","review":"you can't stop the stupid kids for buying this album. who still recognize these maids in the next 10 years? it is the same case like britney spears and Tina alguiera. pls throw away the cd from your window!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"S club 7 are better","review":"This cd is good but the spice girls are getting old. I prefer S club 7 myself. I like the tracks: Last time lover, love thing, wannabe and Naked. It's a great cd and all but s club 7 are newer and cooler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a f****ing break!","review":"This album is an album that belongs in the garbage. First of all their first single off the album Wannabe, what a joke! The lyrics in it are so childish and do not make any sense whatsoever, I mean come on \\"if you wannabe my lover you gotta get with my friends\\" Please! The song Naked, I have no freaking idea even what the point of that song is, it talks about some girl who is naked,but what else does it explain, nothing. The only promising song on this album is Say You'll Be There. Although the Spice Girls show there soft side in the song Mama, they have songs that glorify having promiscuous sex and those songs should not be the type of songs displayed in their album especially since it is targeted at such a young audience. Spice Girls have no musical talent whatsoever and should drop out of the music business, because their material isn't music at all and is and should be an embarassment to pop artists everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Metal? WTF","review":"Spice Girls are NOT underground death metal, they're nothing but radio friendly pop garbage, and I'm glad they split. That Henry guy or whatever the hell his name is must be on drugs or something thinking that this is really death metal, but it's NOT. GET A LIFE LOSER! For REAL death metal, listen to Deicide, Nile, Death, Cannibal Corpse, Carcass, Mortician, Morbid Angel, Cryptopsy, Children Of Bodom, In Flames, Suffocation, Obituary, Gorguts, Slayer, Sepultura, Brujeria, and Exhumed."},{"rating":"1","title":"They have no talent, but not a bad pop record","review":"The Spice Girls have not an ounce of musical talent between them, but all the same this is not a bad record as far as pop goes. Congratulations to their production team. The better songs here are 'Wannabe', 'Mama' and the ironically- titled 'Who Do You Think You Are'. The rest is the kind of corny, heartless, and overproduced music you'd expect. Their singing is just about good enough after hours in the studio doing re-takes, and they rarely try solo. Overall, not a bad pop album, and kids, who it was primarily made for, will still enjoy it after all the pathetic commercialism dies down. If you like good music, however, don't waste you're money on this audition-band. They're already millionairesses anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible mix of junky songs by five girls who wannabe cool","review":"I think that Spice is a terrible CD.

I used to enjoy Spice Girls but now I realize they *****."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is okay, but I've heard better","review":"This is a pretty good CD, but the lyrics are very dry. If you like dance and pop, than try Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, or 98* I like Britany Spears, buy that cd instead! It rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want, I really really want the spice girls to stop singing","review":"This cd is a travesty to the modern music world. It seems in todays society people can sing stupid lyrics over horribly annoying backing music and still call themselves a band. Listing to my little cousin making noises with his armpit is more interesting than listing to the spice girls. Please do a service to all music fans and do not buy this cd. To conclude, I would like to say to the spice girls that there are many careers out there that you could be good at. Perhaps you could go into the fashion industry or some type of real estate. What ever your choice I'm sure you'll do well. Please just do not put out music because sometimes too much of something can be terrible. Thank you and good bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"The Spice Girls stink! They have absolutely zero talent, but they cover up for it by their all-makeup looks. Their clothing describes them perfectly: risque and cheezy. No wonder Geri quit! Here is my motto for them: WE CAN'T SING AND WE CAN'T DANCE BUT WE LOOK HOT IN SPANDEX PANTS! What can I say? DON\\"T buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music, bad advice","review":"Everyone admired the spice girls for their marvellous 'girl power' attitude, which frankly put the suffragette movement of the early twentieth century to shame, and nobody can deny the catchiness of their tunes. One quibble however - what's this 'zigazigah' that they are claiming women really, really want. I have no idea what a zigazigah is or how to present it to a lady. Come on girls - be more specific!. I also lost a perfectly good ladyfriend when I attempted to 'get with' her friends as they suggested. Verdict: Good music but don't take it too literally."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Album of '97 And Many To Come!","review":"I love this CD! I love the Spice Girls! A lot of my friends think that they are stupid but they have it all wrong. They are the best group out of all of the groups! The CD has some really great tunes on it. All of the songs are great. At first I didn't like it but then I listened more and more and now I have almost all of their singles and write a Spice Girls & Geri Halliwell Newsletter! I also have a scrapbook with over 300 items in it. This is a must-have CD! I collect anything and everything spice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still sounds good years later","review":"Although it's been a few years since I've labelled myself *gasp* a Spice Girl fan, this album actually still sounds as nice as it did when I was an admirer of the quirky quintette. Each song still sounds lively and vibrant. Highlights are \\"2 Become 1,\\" \\"Say You'll Be There,\\" \\"Mama,\\" and \\"Last Time Lover.\\" Give it a listen if you're into fun music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spice Girls need mental/physical help!!!!","review":"This was just awful.

Ick!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Wannabe\\" sums up their career","review":"I'm sorry, but who really wants to listen to five Debbie Gibsons? To me, this album symbolizes all that is wrong with the music world: emptyheaded pop which is popular because it caters to the lowest common denominator. The Spice Girls don't bring anything to the table: their material isn't original or innovative, they can't dance and don't play any insturments. Plus, all of their songs are cowritten. As far as their singing goes, I'd like to see how many seconds these ladies would last in a vocal contest with En Vogue. Spice is disgustingly cloying ear candy that will leave a bitter aftertaste in about 3 years when you realize how bad it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spice Girls Rule!!","review":"This cd is awsome!

What was so bad about them? Their decent pop music? Entertaining antics? Inspiration to young females accross the globe? I just don't see it.But this review shouldn't go there. This is about their album and it's a very solid pop album at that! Forget the over-sexed, over-produced pop of Britney Spears and the like. The Spice Girls had and still own their own pop sound. It was unique and strong!Lyricly, the songs weren't any great achievements. But they were quite catchy lyrics which didn't really admit to much nor really got too preachy. As for the music itself, pure pop magic! Every song was oozing with sound. And their voices, while not being anything amazing, worked together and each had it's own charm and individuality.Songs to look for on this album include the unforgetable \\"Wannabe\\", \\"Say You'll Be There\\", the ballad \\"2 Become 1\\", and the always fun club hit, \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really miss the Spice Girls!","review":"OMG!

There are so many other great musicians out there. Ones that can actually sing. The Spice Girls are all about performance. If they didn't have their \\"nice bodies\\" and their flirtatous behavior, they probably wouldn'd have gotten very far....in the music buisiness that is. All those that are agreeing with me, not to fear; so many bands, simular to the Spice Girls (simular as in getting reconition but having no talet), have come and gone thoughout the years. Since the departure of Ginger Spice (thank god) 1 down, 4 to go. Doomsday for the Spice Girls is right around the corner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful gimmick, I'll give them that.","review":"No matter how hard little kiddies may try to think not, these teen pop artists from the late 90's to the early 00's were mostly all (are) fakes. The Spice Girls were put together by a record label and hired for their looks and personalities. They don't have vocal talent whatsoever, and they were the first to admit it. A writer wrote songs for them, a DJ and music group came in and recorded the beats and tracks, all they had to do was open their mouths using their incredibely weak voices and sing the lyrics, then let the vocal purifier to the rest. It worked, and the Spice Girls, along with the Backstreet Boys proved that talent was no longer needed to make money in the music industry.

An album you should probably avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"THROW PIES AT THE SPICE GIRLS!","review":"I hate the Spice Girls, plain and simple. They are just a T&A version of Menudo, New Edition and New Kids on the Block. They are just a put together package to prove that females can be thrown together harmoniously. Not this pack. These women couldn't carry a tune in a pick up truck and their overly simplistic songs are dismally disappointing. BOO! HISS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cd.","review":"Bought this for my sister who was really into the Spice Girls at the height of their fame. I've listened to it with her and there are a couple of good songs but I was in my late 20's when this came out so it was a bit past my interest level. Music and vocals are ok.

I thought the lyrics were annoying, uninsightful and they can't carry a tune. I gave this album a 1 because there is nothing lower and \\"Spiceworld\\" is even worse.

Not too well, I'm afraid. The insipid lyrics (\\"If you really bug me then I'll say goodbye\\" comes to mind) and terrible singing (sing? they need to sing?) make this album a joke.

The combination of factual innacuracies and the poor quality and quantity of the video adds up to an awful documentary. One expert/talking head kept confusing the songs Livin' Lovin Doll and Living Doll. Hank Marvin is credited with the guitar sound on Move It, a song that was recorded and became a hit before Hank was a member of the Drifters/Shadows. Hank simply replicated that sound after he and Bruce Welch joined the group.You know, there is a need for a definitive DVD documentary series on Cliff's career a la The Beatles Anthology.

As another sharp reviewer has mentioned, the big 5 on the cover seems to provide just enough 'nudge' to get you picking it up again and reading because after a while you realize how short five minutes is.I listen to the radio during the day and I know how long a top of the hour newsbreak lasts (about 7 minutes now) and since the news is often so depressing to listen to one more time, I found that you can easily at least do an initial read from this book. It really is nicely divided up into segments where one topic could be taken from the reading.The author's pre-reading sentence seems to focus the reading and keeps you from going off into untimely tangents.The after reading 'probing' questions really don't do much for me. They seem a bit preachy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I imagined from Peter Beckett. Great songs.","review":"I had to settle for a cassette of this Think Out Loud recording because I can't locate it on a CD. Being a long time Player/Peter Beckett fan this was the only recording of his that I didn't have (as far as I know). Thankfully the cassette was still factory sealed and was manufactured with excellent quality sound. The songs and performances are great and the production is typical of Peter's other work (which means outstanding technical audio production).

This is a great resource for primary teachers who would like explicit information on how to do a word wall and use many activities for using word families, etc. to teach phonics. But don't bother waiting for this book to be available again. Get the 3rd edition! It's worth the extra money. I purchased the 2nd edition several months ago, but when I examined the 3rd edition at the library, I noticed there seem to be many more activities and games for teaching phonics. The 3rd edition easily gets a 5+ star rating from me. It would be an invaluable resource, especially for new teachers! Making Words, by Cunningham and Hall is a good companion if you need help with the making words activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phonics We Can All Use!!!","review":"This book is full of great activities and strategies for teaching reading.

He LIES. Maybe this is why my whole language based college career never mentioned dyslexia. Sorry frank, it exists and it needs to be remediated.Pat Cunningham's materials are questionable products of whole language that have 'stolen' research based and systematic lingo claiming things I'm pretty sure they can't deliver.

Even though the old Misfits aren't about to play together anytime soon, this CD gives you a little taste of the energy at a Misfits show. However, the sound quality is so poor on some tracks that it can be distracting, but after a while you get used to it. This CD is good, but there's definately room for improvement. If your a mega Misfits fan don't hesitate to buy it, but if your only looking to get your first Misfits CD get one of their other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"you like the misfits you'll love them live","review":"the misfits are a band that are great on a studio album but know how to rock on a live one.

I say if you want all hell to break loose buy this and feel the power of one of the greatset bands ever! if you have any other misfits album get this it is a sure deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape Version Was Better","review":"Is it just me, or does this CD sound horrible in comparison to the release on actual audio tape? It sounds very tinny on CD. Furthermore, they removed the most interesting, hilarious track, the one where Danzig improvs his \\"Bobby Steele's an a-hole\\" lyrics during Teenagers from Mars. That was half the reason I bought this, and was very annoyed to find it missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killed by the sound quality.","review":"I appreciate that the Misfits' production has always been lower-quality because it was DIY and that's part of their charm. However, with the exception of being able to experience how ferocious they were live (this includes Glenn jawing to audience members between songs), the songs on the album are probably better enjoyed on their studio releases.Recommended for established Misfits fans only; I would recommend new Misfits fans check out either Walk Among Us, Earth AD, or the first Collection album."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"One more f^@%!#& time you a$$#@!* and you die!\\"","review":"Catchy tunes played by heathens. Forget SAMHAIN... MISFITS were much better. Not as musicians but slightly greater songcrafting. Simple rocking punk melodies that stick in your head. Live... these guys' presence is very strong as well. Their whole persona is right in your face just waiting to whup your butt if perhaps you step out of line. This performance shows an intensity and feverish mania enjoyed by the band as a whole I mean listen to Doyle and Jerry Only's yelling... just deranged sounding. Well, as you would expect the sound ain't too crisp (one of the reasons that I took off a star.) Band's playing is real primeval in a sloppy way, sort of a good thing. And this CD should have been twice as long. Then again, I'd probably buy anything these guys put out (as long as Danzig rejoined the band.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"only buy this if you're a misfits fanatic","review":"This cd has pretty much all their great songs, but be warned. The sound quality is beyond awful. If you're hearing any of the songs on this for the first time, you might end up being biased, as the real recordings of these songs sound much better. For misifts newcomers, i'd reccommend \\"misfits collection 1\\". Then maybe collection 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for die hard fans","review":"Probably the only way you'll get to hear the misfits live but the sound quality is horrible. I've heard live bootleg Misfits records with better quality. This isn't to say that the band played poorly, but it can be a bit of a downer if you think your going to get blown away by the Misfits playing live. Not a record to start your Misfits collection off with but still a good listen if your into the Misfits."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I just don't \\"get it\\"...","review":"...if \\"getting it\\" means not feeling ripped off paying $17 for this short, sloppy and screechy set.

Some of it is sort of listenable but some tracks,but some are down right terrible! especially Night Of The Living Dead, Astro Zombies! There are a couple of okay ones near the end. If you want these songs you can find them on albums that have a much better sound such as MISFITS COLLECTION 1 & 2 and WALK AMONG US. If you are one of those people who just has to own everything a band releases then I guess it is sort of worth having for its pretty rainbow cover!hehe"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"Everyone admits that the sound quality is awful on this recording.

If you expected explanations on the methods used, you won't get it. If you expected even rudimentary paragraphs on the sex organs of plants or a light-weight explanation of SAP flow, once again, you won't find it. If you wanted endless vague descriptions of people long dead, then this book is for you.The final few pages top of an execrable book by being blatently pro-GM, despite most intelligent people having grave misgivings on the directions being taken.I cannot recommend the book unless you already have a detailed knowledge of gardening and 17th century Britain. But then you don't need this book either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly useful, but not as a blanket","review":"This blanket set has 1 yellow, 2 green, and 2 white blankets with a very faint print- very disappointing that it pretty much looks white. I only saw them online and thought they would be useful. Although it says they are great for swaddling, don't be fooled- they are hardly big enough or heavy enough to keep a fussy baby snug. They are also extremely lightweight, which I suppose is fine if it is really warm and you just need to keep drafts off the baby. But, that also means they fold up very compact and fit easily in the smallest diaper bag. After 2 months, I have found that I use these blankets as \\"sneeze guards\\" over the car seat while shopping, rolled up to help support baby's head in the car seat, and for privacy while nursing. Bottom line is that if you are looking for a blanket to keep the baby warm, or something that looks cute, look elsewhere. But, for $10 you, too, will probably find random uses for these."},{"rating":"2","title":"my baby loves them","review":"My baby loves these blankets. They are good for swaddling a newborn and are warm enough for a spring/ summer baby. My baby won't go to sleep without them. She especially likes the green ones. (I like the pale shade of green too.)

But,the cheesy aluminum handle has broken off of both pots, and not through abuse, just through normal use, and it is NOT the plastic handle which can be replaced that breaks, it is the aluminum mounting bracket for the handle, and short of finding a tiny little elf that can weld aluminum, there is no fix for the fracture. The coffee is so good that I am tempted to buy a third anyway, but I am going to shop around a bit and see if any other manufacturers offer more sturdy construction. I believe the breakage is caused by a built in design flaw that attaches the handle too high on the pot and in only one point of contact so that the connection point can also be used for attaching the lid. This saves a little bit of materials and complication in the manufacturing process, but it is a real bummer when the handles keep falling off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this little pot","review":"I love this little pot. The Italians are right. It makes two espresso cups for lattes for me, and the taste is great.

This CD is a must have, and will be loved by all Die Hard Ben Fold Five fans. \\"For Those Ya All That Wear Fanny Packs\\" is hillarious, and there is not subsitute for this version of \\"Underground\\" due to some interplay with the crowd.

This CD rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's OK","review":"Well, either people love this album, or they hate it. I sort of lean to loving it, I guess. Tracks range from very good (\\"Eddie Walker\\"), to just downright odd (\\"For those of y'all who wear fanny packs\\").

Well, Ben Folds Five is without a doubt a talented group with beautiful songs, but this album was sloppily put together with songs that could have been kept off (\\"For those of y'all who wear fannie packs\\" are you listening?). Although not their best, even Ben Folds Five at their worst is better than the average band at their best. We love you Ben!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Throwaway","review":"These guys are my favorite group right now, but this is simply a throwaway, I guess to complete the record contract. Sound quality is variable at best and they crossed the line between spontaneous and sloppy. I'd hate for someone new to the group to pick this up first because it's a poor representation of how good they really are. However, it does nothing to deter my expectations that they will put out great work in the future. But this one -- put it in the category of \\"For Hard Core Fans Only\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get real, guys! This album is pretty lame.","review":"Ben Folds Five is a super group with so much talent. So why put out an album like this that's basically just repackaged material from other albums?

Get refocused, guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst CDs EVER","review":"I consider myself a casual fan.I loved \\"whatever and ever amen\\" and looked forward to this. What a dissapointment! Not one reason to let it take up valuable space on my rack. I think they put this crap together to test the loyalty of the fans. If we bought it, they'd stay together. If not, they'd split up. They're capable of excellence. But don't judge them by this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD should be added toward the end of your Ben Folds Five catalog collection...","review":"I like the songs on this CD but a good number of them are for the most part just raw earlier versions of tunes which were issued on the debut CD titled \\"Ben Folds Five\\" and/or \\"Whatever and Amen\\". I am pleased with the CD as It first exposed me to the tune \\"Eddie Walker\\" and that bent tune \\"For Those Of Ya'll Who Wear Fanny Packs\\"..this alone made it worth the purchase price but I would recommend purchasing it after one has already acquired some of the other CDs in either Ben Folds Five or Ben Folds Solo Catalog (with the exception of Fear of Pop which is really really bent! but good! but still bent!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Am listening to it right now!","review":"I got started as a listener the ideal way, with WEA as my first BFF CD, but I became a fan when I saw them on the telebi, performing a live concert.

This album could have been released to share the live experience with new followers like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"BFF does it again","review":"Okay, this is a CD fill of B-sides and live performances. Know this before you buy the CD!! If you are just starting to listen to BFF, get a different CD... If you love these guys, GET THIS!! It is an excellent collection of stuff if you just can't get enough BFF. Eddie Walker is stunning, Fanny Packs is Hilarious, and most of the live performances are worth your listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"People need to stop comparing this to their studio albums.","review":"I bought this the day it was released and found (and still find) it to be a fascinating look at the creative process and drive behind BFF. If you bought the first two albums and dig them, you won't be disappointed, but don't buy this first. The key to enjoying this collection is to take it for what it is: naked baby photos. It's not SUPPOSED to sound as good as their studio albums. It's kind of like a scrapbook of demos and live performances in the vein of the Beatle's anthology project. My only regret is that \\"Champagne Supernova\\" and \\"Mitchell Lane\\" were not included, as I only have them on cassette. Bottom line: This album is extremely good for the type of album it is. If you have it and don't like it, read the liner notes and stop dissing it just cause it doesn't have that bloated, overrated throwaway \\"Brick.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding 3rd release","review":"The third excellent release from this criminally underrated LA band, Hex continues in the vein of its predecessors, but more riff driven and with less of the over the top Hammond sound so prevalent on those albums. Highly recommended to fans of progressive hard rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore-fest, USA","review":"First of all, \\"alot\\" isn't a word.But that's neither here nor there.What's here AND there is this band. Bigelf never fail to sound like a dilapidated carousel sputtering out its last breath. That might be okay for one song per album (just like The Beatles and Saigon Kick used to do), but for every stinking song to sound this way is unforgivable. There are A LOT (two words) of people out there who enjoy this kinda thing, and I think that's great. \\"There's someone for everyone and Tommy's love was Becky\\" (you Kenny Rogers fans know what I'm talkin' about) BUT this is not for me.

That's how fast and how far this one drops.I think it's funny that Real Wild Child and Lust For Life appear in numerous TV ad campaigns these days, including such un-Iggy businesses as 1-800-FLOWERS and Royal Carribean Cruises.

Now throw in the fact that Bowie has said the 80's were without a doubt the lowest point in his career and he absolutely hates the junk he made. That should give you a little insite on this album. Ig needed to appeal to as many people as he could with this album, and I think he did a great job at that. It's pure junk food for the mind and spirit. Perfect for the time's it was created. Actually, Iggy, in my opinion, has never recovered from this uninspired album. With few exceptions, most music Iggy has made since Zombie Birdhouse has catered to a fan with a bland palate. I had such hopes for Skull Ring. Disappointed again. Don't bother with this album if you like a wild Iggy, he's just a parody of himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iggy Pop Has Never Been Better","review":"A wonderful collaboration between Iggy Pop and David Bowie. My girlfriend and I adopted \\"Real Wild Child\\" as our theme song, in the 80's. This is a terrific album with a lot of great tunes.

It was the first of the series that I read, but now I've added book one, Vengeance, and book two, Retribution, and am about to start on the newest, Denial. Fonesca fascinates me. Through the four books, which probably cover less than two years in his life, he slowly builds a new network of family and friends and even a love interest. He solves mysteries, taking jobs as a finder of missing persons and as a process server. He gets into danger. He does not commit acts of violence. He lives simply, but thinks deeply. He believes he does not \\"feel\\" deeply anymore, due to the tragic loss of his wife, but his actions prove that he does. Kaminsky writes a ton of books, with five different series heroes, and all of them are worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy addition to the series","review":"I definitely ordered this as a Lew Fonesca novel and enjoyed it as such.

I've seen many horror flicks way more gorier than this one, but the story that this flick is about rates up there high on the SICK-O-METER!!! On some parts in this film, I felt like I was committing a crime simply because I was watching it haha. What else is next?....seriously! I can definitely see this become a cult classic. I know folks throw those two words around a lot, but I mean it! With what this story is about, the amount of gore depicted in this flick, matches evenly. Even a gorehound like me knows when to be smart on how much gore needs to be thrown around. It all depends on what the story is about. 'Header', in my opinion, is definitely a video nasty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time","review":"Horrible. Words cannot describe how badly this film was made. I am usually pretty lenient with horror films, but this was beyond disgusting. The acting was very bad, some of the dialogue and plot made no sense.

The story is disturbing but all around the movie was really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust me. Take a pass on this one.","review":"Horror fans. Trust me. This is the worst I've seen in a while. Acting is at a Grade School level. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the goal of this failure is to answer the question, What is a header? I have to agree. After about 30 minutes I could take no more and ejected it. I'm truly mystified how any viewer could have given this a positive review. I can only guess they were somehow moved by the concept of a \\"Header\\". Again, Trust me.

It's like nothing else and utterly magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ummm...","review":"The only reason this gets 5 stars is because I love Edward Lee (who is one of the cops by the way, the other cop being Jack Ketchum). The book was great, but the movie was just ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless, scare-less punchline to a bad joke","review":"This movie only exists to serve as the feeble punchline to the unfunny joke, \\"What's a header?\\" Even after the dim ATF hero has seen two women's bodies with holes drilled into their brains and semen dripping out, he's still desperately trying to find someone who can explain to him what a \\"header\\" is. Unfortunately, we in the audience find out long before he does - which is typical of this movie, in which there is NO suspense. No terror either - we don't care about any of the anonymous victims who get \\"headered\\", so the indignities visited on their bodies are just gross/disgusting, not frightening. The writing - and the delivery of the terrible writing by the decent actors - is a mess. Many scenes of this movie are so dimly lit that you can barely make out what's happening (nor would you care, if you could.) If you get off on dead-baby jokes, you might find this movie fitfully amusing - otherwise, steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found Fried Maine Clams","review":"Here in Texas I can get Maine clams and Lobster, but not the fried clams.

The chapters are like scenes,short and without extra words. The plot is weird in a good way. A serial killer controlled by a woman so that she can get revenge on people who she believes have harmed her. Friedman writes in short chapters so you can stop and go whenever you get a few minutes. These also help the pacing of the book. The ending is totally unexpected and makes you wonder what kind of imagination it takes to dream up these things. Definately read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an awsome ride!","review":"I read this book in 2 days!! It started out great and I couldn't put it down until the end. The characters are great.

Great songs, thoughtful lyrics, and the cello (and occasional mandolin) don't really start to explain the atraction. For Atlantans, this music sounds like home. The Brothers are too smart to be country, too hopeful for rock, and too realistic for pop. There is not a bad song on this album. My wife and 16 year old daughter sing it from cover to cover. \\"Love is moving through this world\\" is their favorite with a beautiful cello line in the refrain backed by verses steeped in the real world. I am blown away by \\"I'm in over my head\\" as it opens with a gritty comment on the nature of sin and then turns into a desparate prayer. Whether your laughing with \\"Can't let go\\" or grooving with \\"Opening up\\" there is something fresh and unexpected in every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"5��5��","review":"My friend got me this book for my b'day.

After reading this book, I have total faith that the sequel will be a smash. Heck, I think this might top HP over the next few years. I love how Eng uses modern idioms in his medieval writing. His characters have personalities I've seen before, but he presents it in a unique way.

When I looked a little further I noticed that while the reviewers who ranked the book as not very good were obviously real people who had done many other reviews, the majority of the good reviews came from screenames that had never done another book review on Amazon before or since.

Anthony Quinn gives a restrained performance. He seems to totally misunderstand the meaning of his vast experiences but his good natured spirit seems to guarantee his spiritual salvation. This film demonstrates man's ability for infinite cruelty toward his own species. Quinn's performance gives witness to all these events of horror through the eyes and mind of a child yet he understands the true meaning of right and wrong. Ultimately in the end, Quinn must pay for his worldly transgressions. This is a rare and thought provoking film."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as \\"Gladiator\\" -- Inspiring biblical epic !","review":"I am so glad this DVD has been made, and I've waited for a chance to buy it. After viewing \\"Gladiator\\" w/R. Crowe, I'd say the arena scenes in \\"Barabbas\\" are just as good. There's more than just action; this movie is interesting because it portrays the period of history when more & more people become aware of Christianity. Barabbas sees Christ's following as it grows, then begins to wonder why he was spared in Jesus' place. The tale of Barabbas is an oddysey, and Quinn does a fine job. His journey is as good as his destination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good film for those interested in a story not effects...","review":"I like this movie because of its meeningful message.

A group of survivors trying to avoid Christian assassins armed with cross shaped daggers who were slaughtering everyone they can find to save them from the demons which are supposed to take over the world so the slaughtered can go to heaven. Then just before midnight when demons were about to emerge the nut cases gave each other poison pills (they will go to hell if they commit suicide according to the Christian bible). Obviously these people trying to escape the murderers hadn't watched to many horror movies and split up instead of sticking together and got killed one at a time except... I don't want to spoil the ending so go watch it--Its definitely scary. Some scenes were confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Boring, Scary.........How Bad It Was.","review":"Purchased this movie based on several rave reviews I read on the net.

Complete bore, don't waste your pennies or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and offensive... and not in a good way","review":"This movie has no redeeming quality about it. I'm not a religious person, but was offended at how they used a religion to write a plot... and a horrible one at that.I can sum up how horribly offending this movie is with the scene that made me eject the disc. In the name of God, a pregnant woman volunteers to get stabbed to death in her stomach. The next scene is her and her husband dead and bloody with the unborn dead bloody fetus put on top.Even if not offensive, the movie has some of the worst acting I've ever seen (and I've seen some bad movies) and a plot that goes nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging horror/thriller","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by End of the Line. It's rather unheralded, but demonstrates professional production values and competancy greater than your typical low budget horror flick. I'm somewhat surprised that this idea hasn't been used more in horror: religious zealots killing folks. Sounds familiar stated that way, but I haven't really seen it done on this scale before. A few crazies here and there, sure, but this is a possibly global, well-oiled machine. I was involved with the characters and plotting, and liked the varying levels of faith in certain characters. The pacing bogs down somewhat in the middle, the demons are fairly cheesy, and personally, I could have done without the gratuitous fetus, but over all, I think End of the Line a solid, very watchable film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"Despite the claims in the Editorial Review Description of this video, there is virtually nothing new here, and certainly no new \\"methods of training\\" or schedules. In fact, there's about thirty seconds on sets and reps toward the beginning of the video, much of which is contradicted when Glass talks about individual exercises. There's nothing on body part splits or how many days to work out, nothing on intensity, and nothing on weight selection. Basically, the video consists of the demonstration of one-to-two exercises per body part, with Glass offering a few helpful tips on exercise performance. The production values are low, and the video is simply not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I bought these for my daughter after paying 3 dollars a piece in her band class.

I had to work much more with my Vandorens to get the instant high quality playability from them.Word of note though. This is a fairly hard reed and is perhaps more suitable for players with a more closed mouthpiece, which means the gap between the reed and the face of the mouthpiece is narrow. Those with a wider gap may prefer either a softer reed or perhaps a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rico royal reeds.

Still, HS remains the best Manson Family movie ever made. It doesn't obsess over the bloody murders themselves, as much as it recreates the time-frame, delving into the subsequent events, court case, etc. The only movie I could compare it to would be Fincher's ZODIAC.

He explains the sitting postures, mind-breath exercises and meditation which make up Zen.

If you call Medela, they will tell you that you should only use the pump on one person for sanitary reasons. But you can buy new horns, bottles, membranes, tubes etc... at minimal cost directly from medela or sometimes your local drug store. The breast milk never reaches the inside pumping mechanism. It goes into the horn and drips directly into the bottle.

It is difficult to assemble in order to get a good seal, and even then, I was only able to get a small amount of milk pumped, and it took too much time. I even called the helpline and was simply told that \\"this pump does not work for everyone.\\" I would recommend the Avent Isis over this one.

I was able to express maybe a half ounce of milk after pumping for 20 minutes, after which my hand and my nipples were sore. Tried several more times, no luck. Threw it out and got the Avent Isis, which worked a little better, but still not that great.

After reading reviews, I realized that I am not the only one that this has happened to.

Well, I'm going to be out of the house a little more often and decided I should start pumping and storing and just wanted to do a little pumping at night before bed.

You end up having to transfer the milk to a bottle anyway if you're going to feed instead of store that milk that day.

When it does work, it takes about 5 min to pump 1-2 oz. The biggest problem is that the valve falls out into the breast milk most times while pumping resulting in no suction. At home it is an inconvenience, but on-th-go it's unsanitary. I have to stick my fingers in the milk to pull out the valve. Once it is wet, it doesn't seem to stay in. I am still trying to work with it, but it seems that it makes more sense to travel with the electric pump.

The customer service 800 number you'll need to call to get the new product ID is a business-hours-only number and you have to be sitting at your computer to make any use of it (at work? not at home in front of your computer? too bad, can't help you). And if you go to the Intuit support page and get text help from a person there (it's like using a two-person chat room) they'll give you another phone number, but it's a toll number and you'll be on hold a long, long time. So as long as you don't let the program crash or delete your product ID number by scanning for viruses or spyware, you'll probably like it fine.

There is substance here, certainly not a negative point, but you must focus all your aural attention on the up-and-down flow of this post-grunge explosion to find it. It is strange, however, to look back and not help but notice that Elliot and Sam's newer works seem to have mellowed out, as tracks like \\"Get Lucky\\" prove.

My brother was an elephant once. But about the album, the Misfits draw influences from across the rock n' roll spectrum, from straight ahead 1950s rock, to balls-to-the-wall 1970s punk. Glenn Danzigs mournful yet full fleshed vocals lend to the overlying fright-night feel of each song.This is by far the best of the Misfits, combining all the goods from 3+ albums.

It truly covers the spectrum of the band and is basically all A+ material.They are great for the teen angst phase of life and still always sound good in heavy traffic. A band that gets you moving in the morning.This album is the best possible way to reclaim a piece of your youth, fuel the fires of teen or middle age, or you can just drop it in to decipher the spooky lyrics.

I wanted to see examples of the technology that enables SOA, walk-thrus of standards such WSPL.This book has none of that. To me it is a book of high-level lists of lists and every section I've read leaves me wondering what it said.

This book is at about 75,000 feet in terms of concept and is nowhere near a first step at a real-life implementation. I'm sure these gentlemen could do it, and I'm not doubting their credentials or capabilities, it is just that this book is not even a modest attempt at stating anything but the obvious at what problems SOA attempts to solve!Sorry!

And it IS a debut album. No less - but no more either.Most of the songs are very much alike, so after a third of the CD, you've heard it all. It only reaches historical value for Extreme fans (like me).There's a little too much of childish lyrics about schoolboys which, OK, gives the album a kind of theme. But luckily, both the band and its music grew up after having released Extreme. And they grew up to the better!The highlights on Extreme are the rock ballads like Watching, Waiting and Rock A Bye Bye, and in other songs, there are some pretty good guitar solos as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of it all ...","review":"If anybody out there wonders if Nuno Bettencourt's musical style (or everybody else in the band) wasn't influenced by Van Halen, then this album will be your answer.

Often in other Ozu films like 'Tokyo Story', and 'Early Summer' - we would see flashes of children from a strikingly noncondescending and, often times, humerous perspective. Now in 'Good Morning' we have an almost entire film devoted to childhood - and events that are important in the lives of these kids and their parents and family. Like all Ozu films it is gorgeously shot and in a bright colorful style full of wonderfull compositions. It is not as masterul as 'Tokyo Story' of 'Floating Weeds' - but it gives us a better understanding of Ozu and how he saw the world - very charming film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good morning","review":"I did not care for the style & time period of cinematography. too bland characterization, but well done for how portrayed & presented.

Three chapters and some after-dinner scraps of writing and that's it?

And what's with Maturin's homicidal fascination with honor and dueling?

As noted by other reviewers, a significant fraction of the \\"book\\" is quite simply illegible. The story line, surely to have been improved, is near-incomprehensible. I was more than satisfied to know that Jack had finally and at last been awarded his Admiral's flag at the end of the 20th installment of this wonderful multi-volume novel. In fact, at the time of O'Brian's death I noted to friends that the series could not have ended on of finer note. Now we have this. It offends the memory of O'Brian and all those who love his work. Note: my one star is simply to acknowledge an adequate afterword by Richard Snow; although I suppose if he'd been someone of real character he would not have associated himself with this project.

While it is unlikely that Duranti meant the narrator or those around her to be air-heads or air-head codependents, the brightest character in the book is a stray puppy who eats, sleeps, and poops.The group voted the book a miserable 1.2 bookmarks with the humble footnote that if this is Duranti's latest book she should call it quits for writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enduring free jazz landmark","review":"There probably wasn't much more to be done in free jazz after this disc came out in the late '60s. The fact that Shorter and his band wrung so much expressiveness and even bits of tunefulness out of this chaotic, abrasive genre at that late date is a tribute to their talent. The band included guitarist Sonny Sharrock and future Weather Report bandmates bassist Miroslav Vitous and percussionist Airto Moreira. John McLaughlin also contributes his considerable presence on one track.

My only complaint is the crappy production. I hate when the guitars start out loud and proud, and then when the rest of the band comes in they (very noticably) drop the guitar volume. It ends up sounding really amateur on the production end. All that said, this album still kicks major and is well worth a listen if you like good hard rock with an attitude, 80's style.

Listening without the title in mind, this is pretty likeable.But this is not the untamed beast you would think by reading the press on Free Jazz.

An unforgetable portrait of courage and sacrifice on the part of the mom, and of courage and tenacity in the children. This movie speaks to the meaning of life (which is never seen in modern media)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eleanor: Crown Jewel of Aquitaine","review":"This is a jewel of a story! This is definately one of the best books in the Royal Diaries series. It is well reserched and interesting. I really loved the main character, Eleanor. She was so strong-willed and ambitious and you could really see her personality throughout the book. It was a wonderful way to read about one of history's greatest queens."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CAPTIVATING ROYAL MEDIEVAL ESSAY","review":"This beautifully outlined essay makes a fine read. Right from the first page, its dynamic pattern remained consistent until the last. It is an interesting medieval story whose royal spices are hard-to-resist. Most adults are likely to enjoy it, despite its juvenile outlook.However, adult readers would notice that the story was overtly abridged. Its 112-paged length ensured that considerable details were omitted. Still, it would be unfair to hold this shortcoming against it: its author designed it for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eleanor of Aquitaine","review":"I think the book was the best! Gregory gave a wonderful describtion of how Medeival life was like. In the book Gregory tells of how Eleanor's life might have been like. She describes Eleanor's travels with her father and her interactions with her sister. She wonderfuly depicts festivals and holidays. All in all she does a superb job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eleanor of Aquitaine-- A great book!","review":"This is a great book! I have read most of the books in this series, inclding Cleopatra, Eleanor, Isabel, Elizabeth, Mary of Scots, Marie Antoinette, Anastasia, and others.

I bought this book, and when I read it, I figured it must be a favorite Royal Diary for me.It tells about Eleanor, who keeps a diary in her childhood. It tells of how she becomes Duchess of Aquitaine after her father's death, her marriage to the French Royal Prince, and how she becomes Queen of France and Duchess of Aquitaine at he age of 15.Great book. I strongly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a bit gross","review":"Good and interesting, but it had some uneaded gross parts so I don't reccomend it for anyone under 5. Anyway it wasn't boring or untrue in any big way, So I did like it and suggest that for someone new to this series to read it as a 4th or 5th. It's a story of a 13 or 14 yr. old Duchess and how she marries the future King of France after her Father's death."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit interesting, but not very...","review":"After reading Cleopatra by the same author, I didn't have very high hopes for this book. However, while not great by any means, it was mildly interesting. For one thing, I did not know much about Eleanor before the book, and the author did give us a feel of what life would be like in France in 1136. There also was a plotline, but the book ended in a strange place. Not a bad book to read, but not great eithier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vesta 4 U","review":"After hearing about the death of Vesta Williams I realized that I only had recordings of her performing with other musicians-nothing from just her.

Annie has no background in forensic art, no experience in the interview process and the witness is a traumatized child.The sketch she presents to the police unleashes fears and doubts in Annie. Is the picture really the killer or has she bungled the process and led everyone astray?The danger is imminent and it is very real.

Sorry, but this was completely unbelievable in every way. Trust me folks, homicide detectives don't discuss cases with civilians and don't drag them along to interviews. Ms. Collins' lack of credibility in her subject matter is further revealed in Sybee's not guilty in the murder trial. If a person is in the commission of a felony such as drug dealing and a person is killed, that person is just as guilty as the triggerman. Annie is an idiot who magically seemed to win in physical combat against the bad guy but lost to a two year old, who incidently had perfect diction.Ms. Collins appears to have very little general education. Perhaps her knowledge of Christianity is better. In that case, maybe she should stick to Christianity as the sole subject. She's not winning converts with her uneducated, ignorant fiction writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not particular good","review":"The sound quality is not good.

I recommend trying it from a grocery store before committing to a large Amazon purchase unless you happen to like bitter tea.

However, this latest installment makes is apparent that Brooks is out of good ideas (flying ships doesn't quite cut it) and continues to repackage even his own stuff. After reading this book, I draw a line in the sand and refuse to spend any more time with Brooks' writing. I can only recommend this with the disclaimer to expect nothing fresh from Brooks here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe I'm biased but.......","review":"I've been reading Terry Brooks novelles for a long time and though I've read all of the original Shannara series and Ran with the Demon all the way to Angel Fire East (excuse the puns) I find this book his best. Generally, throughout all of the Sahnnara books the character development was slow and many times I have wanted to leave the books, the same with John Ross and Nest. Where the previous stories held your breathe in the last 3-5 chapters, this books gets going and doesn't stop.It's adventurous, humorous, and the reference to the orginal series is good/helpful but not laborious. Thanks Mr. B for coming back to the girl that brung ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fontana is awful","review":"This was the first audiobook I ever abandoned on account of the narration. It's already abridged, which is just... pointless, but I dealt with it through the Heritage series. Fontana's idea of character voicing, however, comes across like a middle-schooler making fun of girls, or doing his best evilly-evil voice.Cursory googling suggests this book was the only work he ever got in the industry, and with good reason. The worst part about productions like this one is that they just sit there, discouraging a decent version from ever being made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start to a trilogy","review":"I have to say (as I am currently reading the 3rd book in this trilogy) that this is my favorite \\"series\\" by Terry Brooks. By far he has come a long way from his other Shannara books. The other series I read kind of out of lack for something better. However, book one of this series set me up, I plowed through book 2 and now I am stuffing my face with the third book. If you have read his other Shannara stuff and liked it you will be happy that he got even better. Also, if you have never read Shannara, this isn't the ideal place to start but it still stands alone as a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A promising beginning","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable book with lots of action and plot twists. The characters vary considerably. I find Bek and Quentin unbelievably tedious and identical to the bland characters in other books. The parts focusing on them were rather dull. However others such as Walker, Truls and the Rovers more than made up for this and I would definately recomend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad at all","review":"Well well well..... Mr. Brooks is at it again!!His most recent outing in the Shannara series is rather good, i must say. Although a bit draggy at times, the book magically sustained my interest throughout.The druid, Walker is back togeter with good ol' Truls Rohk. Fans of them take note.All in all, this books shows that Terry hasn't lost his magic touch yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVERAGE STORY WITH NO SUPRISES AND RATHER BORING","review":"The Shannara books have become so generic and formulatic that there are no surprises, no twists, nothing to make it interesting. His characters are generic, usually young adult, innocent who must go into the big world. How about some variety? Now that the Shannara world has been completly explored several books back, the mystery and adventure is gone. So now, in the book we go outside the four lands across the ocean, but do we find excitement, mystery and the unexpected? OF COURSE NOT! The characters go to three islands where some type of guardian attacks them, but the guardian is defeated so quickly and then they move on, so there's no chance of developing the story or sense of adventure. Terry rushes the characters across the ocean to get to mysterious land at the end where the second book and hopefull the story will start."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have read all of Terry Brooks' novels...","review":"and this one did not disappoint. The characters are deep, and the plot never slips. I couldn't wait until this one was released, had it pre-ordered at a local bookstore! If you just started with this Brooks series, go back and read all of his books, from the original Sword of Shannara, and the Lost Kingdom series right up to current."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost the magic.","review":"I have been reading the Shannara books since I was 12. Having read the latest offering all I can say is that it is probably about time for Terry Brooks to retire. The story is old, the characters have been done. Let us remember you for the great author you once were, instead of the hack you have become."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Epic Fantasy","review":"After reading Stanek's Ruin Mist books I was looking for something to read and someone recommended Voyage of Jerle Shannara. I had previously read the Sword of Shannara books so thought maybe I'd try this. Let me say, it was just what I was looking for in an epic fantasy series. Terry Brooks creates not just characters, but he includes various customs and cultures unique to themselves. I am reading the Antrax now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Basics!","review":"A return to vintage Terry Brooks. After the Good and Evil series, which was good, The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara is a return to Greatness. A return to great character development -- Alannon is reborn in Walker (He is the man)! The rovers (Big and Little Red) really came to life in my imagination. A \\"must read\\" for Brooks' fans.Conclusion:I have ridden the Jerle Shannara!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent story","review":"I wish I could write like Terry Brooks. This is another excellent story in the Shannara series. The only bad part is waiting for the next book in the series to be printed, but it'll be worth it. If you've read the his previous Shannara stories this one is a must. If you haven't, you need to."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's BACK!","review":"After some pleasant detours through The Word and The Void, and an entertaining prequel of how it all began, Terry brings the Four Lands and her people back to vibrant life! If you thought Shannara was \\"dead\\" or \\"worn-out\\", think again. The strengths of the previous books, (character development and relationships, the puppeteer-like machinations of the Druid(s), and... magic!) are woven together even stronger here than before, while much of the rambling descriptions that could try the reader's patience have been tightened. The pace is much more even, with the \\"privileged\\", Druid's-eye information being doled out in smaller, more frequent doses, rather than the large \\"dumps\\" that I felt marked the earlier books. The plot, while unresolved here, seems as if it is going to resolve in a more complex fashion than the \\"small group finds magical object, defeats impossible odds and saves the world\\" endings we're used to. Thumbs up on what I think is Terry's strongest effort to date!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Brooks new book definitly one of best works","review":"When I first read the first book The Sword Of Shannara I wondered about more land across the blue divide. When I read this book my questions were answered when an elf was found in the blue divide by one of the famed wing riders of past books. The elf is carrying a map and has his eyes and tongue removed. He happens to be the current kings older brother who went on a mission some 20 years ago looking for old magic. When the New king found this he agreed to let Walker Boh (now just walker) lead an expedition on airship to get the treasure. He takes a strange boy with unknown powers named Bek Rowe as a cabin boy. When the Ilse witch hears this plan she starts her own expedition and shadows Walkers expedition. And right up to the fall off at the end, and then in typical Brooks style he cuts off to next the next in the series. This book is great and worth every minute of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best of Terry Brooks","review":"Don't get me wrong...I love Terry Brooks (most of my copies are autographed), but I don't think this is the best of his books.In reading past novels, you get the impression of a man with a vision of an alternate world. You get the feeling that he took his time to masterfully craft the story. Not here.In a few places in the book, I get the feeling that the author didn't thoroughly reread the work. I don't want to give away anything from the story, but in one instance, a character \\"absorbs\\" some sickness and passes out. In the next paragraph, someone is going to talk to them. How can this happen with that person being unconscious? Maybe I am nitpicking, but I got this sense in more than a couple of places.I would still read this book and recommend it for all Terry Brooks fans, but this is not a book for the first time reader of Terry Brooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"As a fan of the previous Shannara books, I was very disappointed with this one. The plot is weak, the characters undeveloped and the \\"Cliff hanger\\" ending was predictable. It seemed the author was in a hurry when he wrote it as everything was rushed and glossed over. Not recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 1/3 of a book (maybe only 1/4)","review":"I thought this book was a great summer read. It had a good pace, an interest concept and likable, if not complex, characters. My only disappointment was that it isn't an entire book, it is just a teaser for the books to come. The book does not have an ending; the book just runs out of pages. I highly suspect that Mr. Brook's book deal states that he needs to write 451 pages per book and that is what he did.The Isle Witch is a good start but if you have a memory like me wait until all 3 or 4 installment have been written, so you can read the whole story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the book, but. . .","review":"I am a fan of Terry Books, and I like this book, but: 1. The book is titled the \\"Ilse Witch\\", but the character is missing from much of the book. The book is very entertaining when she is present, but drags when she is not. 2. It is frustrating to read a book without a strong ending. Of course, this is a novel which introduces a series. Thus, you expect loose ends. Even so, I cannot imagine a new writer ever getting this book published, because it is an incomplete work by itself. It is only because of Terry Brook's reputation and fan base that he can get away with a novel like this. 3. I agree with other reviews that at certain points, plot events and character motivations are not logical.When Terry Brooks gets going, there is no one better. I anxiously await the next book in the series. But please, Terry, give us the real deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An idea whose time has come and gone--a long time ago","review":"I got this preview from Brooks' webmaster. I was excited to see if his exposure to the creativity of George Lucas might have shaken loose a sense of humor in Brooks, something he has always been severely lacking. The answer: not a chance.Brooks has built a career by \\"borrowing\\" the creativity of others--Tolkien [Shannara], Pullman [Running with the Demon], Lucas [Star Wars] and now Robin Hobb and some of the other fae-fantasists. While the characters are certainly a little different [for which I awarded an extra star] the writing is the same clunking, lackluster prose he has always had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats Happened To Terry?????!!!!","review":"Terry Brooks has captivated me through his Shannara series, until now!! The Isle Witch lacks the flow of his former novels. It also seems to have been cut to the point where you read and expext more detail on many things but simply dosen't happen. The charachters are not so memorable as his last books made immortal. Truls Rohk is the only charachter I find interesting, the only \\"cool\\" charachter in the book. Terry Brooks didn't take the time to produce a proper novel, or simply is tired of the series and his imagination and patience has all but left. I am most displeased wih Terry's sudden change and lack of forethought to his writing. Terry went from a top writer to a writer simply \\"pumping out a book\\". He should be ashamed of this novel, apologize to his fans and strive for the magic he spun from the depths of his imagination that the Shannara series had once been!!!!!!! Shame on you Terry. YOU KNOW BETTER!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Giant Eels?! Woot!!!","review":"I'd never been a fan of Brooks or Shannara; captivating prose is one thing if it steals the scene in the first few pages, but sustaining the thrill throughout the book has never been a strength of Brooks, and in this case the book falls flat on its face. Giant eels? Oh please.The humdrum, cliched 'gathering of the Company' and the hollow characterization play second fiddle to the laughable plot twists however. I bought this book after reading the excerpt, hoping that the author's style had gained some flavor and maturity over time. As it turns out I just wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brooks doesn't know when to stop","review":"The original Shannara were good, Heritage was a nice read, but what is this? Not bad by itself, but read one of his older books and the entire book seems impossible and idiotic. Sorry, but does Brooks know how to not contradict himself?I enjoyed this book, but only because I'm Shannara fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something is missing . . . .","review":"The book is missing an ending. I can appreciate that Brooks writes series and that no one book usually wraps up a complete story. But this is taking the teaser approach a bit too far for a book this long. It is obvious that Brooks is taking his fan base for granted and has done us a disservice. I will read the sequel, but I might not even start the next story line Brooks peddles. I'll take Raymond Feist over this any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak.","review":"I am a fan of Terry Brooks but this was very disappointing.

It is very well written, and would have received 5 stars from me, except that I loved \\"Wishsong of Shannara\\" more!!

I purchased the book as soon as it came out and finished it in two days. I was devastated to learn the next book wouldn't be published until September 2001. I won't reveal any of the content or plot of the book; suffice it to say that it is excellent; no, beyond excellent. My only complaint is there is too long a wait between books! (Write faster, Mr. Brooks!) As far as I'm concerned, there are only two science fiction/fantasy authors worth reading - - Tokien and Terry Brooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucketh","review":"Sorry to all you who grew up reading Shannara, and thinking this is what passes for fantasy. I recommend you look backwards in time [Charles Williams, J R R Tolkien] or forward [George Martin, Robin Hobb, Elizabeth Haydon] if you want to see some talent in the field.

Ok, where to begin? I read the book and hated it!! It was so dull and boring. It did get good but, not for very long before you fell asleep again. And to get to the good part you had to read at least a 100 pages into it. Only if your really commitied to the book you'll stay through it. It reminds me of something I would be forced to read for school. I wouldn't reccommend this book. Overall in my opinion it was dry, dull,boring, and not memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"product size...","review":"wish they had a picture of the actual size of the product... this is to big for my ferrets and i need to chop it so they can eat it ... other then that the product is fine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk food for ferrets","review":"My second ferret was being fed this food when I got him. His coat was dull, thin, and rough. I switched him over to my mix (8in1 Ultimate Crunchy, Natures Variety Instinct Duck, and Wellness Core) and he's doing much better.Pros: Ferrets seem to like the taste and it's an interesting shape.Cons: The ingredients are less than ideal- chicken meal, ground corn (bad), brewers rice(bad), corn gluten meal(bad), animal fat(fat is good, but this is unspecified so not ideal), corn oil, dried egg, molasses (why is there a sweetner?) beet pulp (filler).... and so on. Out of the first 6 ingredients, only two are able to be digested. Waste of money in my opinion.Spend a little more on a quality food. You will feed less and your ferret will poop less too."},{"rating":"2","title":"INUYASHA: Sesshomaru keychain","review":"Bought it for someone and liked it very much.

There are not experiments crowding each page, just clear electron models that clearly explain electricity theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but left wanting...","review":"I really liked this book and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a quick sci-fi read. I found myself wanting more, and hopefully there will be more in this story line.Barnes looks into the future with a feeling of validity like that of Kim Stanely Robinson in his Mars Trilogy. I've often wondered myself about some of the ideas presented in this book.The characterization was well done. My only complaint was that their motives were sometimes confusing to me. Their actions made sense, but only to a degree.Overall the book was a good blend of modern ideas with a tip of the hat to sci-fi classics like \\"1984\\" and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". To some people the society presented would truly be a Utopia, but to most it would be somewhat of a nightmare.At the end I wanted more to the story, but hopefully I'll get to see it.But I still want a good description of what a diskster is..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a philosophical treatise with window dressing","review":"From all the reviews I read of this book, I was concerned that it would be short on action and long on talk. After all, the setup is not necessarily compelling: two guys hiding out in the snow, trying not to call attention to themselves. It doesn't make for an action-packed plot.Luckily, quite a lot of the book is given over to the two main characters telling their life stories, filling in some of the history of the Meme Wars. Most of the philosophical exposition happens inside this panoramic and engaging context, so it works better than the high school debate-style discussion I feared and expected.Once again, John Barnes has managed to make reading about abstract, high minded concepts be fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner set in Barne's \\"Meme War\\" univers","review":"Anyone who loved the setting of Kaleidescope Century, and couldn't get the alternate-future out of their minds will enjoy this book. The characters are more sympathetic than in _Century_, but the same issues of free will, memes, etc. are explored in even more depth.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Barnes","review":"The usual John Barnes goodness, set in what appears to be the same universe as Kaleidoscope Century (among others). Like those others, the talent and originality that caused some to hail him as the New Heinlein are marred by graphic depictions of extreme violence.Overall, a very thought-provoking and ultimately uplifting novel - but I'll never lend it to my mother; the sick parts would make her cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Badly Underdeveloped Concept","review":"This book sets new standards for incomplete character & plot development. According to this book (written in 2000), all the major events in the book were triggered by the outbreak of widespread warfare using highly destructive and sophisticated bioweapons and the societal changes caused by this warfare. No mention is made of how these technologies came to such rapid fruition, since the negotiated peace that ends these wars occurs by 2002! The book then degenerates into generalities about ecological disasters, social decline, and wars between factions dominated by artificial intelligence programs. The whole book lacks focus, and the ending is just tacked on, as though Barnes became tired of writing. A thoroughly bad book, lightyears behind his Timeline Wars series."},{"rating":"2","title":"great recording, then, now, and always","review":"I don't remember the ,70s; I wasn't even alive then. Gram Parsons was dead before I was born, but, thanks to this recording, I've had the opportunity to listen to the golden voice that is still vibrant with life. This is an outstanding country-rock recording, and it's great to have (it bears repeated listenings very well). I would have never have stumbled on it, but my uncle, knowing my musical tastes (which include Dwight Yoakam, Lucinda Williams, and Bob Dylan), guessed that I would like it, and he was right.

Everything here from \\"Christine's Tune (a.k.a. devil in disguise)\\", to the partial cover of \\"I Shall Be Released\\" is wonderful.

I was hoping this would sound like an early-Eagles album, but Gram just doesn't have the vocal abilities of Glenn Frey or Don Henley and the arrangements and production seem somewhat primitive. I think Emmylou Harris' and Linda Ronstadt's versions of \\"Sin City\\" and \\"Dark End of the Street\\", respectively, are clearly superior to the Burritos', for instance. Gram Parsons' main contribution to music must be his songs and his influence on others, rather than his performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"great leisure read","review":"Great little easy to read book on brand trivia.

I own a 04 Acura TSX (4 door) and after taking the seat and base to Police Department to have it installed by a professsional, the seat could not be put in the middle position in the back. The middle seat was so high compared to the side seats that the base could never be level. The professionals did not feel this was safe for the baby.

So I bought another base for my husband's car (Toyota 4Runner). We didn't have any problems with the 4Runner. I have a VW Passat with leather seats--the kind of hard leather that is really slippery. When I installed it, the seat seemed very loose. Luckily for me, my husband is pretty strong and really got in there and tightened the seat belts. I bought two car seat mats (Super-Mat and Grip-It by Sunshine Kids) to go underneath and the infant seats are now very, very snug. I defy anyone to try to move them now. If you're having problems, then your best solution is to seek out the experts: your local fire department.The only downside with the Primo Viaggio is the cost and weight.

After reading her review, I decided to try to install the carseat which we received this past weekend into my Subaru Forester. It simply will not fit properly. The problem lies in the design of our seatbelts. They are too thin to fit snuggly in the base guides, and the accessory that came with the carseat to compensate for thin belts is too large to fit properly on the belt between the base and the seatbelt latch. Our fire dept. personnel has recommended that we NOT use this car seat in our car. If you have comparatively thin seatbelts in your car, you might want to think twice about purchasing this carseat. If anyone has other suggestions as to how to make this carseat fit in our car, please post a followup review!

Scene after scene is full of made-up or rewritten events.I'm also not sure who the audience is supposed to be. It's a little bit violent for young children, but the production and story don't seem sophisticated enough to interest anyone over the age of 5 or 6.There are a lot of songs.

Deepak Chopra can always be counted on to remind us and chide us about our soul responsibilities. I read this book from cover to cover with great hope seeping into my heart. I've read every book by Deepak Chopra - some many times - and as a former Editor of Science of Mind magazine, I've quoted him whenever an issue focused on personal choice. This book - Peace is the Way - is a powerful call for peace - to every thinking person. Peace depends on you and me, and I'm ready and eager to step up.

It was out of print for a while but turns up here and there.Listed as a Don Cherry record, and it is, in a way. Ultimately, for me, it is the classic Ornette 4tet with James Clay (on alto and flute) replacing Ornette. I have been a fan of Clay since discovering him on \\"Presenting Red Mitchell\\", which is a great record, too. His flute, to me, is second only to Dolphy.I won't go track by track or anything..

This dvd is not instructional, but simly a bit of music, alot of colors and brief comments as to the chakras. Strictly to be used while meditating, in which case, many may not need a dvd, but rather music only. If you're wanting a simple meditation tool or wanting to trip visually on colors, this may be right for you. If you're looking for deeper insight and instruction into balancing the chakras, it's useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"unpractical","review":"I bought this DVD to work with my chackras more, It was a short video, and I agree with the other raters that said it wasn't calming. It had images that not only did not fit with my perception of certain chackras which I can totally look past, but it was projected in clips that were like 2 minute commercials on each chackra. It was fast chatty and not something I would want to use as a meditation tool and in the year I owned it I watched it once. It doesn't seem to be developed as a meditation tool or for a deep introspection tool, but rather a simple introduction.

Unfortunately, the producer of this video cut corners on some of the animations, so while there are quite a few good ones there are enough really hokey spots that it distracts you from the journey.Worse still, the same lady, Anodea, decided that she should narrate this video. HUGE mistake! Her voice is not remotely relaxing, it sounds like a 50-something ex-valley girl reading her favorite passages from the Celestine Prophecy. They would have done better to have one of her gurus or swamis narrate it, at least then it would have had a shred of authority and credibility.Watching this movie just made me want to go and remake it with a capable narrator and quality animations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I was hoping to expand my knowledge of the chakras, however this DVD provides an elementary introduction at best.

It takes less than 30 minutes to watch, and is best used as a simple explanation or introduction to anyone who is not familiar with, or has ever heard of a chakra. This is in no way a meditation video, and is informational only. It would be a good video to loan to a friend who happened to ask \\"a shock...what?\\" or for instructors to give their students as introductory material. The imagery is very creative and vivid, and the music is pleasant and appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"Since I was expecting a meditation dvd, I was very disappointed.

So, after the first broke, I bought three more. This means I've still paid substantially less for a product I like than one I do not. I keep a spare in my bag, and I'm good to go.

I had high expectations of this book, however high expectations are often followed by disappointments and this book was no exception.There is a lack of science and an over reliance on homespun remedies. References quoted were vague and ranged from unnamed butchers to conversations with fellow attendees at conferences. The tone of the book varied from a folksy chatty style to the authoritarian. Words like 'never' and 'must' appeared with monotonus regularity.The most important thing someone like me needs to know from an animal husbandy book is what is normal, and when to call a vet. But in this book, vets don't exist and sick animals are soley the result of a lack of remineralised soil.For an exprienced, conventional farmer who knows animal husbandry well and who would like to try some natural therapies, this book may well be useful. However, for a beginner like me, it has limited use."},{"rating":"1","title":"you'll have to replace the crank, but it's worth it!","review":"I received this as a shower gift and loved it. However, after cranking it up once a night every night, it quit when my daughter was ten months old. The crank won't work, and the music won't play, and numerous calls to the manufacturer have not yielded any results. For a thirty dollar mobile you would hope it would last more than a few months.UPDATE................I must admit that after contacting the company, Dolly, they very quickly sent a replacement music box for the one that had broken.

I've never owned an electric shaver before, but I've always heard bad things about them, so I steered clear. That is, until my son was born. Now, my showertime has been cut to about 10 minutes, and there's really no time to shave. With this shaver, I can shave my legs while I watch him play, watching TV, whenever I get the time. The shave is pretty close, and I really like the extra trimmer function. You can angle the trimmer so it only trims and doesn't shave for, you know...other ares of the body...you know what I mean lol.Haven't had razor burn for about a month now, and I'm very happy with that because all razors, even the Venus, give me razor burn.

A fresh view of Jane Austen as anything but a quiet spinster. Fabulous research on the ways her family tried to sanitize her image, and the ways publishers and critics have fallen for this trick, to the point of revising her very appearance. For the sassy author of books that pointedly, acidly and poignantly highlighted the constraints faced by women, the constricted view of Austen herself seems like some kind of perverse performance art. Auerbach's book gives Austen back her original appearance and her original personality. You will enjoy it. Guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Low-Budget \\"B\\" Movie (with some caveats)","review":"After seeing some of the clips for this movie on YouTube, I just HAD to search it out and get a copy. First of all, know that this is not a wide-screen production and it looks like a pretty poor quality scan of the original film that was converted to DVD. Still, for a B-movie, it was quite par for the course. The voiceover actors are wonderfully cheesy like an old Kung-Fu movie --just shot in the Philippines. The special effects are absolutely hilarious to see. My one caution is that there is a few scenes of full frontal nudity --and for no good reason. If you plan on showing this movie to young kids, I'd caution against it (or edit those scenes out). Still, a great ride and a bunch of good laughs. I frequently felt like commenting on the movie like Mystery Science Theater 3000 because of how ludicrous the story line was. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And in this corner, we have satan...","review":"Very strange movie.

While the narrator's ability to always be the victim, her punishment of the book's rather flat characters and a lack of providing any kind of tactful or subtle plot movement or meaningful emotional exposition--really, anything insightful--makes it difficult to even complete the book.Plenty of people have been addicted to drugs and have gone what Heather has gone through.

He even thows in a Adamsesque quasi quote at one point. The little known standards Here I'll Stay and You've Come Home are so strong that you wonder why they paid royalties to Cole Porter for Get Out of Town. Oddly enough I found the sheet music for both of them in the same out of print hardcover music book at a local library.Things cool off a bit for a couple of tunes but Gerry declines or the record company declined a out and out ballad.

It is not a book for beginners, but it is an excellent guide for anyone who wants to make his carvings of wolves, foxes and coyotes realistic. There is only one project shown in its entirety, but this one project shows many details and techniques for making your carving true-to-life. These techniques can then be used for completing other canines whose patterns are included at the end of the book. The author has shared her abundant knowledge of the slight differences in the anatomy of each species shown, so that carvings will be realistic even to experts viewing the animals.

Anyone with that kind of fever would at least throw off the covers. The intelligent thing would then to take a cold shower or bath to help lower the fever. Neither of these was done. Meanwhile her man who is supposed to be caring for her, has his mind set on having sex and is actually angry that she doesn't feel up to it. This film is a blatant effort to rip you off.

This time around though, the band (or maybe the label) seemed more aware of hair metal's popularity, so the sound leans heavily in that direction.The firstRoyal Court of Chinaalbum had more heart, but Geared & Primed is a totally enjoyable, totally rocking album full of upbeat odes to hard drinking and fast living.

Because it seems like he's actually making quite a few similar points--albeit from a somewhat different angle, with a condescending tone, and subtracting most of the style and wit of the Greg Behrendt book.Overall, I felt like Kerner wasn't even offering any solid advice--he just goes on and on in this really patronizing way about what women are doing wrong.Also, the whole CONCEPT of the book is totally cynical, as it cleary intends to capitalize on the success of the other (far superior, in my opinion) book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as He's Just Not That In To You","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I bought it because I loved \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" so much. This one was more about sex and not about what's important to the female in the relationship. In the beginning it talked a lot about women masturbating - something I'm proud to say I don't do - but this book will make you believe all of us do. I think it's just the author's sick fantasy.

The first book assumes way too much about guys. For instance, if the guy doesn't call you back the next day after the date, he's apparently not interested. That kind of advice is sheer lunacy. Even if a guy is interested, he may not call because he doesn't want the woman to think he's a loser chasing (which I assure you she will. In fact, alot of girls try to get rid of a guy if he calls the day after) her.So anyways, this book is already starting out on the wrong track by giving way too much credit to the first book. Secondly, this book seems to want to give goddess stature to all women. As if every woman should get the best looking guy out there, even if she herself is fat and ugly. Yeah, way to help out your fellow gender Mr. Wuss.This book is almost a breeding ground for lesbianism it's so bad. The book is not worth the paper it was printed on.

Then he is required to go back to acting like a cretin; it's a cycle you see - she needs him to be a jerk, so that when he does do something kind-hearted it really stands out. If he was sweet, nice, kind, gentle, thoughtful ALL THE TIME - that would get BORING, and she'd leave him for someone who could provide the needed drama that I described. So this book is total nonsense.

I found none of the humor and warmth I was expecting, nor any delving into what is important to ME in a relationship, which is moral make up of people, their beliefs and feelings.

IMHO it is books like this that have women continuing to scratch their heads wondering WHAT to do in a relationship.Try getting real, with yourself.

After her death in 1955, her project was completed by Marie-Louise von Franz, the most pre-eminent of Carl Jung's disciples and one of the most respected expositors of Jungian psychology. This book, a Jungian analysis of the Grail Legend, is regarded as a masterpiece. What is the Grail Legend about? In a word: meaning. It is how the Fool, Perceval, finds the Holy Grail and thus rescues the suffering Fisher King from his non-life in the Wasteland. This book explains how that story, with its triumphant conclusion, can take place in each one of us. For anyone fascinated by the Grail and curious about its relevance to life today, there simply is no better book than Jung & Franz's study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This was better than the earring.

I am so glad I actually went to a BRU and looked at it. The bumper was flimsy - it bunched around the sides of the crib, you would have to sew or velcro more ties to keep it in place and I would still be afraid the baby could get caught if it bunched over their face.

I have been a professional mechanic for many years and cannot recommend this book for anyone who is serious about repairing their own vehicle.

(Actually, it's because it's the only Tempo/Topaz book I own.) I have found several major errors in the illustrations, usually due to showing a 2.0 engine setup as a 2.3 or vice versa. Some instructions, like how to change a water pump, are just plain wrong. Electrical schematics, particularly of the instrument cluster are sketchy to the point of being useless when troubleshooting anything other than a hard failure. I suspect that much of the text in this book was a quickie cut-and-paste job of info that pertained to these same components as installed in other Ford products. It really doesn't do justice to the model-specific problems of navigating the limited space of the engine compartment or tracing an intermittent electrical circuit. Proofreading was spotty at best.

I'm not so sure I still want to go.PS I think this is the 2nd time we've been ripped off with only 10 songs....but then again, that might just be a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this for my mom","review":"Horrible music, get it off my recommendations list Amazon, please!If you like this kind of music, there are much better groups...try Westlife instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"AND NOW: IL DIVO!","review":"Has anyone seen the advertisement for these guys.

But the whole album just feels like one long song. No matter what songs is, it's been treated and sung the similar way.

With this one, I enjoyed everyone to the point that I didn't even pay attention to time. Their voices are fantastic and when they hit the song full on, I'm blown away.

I'm just going to say that every product they have put out is an improvement on the one before it. The voices seem richer, the harmonies blend better, the musical interpretation is outstanding.This is not opera folks. This is a pop album. Sung by trained singers who know how to carry a tune and infuse their singing with emotion. They don't need to sing in English to get the meaning across.If you want beautiful, romantic music, then buy this album. It only gets better the more you listen to it.

Big Hutch's second solo, \\"Live From The Ghetto\\" doesn't really do the veteran producer much justice. The very same guy who blessed us with the amazing \\"Black Superman\\" in 1994 seems a little uninspired on the production tip these days.

My recent purchase has made me very happy since i have been trying to get this 3 cd set for quite a while. Anyways I will treasure this forever. Vol 1. Has many of her classics with 15 songs altogether. Vol 2 Features Change of Heart, I Drove All night and You Dont Know , along with 12 other songs. Vol. 3 has 14 songs and a few are: Witness, I'll Kiss You and I Dont Want To Be Your Friend. If you are a Cyndi Lauper fan from day 1 this is a good choice of variety to have in 1 set. 44 songs of Cyndi truly amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cyndi grab-bag...but what happened to \\"Boy Blue\\"?","review":"Three discs of Cyndi Lauper, she of the flashy, thrift-shop style and powerful-pop vocals. It's crammed full of album tracks, hit singles, and several rare cuts (the B-side \\"Cold\\", the hard to find \\"The World Is Stone\\", and of course \\"Hole In My Heart\\", one of Lauper's best songs which never appeared on any of her albums). Still, the packaging is bare-bones, and the sequencing of the songs is all over the map (which keeps the listener on his toes as to what selection might be coming next, but is rather terrible in terms of Lauper's musical history). And couldn't they find a better photo of La Lauper herself? The one image they've got is something you might find on the internet after everything else about Cyndi has been considered."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CYNFUL COLLECTION EVER","review":"They had a little error though.

It actually smells when you open the package, and the patch itself has a sticky goo on one side that you are supposed to stick onto your skin. (You will get a light sticky goo all over your hands from applying the patch--and your hands will smell strongly of bengay.) But worse than that, these patches never actually get hot. They just \\"tingle.\\" I have not found that stinky, sticky tingling provides any pain relief. But if you want your sore area to tingle, stink, and feel slimy for 8 hours, then this is the product for you. Personally, I will go back to buying Thermacare from now on.

I had streamed it a few times on Netflix and while their widescreen copy was very clear, I figured the DVD must be even better (it wasn't available on Blu-ray), and had been searching for it for several years. Well, the copy of that movie in this package is just awful! While it is spread across my entire 55-inch widescreen, parts have been cut off at the sides (for example, you can't see the pins when Collins knocks them over at the fair), there's some awkward pan and scan, and the picture is far from clear. Which means that I spent $12.49 for something I could have watched with far better quality for free. What a waste! I realize that Universal lists \\"The Promise\\" as a \\"BONUS MOVIE,\\" but what about those of us who only buy it for that movie? I think we should be warned about what we're getting!

When I finally bought this CD, it stayed in my player for a week straight. The songs are powerful, and build to a stirring conclusion, reminiscent of his album, \\"The Getaway.\\" A few songs, such as \\"Missing You,\\" may require multiple listenings before they can be fully appreciated, because they lean towards Deburgh's sappy side.

If you like that show you must read these books. In Plain Sight is the second in a series of at least 4 that I've found. The lead character, Ivy is a senior citizen, amateur detective and gets herself into all kinds of trouble. She gets herself in trouble with a 'mob-type' family who chase her around the states trying to kill her. I don't want to give it all away but she gets in more serious trouble than I remember Mrs. Fletcher getting in. Ivy even compares herself to Mrs Fletcher on a few occasions. Start with book one. Each book transitions smoothly into the next and all the same characters show up sooner or later. I have not had a book that I didn't want to put down for some time.

This book is for the readers produced by American schools-- barely literate, easily amused by downhome antics of little old ladies (Southern, at that) and incapable of participating in good plot and good writing. In fact, this book is little more than the stuff peddled to \\"Christian book store\\" buyers who have no idea that they are being swindled by quick-and-easy effortless religious sentiments masquerading as real religion which takes effort and critical thinking.

Spend the extra five or 10 dollars and get yourself a quality clip-on capo that will last you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Capo","review":"This is a great capo.I bought this hoping it would be decent quality, being much cheaper than most capos. It is great quality. Note it won't fit a curved neck well such as a strat, but for acoustic guitars like mine it works great. Also, it's not too tight, but nothing that can't be fixed poking a few holes in it.I also like how you can slide it during play, making it much easier than a clip on...overall great product I'd suggest it.UPDATE- One year later and I am still using this capo. For the cheap price, it was worth it. It holds down all my guitars well, I like that it slides as I said above, and it's durable, it works just as great today a year later as it did the day I got it. I don't think the other guy that wrote a review was very reasonable, it is a capo you snap on through the holes, not a clip on, so obviously it won't hold the strings as well, but it is also much more flexible, and frankly I like the look better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Onmyoji II","review":"i didn't like the dubbed in English.

No conclusions to anything (alexandre vs Genghis, MIR, Firstborn, etc. etc.)...basically concur with all the previous reviews that blasted this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing but readable","review":"After having read Time's Eye..I was anticipating a deeper insight into the nature of the FirstBorn, perhaps even more information about the Eyes...a stronger Bisesa Dutt. But I was disappointed. The story was pretty much told in the first few chapters...the rest of the book just dragged us along with the details of the shield and the boring lives of the protagonists. Bisesa herself is almost a non-entity, cowering in her home for most of the book. I also expected a stronger ending and a lead up to what could have been a third book if the ending is to be believed. Still, this was readable, if only to get to the end.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good actually","review":"Book two of the Time Odyssey series by Clarke and Baxter is in my view a lot better than book one. Its quite good actually! Whereas book one left you wondering what it was all about, here it all comes together.It reads as a suspense novel. A race between the alien Firstborns, who thinks humanity must be stopped - as human civilisation uses too much energy, eventually on a galactic scale - and humans who try to defend themselves and humanity against these murderous plans.Lots of good ideas (I know, thats not what the other reviewers wrote, but I think its good on the ideas front) and good pace throughout. A joy to read.-Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"sunstorm","review":"I must have read a different book than the newpaper reviews. I found the book dull and trite. I could skip five pages at a time and never miss anything in the story. It seemed to have a lot of filler of trivia. In my estimation, not up to the standards of the two authors. I thought the first book dragged at first but then got interesting. I was hoping the next book would continue where the first one left off, but no luck. SF authors should not try to write harlican novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I went into reading this book immediately after the first (Time's Eye) and there was quite a bit of difference in writing styles. For one thing this book didn't flow as well, and I found it to be a bit boring at times. It didn't answer many questions at all about Time's Eye and the world of Mir, but it was still ok if you like the kind of book where humanity saves earth against incredible odds. Although I'm sure there are better books out there with such a premise. Still.. it was better than the third book which was a huge disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Switch-a-roo","review":"Not a bad hard sci-fi read. But, not what I was expecting and wanting for a sequel. Time's Eye was a fun, fast read that left us wanting more. Instead, we get a whole new set of characters in a side story to the first. We learn almost nothing new of the Firstborn except from where they are from. All the while, we are forced to read through endless pages showing that the author knows a lot about science and his philosophical views on humanity. Not horrible, but I wouldn't have chosen to read this if it was pitched as a stand alone novel, which it is very close to being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"If you are into reading chapter after chapter of pseudo-scientific techno-babble this book is for you. Otherwise, the story is extremely lame and the characters are two dimensional disposable pieces of cardboard. \\"A Time Odyssey: Book Two\\" is misleading as there's no time travel or time shifts involved and the part about being Book Two (Book One is the vastly better Time's Eye) is misleading as well - the part played by Bisesa is incidental and left undeveloped and as to the Firstborn: here's a complete summary of their role in the book: it's all their fault. There, you'll find no more about them.The book is not just bad given who the authors are. It's just plain bad. Really, really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please...","review":"I've read this idea before, nearly 3 years ago. It's called Decipher by Stel Pavlou. Clarke and Baxter write a significantly shorter book, but stylistically it's even identical in places, peering inside the sun to watch what's it's doing, and following how it works, while a shield is erected on earth. What exasperates me is Clarke and Baxter are getting praised for the idea, and Pavlou got criticized when he was first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Core Ideas","review":"Obviously you have to read \\"Time's Eye\\" first.This book, as with most Clarke books, has some future tech that is more than a bit intriguing. That we can probably produce aluminum on the moon was a surprise to me.

It also reminded me why I don't like Arthur Clarke-he can make the most interesting plot seem boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunstorm (A Time Odyssey)","review":"Book two of the Time Odyssey trilogy is almost as good a read as the first book in the series. It continues the story arc from the first book but tends to be more introspective and not as expansive as book one. If you have read the first of this series there's no doubt you will want to continue with books 2 and 3. A great idea for a series but I would have been much happier with bigger books and more story. At around 350 pages it feels a little rushed and before you know it you've reached the end and want more! Great book from Clarke and Baxter but I wish it had been 4-500 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail","review":"Poorly produced and executed.

I was ambitious and tried out the whole video - it was worth it. What kept me going was the timer on the bottom of the screen; having the segments broken down into 5 minute sessions helps you stay motivated to keep on going. The examples of the three levels is also helpful. For different sections I tried different levels and that also kept the video challenging yet within my limits. This is a terrific video whether you have ten minutes or sixty."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!

Every one of my students who have purchased it agrees that it is the best, most understandable book they have read on the subject.

It was remastered by George Marino, who has remastered a lot of catalogs, most importantly the Led Zeppelin catalog. This edition sounds a little better than the old CD, but not that much. The two extra tracks are really outstanding. One is an instrumental jam where Buddy really lets loose and the other is a nice cover of Guitar Slim. No horns or big production, just Buddy and the band on these two. The big letdown: in 'Mustang Sally' Jeff Beck's contribution has been edited out completely!!! All the fills and his solo. Why, what happened???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the fans (maybe), and beware the sound quality!","review":"Even for avid Nice fans like me, this disc is hard to justify purchasing. The problem is that the recordings sound like they were recorded off of a table radio typical of the period. They go to some length in the notes about how they improved the quality from the originals, but you have to scratch your head and say why bother.However, kind of a thrill to hear the Nice playing Zappa's \\"Lumpy Gravy\\" (really!) Also interesting I suppose to hear most live versions - although \\"Little Arabella\\" is actually the studio mix from Ars Longa Vita Brevis(!!). That's the kind of production this is.All in all I just wish there was some way of knowing when you purchase this what you are getting, since this falls far short of today's standards for nostalgic live recordings (such as the Old Grey Whistle Test discs)."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is getting back to basics give me a full-blown orchestra","review":"I loved Le sac des filles, I want state that right off.

The supporting cast are also funny, especially Jamie Pressly as Earl's wise-cracking ex-wife Joy.

This is not a warm mist humidifier, just becasue you don't feel a mist doesn't mean its not working!It needs to be rinsed out regularly. The whole unit breaks apart easily, most of which can be washed in the dishwasher, best part of all the filters don't need to be replaced, they can be soaked in vinegar/water to be cleaned.Humidifiers take a little work, they must be cleaned inside and out. But this one makes it super easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought two of these, one for each of my kids rooms. After using it for only a week or so I noticed the water in the tray is a rust/brown color. What is that from and what are the kids breathing in? The claim that you never have to change the filter doesn't seem realistic to me with rust colored water. And the noise! One is pretty quiet and the other? You can hear water sloshing (is that how you spell that) around. Not sure how my son sleeps with that noise. I'm off to search for a better one. Wish me luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am going to bring it back to Walmart for a refund","review":"This is a breeding ground for bacteria. The base of the unit contains a water reservoir that does not get vaporized after the main water storage container is empty. The water there in the bottom of the reservoir gets brownish. I don't want brown water getting vaporized into the air. The user manual tries to explain how the humidifier works but it seems to have been written by someone who could care less about what the customer thinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lower quality than expected","review":"Live in Phoenix, Arizona and need humidity just to survive the dry air here. This unit claimed to be quiet and included anti-microbial in nature. I will say, these claimes are not a fair representation of the product. Always had problems with mildew buildup, even when using the chemicals requested by manufacturer. After a few days the unit started to vibrate to the point the dishwasher is considered tolerable. We would have to shim the water tank with folded paper and toothpicks to get vibrations to lessen. Sometimes a smack on the side did the trick. After two months the unit started to leak out the intake vents.Unit requires refilling every 22 hours or so on medium fan speed. All in all, I think this unit gives humidifiers a bad wrap as I am sure you can get a better unit with less hassles. As it is, $50 is a lot to spend on a night light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Useful Life","review":"I bought 2 of these humidifiers. They worked well for about 3 months. The humidifiers stopped distributing mist properly and started \\"spitting\\" water. The fans also became noiser and began to work unevenly on lower settings causing a squeeking sound.

I'm going to throw the Hunter humidifiers away and try a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carefree?","review":"I bought this product April 23,2006, and started noticing water spiting out rear grill.

Even though I filled it with filtered water, calcium deposits were all over the inside. I wiped out the inside with CLR (lime and calcium remover) and soaked the filters in CLR. Within 3 days, it was spitting out water again. And not just a little bit of water, either. I'd placed it on a huge beach towel that I'd folded up as many times as possible...maybe came to 3\\" of towel that it was placed on. The next morning, the towel was DRENCHED...I mean, I picked it up and water was dripping out of the towel. I phoned their \\"customer service\\" number listed in the manual about 3 times. I was on hold for so long each time, I gave up. Now it's just sitting in my living room and I'll probably throw it out. What a waste of $50. Oh, and when it WAS working, it was noisy. I had to turn my TV volume up to a level I hope did not disturb my neighbors (apartment living)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Mildew builds up every few days.

It was so noisy from the beginning I could hardly believe it. I bought it because I had an awful cold and instead of relieving my dry nose and throat, it kept me awake. Also I cannot sense any humidity in the air even if I hold my hand over the vent. And it is like having an air conditioner in the room. The vent blows cold air but, from what I can sense, not much else. We cannot run it with the TV without turning up the volume.

The fan is noisy even on lowest setting. The case design makes access to filters cumbersome. The permanent filters themselves seem good and quite robust.. The unit badly needs automatic operation.

The tank crashed down, breaking upon impact, sending water everywhere. Thankfully no child or pet was underfoot when this occurred, as the weight of the crashing tank would have been great. The handle is attached with only a single plastic peg. Recommend against relying on the handle alone when carrying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, doesn't last","review":"I've had Hunter ceiling fans in my home for many years, and expected a quality product in this humidifier. Boy, was I ever wrong. We found that unless the water reservoir was perfectly aligned, it would leak all over the floor. It did this about every fourth time we filled the reservoir. Then, after only six weeks, it quit working entirely. Wish I could get a refund for this piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD","review":"It works great as a humidifier but it is more than loud.

I am using it for my 2-year old daughter's bedroom at night. My main goals were to 1. find a unit which was very quiet and 2. find a unit with minimal maintenance (i.e. filters). I used it in her room for one night and couldn't believe how noisy it was! I had it down on the lowest setting and thought that it was still way too loud. And the other two settings were totally obnoxious. I think that they definitey misrepresent it on the box when they advertise \\"whisper quiet\\". I don't know about anyone else, but when I whisper, it's much quieter than this unit!Since I promptly returned it, I can't speak to the maintenance of the unit. Outside of it running very loud, it seemed like a good unit.

It is harmless and prevents harmful growth of mold and bacteria. Also, I saw a negative review about the unit not blowing cold mist...um, duh...this is an evaporative humidifier. There is no mist.

I thought that a lot of the power of the story was lost in translation, as is always the case with books in translation, especially from a romance language into a germanic one. However, I was willing to ignore this because finally one of my countrywomen had won a Nobel Prize for her work. A couple of years later, i read an article in the Washington Post stating that Ms. Menchu had \\"embellished\\" her story, adding extra drama. As if the Guatemalan tragedy needs drama to make it real and poignant. And indeed, it was true. Ms. Menchu was asked by many to give back her Nobel prize. I don't remember if she did. If anyone knows whether Ms. Menchu gave back her prize, do tell. The book itself is boring and plodding. It did not communicate with the reader the way good books do. This is non-fiction that reads like the worst fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Hoax","review":"This is the classic left wing - right wing myth that helps selling books.

In most if not all cases it is completely unnecessary and its a big let down when you find that one character is an amalgum of five different people or something like that. I found that to be the case with this novel as well as dave eggers' \\"What is the what\\" and just about every single supposedly true biography I've ever read. The first few chapters were very interesting but afterwards I literally fell asleep. I had a paper on this book due in two days and was so sick of trying to get through the whole thing that I just had to wing it and write around what I did read. It drags on and on and on.

Then, after received the awared, while her people suffered there in Guatemala, she was living the high-life on the $1,000,000 prize. Not until there was great outrage by her home town, threatening to expose her, did she donate a small portion of her awared towards a local school.

I discovered halfway through the book, that the author gave false testimony of her life. This was disburbing and made the rest of the read deflating.

I realize that horrific atrocities were perpetuated against the Maya by the military and this book helped bring attention to the genocide. I believe that was important, but I'm disappointed that the author chose to create falsehoods. It brings her credibility, in general into question.

Menchu herself was much more aligned to the marxist guerillas in the mayan highlands than she wanted you to believe in this book and her book was written with the help of a french leftist. It's unfortuante that menchu's story of pain suffering and struggle have been used for the benefit of the left in this country and europe as well as guatemala.

Fonda and Ball are terrific together, and it is nice to see Lucy playing someone a little more real and normal. She brings her great comedy timing, but also a lot of warmth and decency to the character. The scenes with the eighteen kids in the house are a lot of fun, as is Lucy's drunk scene and the scenes surrounding their blind dates. This isn't a hysterically funny, holding-your-side kind of comedy, but it is a warm, affectionate look at the perils of blended families, which in the hands of Ball, Fonda, and some good child actors, is very amusing and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lucy Lover in Texas","review":"This movie is a great movie for kids!

The idea to make Helen and Frank Beardsley's life into a movie came from Lucille Ball herself, who read an article about the couple in a magazine and thought it would make a good film.The movie is about a widow, Helen North, a nurse for the Navy, who has eight children. She meets Navel officer Frank Beardsley, a widower, who has ten children (one of his sons, Mike, is played by Tim Matheson). They begin dating and soon they're married.. Although, the kids aren't very happy about their parents marrying new people. But the family is in for a shock while Frank is away at sea!Also starring Van Johnson, this is a fantastic, heartwarming comedy that the entire family will enjoy. Lucille Ball, as usual, is hysterical and Henry Fonda is charming and just as funny. This is one of Lucy's best performances!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yours, Mine & Ours","review":"This is the original Yours, Mine & Ours with Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda.

LUCY MANAGED TO MAKE THIS FLICK WITH HER PRODUCTION COMPANY AND TONS OF MAKE-UP. HER CHARACTER IS PREGNANT IN THE LAST SCENES OF THIS MOVIE. HENCE, LUCILLE BALL (GOD BLESS HER) WAS 57 YRS OLD WHEN SHE MADE THIS FILM. THE BEST MOMENT IN THIS SADLY DATED \\"FAMILY\\" FILM IS WHEN LUCY'S CHARACTER GETS DRUNK.

The fleeting yet tangible loneliness her character expressed when meeting Fonda's character in the hospital and the later, breakthrough, conversation between her and Tim Matheson in the laundry were amazingly, honestly and heart-breakingly handled and only hinted at the sheer depth of talent that this legend had to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" Yours, Mine and Ours \\" is excellent, a great film!","review":"This film should be considered a family classic. I have seen this film probably a hundred times since I was a child. I never tire of it because everyone involved is just wonderful. I would feel safe to say that there has never been a funnier drunk scene on film or television that can even come close to Lucy's scene where she meets Henry Fonda's family for the first time. Hmmmmm... oh yes, I almost forgot, maybe a little scene involving Vitameatavegamin but I have to say that it is very, very close."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT MOVIE FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY TO WATCH!!!","review":"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT.

It's great to find such good talent and a warm true story. Whenever we are feeling a little down we just put this tape in. No matter how many times you watch it you will find even more in it, there are numerous interactions in the background between the kids that just add more depth and reality to the story. What makes it even more special is knowing that this is a true story. I guarentee that you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Lucy's Best!!","review":"This is one of my all time favorites. I watched this movie many times as a child and loved it. When I finally found it on VHS years ago I bought it immediatly. Now that DVD has become popular I knew I had to have this version as well. All of the scenes are hilarious, but everybody comments on the \\"Drunk\\" scene or the \\"floating eyelash\\" so I will comment one of my other favorites...the scene where Helen and Frank are strolling by the shops after their first (and supossedly last) date. He tells her he wants to buy her a momento to remember him by and she picks up the jade statue and they are told by the store owner that it is a \\"goddess of fertility\\". The look on both of their faces is priceless because it just points out their situation and the fact that neither needs help having children! The way that they eventually come together as one big family in the end is wonderful. Well worth watching.....and owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a family movie night!","review":"This is the kind of harmless fun I grew up on. And Lucille Ball can do no wrong in my book. Innuendo can keep adults chuckling and harmless to watch with the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a timeless classic worth owning!","review":"I remember seeing this movie as a child but didn't remember the name of the movie. It's one of a few movies that I always remembered and searched through countless video reviews to try to locate. I was ecstatic when I found it and, unlike many fond memories of things from my youth, I was not at all disappointed when I watched this for a second time. It was as enjoyable as ever! And my 11-year-old son enjoys it as well! It's so nice to know that some movies don't have to be remade or \\"spiced up\\" to still be appreciated by today's culture. Yes, having a family of 18 children might seem outlandish to some, but I would much rather my children watch classic movies like this one as opposed to watching some of the filthy and raunchy stuff out there today...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belly Laughing Riot!","review":"I rate this a 4 star movie because the first half of the movie is one continuous laugh after another, up to Lucy's classic drunk scene (reminicent of \\"Vitameatavegimin\\"). After that it takes a turn toward a more \\"serious\\" comedy. The dialogue and physical comedy give way to the eight-is-enough situational comedy/drama. Overall, the first half is so funny that you won't mind the directional change. The price is a fair trade off for the draw back of a full frame picture. Always a loss when the maker's choose against the always preferred letterboxed edition. Still, DVD is better than video, and this movie is better than most comedies made now-a-days! Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For You, Me, & Everyone","review":"If you're looking for a \\"feel good\\" movie, this is definitely the answer to your search. Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda are the utterly believable parents of this overwhelming brood of EIGHTEEN. Handled with gentle humor, Helen (Lucille Ball) and Frank (Henry Fonda) initially determine that there are far too many obstacles in the way of a relationship. Eventually, however, they take on the formidable task of uniting their two families into 'one big happy'. The trials and tribulations of accomplishing that feat will be all too familiar to those who've tried. This is excellent entertainment for the whole family. I saw it FIVE times at the theatre when it was first released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucille Ball","review":"I have yet to view this movie, but based on the quality of the stars, I am sure I will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST PLAIN DISAPPOINTED","review":"...

HERE ARE THE MAIN REASONS FOR MY DISAPPOINTMENT. 1st.. THE CHILDREN DISPLAYED A LOT OF DISRESPECT FOR THEIR PARENTS WHICH TO ME IS NOT COMICAL. 2nd.. THERE WERE SEVERAL SCENES THAT I WOULD CONSIDER ADULT SITUATIONS AND SEXUAL IN NATURE ... 3rd.THERE WAS TALK OF SEX AND IN MY OPINION THIS DOES NOT MAKE FOR FUN FAMILY VIEWING..

Although we won't throw ours away - we'll donate it to the library. perhaps somebody will like it.This was really pathetic 1960's cinema: Gone is the class and glamour of 1930's MGM. No taste in clothes, no taste in home decor (much), no taste in raising children. I couldn't believe that Mother didn't even reprimand the son for having the Playboy magazine? Family film? Not a chance in my house.I have to confess I was laughing sometimes during this film, but not because it was funny. It was incredibly UN-funny. I don't find rude children and parents sort of lost out there somewhere amusing.

Too bad because this was perhaps the best horror film to come out of Hollywood in decades. This film avoids every vampire movie cliche ever devised. Instead of throwing gallons of blood and gore at the audience, the movie spends 40 minutes developing its story and characters. This movie is so daring, the movie is halfway over before we see the first real vampire attack - and what an attack! Better yet, the movie deals with the possibility of vampires regaining mortality. It's a shame this film escaped most of its audience. Perhaps now, people can see this horror masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Near Good","review":"This has some really good moments - the evil western outlaws as vampires is a great idea. The darker, sordid, violent scenes are the best (particularly the bar scene). It is absurd to criticise a vampire western on grounds of logic but by its own terms the film becomes confused and incoherent. This is mostly due to the clumsy attempt to resolve it in a happy ending. Maybe the film wouldn't have got funded if it had pursued its darker impulses to the end. The problem with endings like this is that it undoes the entire film - realigning all its subversive moments with a conservative, reactionary and frankly dull cause. In the end this apparently dark vampire western reveals itself as Little House on the Prairie dressed up for halloween."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as everyone keeps saying","review":"A lot of reviews say this is a really good movie. I liked it alright, but it wasn't what I hoped. I like vampire stuff - whether movies or books - and this one took a little different turn on it. I liked that they showed some imagination, but it still isn't my favorite. I liked seeing a young Adrian Pasdar (Nathan Petrelli on Heroes), but I hated the vampire girl that he fell in love with. She was absolutely horrible. Other than that, not a bad movie, just not fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"<Scenes Cut!>","review":"I LOVE this movie. I saw this movie for the 1st time a LONG time ago and was blown away! I rented it a couple of times, then it seemed impossible to find. When I bought my DVD player about 2 years ago, this was the 1st movie I tried to find. Almost 2 years later I saw that it was finally coming out on DVD. When I got it I called my husband and told him he was in for a real treat, I was coming home with the MOVIE. Within the 1st 15 minutes I became VERY aware that this movie has been chopped up. ALL of the blood, violence and gore that made this movie what it is was GONE! Yes, CUT OUT! Gone! The bar scene was butchered! All the scenes were cut, gone, not in the movie anymore. WHY?? Who did this to a classic film. I want to know who is responsible and they should re-release this movie with ALL of the scenes put back in!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super movie, super dvd","review":"This is one of the best horror dvds released.

From most Amazon viewers, it received 4 stars. Good God, what a travesty...There are so many dimwitted and preposterous plot elements that the film is actually laughable. If it is \\"a cult favourite,\\" membership in the cult must be restricted to those who have failed urine tests.

Don't waste your money.Watch/buy a good vampire movie like Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Shadow of a Vampire, Nosferatu, Interview With the Vampire, Let the Right One In, Night Watch and Day Watch. All 100 times better then this movie. Hell even From Dusk Til Dawn and The Lost Boys are better then this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capital B","review":"I have enjoyed quite a broad range of vampire movies. Some good, most bad.

It's not a terrible film either, it just isn't very good. The acting was decent enough, and I'm sure that it was made for a fairly low budget, but the overall story wasn't very compelling or well-told. For one thing, this group of vampires have got to be one of the dumbest groups of vampires ever portrayed in films. You'd think that after living for 150 years or longer, you'd learn a few things such as, I don't know, maybe if you're a vampire and the sun will kill you, then you should look for a dark place to sleep at least a few minutes before sunrise, without waiting to see the sun appear? \\"Oh no, there's that sun again! How did that happen?\\" The vampires were caught in the sunrise more times than I care to remember.So, ultimately, can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Great - Blu Ray VERY poor","review":"what is the person thinking saying this was a good transfer?

Their youngest recruit, a lovely young woman, meets the man of her dreams in a small town in the middle of nowhere and turns him into a vampire. This starts the trouble for the gang as the young man's father pursues his son's abductors relentlessly.

The story moves along nicely, and it is always a delight to see former \\"Aliens\\" cohorts Henrickson, Goldstein and Paxton together again. Paxton in particular really lets it rip; he's definitely the most interesting, but I love all three of these characters.My only real complaint here is the ending - it really leaves a lot to be desired and seems to have been hastily tacked on. Okay, two complaints: Henrickson, Paxton and Goldstein need to stop dying onscreen! :-) Let's keep their characters *around*!Severin can stop by for a drink anytime.... and oh yeah, WHERE'S THE DVD?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alien's cast become vampires!!!","review":"This was a very sweet surprise.

This movie didn't have any thunder. Much as I like Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, and even Jenette Goldstein, this movie has little acting, no plot, and nothing else to sustain it. This is a fine example of movies that are made because there's money to make them, and nothing else. Bigelow's _Strange Days_ was okay; perhaps because she didn't write it.

It was awful, believe me, AWFUL!! I am a big fan of horror movies and Vampire movies. Watch something like \\"Interview with a Vampire\\", \\"The Lost Boys\\", even \\"Fright Night\\" was way better than this crap!!!! There is a reason why \\"Near Dark\\" wasn't a popular movie!!

Simply put, this movie is so slow and drawn out that I wanted one of the vampires, preferabley May, to jump out of my television and bite me in the jugular just to get it over with. However, since that wasn't going to happen, the next best thing for me was to use the chapter jump button on my remote, which I used many times after the first hour.Rumor has it that Hollywood wants to do a remake of this dung flick!

I prefer something a little more traditional like with fangs and what not and a little more class.

A little more subtlety and finesse about there kills... graphic, yes, but as I said, more stealth and subtlety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much bite...","review":"I actually like most of the actors in this movie ... just, not in this movie. I do not consider it horror, because true horror has no happy ending--horror is meant to leave you feeling like the lights should be left on at night. I would catagorize this as drama, and not a very good one.To me, it failed in about every way possible. I really didn't give a crap about the characters, it didn't hook me. In fact, I stopped several times and worked on my college homework--because that was more entertaining!I kept watching, praying that it would get better ... in the end, I finished watching because I'd already paid to rent it and I might as well get my monies worth.It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, and a few parts were okay, but it's certainly not on my list of movies that I'd want to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"there should not be so much bad acting in just 1 movie OMG!!! how is it possible that people actually sat through this and LIKED it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Near Dark (DVD) Horror, Vampire","review":"I saw this movie when it was released in the late 1980s.

For me, Hats is indeed one of those very few recordings, if only for the tone of this terrific album.Tracks like The Downtown Lights, Over the Hillside, and Headlights on the Parade bring out a mellow, urbane, highly emotive sensibility: refined electronica set to sparse, sad, probing beats. Think of a soundtrack for walking along damp and foggy city streets on a late Sunday evening. This record says \\"Glasgow\\", even for someone who has never visited.Can't precisely put my finger on it, but Paul Buchanan's voice cuts through everything. Sad but fulfilling, mellow yet uplifting.For this listener, Hats is an absolute classic that still very much stands out in my collection.

I listen to all kinds of music, and own nearly a thousand CDs...and \\"HATS\\" is my Number One favorite of all of them.The Blue Nile rarely tours, but if they come your way, do yourself a favor and go. I was told when they played in L.A. at the end of the 80s the crowd gave them a standing ovation after EVERY song. Finally, they returned for the release of \\"Peace at Last,\\" and I went.

I myself listen to it some days on my car rides to and from work-helps me unwind a bit if the day was particularly stressful! So if you are a fan of Japanese music-this CD is for you!

Yet, the book is easy to read without economist-jargon. War creates many many ecconomic problems such as shortages, inflation, and displaced labor force. The book then examines government solutions of rationing and price controls. This book also looks at the wars effects on neutral nations and the post war economy.This study mostly centers around the First World War, but realy this is a study of the economic effects of war, ANY WAR, on a nation's economy.This book was first printed in October of 1940, so the ecconomic effects of the early stages of the Second World War were still unknown to the authors. However, they offer some statistics of population and ecconomic potential for the warring nations.Over all, this is an interesting book.

Within 2 months the batteries began to weaken, lasting just 20 mins or so in the camera, just shooting stills, no video, no watching pictures. Then one battery was completely dead, leaving behind three that worked poorly. Now only two remain, holding charge for 20-25 mins at most.I rarely use it now, having no faith in how long the batteries will last. I know that every battery has a fixed life, but did not expect that life to be less than 50 hours.I have read the manual and used the refresh option (discharge and then recharge) to no avail.

It felt as though she was building up to bring us through the story and didn't know how to pull in all the pieces. I was disappointed towards the middle because I wanted to READ a GOOD book. The characters were beginning to annoy me through the middle. A little far fetched. I put the book down often which is unlike me. Once I am hooked on a book it doesn't leave my side. I always keep it with me in case I find a few moments to continue reading. I beleive she has talent but this book didn't showcase her well. Could have been so much better if she spent more time developing the plot and creating some mystery and excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"As an Andrea Kane fan, I have to say this is one of her best novels of the contemporary, thriller style. I loved the characters of Sabrina and Dylan, her father Carson, her mother Gloria and all the characters who keep you guessing as to their involvement. It kept me turning pages till there were none left. The chemistry between Sabrina and Dylan was hot. And Sabrina is 27 years old in this novel, not 32 as a reviewer incorrectly posted. Since this is fiction, you can believe that she was the president of her own company. There are many women who have achieved early and this is definately feasible. Of course, it doesn't hurt to believe that a young woman could be so successful. I give credit to Kane for creating such well rounded characters with a great plot. If you like Kane's earlier works, you will like this one just as much. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that I found it difficult to believe who the culprit really was, after revealed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks to High Heaven","review":"Wow, what a let down.Not a bad story overall. However, the characters are overblown to the point I really disliked them. Genius, superior olfactory sense, incredible business acumen and outstanding style. It was all repeated so often that the only character I liked was Dylan Newport. He hardly ever announced how awesome he is. Instant connections, deep rooted love in record breaking time. It was a flat story that never hooked me emotionally.Mundane, trite, phrases are repeated as well; 'tension so thick you could cut it with a knife', 'it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop'.

He was in his 60s. Me in my 20s. I'd bring in all my music and play it. He always said he liked it. No matter what I brought in he liked it. And of course everything reminded him of bands that already came and went 20-30 yrs prior. He'd talk alot about The Feelies. Then I bought this album. This is way ahead of its time. I love the Pixies and thought they were way ahead of their time, but this stuff is even older and is more relevant today, sound wise, then the Pixies.

The lyrics and the overall tempo are another matter. The whole CD conjures a real downer attitude that doesn't change much from track to track. In short, it is not clear to this listener what the artists were trying to accomplish. The lyrics are not potent enough to yield sad or fulfilling feelings. It's just plain dull and pedestrian. It's a shame to waste such talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Stars for One Track","review":"The song \\"Marie Mouri\\" was the only good track on the entire album.

I knew this could be a risky purchase because she does a lot of \\"Art\\" music. I was right, this Album is nothing but \\"Art\\" music. Half the songs are in French, and there is nothing in here that is even close to the Linda Ronstadt I remember. Keep your thumb on the skip button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistently beautiful collection of songs","review":"This collection of songs is from many genres. There are a few cajun tunes, blue grass songs, and a pop song. Even though the background of the songs is varied, they are pulled together into a cohesive whole on this CD. The vocal harmonizing is lovely, and the selection of accompaniment is perfect. The people performing on this album are serious about their music, and it shows.The songs are all very smooth and on the quiet side. I suppose as if one were floating down a long slow river in the hot sun. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rustic and Refined","review":"From the first strains of the instrumental opening the stage is set for this rich and evocative recording to unfold and take you on a rewarding musical journey. Together,the voices of Ronstadt and Savoy blend gracefully and weave together to create some breathtaking harmonies. The musicians accompanying them make every note matter and play with precision and passion. Julie Millers's tender country ballad \\"I Can't Get Over You\\" is handled with such care by Ronstadt and sung with such heart that the result is one of her most moving performances to date. Likewise, Ann Savoy's lead vocal on Richard Thompson's \\"Burn's Supper\\" is staggering. As if this weren't enough, there's a knockout version of \\"Walk Away Renee\\" to close the record. That's not to say that everything in between is any less than wonderful. The project is a work of art from beginning to end and the kind of timeless music that you will come back to again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Listen -- Stunning","review":"This is a rare recording which all should consider adding to their collection. The artistic integrity throughout the CD -- guided by the musical instruments, but sent soaring by the vocals -- makes it stunning to listen to. Doing so is a visceral experience which almost appears to stop time. (This sounds over-the-top .. but for me this was the experience on the first listen.) Trust me: you will treat yourself to something special and unique if you put this on your CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linda Ronstadt at her simple best","review":"I bought this CD with some trepedition. My last few times of trying a new Linda Ronstadt were disappointing. And while I understand why a good and longstanding artist wants to try out new forms, somehow those forms were more experiments, I think, than true to Linda Ronstadt's musical roots and her original fans. This collection is a back-to-basics and it works well. Her fellow vocalist, Ann Savoy, has a lovely, sure lilt, and the songs chosen are old-fashioned folk melodies, original enough to be interesting, yet very pleasant and undemanding to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking...","review":"This album blew me away. The songs are simple and the singing is heartfelt. The vocal harmonies are perfection! I can't say enough good things about this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not awful.","review":"Linda Ronstadt has such a warm, emotive voice and can do so much with it. I unequivocally rate her as one of the top five female pop vocalists of the last fifty years. I've followed her from folk to country rock to standards, Latin, lyric opera, adult contemporary, back to country and roots, and enjoyed pretty much all of it. But this collaboration just left me feeling like I'd wasted my money. You know, it's not bad: it's moderately lyrical and technically adequate. But there's just no life in it. It doesn't make me want to listen to it over and over again, and isn't that one of the qualities most of us look for when we choose to lay down our hard earned cash? Unless you're a die hard Ronstadt fan who has to own every thing she records(hmmm... sounds too close to home), I'd pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this album","review":"OK, I'm not a big Linda Ronstadt fan and don't know her work that well. I heard her on \\"Wait,wait,don't tell me\\" on NPR and thought I'd try the album she just put out. It's a nice enough album but every song has a slow tempo and I found it a bit tedious. None of the songs \\"called\\" to me. I haven't had any real desire to listen to it again. If you are looking for slow ballads only, you might appreciate this CD more."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOLKSY POP PIECE OF HEAVEN","review":"THIS SUPERB COLLECTION OF TUNES IS DEFINITELY A LABOR OF LOVE FOR LINDA AND ANN; PENNING THEMSELVES THE \\"ZOZO\\" SISTERS.

That's all I have to say in this title, but:","review":"This is the most exquisite Linda Ronstadt or Ann Savoy collabarative album I've ever heard from the first track, sure, her solo album Hummin' To Myself was great, but this is exquisite, developed in poetic expression, and beautiful. I have a deep Cajun background on my Father's side, so this makes it even more deeply affecting. When I heard the second and title track, tears almost came to my eyes. This is the most affecting ethnic Southern music I've heard since I first heard Leo Nocentelli/The Meters, Johnny Ace or The Neville Brothers. And the French lyrics were exquisitely done, I always said Linda Ronstadt could sing anything and do no wrong... Well, 'golly'(I'm not going to use the strong words I want to use here), I was right.Captain Josh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Louisianan Side of Linda Ronstadt","review":"I've been collecting Linda Ronstadt albums for 33 years now, and this is the best one since at least 1995's \\"Feels Like Home\\". Her voice (probably the best collaborative voice in music over the last 25 years) meshes perfectly with Ann Savoy, a Cajun artist with whom I was unfamiliar, but is well worth exploring with her efforts here. The best songs are the two Richard Thompson covers, the title track, and their version of \\"Walk Away Renee\\". There've been very few bad covers of that song, but this is the best one since the original. This is a must-buy for those who love beautiful harmonies and classic songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adieu False Heart","review":"One of Linda's latest & greatest collaborations.The melding of Ann Savoy & Linda Ronstadt's voices is so harmonious.The usuage of the traditional Cajun instruments and then to use cellos, violas and other string instruments on some of the cuts were ingenious.It's hard to categorize this CD into one category. It's jazz, cajun, light rock, traditional, pop country and more. There's something for every one.It's a sentimental & sensitive compilation of songs come together in utter exquisitiveness.If you don't own any other Linda Ronstadt's work, this is one to start with and work your way back with her prior hits.After all, someone who's sold well over 50 million records can't be too hard on the ears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This CD is excelllent. My daughter and I had heard the title track on the radio for the first time. We wrote the name of the song down and went from there. All the songs are great.

My memory of reading and re-reading both prompted my purchase of both from Ebay a few years back.I purchased this reprint for my ten year old daughter, as she has many of the same interests as I and I was hoping for her to enjoy Bond's book as I did years ago. The disappointment is that where the original volume had many, many sketches/drawings, this reprint has just a bare handful. The drawings in the original elicited much day-dreaming about things that could be built or done and the reprint mainly has just words.Save your money and search out an original volume.

I found myself responding to the characters with real emotion, and I could not put the book down.There is no way to anticipate the plot twists in this book.

The songs SEEM very long and very repetitive. there are a few good guitar riffs here and there but they don't make up for the rest of the album.I think if they worked on their songwriting a little bit they have to potential to make some great music.

Key's final volume; he died before it was published. Perhaps it is most famously summarized by his quotation (Page 7): \\"The perverse and unorthodox argument of this little book is that voters are not fools.\\" In short, something like a populist work on voting behavior.Throughout the book, he uses a variety of data--adopting very simple statistical techniques--to develop this point. For instance, he shows that voters who support one party in an election and who then become dissatisfied with that party after the election tend to switch their votes at the next election to the other party. Thus, voters are not Pavlovian dogs, ritually supporting the same party over and over.All in all, a classic little book.

This is Brain Tracy's BEST work, and a classic on enhancing learn capability (if you actually diligently apply it)!One word of caution: If you never really fit the mold of a \\"good student\\" because you think differently, this program is for you! But, if you DON'T believe that earning and learning are tied together, and accelerated means \\"short cuts\\", then you should stay away from this one.I'm about to buy it again, because I gave my first one away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work...","review":"I've listened to many Brian Tracy programs over the years, and was very hopeful when I saw this one hidden away.The only reason I gave it ONE star is because Amazon won't let me give it ZERO stars. This is just not very good work. He repeats himself multiple times, paraphrases and re-states the same ideas, and frankly the suggestions for increasing your learning potential just aren't very good.Don't waste your money on this one. Stick to the motivational techniques he teaches in other programs and apply them to your own learning. 90% of learning something is WANTING to learn it in the first place--there aren't any shortcuts or tricks.UPDATE: I guess there are some die-hard Brian Tracy fans out there. Of all the reviews I've ever written, this is the only one that ever got a thumbs down! The truth is the truth. I calls them like I sees them! This program is a waste of your money and--more importantly--your TIME, and Brian Tracy claims to be an expert on time management."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brief good read","review":"Only 48 pages long (including index), I thought it was clear, concise and objective.

The plastic fan blades developed several cracks and were rubbing against the fan housing. Then the blades flew apart.I wanted a humidifier like my father has; an old belt type that has run for years. A plastic belt netting rotates through the water and past a large fan. But I cannot find those any more.Wicks rot after a season, requiring replacement. So I was happy to see that this had a wick made of metal, over which water is pumped. However, part of the so called PermaWick rotted away after one season.A permanent wick is a good idea, but inferior materials sabotaged it. Hunter replaced the entire unit free; we'll see if it lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Care Free\\" - I think NOT","review":"Yes, it puts out the moisture effectively. That will warrant one star. Aside from that it is loud & big. But my biggest complaint is the gunk that builds up in the inside.

It looks like a white crusty film. GROSS. I even tried bleaching it with no luck.

All are the same type but 2 different models. This is a newer model so I thought they may have solved the problem I have had but they did not. After a season the motor freezes up and you call Hunter and they send you a new one. I took one apart and found that salt builds up in the motor till it will no longer turn. I have a water softener which is the source of the salt. If you have hard water the result may be the same. If it wasn't for that I'd give it a 5 star because the filters last forever and on the low speed it's fairly quiet. I run it on high when no one is in the room. I run it constantly during the winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first but did not last","review":"We owned this product for less than a year.

The humidistat is defective and will not allow the machine to turn on. My dry-as-the-desert apartment has an actual humidity level of 25%, but the humidistat on this machine claims the air has a greater than 80% humidity level. (If my apartment had 80% humidity in December, I wouldn't be buying a humidifier!) The machine is designed to only work through the automatic humidity setting -- you can't just turn it on and off. So there's no way to override this error.Now I have to go through the hassle of re-packaging it and sending it back -- and paying for the shipping!

Tunes are often based around deceptively simple motivic/rythmic kernels, which are expanded upon patiently but not exhaustively, a departure from the prevalent 50's bop approach, and an anticipation some free jazz a decade later.These recordings are truly priceless, not only for the piano work but for the drumming. Art Blakey and, on the later sessions, Max Roach are clearly enjoying their prominent roles in Nichols' compositional format. Stop reading and buy the set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LAST JAZZ MESSENGER SESSION","review":"Man- dig Brian Lynch playing I'll Wait And Pray. I thought Coltrane was the only one who knew that song. There are ballad features for Barlow and Jackson too. But a trombone solo leading of the first tune seems inappropriate. There's plenty of music, almost 70 min. of it. 14 tracks seem like a lot but the 1st track is a brief verbal encounter between Blakey and the A&R man. Tracks 6-8 are a 8 min. medley feature for the pianist Keezer. Nica's Tempo is the only known uptempo tune. Well, at least I know it. It dates back to a mid 50's side man session Art was on with Gigi Gryce and Monk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resource","review":"This is a good cookbook - one I appreciated finding since there aren't many japanese vegetarian cookbooks out there! First, the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 ios because I really like to have more pictures when it comes to ethnic cooking. It not only gets me interested in trying new things but also gives me ideas for presentation. This book only has 8 pages of pictures. But that aside, the recipes are tasty. Some of the ingredients are hard to find (like the specific types of seaweed) but if you have an asian store near you'll find what you need. I've found some things on the internet too (the world at your finger tips!) I recently bought a deep fyer and am looking forward to trying out some of the deep fried tofu recipes.

These are the most difficult ingredients to locate.Although the recipes are simple, they are very good and can be the base of a daily Japanese menu. Full dinners, snacks, lunches, soups and all that are available for cooking. Rice is a main component of most of the dishes, but there are some excellent potato recipes and more vegetable-rich dishes. The glossary of ingredients is a usefull addition.I have made many meals using this cookbook, and I will make many more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stock issues?","review":"I ordered the book in March of 2006, and every month I was required by Amazon to approve a delay.

I've had Peace of Mind on tape for years, and recently decided to upgrade. I have loved David Glasper's voice since I first heard \\"Hands to Heaven\\" on the radio (so long ago). He has a beautiful range and the band compliments him so well with their amazing talent. I appreciate their ability to move so fluidly through the jazz, rock and pop styles in their music........sad that they were only able to record two albums ('glad that i have those albums to enjoy for years to come). David Glasper shows so much emotion when he breaks into the bridge of songs like \\"I hear you're doing fine\\" and \\"Does she love that man?\\" (2 of my favorites), and although it's a small portion, his take on \\"Amazing Grace\\" in \\"Got to get by\\" (another favorite) is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard (I'm a bit partial). \\"Peace of Mind\\" is a lovely album and must-have for any Breathe/David Glasper fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aggregate excellence","review":"As the pronounced possessor of Breathe's integral repertoire, I'm rather familiar with the penetrating musicality of the Yately-borne threesome. Even so, 'Peace of Mind' ushers in an entirely divergent degree of profundity. Anchoring this composition are the would-be hits \\"Say A Prayer\\" and \\"Does She Love That Man\\" -- both structurally grand and deeply perceptive. Proclaiming the seemingly hopeless despair of the brokenhearted, one can't help but be moved by \\"Where Angels Fear\\". I, for one, simply adore the consummate saxophone solo featured therein. Other noteworthy, dulcet tracks include \\"Woman\\", \\"Say Hello\\" and \\"Without Your Love\\".Truthfully, 'Peace of Mind' has become synonymous with the eventual demise of Breathe, however, the album serves as testament to their cohesive dexterity. Indeed, this group demonstrated a maturity far beyond young men of their twenties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job!","review":"Went to Orlando in JULY and did the theme park scene for 7 days in 100 degree weather and we were cool.

Example: the essay about going to a large state university paints the whole experience as lonely, alienating, and anonymous. The writer complains about the 20-minute walks from dorm to classes(other people might find this useful for thinking and in keeping fit), the throngs of girls she's too shy to make friends with, the communal washing machines in the dorm. She wants to go home and spends as much time as possible in her bed.

It offends me that I'm inconvenienced by having to send this defective unit back and, far from being sorry that I've been inconvenienced, they are concerned only that I might cheat them out of $6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Universal DVD player","review":"This player is amazing, yet inexpensive. Plays NTSC and PAL (European) DVDs and burns them, too. Look for hacker codes for this player in the Internet to make it region free, and you can play DVDs from anywhere in the NTSC/PAL universe.If it only looked cool -- with the mirror clear front it looks so 70's. I can live with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Disappointment","review":"As the other reviewer has said, \\"save your money: don't buy.\\" The manufacturer states that the unit offers compatibility with NTSC or PAL sources but fails to tell you that this requires sophisticated hacking. The \\"pamphlet\\" that passes as a manual is less than helpful and the unit is always less than cooperative. It should also be noted that the unit will ONLY record with \\"DVD+R\\" discs, and only 8x at that (this is not made clear in any of the company's literature and may result in owning many discs this machine considers \\"useless\\"). The unit also has a tendancy to freeze multiple times during any given movie. I am also disappointed with Coby's US customer service -- the DVDR-1100 is not even listed on either of the company's websites, and it takes far longer than the 90 day warranty period to ferret out all of the unit's idiosyncracies and flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horror BUT!","review":"After using only 4 or 5 times, all of a sudden it started flashing HELLO,HELLO,HELLO,HELLO.Wouldn't let the disk out. Tried unplugging and re-plugging to no avail. No lights lit up-no power.I called customer Service and was very pleased to be told that I could bring it into the Maspeth facility and get a replacement.If this is true, I will find out next Tues. after the Memorial Day week-end, then I will be very happy since this unit is already past it's 90 day warranty. Happily, I live in the NYC vicinity or I don't think that I would risk sending a $31 money order plus shipping charges for a repair. Apparently they don't make DVD Recorders anymore since there are none on their website.Will send a follow-up review when and if I get my replacement.FOLLOW-UP!! THE COMPANY WAS WONDERFUL!

Lady's voice has that drug-and-alcohol-induced rasp that crept in as the years wore on, but her phrasing and emotion are still astounding.

This book really concentrates and is thoroughly researched about Japan in that time period.I found the writing to be a little boring at times. I didn't really get her character until a death occurs in this book. Then I really felt I understood her better, I wished that she had a sense of humor or something relatable. She is a mixed bag of happy and sad at the same time. I couldn't really relate to her and I wanted too.Sometimes, I felt the book was moving too slowly at times and needed to pick up the pace. I also felt that there should have been a map in the beginning of the book as well.

Nancia's growth from naivenewness to flexible adulthood is accompanied by normal emotional trauma. Selfawareness, recognition of self worth and valuation of others are wrapped in anentertaining reading experience. Cynical recognition of who you know rather thanwhat you know doesn't detract from the message or the idealistic theme that goodworks and good will can triumph."},{"rating":"2","title":"PDA Slip Case Doesn't Slip Around","review":"I recent purchased the Case Logic PDA Slip Case (PLTS10) from CompUSA. At first the item looked bulky and I didn't want to be seen with it on my waist. After inserting my Toshiba e755 I found that I felt safer with my PPC in the slip case than in the one given to me with my PDA package. The case will comfortably hold any PDA, PDA-phone or PDA-GPS handheld device. On the bottom is very rigid plastic and rubber making your PPC sustainable to falls and drops. I would much rather drop it in this case than the case I recieved with my PDA. Although the belt clip doesn't fit comfortably on very wide belts, you'll never have to worry about it coming off.The PLTS10 is a very secure way of toting your PDA. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I bought this after seeing the beautiful book \\"Gee's Bend: Architecture of the Quilt\\", hoping to see the vibrant, exquisite quilts in detail on a big screen.

The quilts were seen only as an occasional backdrop in between tedious chatters, flashing for half a second and gone. What a waste. Just buy the book and forget the DVD !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!","review":"Living in the area where Charlie grew up, it is quite obvious that the author did thorough research.

The novel deals with the way in which music imprints itself on the narrator's brain--as subject and as form and as way of dealing with the world. It really is like she is swimming in it as she sets out trying to survive without many resources in Italy. So much of the book is about various forms of performance, as she becomes involved with an Italian doctor who moonlights as a male gigolo. It looks at the ways we instruct and command ourselves due to the training and rules we learn. REALLY interestingly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Among the worst","review":"I don't comment on movies very often, but watched this loser on DVD last night. Your first clue is it never appeared in the theatre. I feel almost compelled to spoil the sappy ending to save people from wasting their money. The problem with the movie is it masquerades as a tense hostage drama but in reality is nothing more than a video lecture on the evils of drinking and driving. The dialog is boring and the drama is minimal. If you think this movie is going to be like the Liam Neeson movie \\"Taken\\" think again. Think about the worst movie you have even watched. This one will be up there with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audtey hepburn","review":"I was very pleased with the poster I recieved.

Even for those longtime fans who have LSD, Slippin' Away, and Songs, this album is a must have. Some of the songs are new recordings with completely different arrangements. 2000 Miles gets a complete makeover, but still rocks. For those who only know AH&J; from the song LSD, you will not be disappointed with this album.Like the preceding reviewer, I love Keeper of The Tolls. Unlike the preceding reviewer, I have listened to this album in its entirety many times and quickly learned that because there is no gap between Money Talks and Keeper, the cd directory considers them one song.

I've used the supplied software for over a year and prefer it over all others I've used. It allows use of any font. It allows scalable rounding of text. The complaint about graininess is caused by trying to enlarge an image too much. There are limits. I do multiple disc set sometimes and this software allows me to easily mark disc numbers.

The author goes through detailed explanations of the abilities and limitations of the young child in each phase. He gives the reader a lot of information about the behavior of the child and what drives it. Using the behavior and the development of abilities as a guide the author recommends and discourages various toys, child rearing practises during each of the phases. This is the only book I've read on the subject that is based upon factual research and not some feel good hypotheses."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent because it's different and thorough","review":"I have read thousands of pages of baby and child rearing books, and in that context, really appreciate this book because it covers material I haven't seen in any other book. For example, the common ear infection and how it could effect the child developmentally because of the loss of hearing. The way the author organizes the developmental milestones also provides a new interesting view on what to expect at certain stages and ages, and most importantly, how parents can help form these learnings and stages with what they do and don't do.Further, I do appreciate the author's professional opinion where he expresses it as opinion and not necessarily research. I am not big on all the charts and graphs of the developmental stages, and for that reason only rate this a 4 and not a 5. I think i will get his other book as other reviewers mention.Overall I really like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensible and evidence-based","review":"The book seems to be based on close observations of thousands of families, by someone with good judgment. It says what the child should be doing at a given age, and what you the parent should be doing, without euphemisms or ideology. A big theme of the book is that you must establish compliance with rules between the ages of 16 and 24 months. I began to read this book just *after* my child turned two, and it is a bit sobering for me to ponder how sound its observations and advice appear now. I own at least two or three other books on parenting (the also good Brazelton and the treacly Dr. Sears), and this one is easily the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book for the first 3 years!","review":"I used this book to raise my three smart and successful grown children.

Parenting is a continual experimental process and there IS no right or wrong way to bring up your child and there is very little a reasonable parent can do to \\"ruin\\" their child. (The word \\"ruin\\" is used frequently in the book)Please people, read a reasonable book!

It's economical because of the permanent filter. However, as with the last two I owned, several years ago, the motor will not turn after several months of storage. I used this, and the privious units, continuously for 3>4 months. It's got to be mineral build up in the pump (and probably on the drive shaft), which is attached to the motor armature. It would be very difficult to disassemble the pump with damaging the clips which hold it together. And then, how would one clean the shaft and shaft housing.I like the humidifier. It really works well, when it is working. I live in Ohio and have a filtration system on my home's water system, and my water really isn't that hard. I don't like the idea that you can't service the pump or get to the pump shaft to clean any hardened mineral deposits.

One is stronger than the other and the bottles are different. The toilette spray is a frosted bottle. This was the same great product we have always used. To avoid problems with shipping and to make sure we received a true Donna Karan item I did purchase directly from Amazon. I received my item 3 days later and it's perfect.

She stays away from the simple and crummy repetition that most modern bands fall back on.Instead Drea relies on her voice and lyrical skills to carry the songs. There's only a couple of tracks that seem to break the pace of the rest of the album, but for the most part she keeps the power throughout the album.If you liked her \\"Justified\\" track from Dead Rising, you're going to like the rest of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"podcast-mind","review":"\\"Ken Goffman (R.U.

There's plenty of depth and it's well written although not very complicated. I never realized what a sad life Shubert had, and this book does a great job describing it. The best parts are in the first half when he's very young and wants to do nothing but compose, but his father forces him to be a teacher. Shubert was a tragic person and Unfinished Symphony leaves you feeling really sorry for him yet also filled with gratitude for what he gave to the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would recommend the A&E or Lifetime videos instead","review":"I was very disappointed with this video.

There are no interviews with anyone who knew Evita on this video. The only interview is with Madonna - and it is a very short interview and was not done specifically for this video, rather is it stock footage that has been made available to all EVITA promotional events.I was very disappointed with this video.

I had mixed feelings about the movie - it was weird, disjointed, boring, and yet sometimes intriguing all at the same time. Certainly, it tried - not entirely successfully - to capture a fairy tale atmosphere that not many movies have tried to do and I had to applaud the attempt. It did succeed in inspiring me to try reading the book. Similar to the movie, it was weird, disjointed, boring . . . and lacked anything intriguing.

Again, even finding a weather channel is difficult, and even if you follow the instructions precisely, you can never be assured that you will find what you are looking for.

I already had the mouthpiece from previously whitening with gel purchased from a dentist. The first clue I received that this product was not going to work well was that I felt no tingling, pain etc. when the gel was in. I remember when I used the product from my dentist, my gums would tingle and hurt by the end, and my teeth would have sensitivity. Not that I am promoting mouth pain! But it means that there is a chemical doing its job. The level of this gel was higher than that I purchased from my dentist, and I felt nothing and had no sensitivity. I still continued to the use the product though, in hopes that maybe my teeth had just become less sensitive. But at the end of a couple months, I still had little change to the level of whitness of my teeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"on the run","review":"A cute series that is light but entertaining.

From the reviews here, it sounds like others have had the same experience.

Profound sadness from songs like \\"You Chase the Light\\" . Transcendent hope in \\"The Wonder of Birds\\" . A friend crying at \\"Black Sheep Wall\\", feeling her relationship with her brother. The instrumental music a perfect backdrop for Karen Peris' haunting, innocent voice.I haven't listened to anything after \\"Umbrella\\", which wasn't as powerful for me as \\"The Innocence Mission\\", but the reviews here pique my interest to try out some of the more recent material."},{"rating":"2","title":"This love hurts too much...........","review":"An ex introduced me to Innocence Mission back in the day and the moment I heard \\"Black Sheep Wall\\", I felt like I hadn't lived until I heard that song.

That being said, every track on here is a winner and no one should be disappointed. If anyone is, there's definitely something wrong with them. I had a chance to see Buddy live back in the mid 70's and it was an extraordinary life moment. The man beat his kit with such speed and precision that I leaned over to my dad in complete awe and said, \\"the man's not human!\\" While listening to this CD I could visualize his performances beat for beat as each track brought it all back for me.

Burt Lancaster and Brian Keith, Jim Hutton and especially Donald Plesance give performances that round out the overall effect and feel of the film.The humor is not dropped out of the sky to hit hard, it is constant and subtle, and makes the entire film enjoyable. There is sarcasm, slapstick, intellectual, and low-brow humor, all intertwined as a constant barrage that keeps you attentive, lest you should miss a joke.The textural appeal of the film is also high; saturated colors, excellent scoring, and great wardrobe make it a delight over and over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong region","review":"DVD was the wrong region and would not play on my dvd/ bluray player.

They should have taken the time to find a good quality copy of the film to transfer or touched up the master to preserve this classic western film.

They meet on a beach that is probably Fire Island. They stay up and talk all night, discovering they are friends.Jim then invites Jack to visit him and they go sight seeing. They have a wonderful time until Jim's bigoted friends reject Jack because he is a blackbird. Jack knows Jim is really his friend when Jim tells the bigot birds that if they don't accept Jack, then they can just go fly away. In time, the bigot birds have a change of heart once they get to know Jack. They also know Jim is not a bigot and he will not support any mistreatment of his friend Jack.What a nice story about loving acceptance. It teaches about unconditional love. Whether or not the birds are partners is not important. The message of acceptance and unconditional love is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Text","review":"This book changed my life...The 2002 version is even better, but you should get them both.

It almost never works, and usually I give up in disgust. But here's the best.I exchanged emails with Nokia about the problems I have, and guess what ? They do not support this cable anymore. They want you to buy a new cable for another $50. The Cell industry is disgusting. Crappy products, crappy software, and a constant attempt to pick your pockets.

That said, Holy Soldier gives them a run for their money with this cd. You can honestly listen to it from beginning to end, and enjoy every song. Some are more catchy than others, but they all are entertaining. These guys know how to play their instruments. This is not just a group of guys who got a record deal because they are Christians (not naming any groups, but it does happen), but a group of Christians that know how to play real Hair Metal/Hard Rock. Think Bon Jovi, Dokken, Sammy Hagar, and Stryper. If you like the style of those bands, you will like this cd. If you have this cd, take a listen toLast Train."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Christian rock release","review":"Holy Soldier were a white metal band that sounded and preached like Stryper, but had the look of your typical hollywood hair band of the time. Which is not a bad thing, but honest.Quite truthfully, this album is nowhere near five-stars. Sorry to all the people that think that, but this album has a substantial amount of filler. However, this record also has some pretty kick-butt tracks as well. Songs like \\"See No Evil\\", \\"Stranger\\", \\"Cry Out for Love\\" and \\"Tear Down the Walls\\" are top-notch melodic metal tracks, but for some reason, the rest seems to just be there. Good, but nothing mind-blowing is what i'm saying.While Holy Soldier is completely an enjoyable album, it's not a five-star record. It is however definitely worth checking out if you don't mind your hard rock on the white side!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Numerical Analysis and Graphics Visualization With Matlab","review":"this book waws very helpful in creating maps of pixelated tif images in the optic research I conduct at LSUMC"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money on such a pile of trash","review":"Not clear from the very beginning and not many things you can learn from this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETE LETDOWN","review":"I as much as any die-hard fan could not wait for this new \\"Foghat\\" cd to be released...i'm sorry to say that this display is just garbage...with all the bands out there trying to make it in this business, these individuals have the balls to call themselves Foghat and get a national recording out...that's a shame...this is not to my ears a tribute to the musical soul of Dave Peverett..as talented as these individuals are, the mix of ideas are nothing more than those of bad bar band...spend your money on the new \\"live\\" cd...class just can't be replaced or shadowed"},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't no Foghat thats for sure-just a copy","review":"I bought this album with thoughts of a new direction with a new singer and guitar player--believe me if you are looking for that Foghat sound-forget it--this is just a copy band with new songs that are boring--the same old rock and roll lyrics-they are not up to par of Lonesome Dave or Rod Price-after one of two playings they sound boring and forgettable--Roger Earl and Tony Stevens provide great rhythm to very boring songs--not very original at all. Charlie Huhn is an average singer with no soul and little range and Bryan Bassett is an ok guitar player-I have heard better.

I didn't expect much of it, but when it ended, I was still pretty irritated.

With \\"The Breed\\" he does bring out some scary options for the typical characters he has. In this movie they are of course just a bunch of college students on some vacation getaway on an island that formerly housed some secret government test facility that experimented with dogs.It has the usual problem presented which has the youths trying to figure out a plan of escape as well as at times, a plan of attack. In the end I just felt like this movie was sub standard slash that did not have enough staying power to make me feel like it had any value to be viewed again. Craven needs to concentrate on getting more intricate scripts that are followed up by some better actors, but that costs more money so I am not expecting anything spectacular from him anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real rabid dog film that really really barfs","review":"Barf!I watched this film, expecting something interesting. It starts off as if it is an updated version of the interesting but hokey film THE KILLER SHREWS.Expectations by the cast are raised. Some of the relationships seem good enough. Some of the interplay works, but ultimently, it sinks.Why? Because no one gets out alive. In KILLER SHREWS the people keep their wits about them, use what is at hand to escape and get off the island. Here, they all die.If you want to see a better update of THE KILLER SHREWS, watch TREMORS. It's the same idea, same use of \\"things at hand\\" and use of the mind.Avoid this shaggy dog. You can see that it is being remaindered for nickles."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is far too much","review":"I have a collection of about l000 movies on dvd. There are excellent movies among them, others are average and still others are poor and boring. \\"Breed\\" is just bad, bad, bad... Dogs (more cute than frightening) play with shouting and screaming \\"acors\\", following a \\"story\\", which never gets exciting. It takes courage, to watch this movie: not because of the horror, but because of its below zero qualities and boring stupidity.

Not \\"Guitar.\\" \\"Nursery Room\\"'s rightful descendent, the album strikes a meaty balance between four-square structure and brain-tickling abstraction, playfulness and poise. From the modal opener \\"Little Cairo\\" to the Pahinui-esque \\"After the Fall\\" to his touching evocation of Fahey in \\"Witness to the Messenger,\\" Lang is spot on even as he's a little bit off -- a stylistic trait peculiar to the Takoma guitarists as a whole and a big reason why their music was/is so much more rich and soulful than that of the merely technically proficient.

If you are ordering this product make sure you know what you are getting. This is an \\"MP3\\" player, not an MP3 player. It doesn't play real music.

I had to remove the sliding glass door from the track and lay it on the ground to drill the holes in the door frame. Then, after re-hanging the door, I was extremely close to needing a very small, right-angle screwdriver to attach the lock to the frame as a)the unit just BARELY fit into the space available between the tracks of my door and b) because of the short bolt, it has to be mounted so low that it's very difficult to get a standard screwdriver squarely onto the screw heads to tighten them down. This lock comes with an insert to stick in the hole you drill in the frame, but I found that the bolt would hang on the insert, so I pulled it out & tossed it. The lock tumbler must be pretty poorly constructed as I find I often need to 'play' with the key to get the lock to release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific on regular wood sash windows","review":"I used these in my house, for the sash windows.

They were pretty easy to install and very easy to use. If you plan to use them in more than one window, be sure to ask for them all to be keyed the same or you'll have to use a different key for every lock (!)For my patio door I put a 1x1 wood bar in the space opposite the door on the inside, about 1 1/2\\" shorter (so you can get it out!)

Tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley, a Blue Note stablemate, brings not only a pair of compositions but some superlative blowing. The two horn men definitely bring out the best in each other here.Tyner's finest moment can be found on the balled \\"I Wish I Knew\\", where he contributes some of the most lyrical playing of the set. The inimitable engine room of Paul Chambers on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums round out the quintet.Blue Note's output of this era is so consistently strong it is very easy to take individual titles for granted. This one merits multiple listens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rings would not fit together properly","review":"This looked like a fun toy when I ordered it. Sadly the concentric ringswhich compose the body of the item cannot fit together unless they are allalmost precisely circular: any significant warpage at all, even on just onering, will ensure that the snug fit necessary to lock the rings tight witheach other without the possibility of slippage during use is impossible.Given how easily such warpage could occur during manufacture or in transit,or even while the product sits in the warehouse, caveat emptor applies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your Time","review":"This book is terrible, its like a detailed version of the owners manual.

I think it is a good value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purifier for the money","review":"I bought this one because I didn't want to spend a lot of money, especially when I didn't know how well one of these machines would work. I have allergies and was told that this might help. I had just moved into an apartment with a previous tenant that smoked. The whole bedroom was horrible. I couldn't take it, I left the window open for days but being that it's winter that wasn't a long term option. So, I decided to to try this because it was fairly inexpensive, I figured it would be a good way to test one out in the bedroom. This works great!! Within 2 days, I could no longer smell the cigarette smoke and my allergies have calmed down!! The only negative (and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is that it's fairly loud on 'high'. On medium it's quiet but if you put it on 'high' it's about as loud as a fan blowing. All in all it's definately a great value for the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work well","review":"This purifier does not pick up any odors, such as smoke or animal hair as it purports and you are forced to buy the filters on line.

We use this one in our bedroom, and would be great in a small office. It is not noisey at all and I don't know why one reviewer rated this unit so low.

First, Dembski is a mathematician and mathematics is not a science (though very useful for scientists) because in math, things are true because their logic is sound. But in science, things are true because the evidence backs them up. This is the reason mathematicians can talk about n-dimensional spaces and physicists shrug off such talk. Dembski's essay only includes examples of man-made objects... he never has a natural example.Second, the essays never quite nail down the definition of complexity. And you will never get your foot in the door of Science if you can't nail down a definition.If you want to read what they have to say, you don't need to buy this book.

This is a direct result of the poverty of science education in the United States which leads to a shortage of qualified individuals to fill the seats of graduate schools in fields as diverse as biology, mathematics and particle physics.Another indication of the poverty of science education is the popularity, among a certain ignorant class, of books such as these irrational anti-science tomes. All of this bodes poorly for the U.S. lead in the sciences.A prime example of the poverty of quality among American educated students is the supposed entry into PhD studies of \\"Paul L.

But for those who have an open mind and real curiosity about the subject of just how the universe and our earth and its living organisms came into being (pure random chance vs an intelligent designer) the three scientists whose articles make up this book present much rational food for thought as they explore the evidence and test it against the claims and capabilities of traditional materialistic science.

All of the stories are good mysteries; none of the endings are overly obvious, and most of the outcomes left an impression to be thought about later. (The picture of Heaven and Salvation in Susan Dunlap's \\"I'll Get Back to You\\" has started many thought-provoking conversations.) The reason I would highly praise the individual stories yet rate the book so low is that as a group the stories are depressing. Even the relatively happy endings are tainted with sadness, failure, fear or misery. Being the owner of two fickle little kittens I still cry occasionally when I think of \\"A Witch and Her Cats\\" by Antonia Fraser. I realize that it is the purpose of each of these women to reach out and impact her audience, but the combination of stories in this book turns the pen into an arrow, piercing the soul.

Shame on Blue Note Records - it is obvious that they have a total inability to distinguish good from bad. Sorry Ron, stick to Jazz.

While the chapters were easy to understand, the homework problems at the end of each chapter did not relate to the material covered in the chapter. My homework study group ended up using the internet to figure out how to do the problems since none of us could find even a hint on how to do the computational problems in the book.

Occasionally you'll come across a question for which the answer is pulled straight from the text, (most non-numeric answers) but otherwise you are left questioning the books purpose other than being a large and expensive, conceptually based, tome of inapplicability.Maybe if there was an answer guide or key, it would slide towards being helpful in learning the info through methods other than pure memorization.

The DVD spends too much time on things like fairing the keel, where the navigator is suppose to sit and how many sails you should have in your inventory. Almost nothing on tactics and strategy, and way too little on how to trim your sails for various conditions.Lack of content aside, the quality of production is very amateurish.

If you can play a bit and are dedicated enough to stick with it, you will learn how to \\"gospelize\\" simple melodies into full arrangements. Lead sheet and by-ear players who want to learn to get that funky gospel praise sound need look no further. I don't mind chipping away at this for a few years.Some hand independence and comfort with four-finger chords are pre-requisites to making the most of this, though you can use the DVD to learn these skills if you're patient and not afraid to practise hard. Caffie-Austin is a beautiful player and the video shows well what her talented fingers are up to. She has a wonderful voice and engaging persona too.If you are unsure about your skills, or are just beginning, I recommend you start with something simpler like Bradley Sowash and Scott Houston's \\"The Next Step\\" before tackling this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy and Jay doing it Kansas City style!","review":"This is right up there with Big Joe Turner's \\"boss of the blues\\" for best album of Kansas City blues.

The emotional ending is something I don't think she could recapture if she tried. The instrumental tracks are solid, traditional jazz. The vocal tracks, which are the first 7 tracks on the cd, rate as legitimate jazz collaborations. She shows off her tremendous rhythmic agility, crisp articulation at any tempo and beauteous piercing tone, easily holding her own among some of the most respected jazz musicians of the time. There's none of the operatic flab of Sarah Vaughan, the cornball phrasing of Ella Fitzgerald or obvious vocal limitations of Billie Holiday."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Robert Crais fan..","review":"Robert Crais has created a number of characters that come to life in each book he writes.. Voodoo River is no exception, and such a fast flowing read that as usual, I could not put it down. Elvis Cole and Joe Pike blast through the Mississippi in their suspense filled style, and will not leave you disappointed.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I adore Robert Crais's books. His characters Elvis Cole is a PI and teams up with Joe Pike to solve interesting crimes. The are are well developed characters that you learn to love. Though the story is in first person with Elvis Cole as the main character, Joe Pike is intriguing to say the least. In later Robert Crais books, Joe becomes the main character. Lots of action and suspense. Crais has a talent for tapping into most human emotions. Once you read one of his books, you'll be hooked and need to read others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice running scene towards the end of the book..","review":"I have enjoyed nearly every Cole/Pike book Robert Crais has written. This one is no exception.Crais takes the action away from CA and into Louisiana and shows the diversity and variety of that part of the US while telling an adventure filled tale. I love the author's knowledge of local lingo and dialects (Crais has always been skilled at that.)The story itself is multi-layered and knowing more about cole/pike would be somewhat helpful in fully enjoying the book. The love story wasn't 'forced' and I especially like the running scene towards the end between pike/cole and a local runner. I found that passage moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis charms again","review":"I have always enjoyed the sassy but competent Elvis character Crais has created as well as the somber, enegmatic Joe Pike. Easy to read, some good reparte, an interesting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Solid Elvis","review":"To know Elvis Cole is to enjoy him. Once again, Craig brings his excellent dialogue, intriguing plot lines and sense of humor to life. Crais writes as well as anyone in this genre. Additionally, each time he takes on different topics in which to set his mysteries. In Voodoo River Elvis takes his \\"world's greatest detective\\" agency to Louisiana and enters the worlds of adopted children growing to middle age and immigration. Despite the change in locale away from LA, Mr. Crais does not a miss a beat. If you are an Elvis fan this is everything you have come to expect. If you have not yet met him, you will enjoy him and look forward to finding another Elvis book. Crais' writing style enhances the telling of terrific story lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"When's the movie coming out?","review":"Having just read Hostage, Demolition Angel, and LA Requiem, I am now reading Voodoo River. I guess you could say that I like Robert Crais\\" writing.The back page always refers to Mr. Crais' credentials as a screenwriter for LA Law and Hill Street Blues, both excellent TV shows from years gone by. Why hasn't any of his books been considered for full-length movies? It seems to be a natural consequence, given his prior work.I can't help but visualize each of the characters, especially, Joe Pike. I think of Jan Michael Vincent as Joe Pike, cat-like, etc.Given the success this year of the movie version of Mystic River, I think it might be time to consider one of Crais' novels for a similar treatment. The difficulty lies in deciding which one to do first. LA Requiem was good for the action and character of Joe Pike. Might be a good one to begin with. I'll have to read the rest of the books so I can assess them all.Later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of the mark","review":"I started reading Elvis Cole with the five-star LA Requim--and was hooked.

The plot started off okay but just kept getting weaker and weaker and then totally bombed at the end. The ending was just too contrived. The characters, mostly, didn't seem real. The romance seemed unrealistic. Even the setting -- not far from James Lee Burke bayou country -- lacked Burke's superior narration and authentic feel. Crais should have ceded Lousiana to Burke and stayed home in L.A. Crais' books seem to be very good or, well, not so good. Sadly, this one falls into the latter category. He's a much better writer than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"VOODOO RIVER","review":"THIS BOOK WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO READ UNTIL YOU FINISH IT. NO SETTING IT DOWNAND COMING BACK TO IT LATER."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Second Half was Tired and Cliched","review":"I've read most of the Elvis Cole series, and this is by far one of the worst ones. This book has the feel of two different novels pasted together. The first half is very intriguing, where Elvis has to search for a Television star's biological parents. Elvis searches Louisiana and comes up with even more mysteries and secrets, making it interesting and a page turner. I almost felt the anxiety and the hot muggy air when I read the first half.Then, all of a sudden, a horrible travesty of a book breaks out. Suddenly, Elvis somehow becomes involved in multi mob-boss fighting and immigration issues involving government stings, racial tensions from long ago, and horribly over-sentimental goals. The fluidity of the book is lost. The motivations and character involvement's are convoluted at best. Compared to the first half of the book, the second half is pure garbage.Crais took a good book and sabotaged it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis In The Bayou","review":"Elivs Cole, the self-proclaimed \\"World's Greatest Detective,\\" is back again for his fifth novel. This time, Elvis leaves the west coast, and takes on Louisiana.Cole is hired by a popular television personality to find her biological parents in Louisiana. Upon his investigation, he finds a lot more than meets the eye, and people begin to wind up dead. When Cole's \\"silent partner,\\" Joe Pike is brought in, they uncover an illegal alien operation, causing a lot more problems.Robert Crais does another fantastic job in developing the storyline. He peppers his writing with sardonic dialogue and witty humor. He develops some outstanding characters, bringing the story together quite nicely at the end. Although the ending seemed to be slightly rushed, the novel is an overall excellent read. Crais does another stand-up job of creating a solid, cohesive plot that is fun to read. VOODOO RIVER will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff!","review":"This is zydeco that leans heavily on traditional Rock'n Roll. I first saw Zachary Richard on stage with Jimmy Buffett at a concert I attended. I was impressed, and proceeded to buy the first recording of his music that I could find. I was lucky that this was the one. I have since bought other albums, and though I like them as well, this is the best. From the rocking title track to the soulful Cote Blanche Bay and on & on this album is one of my favorites. It isn't pure Zydeco, but it is GOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It","review":"This disc is so good it makes you want to cry. Until Zachary Richard, Cajun music was stuck in a rut.

When June hits, I will reattach the vent to the outside wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Advertised","review":"First let me start by saying, \\"this product is extremely poorly made.\\" Secondly, it was advertised as coming with: \\"Includes a 4-Inch by 8-Foot ProFlex UL 2158A dryer transition duct,\\" which wasn't anywhere to be found. This is made of very thin plastic and the parts do not fit together well so there are open seams which allow air (and lint) to escape into your room. The damper is also poorly made and allows air to escape the unit into the \\"closed\\" duct so it isn't very effective. Another negative aspect of this device is that there are no mounting brackets or fixtures for keeping this on or against your wall. So please consider it's going to cost you more for mounting brackets, additional duct work, better clamps (comes with zip ties) and that this product doesn't work effectively.

The two pieces that make up the housing don't form a hermetic seal (not that you can't just use some foil tape or duct seal). I installed this rather quickly and sealed things up well.On my test run, I noticed that warm, moist air was blowing right through the vent. Granted, much of the air was deflected outside, so it is better than just dumping all the air into your house.Also, I felt that the lint screen was inadequate. The mesh isn't fine enough to catch the small pieces of lint that make it into the vent. The screen really might as well not even be there.So, I'm back to doing what I did before: remove the duct from the outside vent, point it inward during the winter, and plug up the exterior vent with some insulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to heat your garage.","review":"It installed very quickly. I cut a section of existing vent and placed slid the vent valve in. It has a simple flap that directs the air outside or through the circular opening to the inside. Now I can turn on the dryer and heat the garage very quickly.Good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design very poorly manufactured","review":"This is a great idea that I have used before to good effect.UNFORTUNATELY...This PARTICULAR device - essentially an air valve - is so poorly manufactured that it requires repair BEFORE it can be used. The plastic shell is a two-piece, snap-together affair that doesn't snap together well at all, leaving the interior valve in a warped shell that does not allow the valve to seat properly in either position.I am strongly considering sending this unit back, not for the few bucks (plus shipping) it cost me, but to make the point that there are limits to the junk Amazon.com can foist off on me.Buy another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Piqued by the description, I bought this book for my mom for Christmas. She read it and then lent it to me. I just read it, and am now convinced that I should buy my mom another Christmas present. How disappointing. There is a great deal of interesting content here, however the writing technique (or lack of it) becomes an obstacle to enjoying it. It's like taking a ride in a psychotic New York time machine: The book jumps from thought to thought and from era to era. The services of a ghostwriter would have improved this story immensely.In addition, it appears that the author is making the assumption that her readers are born-and-bred New Yorkers. She has opportunities to expand on aspects of New York life that would be interesting to outsiders, but she chooses not to pursue them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, haunting and where jazz should have been going","review":"In 1991 bassist Charles Fambrough released this record in hte midst of the smooth jazz explosion and it didn't get much play, but it should have. It's where jazz should have been headed: cool, mindful of the past, eye always on the new tales to tell.Fambrough writes an incredible song and leads a band arrangement like a master, picking the right songs and the right players for every track. He uses heavy hitters and it's a shame that this record passed under the radar of so many people. You can tell he was sweating over this record as he ran te tracks through their paces.A great record for traditionalists, and a smooth-enough ride for the smooth jazzers who want to expand their tastes a little bit into the history of the form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterfeit","review":"Purchased from 99perfume, this has nothing to do with Dunhill d which I used long time ago and was very familiar with it.

This is a DVD of an old, non-enhanced kinescope of a show filmed by the USO to be distributed to the troops in the 1950s. As one reviewer commented, Bing sings White Christmas and introduces the show, but it's not a Christmas show. There are film clips of 50 or more stars doing one song or comedy bit each. It's interesting to see them, and some talented newcomers are also featured. Miyoshi Umeki, for instance, sings a beautiful ballad. I would like to get the retrospective Crosby special hosted by Kathryn Crosby and Gene Kelly, which is the DVD described by Amazon, even though, as one reviewer noted, the excerpts are short and too often marred by voice-over narration.

Quite frankly there isn't really anything \\"amazing\\" about this album. Unlike other influential indie groups like My Bloody Valentine or Galaxie 500 - who drenched themselves in the glory of the Velvet Underground, invoked swooning, hungry guitar leads/solos and created something fresh-sounding as a result - the Feelies seem content to play fairly straight-on indie rock, with little pretension or poetry. One wouldn't think this to be much of a strength, but the band manages to create solid rhythms and riffs, with compelling guitar noodling over the top. In a word, the Feelies are irresistable.

I've been dyin' to read this book.In the past I've quite enjoyed Pevear and Volokhonsky, because I don't know who wrote what, and both of them are smashing authors. We get two perspectives on Anna and Vronsky, dipping and coiling, luring home answers this side of miraculous. If there's such a character as 'God', then gimme his favorite book. Anna Karenina, the English version surpassing all others.--I'm sure the previous reviewer thought Leonard Kent got the same voice--and shut up entirely--Tolstoy rules!Yeah, we're all pretty glorious re-interpreting someone's voice when explaining God's final, glorious masterpiece.. . . in my opinion anyway . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Boring!","review":"Some of my recent favorite books include: She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb, The Way the Crow Flies by Ann-Marie MacDonald, and My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult.When I picked up Anna Karenina, I thought I might have found a treasure. However, after I started reading it, I found the book to be incredibly boring and hard to follow. There were too many details, none of which were that interesting. I kept skipping through pages of words that seemed to drone on and on just to finish the story. It was a tedious text and extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is major stuff","review":"Tolstoy is a very profound and genius author and intelligent readers have always been drawn to his work. All his best work is grand and masterful and \\"major\\" with a capital M. War and Peace is this dramatic tale of the Napoleonic invasion in Russia and the lives of three aristiocratic families. But my favorite is his Anna Karinina, an unbelievably moving and absorbing work despite its length. It's about a married woman's passion for a young officer and her tragic fate. As far as true classics go, this is one of the biggies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book of great character","review":"If you enjoy characters as much as I do, you too will fall in love with this book.

Tolstoy addresses a multitude of themes in Anna Karenina: infidelity, faith in God, love, politics, and more. It's scope is wider and more ambitious than almost any novel you will find. What's more amazing is that Tolstoy makes it all work. The main characters are all well developed, particularly Levin. I will admit that the book does drag in spots, and the multitude of names gets confusing at times, but keep going! It is well worth the effort. A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penguin Publishing's contempt for Kindle and libraries","review":"Having been notified by DigitalLibrary NJ that my copy of Anna Karenina was ready to be checked out, I went through all the clicks and was stopped cold by Amazon's note that the publisher would not permit direct downloads to Kindle and that I would have to download this LONG book onto my computer and then transfer it to my Kindle. WTF? Can anyone shed any light on why publishers such as Penguin are permitted to actively show their contempt for libraries and the millions of people who enjoy borrowing a book using modern electronic methods by making the process so ponderous?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Disappointed","review":"I thought that this would be a good book to read for my AP Literature class because I had heard that it was a great novel despite its daunting length. I found the book to be full of farming and political details unnecessary to the plot, the plot lacking in a definite climax, and the ending concerning Levin's realization and acceptance of God being completely unrelated to the first 800 pages. Anna Karenina, who is supposible the heroine of the novel, I found to be completely selfish and tried to shape the rules to her liking. She thought it to be totally unfair that she was deprived of society and of her son. She made the conscious decision to have an affair and was unwilling to accept the consequences of that decision. The only pleasure I received from this book was Levin and Kitty's relationship and their romance. All in all, this read was a complete disappointment and waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long and too slow","review":"I tend to read Oprah's picks, otherwise I doubt I would have read this book.

Is Kitty going to marry Levin?Maybe I missed something, but to me it was long and often boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded novel","review":"This is an extremely long-winded book and I would urge anyone wanting to read it, to rather read an abridged version. The author takes numerous side trips which have nothing whatsoever to do with the story.

Thank you Oprah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just watch \\"The Young and the Restless\\" or something","review":"I don't know why everybody thinks this is great literature. If it weren't Tolstoy, everybody would see it for what it is--a soap opera in print. At least the main plot is. I don't know what the point of the subplot with Kitty and Levin is, except to make the book a few hundred pages longer and a lot more boring.Seriously, if you want decent literature with similar characters and stories, go read Jane Austen or Vanity Fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read translation","review":"Usually I don't read translations. English is my second language, so if I want to read a foreign book, I read it in my first language. But I don't like carrying heavy books with me, so to be able to read this book from the Kindle, I gave it a try. And it's not bad! I don't have a hard time understanding it. But one thing that I thought was weird or inaccurate was, in the first chapter of the Part 4, it talks about about a foreign prince visiting a harem in Turkey? Harem literally means the prohibited area, so a man can't just walk into a harem unless it's his, so I'm thinking maybe it meant to say \\"hamam\\",which means Turkish bath? Any thoughts on that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Expansive and Thoughtful Exposition","review":"The Rosemary Edmonds translation of Anna is quite good, though Tolstoy's narrative structure impresses the reader with a sense of detachment from the characters. The words themselves appear similar between Tolstoy and the characters, but the characters are lively; Tolstoy is cold, unemotional and absolutely unfeeling towards Anna herself. Maybe this is what gives the people in his novel such life and such depth. Or perhaps it's just a result of the translation. Take the time to appreciate the soliloquies of Anna and Levin. Try to drag yourself through Tolstoy's ramblings on the relationship between the upper and lower classes. Sympathize with poor Anna. Detest Karenin for his cold heart, but forgive him anyway. Don't be disappointed at Levin's revelation; it is unoriginal and flawed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Towering Work And A Brilliant Translation","review":"You see a copy of \\"Anna Karenina\\" on a book shelf, pick it up,it weighs some, at well over eight hundred pages it should, you think,\\"Am I up for this?\\" It's a daunting event to undertake, even though it enjoys the reputation of being one of the greatest novels ever written,it is a committment. Should one read it just to say you have, will it be worth it? I was hooked by page three and spent the next few weeks immersed in this complete and fascinating world created by Count Tolstoy. It is a masterpiece of character display and intriguing story developments. I'm not going to give the \\"Cliff Notes\\" summary of the plot, needless to say, there's a great story between these pages, it has survived since the 1880's with good reason. I will never forget my time with Anna and Count Vronsky and Levin and all the vivid characters that populate Moscow and St Petersburg in this masterpiece. (And now, on to, \\"War And Peace\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Anna Karenina\\" Leo Tolstoy, translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky","review":"An excellent new translation of the Tolstoy classic; Pevear and Volokhonsky have given the novel a fresh, new feeling. I have read other translations several times in the past, but reading this version was a rediscovery of a Tolstoy novel that explores the many facets of love among the Russian artistocracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Although the premise is a familiar one of the period (beautiful married woman finds love in an affair that ultimately ends in tragedy and self-destruction), Anna Karenina's tale, while entertaining, was less important than Levin's spiritual journey, which I think was the most compelling and moving part of the book. The conclusions he reaches give us fulfillment, whereas if the story was just about Anna it would be a masterpiece still-although far less profound and meaningful. The conclusions Levin reaches about life and God are ones that I still think are relevant today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for Everyone","review":"I thought this book was excellent. There was something for everyone in it -- you could read it for pure entertainment -- the story is just as good as a Jane Austen novel, but the characters revealed lots of about themselves that made you think about all kinds of things (motives, religion, relationships, the female role in society) -- all of which is still relevant today. I felt like I learned a lot about myself and my own motivations, including the ones I might normally hide from myself, by reading this book.What I also liked was the translation. Again, the book was easy to read, but it also explained, through simple footnotes in the back, things that might not be clear, due to the period or unfamiliar aspects of Russion culture/politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"well how do you review a classic? and be as honest as you desire to be. so many words have already been spent on reviewing this book. still, an attempt i do make.insightful engaging and relevant. and will continue to be for as long as we survive as a race. a human story. a common story. for the simple reason that one sees oneself in atleast one of the characters.anna and levin two extreames,formed from the same personality. the condemned anna and the righteous levin.shocking was the condemnation of anna by the author in his abrupt dissappearace of her after her death. and also missed the anna that is reflected in her introductory pages, as she comes to resolve her brothers family issues.the beauty and strength reflected therin came to an abrupt end.i felt i was reading a story of two annas.still a un putdownable. and utterly beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be intimindated, it's an amazingly engrossing read!","review":"I've avoided this one for years -- Russian literature, voluminous small print, you name it.

Don't let the size or age of this one put you off, you are going to LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Viking should have done better","review":"its a shame that Viking did not give their translation of Anna Karenina the same kind of handsome editions Knopf produced for Volkhonskya & Pevear's War & Peace, Tolstoy's short works and Dostoyevski translations.The Knopf editions of Crime & Punishment and Demons, with their cloth boards, gold emboss, heavy paper and fine art jackets are especially fine and beautifully compliment the artistic merit of the prose they contain.In this case, the physical production of the book does not match the foreverness of the text. The design of the book and jacket make a it an ugly stepsister when shelved with the other Pavear/ Volkhonskaya hardcovers.i know this isn't a helpful review, but i did want to say it for the record."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a poor translation compared with Rosemary Edmonds ...","review":"This version of the book is a sad replacement for the Rosemary Edmonds's translation. It simply does not read as well as her translation and, if you look closely, you'll realize that Pevear and Volokhonsky often just reversed sentence order, combined two sentences by making one a phrase (or visa-versa), or chose different, less descriptive adjectives than Ms. Edmonds. It is very likely that these two translators had her translation in front of them as they worked. In the end, it is sad that Penguin Classics chose to replace a nice translation with this pretty mediocre one."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE EDITION","review":"This review pertains to the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition, ISBN number: 978-0-14-303500-8 Don't get me wrong, this is a great book so far..until you reach page 234, then because of a GLARING misprint, it goes back to page 203, then continues on repeating pages 203 back up to 234. Of course after hitting page 234 for the second time, it jumps to page 267, leaving out around ten chapters or so, making the novel completely unreadable. DO NOT BUT THIS EDITION!! AMAZON!! STOP SELLING THIS EDITION. There are plenty of other versions out there, avoid this one at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Majestic...in size and in content","review":"Tolstoy is just powerful...with his words. He talks about everything, describes every aspect of the surrounding down to the very last intricate detail. The result? An extremely enthralling and moving book. Apart from the widely discussed infidelity and love themes, this book manages to transport the reader to Russia in the 19th century, and to blend into the background whilst Anna and Vronsky's sordid affair takes place. The translation was wonderful; it is hard to believe that this isn't the original. I did however, wish I knew Russian so I could experience Tolstoy's actual work.I loved this book. I read it long before Oprah decided to add it to her book club, and so I have the Oxford Classics edition, which isn't as nice to look at and the translation is slightly different. This however, does not influence the book's distinction as one of greatest novels ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Endurance Test","review":"Long, drawn out, &, at times, boring. At one point the book goes on for eons while a character mows grass! Anna Karenina takes the title character through every conceivable aspect of an adulterous affair -tediously. I read this with a friend a few years back. It took me 2 months to get through the book. I would not recommend this book, especially to a casual reader. I can't believe I managed to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing Style but not much plot","review":"The book's characters revisit the same topics over and over again.Levin interests in farming is over explored as well as other topics. The prose is crafted nicely but the book would have been better if it was shorter and did not digress as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to wade through","review":"Possibly the most difficult book of all of Tolstoy to wade though in my opinion. Very slow pacing and a setting that is hard to relate to today. The characters themselves lend some interest and I can see how the characters and their situations would lead a major celebrity to endorse this for a reading club, but unless you genuinely enjoyed War and Peace or other classic tomes, be realistic with yourself and recognize the odds are slim that you'll finish this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven page edges","review":"The pages on this book were cut unevenly so that when you try to turn a page you may turn more than one due to the next page being indented.

I do not understand how people can think this is a great novel. Nothing about this book makes sense to me including the world's opinion that it is a great book. The characters were not interesting and their lives were as shallow as a mud puddle. Despite the book's title, I didn't think that Anna was even the main character. It seemed like the author was getting paid by the word because most of the words in this book are superfluous. I kept plugging along thinking that the ending would redeem the book, but I was sorely disappointed. I have now read almost 100 books that are generally considered classics. This is the worst classic I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW.. this was really BORING","review":"I always read classics among other things, I assume that they're classics for a reason so I picked up this book expecting a work of art. What I found was the longest, most tedious and most boring book I've ever read. By page 120 I already didn't care about what happened in the book. I kept reading it just to say I read Anna Karenina, but it was REALLY not worth it. I also ended up skipping pages of little side stories that added nothing to the plot or the book itself as well as endless repetitive descriptions of scenery.Seriously, sit down and watch paint dry, you'll have more fun and it will go by a lot quicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy-","review":"I do think the story line is good.

I gave up around page 527, and believe me, it was a struggle to get that far! I got to the point of not caring what happened next. I truthfully believe that Tolstoy wanted to publish a political novel on life in Russia but was told he needed to add a bit of intrigue for it to sell. I never again want to read a \\"romance\\" novel where 30 pages are wasted describing how fields were \\"mowed\\" in Russia 100 or so years ago!!! This book has been described as a panoramic view of life in Russia, and BOY are they not kidding...if you want to read a story that takes twenty pages to describe something that a modern day writer would only need one page to do, then this book is for you!! Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Literature!!!","review":"This is an amazing book to pick up if you are interested in Russian literature. Although it is a long book it is a quick read.

I have thoroughly enjoyed learning about the lives of aristocrats in pre-communist Russia. I think that this will become a favorite book for me, and I think I will understand it better each time I read it. I gave this a 4 out of 5 because of the lofty idealogical dialogue. I wasn't completely prepared for all that because most reviews only say it's a love story. I was definately more interested in the plotlines involving the characters than the ideas about government and politics that were presented. It would have been advantageous to read this in a book club or classroom setting where discussion is encouraged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic","review":"This novel is the story of not only Anna Karenina, and how one decision has such a disastrous impact on her life; it is the inter-twining stories of her relatives and friends living in the Russian aristocracy. This is a story about relationships, and opinions, and it explores how they are never clear-cut; and how opinions and feelings can and will change over time.I have been wanting to read this book for a long time. But the size of the book and the Russian names made me put the book down. I decided to give the book a try and am so glad I did.

Although the Peak District (Britain) environs and characters are nicely hewn, the tale is unstartling and tedious in the extreme: good-hearted (but troubled) local boy pairs up with baggage-laden witchy outsider to solve the case of the decade. Yawn. I did at least learn (in way too much detail) how to make a pig dung heap.Spend some quality time with great material like \\"A Small Death in Lisbon\\" and pass this over.

The author does a great job setting the scene and the local characters are believable. The dialog was also crisp and realistic. However, I could not connect with his protagonists. They both had so many hidden psychological traumas that it detracted from the main story. I found myself skimming the chapters devoted to them in favor of getting through the story!

I read the reviews, and thought that I had surely missed something. So, I looked for the fast paced, well-written and atmospheric novel, as well as the illusive 'aha' moments I'd missed the first time. When I had finished the second reading, I was surprised that the same shallow characters, flimsy plot, and adolesent wet dreams had not disappeared, nor had it reincarnated into borderline literature, or even pulp fiction fit for the loo. Believing my taste buds had died, I passed-on this book to friends as I do all thrillers and mysteries. I am pleased to report that the book has proved to be of some value, it has become a metaphor: 'a black dog' is anything not worth the space it occupies upon the earth. t"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb,Exciting,a New British Look!","review":"Well and superbly done!

A great read and I am looking forward to the next eleven. Very detailed descriptions of the Yorkshire Dales and the quirks and personalities of the inhabitants although at times I found I was skipping whole paragraphs of (unnecessary?) detail wanting to get on with the story. Much tension is developed in the relationship between 'nice guy' Ben Cooper and the cold, tormented Diane Fry ...How will this be sustained/resolved over another eleven or more books in the series?A very satisfying, 'meaty' read with plenty of humour to alleviate the sometimes darker side of the personal lives of key characters. The conclusion was as unexpected as it was rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"War as seen by the Brits","review":"In this book you would have thought that Britannia rules the world single handed, no mention is made of the fact that the rickety British Empire, rotten to the core, was upheld not by the grace of Godm or the might of the Dreadnoughts, but by American finance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intresting anime romantic comedy.","review":"First off, this is my first review of any anime. This animeis a romantic comedy targetted mainly toward single male guyslooking for a girl (similar to oh my goddess) but with significantly more character development. On this first dvd,you are introduced to the characters of Hinata Sou; eachof the characters have their various quirks. And each of theseare revealed when Keitaro moves into this exclusively girl onlyinn, after failing to get into Tokyo U. A wide range of rathercompromising scenes, i.e: Narusegawa touches Keitaros ummm....although they may have removed it from the us release, providethe basis for the slapstick humor involved. It gets evenmore zany as well....With its wide variety of slapstick humor, fairly complicated development, and rather well designed artwork (after reading about 95% of the manga and the series itself), I'm sure you'll find it an intresting and worth purchasing anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradise...or so Keitaro thought...","review":"From the great Ken Akamatsu, Love Hina another Romance/Comedy series. There have been quite a few now and very much alike. IE Ai Yori Aoshi, Chobits, Oh My Goddess! etc etc though i dont think they're quite as good as Love Hina.Awesome characters all of which have a decent background. Packed full of awkward and hilarious moments, Love Hina is a Romance/Comedy series well worth watching, also be sure to check out the Specials and Final piece Love Hina Again. And to avoid any Confusion they should be watched in the following order...Love Hina TV, Xmas Special, Spring Special and ofcourse Love Hina Again. Also keep in mind that there is a Special Episode on the Xmas Special disc Episode 25! Cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hee, Hee Hilarious","review":"Love Hina is a hilarious DVD (much better then the books in my opinion) the english dubbed is a little strange it makes some of the characters sound dorky, and I don't really like the front cover, but disregarding those two things this is a hilaroius, fast paced show. It is about a boy(keitaro) who by lying becomes the manager of an all girls apartment! Keitaro has been trying to get into Tokyo-U but he has failed his entrance exams three times. He is also looking for this girl he made a promise to 15 years ago. The characters are all great (expissaslly su) but the beginning of the first one is a little but strange. The drawings are wonderful and creative and I like all those guys who walk through the village. But if you're into big action/andeventure and fighting stuff this anime isn't for you. But if you like cute funny strange romances like marmalade boy or Kodocha you will love Love Hina (sorry that sounded kinda strange) So anyways a vey good Anime, worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"I have heard about this series for a long time and when i finaly got it i loved it. Simply put this anime is amazing, fun and adictive. You will find yourself watching it many times before you even think about thinking about something else and when your bored just buy the next one (its just this easy!) The thing i liked best are the cute girls (Especialy Naru, that girl is hot!).....ahem....Well seriously this DVD is great. Just go out and buy it. You will enjoy every minute of it and then when its over you will be begging for more fun times with the Love Hina Crew. A definate buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst comedy/romance anime of all time","review":"Love Hina is one of the worst comedy/romance anime that I have ever seen. The main character, Keitaro Urashima, is so incredibly annoying actually so is the most of the other female character in Love Hina. Mainly the humor being used in this anime mostly has to do with incidents that being wrongly accused of Keitaro for being pervert and get beaten up by Naru Narusegawa.I didn't actually bought this anime series which I am so glad that I didn't, although I do regretted for having to rented up to volume 4 of Love Hina, therefore I didn't liked this series I did watched up to episodes 16. I still can't stand this series as I watch along through volume 4. Storyline was weak nothing really interesting happen throughout the whole 16 episodes for me.Do get me wrong I actually like comedy/romance anime very much myself, in fact my favorite anime of all the time is Ah My Goddess TV series. (Not the OVA, the OVA was okay but not as great as the TV series)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't think of a title","review":"Although this anime was funny, a whole lot better than Ai Yori Aoshi, it's still a waste of time and money. Why do I even bother to review when all I watch is shojou? Well, because I can. Never buy an anime with the main character as a male because usually they turn out to be some sick fantasy such as this anime. A guy living with a bunch of attractive females, yeah, okay. Dream on."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's probably worse if you've read the manga.","review":"I've watched and read the whole Love Hina series and the video is just horrible. The story in the video is just bad and shows the creators mental need to be the center of its world with three characters that represent himself. Use your money to buy other videos series or the manga of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best comedy i've ever seen","review":"love hina is the best comedy anime ever the only problem i have with it is the dubing, the voice actors just arent right for the characters. but dont let that get in your way af getting this great series. i just switch it to japanese and turn on the subtitles. i love this series so much im collecting the manga and the dvds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Hina!","review":"To begin with, I am normally a fan of action anime (such as Evangelion), but this particular anime has won me over. With spectacular animation (though the animals all look odd) and splendid humour, this anime cannot go wrong. The characters are all very well developed and have many more layers then you initially see. The plot flows splendidly and keeps you into it every step. After watching the entire series three times, I can only hope that more will be made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good anime, BAD DUBing","review":"I saw the original Love Hina in Japanese before it was even licensed in the US. It's a great anime, a must watch for all anime fans. However, the official dub is utterly horrible. Shinobu, Kaolla and Mistune sound like they are adult women with southern accents. Shinobu and Kaolla are under 14. And Mistune is 18. While on the topic of US voice actors, none of the voices fit the characters at all. Also, the translation is pretty bad. It's been dummied down, for censorship and aimed at a younger US audience. The sub title wasn't too bad. It's a lot closer to the original storyline then the dub. If you truly wish to enjoy Love Hina, you need to turn off English dub, listen to it in Japanese and watch the sub title. It's the only way to watch this anime with the poor job done in the dub."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 Romantic Comedy Anime (at least that's what I think)","review":"Love Hina is my personal favorite anime next to Gundam and others. It is really, really funny with lots of twists in it. The story line is amazing and not confusing at all. Once I watched the first episode, I knew that I needed the other Volumes. In other words, it's about a guy named Keitaro Urashima who made a promise with a girl 15 yrs. ago to get into Todai (Tokyo U.), the only thing is he doesn't remember what she looks like or her name... Find out what else happens by watching this great anime series, there is no doubt that you will love it if you are a anime fan or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Anime All Around","review":"This is a wonderful show with a great sense of humor. Sure, the panty shots of Naru and the other girls gets repetetive, but they're usually followed by some gret humor or punchline. Kitsune does have a Southern accent in the English dub, but the translators took Kitsune's character, which is apparently from Southern Japan, and tried to keep it close to the original dialect, hence the Southern. I prefer the Japanese, which features the always amazing Megume Hayashibara in a smaller role for once, unusual for her. Overall, this is a great show and will make you laugh with the jokes and animation style, which is very clean and great-looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great Anime!","review":"This is one of the greatest anime ever! I love the plot and the characters. I bought the first 2 DVD's at an Animation Convention (Otakon 2002) and I just got hooked! I like Kitsune and Naru who are really great in the formation of the story. Keitaro is a great guy and funny, but the thing is how can he survive all those beatings from the girls in the dorm? He must heal fast to be back on his feet the next day. I wish I was a landlord of a girl's dorm. I wonder what it would be like? If the girls are like the ones in Love Hina then I'm in. One-of-a-kind people there are in the story. It's also motivational too. It teaches that you should never give up no matter what happens. \\"Overcome all obstacles\\" that's what I learned. It really made me think about myself and my life. Okay! Enough about me. Otherwise, this is a great DVD and you should get the whole series. I know I will! Buy it or regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for everyone maybe?","review":"although this show seems to be popular based on other reviews (so it must have *something* going for it), i must warn the anime fan that this series might not be for you. if you like interesting, thought-provoking, original (etc etc) anime, don't bother with this. everything is a total cliche and the humor is all sophmoric... i wasn't impressed. if you are interested in the series, i recommend you watch the christmas special (which was okay) and then wash your hands of the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic and not worth the politics","review":"Those attempting to read this work are advised to keep a copy of a map of Jerusalem nearby.

Their style of writing and answering the questions was inconsistant at best, and downright deceptive at worst. Some questions ask for multiple answers, others that need more than one answer do not indicate it. If your real desire was to be paralyzed by fear that you may leave out a possible answer on the test, then this is the book for you. By the time that I got to the last tests in this book, I was so afraid of not checking enough answers, or checking too many, that I just flipped to the answers and looked it up. There are a whole slew of practice tests out there. Pay to unlock that questions on the CD in the Michael Myers book, or find another resource. You will learn more, and have more confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete &#65533; 1998 Edition","review":"This book is a mediocre test prep book churned out for the 1998 test objectives.Since then, the A+ exams have been revamped and rewritten several times over.

It did point out some of the things that I did need to study up on... IRQs, I/Os etc... Know them cold! But, it went about it in a manner that really pi***d me off. The manner in which questions needed to be answered was inconsistant. Several times the answer was just \\"Best Fit, single choice.\\" and others, it was \\"Select all that apply\\" with no indications which was which.Overall I just used it as a method of pointing out where my weaknesses were, and you should not rely on it as an accurate representation of the actual exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book - wait for the 2nd edition.","review":"The book has a wide array of errors, some that are not easily caught.

But for a fan of shoegazer, dream pop, alternative, singer-songwriter, this should be required listening. It's a sadly overlooked disc, well worth the price. Yes melancholy, moody, brooding. But not morbid or morose - it's delivered with a positive and hopeful outlook on life. Great music for inclement weather (but I doubt the title was a pun based on that thought). The sounds and what it evokes are like great Impressionist paintings and music - very imaginative. The lyrics are very in-house, microcosmic, even mundane, and so some look down on the disconnect with such grand production - some think it's overwrought. But a more right-brained listen yields greater enjoyment. One of the top alt discs of the 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Past...","review":"I first heard this wonderful record in the basement of Bleecker Street Records 19 years after it was released and have been playing it almost nonstop ever since.

It feels like the keyboard on an ultraportable laptop. Very limited key btravel but I can type pretty quickly on it; probably 30-45 words/minute. On a regular keyboard I'm 45-60 wpm.

After receiving the product, I find out:* The Over-the-air driver's link is broken. (From Igo Tech Support)* The CD that comes with is outdated. ((From Igo Tech Support)* Even though Amazon advertises it as \\"for Blackberry\\", it does not work with the most recent Blackberry models!!!!Their website says it supports the Curve 8300. DO NOT make the mistake of thinking that it will work for the whole 8300 series. The tech support person said that he is not aware of any current plans to support this model and I should return it to Amazon. Ofcourse, since I have opened the keyboard, I wont even get a refund from Amazon.I wish when Amazon is pushing a product through a high-profile \\"Gold Box\\" deal as a keyboard \\"for Blackberries\\", it would do a better job of warning its customers of such importand product support exceptions. Very very disappointed with IGo and Amazon. The whole affair really sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I purchased this keyboard because of a business trip. It was for the Blackberry 7290, and it does not work with this model. It would be nice to see some more specifics on what models it supports; especially since it says it supports Blackberry right in the title. Customer service was not great either. I asked about receiving a refund for shipping in addition, and never got a straight answer. Feel free to take your chance, but, personally I would rather buy it somewhere else like I did and pay a few extra dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item but watch for a sale","review":"I bought this last year when the price was substantially lower. It works beautifully with the AT&T Tilt, and with the adjustable holder, can hold the phone in either vertical or landscape mode. This is a much lighter and somewhat smaller keyboard than I used with my iPAQ, but quite satisfactory -- it does what you want it to do, which is provide an alternative method of data entry and allow you to travel without a bulky laptop and still get real work done. Hopefully the price will drop again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard","review":"Just as other reviewers said, this bluetooth keyboard worked fine with my Dell X30, too. It's really cute. One star gone because they used cheap lable sticker on the keyboard and it's really not easy to get rid of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great with Nokia 770","review":"This product works great with the Nokia 770 (Internet Tablet). It has a great feel when typing --quiet, but with a tactile and noiseless click -- folds up to an easy-to-carry size, and looks pretty stylish, too. I also like that the fold-out PDA support stand can be removed if you find a better arrangement for supporting your portable device.Downside (very slight): If you do a lot of number crunching, get the keyboard with the dedicated number keys; otherwise, entering numbers is a little cumbersome, requiring a press of the left Fn key before each number entry. Also, the latch required to fold the keyboard back up is a little hard to operate and feels like it might be the most vulnerable to breakage. It would be improved by a pushbutton type release instead of the slide catch. Overall though, I get the feeling that if you treat this keyboard with the same respect with which it was designed, it'll give you lots of great service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eh","review":"I bought the ThinkOutside Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard because I thought that it would be a great help to word processing/note taking/ and internet browsing. Turns out I'm really not using this much.*Take this review with a grain of salt.*The connection interface (with my Palm TX) is a bit clunky, especially when you try to set up the secure connection. I've given up, but the unsecured is fine. Haven't noticed any lag, but I feel the keyboard design has some flaws. Mainly, whenever you open/close, it feels very forced. A lot of resistance, so something is definitely bending. I've also noticed some small cracks around the aluminum exterior, but nothing big. When you do fold it, it as small as a pocketbook so you can easily carry it with you in like a overcoat pocket.Networking and product design, I'd give it both a 4/5. In terms of use and practicality, 5/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blackberry 8130/pearl unsupported","review":"This keyboard feels nice and solid yet there is just no support for my blackberry 8130.

The web site does not list the Mogul as one of the products it works with but I found I could use the Cingular 8525 driver. My only complaint is the awful sticker they put on it. I had to use WD40 to remove it!! Otherwise the keyboard is incredible especially at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck installing this!","review":"Doesn't work with Blackberry 8703E which the company declines to announce. Took a week to get through to support for me to finally get a hold of them after being on hold for 45 miuntes and then to have them tell me there are no drivers for the Blackberry 8703E. <grumble> And then as far as the actual packing goes? Who's the genius that figured it was a good idea to put a sticker covering 1/4 of the keys on the keyboard? Did I mention that the sticker has something to the equivalent of industrial strength super glue on it?!?! I spent a good hour working on that just trying to get the remaining sticker off. Over all, I wish it would have worked but if you have a Blackberry 8703E, DO NOT buy this. It will not work. Also if you need help, set aside a good hour or so to wait on hold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably great, but can't get it to work.","review":"Well, we've tried all the sites mentioned for possible drivers - but the blackberry is a year old, so maybe we can get it to work when we get a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works... sometimes","review":"Great when it works, but sometimes there is a long delay before character appears.

It's also heavier than others on the market (by twice). There is also a long lag each time I start up typing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works For Me","review":"The product works well with my Nokia N95 8GB using the built in wireless keyboard application. Though I dislike having to press a function key to input numbers, I don't use it very often and the keyboard performs well enough for my limited needs. I probably would not recommend it for frequent or lengthy periods of text entry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Works well. Documentation could be more complete.

Functional, not quite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky \\"H\\" key and flimsy construction","review":"I opened the package and decided to get used to the keyboard before installing it. The \\"H\\" key sticks when I opened the keyboard and after I tried to loosen the \\"H\\" key again, it popped up. I pressed the key once more and it sticked again. After four attempts to unstick the key, the \\"H\\" key flew off the keyboard and it was lost. The rubber casing that gave the key its springy feel vanished along with my \\"H\\" key.All the other keys seem to work fine. Keyboard construction seemed flimsier than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for Palm OS","review":"This product is now a universal product--not just compatible with Pocket PCs. I have a Palm Zire 72 and this keyboard works great with it! If you have a Palm, just go to the Think Outside webpage and download the drivers for Palm, then do a HotSync. Pretty simple. Anyway, on to the review:Good:1. Comes with nice, padded case2. Folds up easily into a small, mobile size3. Makes entering data or surfing the web MUCH, MUCH faster4. Bluetooth allows great range (well over 100 ft. from what I can tell, but this doesn't really matter since you can't read your PDA screen from very far anyway)5. Detachable standBad:1. A little pricey for a keyboard, but WELL worth it2. Installation is no plug-n-play (especially for Palm users)I would highly recommend this! My only regret is that I didn't purchase this weeks ago when I didn't think it was compatible with Palms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Fine!","review":"I must admit to being a little afraid when I took it out of the box-- After all, with the varied models of PPC out there, who can be sure that a product will work on yours specifically? However, the installation went flawlessly, and the only issue I've ever had is that when you close the keyboard, you get a feeling that you might break it-- but you won't! I've dropped this thing a couple times, being a natural klutz, and no harm has yet come to it. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP! Discontinued Product.

This little keyboard actually makes my Nokia N-series phones easier to use for e-mail and messaging than the Nokia E-series devices that have a full keyboard.I've tested this with:Nokia phones: N73, N75, N76, N80, N81, N82, N93, N93i, N95Nokia internet tablets: 770, N800, N810It works well with all of them. It worked well enough that I gave away my Nokia BT folding keyboard and ordered a second one of these.Why only 4 stars? I would actually prefer it to be a bit taller and have an extra row of keys rather than doubling up the numerals. Also, the sticky tape wrapped around the device showing you how to open it for the first time is FAR TOO STICKY; it took me 45 minutes with Goo-Gone to get rid of the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"To many problems","review":"I had problems with:1.

However, after only occasional gentle usage over something longer than a year (perhaps used 10 times in the library) the bracket that makes up the PDA stand snapped in half due to its support wire, making the PDA support useless and closing the keyboard difficult. Customer service said since it is out of warranty my only option is to purchase a new keyboard since they don't make parts available. Does it work? Yes. Will it last? Probably not. Not many other options out there, but be aware this is a very fragile device that, when it breaks, can only be replaced and not repaired."},{"rating":"2","title":"ETEN M600 users","review":"For the keyboard to work with ETEN M600 PDA you have to point the navigator to the company site www.thinkoutside.com FROM YOUR DEVICE connected to the internet where the best driver will be automatically selected and readied for download, download it and install it IN THE DEVICE MEMORY NOT THE SD CARD.Works fine"},{"rating":"2","title":"solid product, could use tweaking","review":"After downloading the drivers from the web site (I read the drivers on the included CD wouldn't work) and installing the keyboard worked right away. Keys have great feel. Not quite the equal of a ThinkPad, but much better than a lot of notebooks.The lack of a separate row of keys for numbers takes some getting used to, partly because typing numbers takes more effort and partly because the keyboard is visually disorienting--I didn't realize how much I use that row to orient myself. The clasp on the right near the enter key gets in the way. The stand for your PDA/phone isn't great. But I'm very picky. It's small, it works well, and I carry it in my bag everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything IO","review":"The Keyboar I bought works fine.The snap in of the extension does not work 100% anymore, maybe this could have been mentioned, but it was sold as used, so as long as it technically works, thats fine, and that it does.Delivery was in time, so everythning alright.I would buy again from this vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"keyboard, would rate minus 5 star","review":"never worked..tried downloading all the repair files to correct the problems. don't waste your time or money. if you want other opinions, use google to search other web sites:-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsupported on Mac.","review":"IGO claims compatibility on the Stowaway Ultra-Slim with Mac based on the logo on their Data Sheet.

I've used it with devices ranging from older Windows Mobile to an iPad, without a problem and literally for years. It is too bad they are no longer made, because I feel that a new market is ready for them.I will say that the keyboard, once unfolded, needs a solid place to be used. Sitting it on your lap is just a bit too wieldy. The keyboard ships with a device holder at the top, but I pulled that off in the first week and have not looked back.

So my Palm T|X and this keyboard work great for me. When I have an idea, I can just pull out the keyboard and churn out a chapter or two. It's so small, it fits into my purse - a big plus because I don't like to carry a big laptop bag everywhere I go. You need a hard surface to type on, it doesn't do well on your lap. It's kind of delicate so you just have to open and close it gently. It loses signal every now and then - not sure if this is because of my Palm T|X or the keyboard. But reconnecting isn't a big deal. I know some people had problems getting it to sync with their T|X, but I didn't have any problems. I bought both items in January 2006, so maybe they've fixed the bugs.

That's annoying but necessary since I only use the keyboard in public places.If you don't mind an unsecure connection it quickly connects the first time, every time.Once it makes the connection, either secure or unsecure, it holds it.

Not only does it technically suck, it sucks in that you have to press a numlock anytime you want to use the number pad, which is annoying and time consuming. After finding that this this is useless, I feel the urge to throw it against the wall. I assume that it will break in pieces if even dropped. If I did get it to work again, it would still be a pain to type because with every keystroke the thing goes flying because it is so flimsy. Definitely the worst buy that I have ever made.

I saw all of the complaints here about the stubborn sticker and while I agree that it was unfortunate, for me at least it wasn't that big of a problem. A little peeling and a bit of Goof-Off cleaner (Goo-Gone would have worked also) and the sticker was history (along with the painted logo on the outer cover, but who cares about that?)! It didn't affect the keys which is the important thing. Anyway, downloaded the drivers from the company site straight to my device, fired everything up and after several tries (my fault for not paying close attention to the instructions) it was working as it should, no problems!

Book is huge and covers a lot of games that i don't think people play anymore. Stats were considered very useful when the book was written but now you can find all that stuff online for free.I found book hard to read because it had very little information about improving your game.I also believe the game evolved since then, so advice is not relevant.

There is such an incredible gold mine of information here that I was forced to use only two or three of his tips until those became second nature. I then added a few more tips and so on. I first read this book over three years ago and I still turn to it constantly and I learn something new every time.

Once, I dropped it from 5 feet onto a sidewalk and it didn't even get a scratch. The outdoor picture quality is excellent, as well as the macro mode, but if you have shaky hands (like me), you will have a ton of blurry pics. The screen just can't compete with new cameras, being too small and dim to see outdoors. The flash is weak, but if you know how to use aperture and ISO settings, indoor shots will turn out pretty good. Personally, I think buyers would be better off buying one of HP's new R-series cameras (R717, R817, etc).

I tried every single type of battery. Make sure you have one or two sets of spares with you. But beware! Be sure you cahnge the batteries before they run out, or you might get strange behaviors like corrupted flash card.-I found the camera very buggy (I might be unlucky).

Filled from beginning to end with gobbledygook such as the inferiority of \\"bourgeois armies,\\" the results of these shallow interviews are devoid of any significant content. I would have loved asking these generals about the incongruity of fighting for \\"liberation\\" on foreign lands while enduring the 42-year-old rule of Fidel Castro in their native land without the benefit of a simple plebiscite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again!","review":"I, sadly, bought this book along with \\"Addicted\\". This is the worst erotica I have ever read in my life. The writing is at a 6th grade level at best. It is dull, empty and so repetitious. The word vacuous comes to mind. I am returning both books and will always remember this...If the author is ashamed to put their name on the cover...there is usually a good reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My friends read this book sayin' it was hot, so I read it.

The descriptions where weak and very often repetitive, a broader use of adjectives and adverbs might possible help to improve these stories. The writer's need to end her stories with a \\"happily ever after\\" cliche' was tired and trite. Overall I found this book to be a very disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sex Chronicles: Shattering the Myth","review":"This is by far one of the most stimulating and enjoyable adult novels I've ever read.

I was hoping to read articulate, well-drafted, passion-evoking stories and ended up reading bad English, misused words and boring, trite stories.I challenge the publishers of Zane's books to locate female writers like me, and many others, that can actually boil readers from the inside with decent English and a colorful, broad vocabulary.Women need to write more, read more and explore more of their sexuality. This book is not the way to start. I am appalled by the number of people that find this work stimulating.Ladies, write you own passion. Be creative and honest.Anna"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasteless Sex","review":"Could the sex in this book have been anymore obnoxious? Sexual freedom is not about women performing demeaning sex acts to prove that they are just as liberal and erotic as men in the bed.....I wont be buying anymore titles from this author.

Shared this book with several friends, they feel the same way I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH BABY!!!","review":"I had no clue what this book was about, but I knew it had to be good because it is written by Zane. When I started reading the book in the book store all I could think was 'WOW'.Zane did a very good job of putting these stories together to make them very erotic and sexy. This book showed me that women can definetly have fun with sex and be out there just like men are. At times the book got really hot and heavy. Whew.I suggest that everyone picks up this book. It doesn't matter how old you are and if you're married or not. The book is universal, No Doubt.:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn in Print???","review":"I'm sorry but this is was disgusting, No plot, No real dialouge, No depth, just trashy and distasteful.

U R ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE ZANE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my personal thoughts. .","review":"The stories in this book were all nice, but the sex wasn't as rough and explicit as it usually is in Zane's books and everyone winds up falling in love and/or married in the end, not bad but, it just didn't call much of my attention like her other books did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissappointment","review":"I've always heard of Zane and how hot her books are, so I thought I'd start with one that was supposed to be one of her best. I'm sorry to say that I don't see what all the hype is about. Her sex scenes are bland and disappointing, and every other word is a curse. I wouldn't mind the cursing if her stories weren't so stale. Her books are one of the few that I did not even bother to finish. If you want Erotica, try Lora Leigh or Jade Black, but skip this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm.....","review":"After the 3rd story, I put the book down.

I mean she did her thang in \\"Addicted\\" and \\"Shame on it All!\\" You would expect more of her but reading Sex chronicles makes me not wanna read anymore sex scenes in any future books of hers simply because she talks about the same stuff. I thought I was in for a ride in a Bentley but unfortunately I realized I haven't left the bus yet! She uses the same words like \\"suckle\\" and \\"baby fine hair\\" I just felt like saying \\"ZANE CAN YOU THINK OF SOME NEW STUFF!!\\".Before I read this book I was anxious to read PartII but now I will save my energy and money for another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zane....What a shame...","review":"Ok, several friends raved about this book so I decided to borrow it. As I read the disclamer that basically states \\"the book is too hot for your a$$ then put it down\\". Then I read the acknowledgements and the mere statements the the author himself believes his work is \\"not for the weak hearted\\" or \\"if you don't like my work why are you reading it.\\" Those statements alone made me think Zane better bring it own if he's talking trash.Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The book is laughable. After continuous four stories reading do'em, suck'em, f**k'em, lick'em and screw'em. Not only were the stories repetative they were down right boring, lacked imagination and creativity. The sad thing is that I could hang but was so bored with the characters and plots that I couldn't turn another page and went to sleep. Because it lacked interest I returned the book to my friend the next day.Basically, don't waste your money on this book, borrow it from someone and return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"This book is horribly explicit. It's not vulgar in the way most erotica books are. It's vulgar to the point were it becomes nasty. I read the first four stories that are in the first section and they became redundant. First of all, the stories are only about 4-5 pages long and they elaborate on the sex and then rush through all other aspects of the story.The main plots of each story are exactly the same. Instead of mixing up the sexual experiences, the characters are basically having sex in the same way but in different scenarios. Please...if you want to read this book, borrow it.

I now believe those reviews were put up here by the publisher.My wife took a look at it first and put it down right away. So I picked it up and I could see why she had dropped it. Very simply - it sucks! I have read a good deal of porn in my time and this is some of the worst I have ever read. It is concrete, clunky, prosaic, with zero style and zero sense of time and pace. In a word it is *mechanical*. There is not a whiff of the erotic anywhere. Find something else - trust me. You could buy pay close to nothing on a secondhand bookstall and do *way* better than this - in fact, if you didn't, you could consider yourself extremely unlucky!Check out the number that are available secondhand and the prices they go for - this is not a book people keep - those numbers never lie, unlike some reviewers.RegardsAdrian"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where shall I begin?","review":"A member of our book club just kept ranting and raving over how great this author Zane is. So I went purchased the book. Silly me!It does not take a lot to wonder why this author remains anonymous.Like most readers, I enjoy a well-placed, creatively described sex scene in any book. In this book, the sex scenes were like what a child might write on the bathroom wall in an elementary school. Really! I mean this book isn't good enough to be called porn or erotica.Also, it doesn't take a lot of imagination to figure out that this author is a MALE! Yep, that's right! I just \\"know\\" Zane is a man. Messing with the small minds of sexually deprived, Waiting-To-Exhale sistahs! The author is smart because he (oops, I mean) she is making a fortune.This will be the last book I ever purchase or read by Zane or any other author in hiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"TO MUCH!","review":"I COULDNT GET PAST THE SECOND STORY DUE TO ALL DA FREAKY THINGS THAT WENT ON IN THIS BOOK, HOWEVER IF U INTO SEX THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YA.

Zane's way of writing is just not my style. I bought this book thinking that there would be a little bit more of a story to it, but I guess I shouldn't have looked into that. The title is a pure definition of what the book is - just a bunch of short erotica stories.I feel I cannot judge this book or the author on a large scale because I did not finish it.

The visual pictures this book evokes is nothing compared to the feelings it stirs up! Girlfriend, you are to be commended for putting it out there and going where no one has really had the nerve to go, and tastefully at that. I have never been a short story person, preferring the evolution of the characters and storyline in novels. However, each story was so well rounded, it was like small doses of chocolate. Just right and hits the spot, even though you know you're not suppose to be having it at all. I can't wait to read Addicted and Shame On It All. If the short stories are that good, I can only imagine that one concentrated story will be off da hook!

It was just what I wanted - literate, luscious, and lusty. It's erotica that I can really enjoy, the kind that's mostly about people enjoying each other all out, in every way a body can please a body, own or others'. There's not much here for the fetish crowd, and almost every encounter centers on one man and one woman (from her point of view). Maybe that's not enough variety for some readers, but the endless variations work for me.This is enjoyable, intelligent, and sexy, with extra flavor from Zane's brown sugar. I'm coming back for more.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"1","title":"eh!","review":"I dunno...I am in the middle of reading this and it doesn't really hit my switch, as far as sensuality goes. Maybe I am looking for more literary finesse to complement the sex in these stories?I haven't really delved into erotica as of yet, so I have nothing to compare it to--although Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), of all people, wrote some fiction that nicely worked sexual fantasy into a story line. I found it beautiful and quite erotic.Zane is treating sex like the average guy does. Just a banal fast f*kk. I am looking for nuance, and a pace that actually feels like lovemaking. Good erotica should feed your senses--I want to see, hear, smell, and taste what is going on in the story.That's what separates erotica from porn, because believe me, honey, there is a difference!Her writing lacks sensuality, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAR","review":"NOT AS GOOD AS I HAVE READ IN THE PAST FROM ZANE.

I've heard for years how fabulous Zane and her writing was but I must say, if I wanted straight porn, I'd rent it on tv. No real storylines. It was just awful. I couldn't even make myself finish the entire book. After about 3 stories...I'd had enough and the entire book went into the archive files. Hate I spent my money.

So based on that, I bought Sex Chronicles I and II- no questions asked. I love good erotica, and while this was definitely freaky, it didn't really do it for me. It was so repetitive, sometimes unimaginative, and I couldn't even bring myself to get even halfway through it. You don't get to know the characters - each story is like \\" we met...we hit...now we're engaged\\" ,or something like that, crammed into a few pages. Short isn't always sweet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"I will never again buy a book by Zane. The writing was poor, and the stories were not creative. I was let down.

I read Addicted by Zane and I have to be honest I was expecting the same page turner with the Sex Chronicles. All I ended up with was a bad taste in my mouth (there are only so many ways you can digest this before literally just wanting to regurgitate). The stories are repetitious and basically it's the same sex with different people on different pages. This is one she should have kept for her own personal collection and not have me waste my .... I am not saying that I will never buy another book by this author. I will be certain to read the inside flap before I go inside my wallet again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"This is the first book by Zane that I have read and I must say that she is not as imaginative as I expected. After reading the first story \\"First Night\\", I almost put the book down because I was neither impressed with the writing style nor the sex descriptions. They were both so ordinary! I hoped it would get better as I continued reading, but after the fourth story, the sex descriptions became overly repetitious and the supporting imagery did not help much. I must say that my imaginations are a lot more fun & creative. I was not impressed with the book at all and I have returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book tells all!","review":"As a man in his mid-fifties that has lived, and is living a full life...I can attest to the myths that Zane has shattered in this book. If this book was written many years ago, it would have prevented me from losing out on a host of erotic opportunities in my early adult life. I had to learn the hard way...through experience. I have been an avid reader of Zane's stories for over a year now, and I can truthfully say that she is the most talented writer of the erotica that I have ever came across. In SHATTERING THE MYTH, she has brought out the truth of the passionate side of a woman...a side that, if a man was aware of, would have peaked the sexual experiences of any of his relationships. I consider this book highly valuable to ANY woman, but also to ANY man who reads it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hottt, Steamyyy; Good ideas to spice up the bedroom","review":"The author summarizes these stories as WILD, WILDER & OFF THE DAMN HOOK and she delivers!!!

It had lots and lots of adventures and it was a real page turner. But, I hated seeing the same words and phrases over and over such as \\"suckle\\" and \\"long black hair.\\" And, all of the men that she met seemed to have bald heads and they were dark skinned!

Spend the bucks to get this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Biker Rock to Candy StreetCar Rock","review":"Why did Jo Jo Gunne tail off in popularity following their first big release with the hit Run,Run,Run? Hard rock bands really liked the sound of that hit and those type of guys were the folks that really supported it. Some of the other songs on that album rocked, but from there the band adopted more of a pop,southern california teenybopper sound rather than the tougher hard-driving sound from RunRunRun. There were exceptions but Jo Jo lost it's focus on the more serious sounds. I mean bikers dug \\"Run\\" but they couldn't hang with much of the rest Jo Jo Gunne put out. Sure it rocked, but it was candy rock as opposed to the real gritty stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh..","review":"These snapped pretty easily, but they did as they advertise.

This is a great pop record. As good as Oasis but with more harmony. I can just imagine the Britain they are singing about.An intense but melodic record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - one track missing though","review":"What a GREAT album. I have the US version of the vinyl and it has \\"Lady Starlight\\" on it. This was omitted here, and really it's not a bad thing as the US version was the only one that had it - it was an attempt to make it a hit as it originally appeared on the UK Desolation Blvd, but didn't become a hit then, though the record company thought it should have been. This version is heavier where the DesBlvd version is more acoustic. This album rocks, and the playing is first-rate, and it's raw but polished at the same time. Connely and the boys were absolute master singers as well. Only Queen or Styx approach this level of vocal harmony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where were you in '76?","review":"I'll tell you where I was--I was 16 and just discovering my love of hard rock music (I know, late bloomer). It's a shame that Sweet never rose to the top in the U.S. like they did in Europe. I remember dancing in a German disco in '77 with \\"Fox On The Run\\" blasting from the speakers. As an avid Sweet fan and collector, I have to tell you that this is THE moment in their careers. For all the reasons why, just read the comments of previous reviewers. Kudos to Capitol Records for issuing U.S. releases in the 70's (Desolation Boulevard, Give Us A Wink and Off The Record) which were far superior to the records released in Europe. I rate this the best hard rock album released in 1976. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Sweet's best","review":"My version of this on Repertoire West Germany (RR 4084-WZ) has to my belief the original US release Lady Starlight from the original LP. The running order has been messed with however, and bonus tracks added. The UK version Desolation Blvd on BMG (74321 66012 2) has the original version I think, at least it is different as it is missing the added electronics. Fox On The Run is different on there too. I always liked Sweet although they were as directionless as a weather vane even without Chinn and Chapman. Strangely enough, only their foray into funk on the follow up fails, everything else they tried seemed to work. Unfortunately, the buying public tends to want continuation of the same, and deviation or versatility often leads nowhere in sales terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"four and one-half stars","review":"To me \\"Give us a Wink\\" was the high watermark that the band could ever have hoped to achieve considering they started out as a glam/bubblegum/teeny booper act under the control of pop songsmiths Mike Chapman, and Nikki Chinn. This could be considered the Sweet's dark album with cut after cut being brooding, standoffish, and sleazy. \\"keep it in\\" and \\"White mice\\" drive with reckless abandon while \\"Yesterday's Rain\\" and \\"Healer\\" are mid-tempo rockers that make full use of the bands skills at creating tension and climax. Lead Singer Brian Connolly's voice is shredded at the end of most cuts and sounds incredible while yeoman guitarist Andy Scott makes the most out of every solo and riff, and there are plenty of good riffs to be found here. Production is not a bright as \\"desolation Blvd.\\" or \\"Off the Record\\" but it adds the the greasiness of the whole album, which is ripe with sex and violence. One of my faves from 70's rock, I put it alongside ANYTHING made from the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great, melodic, catchy as hell, hard rock album!","review":"This band, and especially this album, have been sorely overlooked and underrated. Before GUAW came out, all I really knew about The Sweet were \\"Little Willy\\" and \\"Fox On The Run\\". Now, \\"Fox On The Run\\" is a great song but the songs on GUAW are powerful. I bought the cassette when it first came out because I was on a Navy ship and I had a small tape player (this was before the walkman). Even through my one little speaker I was blown away by these songs. All 8 songs from the original release are great. All these years later and I can still hear the songs in my head. Particular favorites are \\"Lies In Your Eyes\\", \\"4th of July\\" (I find myself singing the chorus quite often), \\"Action\\" and \\"Yesterday's Rain\\".If you're a fan of 70's hard rock, like Uriah Heep and Humble Pie, I think you will like this album. Buy it, play it, crank it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The heaviest album by Sweet","review":"This is the most heavy album from glam rocker Sweet. No bubblegum pop at all. But the problem is that Sweet never was a heavy metal band and some of the songs seem rather un-natural. Bits and pieces are good and especially \\"Action\\" and \\"The lies in your eyes\\" makes this one worth to have, but this album is nothing in comparison to \\"Off the record\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned my finger a different color!","review":"I usually am a big fan of 925 sterling silver, and also a big fan of Eve's Addiction, but this piece of jewelry made my ring finger turn a green/grey color of where the band was on my finger.

However, this book should not be used as a reference for the scientist needing to do the occasional number crunching of categorical data. The examples are vague and the tests are not well explained. If you want to derive the tests, this book is for you. If you're not a statistician at heart and just want the answer, I suggest looking at Conover's \\"Practical Nonparametric Statistics\\" for a good explanation of which tests to use and how to use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasteful, thoughtful, inspiring","review":"This duo works as well together as Herb Ellis & Joe Pass, with the same amount of skill and taste.

The reader might reasonably expect a handbook to be just that: a treatise that explicates the method used to achieve the examples shown. This would translate to the listing of f stop, shutter speed, lighting arrangement, etc. for the photographic illustration chosen. Unfortunately this information was missing in most of the photos shown in Group Portrait Photography. Although there is some information that the reader can employ when photographing groups, I believe that other books on portrait lighting offer more usable material than was found in Group Portrait Photography. In fact, additional books I own by Mr. Hurter seem superior to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality for the price, but could be better","review":"The local hardware stores only had vents for installing in a wood wall or on top of siding, I needed a kit to install through a brick and block crawlspace wall. This kit allowed me to do just that.The flaps move freely after a 20' run, yet not so freely that exterior wind opens them. Everything (other than drilling the hole through 1' of brick, concrete, and cinder block) installed fairly easy.The two reasons I am deducting a star are that the item came stained. I plan on trying the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser on it to get the stain out and if that doesn't work I'll just have to paint it. Also the mounting options are to drill screws into the mounting surface or to silicone it to the wall. Since it doesn't come with screws I assume the ideal mount is silicone, so I believe there should be some caps to cover the screw holes. It's nothing major, but a little touch like that would have elevated the product enough for me to ignore the staining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astoundingly awful","review":"This is, hands down, the most jaw-droppingly bad CD out of the hundreds I own.

Written as if these were merely his sermon notes, the book lacks depth of exegetical or hermeneutical study and merely glosses over the deep theological themes of James. In addition, the author asserts many phrases foreign to Scripture, perhaps in view of making the text more \\"relevant\\" to its audience.

They key recognition is excellent and the design is sturdy; it's a full-sized keyboard too. The quality of this keyboard is almost perfect. There is only one draw back. If you like to use your T3 with a sideview, your display will be upside down because it will have to sit on it's left side instead of it's right. Key recognition will still be perfect though :). You will require a flat surface because the keyboard does not lock into place. Other than that, this keyboard couldn't satisfy me more. In the end, it's not a matter of quality and ease of use, but a matter of preference (lay it on it's side or upright...hmmm..). If you have read the many warnings from other users not to buy the Palm branded stowaway to avoid the black screen of death, this is a great answer because it operates perfectly with the Palm Tungsten T3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great keyboard","review":"I just bought this keyboard, somewhat afraid it might serve my needs. I have a HP iPaq 1910, for which there is no official full sized keyboard available. I just received it and it works great. It can be configured also to other keyboard layouts besides the US English layout (most of my typing is in Spanish). The only inconvenience with using a keyboard layout other than de US English is that the symbols on the other layouts (e.i. Spanish layout) need to use a special combination of function keys to be accessed (because of the lack of a 5th key row), but it doen't take long to get used to this.The hinge bump mentioned with the pictures has been of no bother whatsoever.The size is great and the convenience is huge.

After reading the reviews on this site I was under the impression that Think Outside was way ahead of Palm on keyboard design--which might be true if you don't use a Palm PDA. AFTER fighting with this keyboard for two days, I read the \\"support\\" on the Think Outside site and found that pretty much everyone who tried the keyboard with their LifeDrive had problems.And here's the really appalling thing: I know all tech firms are coy about sharing their phone number for tech support, and I can (sort of) understand why. But Think Outside is in deep hiding. They don't want you to call them even if you've jumped through every other support hoop.

It is muddied and dreamlike, and full of guitar work that one can only truly appreciate if they see Swervedriver or Adam Franklin (Toshack Highway) live.This is full of so many great songs I don't even know where to begin. Perhaps most importantly, the album has a great flow to it, similar in that regard to both XTC's \\"Skylarking\\" and Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" (even though the music is much, much different for all those bands). For fans of old Dinosaur, MBV, or Sonic Youth, this CD is a must, as is \\"Mezcal Head\\" and any assortment of early Swervedriver b-sides that you can find.

The first two books of the trilogy were absolutely gripping while this one was more entertaining but still a great read nevertheless.

I love how Tony and Clare will be at each others throats one minute and then making hot, sensual love the next. I also love Emma. She was such the pre teen that you would expect her to be. She was very smart and wants to be a cop. I loved this whole series because I could totally see it as a movie. It was descriptive enough to make you see what Clare was seeing, but not overly discriptive that it takes 2 or three pages to describe a person's shirt. I absolutely recommend this book. You will love the emotional roller coaster it will take you on. But make sure you read the first two of the books. Don't Look Now and Never Look Back.

If you have never read a book about Napoleon and Josephine, I would recommend this one, and even if you have read others, this one is probably the best there is. This extraordinary love story has never been better told. The only thing that dissapointed me about this book was to read that it was the only one Evangeline Bruce ever wrote, she died not long after it was published, but at least she lived to see this superb work in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Jumpin' the Gunne but a couple of tracks are worth getting","review":"Although Jo Jo Gunne's only hit was on their first album, they really reached only their maximum potential on their third album Jumpin' the Gunne IMO. That's a rock classic that belongs on the CD rack of every classic rock fan. Coming after that, this 1974 album was a bit of an anticlimax, and some of the songs seem relatively hook-free, with not much to catch the listener. But a couple of songs stand out from the mediocrity - have a listen to the catchy Falling Angel ('Runnin' wild in '67, home was hell but life was heaven' just about sums up life for a lot of young people in the 60s) and the keyboard ballad Into My Life. These songs have '70s rock classic' written all over them, and I'm surprised they weren't released as singles.

It is a simple introduction to physics, which might suffice as secondary reading material for students in AP physics. Since I occasionally tutor AP physics, I thought this would be a good book to lend/share with students trying to use their study time constructively.As for my copy, pages were unmarked so far as I can tell upon cursory inspection. However, the cover was in poor shape, and the seller (CNMehta) apparently thought that mailing a six-pound textbook in a standard manila envelope was standard operating procedure. Perhaps I'm fortunate there was anything left of the envelope so its destination could be ascertained.

This drives me crazy. The instructor gets off the beat and stays off it. I have been through the warmup and first exercise, and she got off the music entirely in the warmup, and got off the measure in the exercise. I'm not very inclined to slog through the rest of it. It is always amazing to me when dance instructors can't find the first beat of a measure, and don't seem to think that is a problem. Dancing is essentially playing an instrument -- one's body. Interpreting the music is primary, not just the ability to perform movements. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"This is MRs. Beach here -This video is AWESOME! I LOVE it. Michelle is now my fav. instructor. I love the way she breaks down the combinations. I am buying ALL of her videos. It's good to go back and practice the basics. She is a very thourough teacher (as others have nicely written already)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't move me.","review":"I think when showing the moves to belly dancing the legs should be exposed, as this is the real secret to many of the moves. I would like to see the kness and feet as the moves are deminstrated. I am a good dancer, but could not figure out how to do the Pop movement. I also found it quite boring when the moves are repeated so much at the same speed, slower working towards faster would have been more benifical. I won't be using this DVD anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pratice","review":"I'm a tribal bellydancer but this was perfect to help me sharpen my hip movement for my drum solo. Really loved this. So worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worse instructions ever","review":"If you are already familiar with belly dancing don't buy it. It is a waste. She does not know how to give precise instrucitons and she is a horrible dancer. I just put it in the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"I do a lot of Bellydance workouts and this one is very fun! I like the way the moves are taught in short segments and then repeated a lot. I also like that you can skip the learning part and just do the moves or the dance. I wish she taught every move in the dance as i do not have the patience to figure out the fill in steps -- I am an exerciser not a dancer! Also wish I could play the dance in a loop so I could just do it over and over now that I know the moves. But it is a good workout and (did I say this?) fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Kickin' DVD from Michelle","review":"What makes a good dancer? Skill, personality, and that little extra something that makes them stand out. Michelle's is her incredible flawless execution. Shimmies so small and perfect you wonder if they are a mirage,pops and locks the same. This is a great DVD that teaches all this, plus an extra extra challenging choreography at the end. If you buy this for nothing else buy it for the choreography!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best beginner's look at drum solo.","review":"I have spent a good deal of time and money perfecting (well working hard on) isolations However, I find combinations hard. my first year's teacher thought technique wasn't for beginners and I can't tell left from right. As I was working at home, I wasn't working enough on moving. I have some excellent choreography and drum solo dvds tagged for beginners, but found that I hadn't been taught enough to do them. I bought this to drill combinations and am delighted. I'm taking it nice and slow and working through because you can move at your own pace. Some killer exercises and layering drills too. Descriptions nice and clear, dvd well organised and lots of different cue points so you can work on each segment as you please.Anyone got any suggestions for a similar work out with travelling steps, I fall over my feet trying to work out L/R and need to practise at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not UL Listed and a fire hazard","review":"I bought and quickly returned this without using it.

This is a oversimplified video with nothing that will help you unless you don't already know what the inside bid and ask mean.The video production quality is poor, and it's just a basic video that doesn't tell you anything you can't find for free on the net, eg at phactor.com, for using level2.

This book is great - entertaining, frustrating, thought-provoking, etc. Remi, the main character, was an absolute delight. Her descriptions and observations of people and goings on were hysterical - I laughed out loud several times while reading this book (her description of her father's actions in London had me in tears). She was also a very brave little girl who handled the various situations that she found herself in with such skill and grace that I had to keep re-reading passages to find out how old she was at various points. For a different kind of coming of age story, please check this book out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Read the Arabic newspapers","review":"The authentic materials (articles) of this book are excellent for learning to read Arabic for Foreign students.

Her incredible beauty did not hurt. I was most fortunate to see Anna Moffo perform at the Chicago Opera House, soon after her Butterfly triumph in Italy, during her Fulbright Scholarship. She did another opera (Lucia), and she tore the house down. It was the most memorable performance I ever experienced. At least 10 mins ovation. All Italy fell madly in love with Anna Moffo.

We highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try everything in this book!","review":"This was the first Jamie Oliver book I ever owned, and I quickly became a huge fan as one recipe after another led to a new, fantastic meal that was unlike anything I had ever created before. New approaches for everything from root vegetables to fresh herb uses to a fantastic twist on a caprese salad taught me a lot and made my kitchens' best customer (my husband) very, very happy. I would recommend it to anyone for great flavors, creative recipes, and ease of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!!!","review":"The book is worth its money just for its mear beauty, as well as for its melon vodka trick :).The design of the book is excellent and the presentation of recepies is a pleasure to read. If there is nothing else I can offer for the review, I can at least add one single word to explain the entire book...\\"COOL\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This One Delivers","review":"So many times cookbooks leave you feeling somehow foresaken. You turn to them expecting to find a hand on the shoulder and a step by step help through the labor of all the dishes presented within its pages; but, so many times it never happens. This one stays with you and never leaves your side. A true bonus--if you are covered over with the business of life, and find time to be a premium--is that several dishes can be prepared within the confines of a single crimped-foil-envelope. Simply add the ingredients, cook and cut open the foil. Can it get easier? All of this, and it's a fun read as well. If you enjoy the show, you will LOVE this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How to be a 5 star home-cook","review":"I really love the books of Jamie. This volume again contains recipes that aren't hard to make and are very easy to do. Jamie uses fresh ingedients, no really difficult techniques and the composition always looks great on your plate. With this book you won't find cooking hard and you will get a lot of compliments for the dinner you have cooked. There are different sections: starters, meat, fish, vegetables, pastas en desserts. The techniques used by Jamie are explained very clearly and most of the time he gives some advise in using your own imagination to make it your own recipe.I have had this book for over a year now and I use it very often. My favourite recipe: Fantastic cooked chicken!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice one mate...","review":"A cookbook that contains recipes that ordinary people, as opposed to professional chefs, can understand, and don't need a kitchen full of cooking gadgets, or special ingredients to prepare and enjoy. I've tried most of Jamie's \`pukka tukka' and its recipes are easy to cook and taste great. Only problem I've found is that my girlfriend now says that as I cook so well I can do it more often, but the plus side is she does the washing-up, and provides dessert ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, charming cookbook!","review":"What a nice change of pace to read a cookbook by an author who has a sense of humor and some modesty about his or her accomplishments. Although Jamie Oliver has a lot to crow about, he's a marvelous, relaxed writer whose prose is engaging, readable, and yet serious about its subject matter. The recipes are super. There are a lot of little touches to this book that I pick up on every time I glance through it. Mr. Oliver packed so many nuggets into his text that you could literally experience a new insight each time you open it up. A must have for any serious cook who still likes to have fun cooking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's So Likeable - He Makes You Want To Cook","review":"I have been watching Jamie Oliver on the FoodNetwork since he invaded the States. I love him. Plain and Simple - I think he's a riot and so friendly. He makes me rethink that whole \\"stiff upper lip - English thing\\". When I watch his show - he makes me SO hungry. I don't think he's ever made something that I didn't like or couldn't see me making. He's recipes are down to earth - user friendly and SO good. He's a chef for the everyday \\"man / woman\\" (you know what I mean).From the basics to the more industrious recipes - \\"The Naked Chef Takes Off\\" is a great follow-up to his first book, \\"The Naked Chef\\". Also a wonderful heads up - \\"Happy Days with the Naked Chef\\" is available from Amazon UK and I LOVE LOVE LOVE that books. It's wonderful! But - until that one hits the states, check out \\"Return of the Naked Chef\\". You'll be chomping at the bit to get into the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The naked chef","review":"This book shows you the way to cook fusion food, mixing english, spanish, tai and italian food in a special way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salty Breads","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that I am a fan of Jamie Oliver, but a disappointed one when it comes to this book. Normally, I wouldn't take away so many stars from a book based on just a single recipe, but since this recipe is the basic bread recipe that serves as the master recipe for all the breads in the book, I feel this is justified. My edition of the book lists 2 tablespoons of salt for the basic bread recipe per 2lbs of bread flower. The type of salt is not specified and those of us who bake know that there is a considerable difference between 2 tablespoons of table salt vs sea salt. Just looking at the recipe this amount of salt seems excessive. I followed my gut and made the bread with 2 teaspoons of table salt; the bread came out quite nice. However, I can only assume that had I made it with 2 tablespoons of table salt, it would have come out inedible, along with every other bread recipe in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge a book by its title","review":"This cookbook is just The Return of the Naked Chef with a new title. I already owned The Return of the Naked Chef, so now I have two. I really dislike publishers who mislead us by changing titles or changing covers just to get us to buy that which we already own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jamie is cool and unpretentious","review":"I thought that this was going to be a repetition of \\"The Naked Chef\\" and that Jamie was going to use the same formula in his new book. I was wrong. Not only did he improve the book but also dedicated his book to his wife--I bet Jamie was at the doghouse for not dedicating his first book to his wife or mentioning her... Anyhow, the recipes are very easy to follow and to reproduce in the privacy of your house. The only but that I have is that some of the ingredients are not readily available. However, all I can say is buy the book and let the cooking speaks for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"That \\"old sailor\\" doesn't have a clue!","review":"He has no idea what he is talking about.

I wore them for a half-ironman, a full ironman and countless bike rides and runs as well as everyday... I wont leave home without them. They travelled to Europe with me and I simply hate to drive anywhere if I've forgotten them. They look great with everything. I will never go back to cheap sunglasses again, the lenses are great-- no more squinting-- I love these glasses! I previously had a problem with sunglasses slipping down but not with these glasses, they stay on in the most extreme of workouts! Best Glasses EVER! Oh, and my kids dropped an apple on them in Europe and broke the earpiece off-- I was totally bummed, but I sent them to Zeal and they fixed them for me at NO CHARGE! Fabulous company, fabulous product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sunglasses; Not lovin' the color","review":"This is my first pair of Zeal sunglasses, and sadly, I had to return them. These glasses have a slightly smaller look would look great whether in a business suit or running a marathon - very functional but still a little sporty. I have a medium size face and the fit is perfect and they stay where put, unlike many sunglasses I purchase. The polarization is an outstanding feature and if you have never had glasses with this, you are missing crisp, clear sight, which is much easier on the eyes, especially in bright sunlight. Why am I returning them? I ordered the Venetian Violet and the color is not as shown online (not just at Amazon, but on other websites as well). The true color is much lighter, more like a light mauve. I like the glasses so much I almost kept them, but just don't care for the color. Amazon's return policy is the best and the return shipping was free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strikingly different and wow!","review":"\\"Lost For Words\\" is the first single to be taken from his album \\"Turn It On\\" and is distinctively different from his usual tracks. If you have listen to all of the tracks of the compilation,then you would find this song is starkly out of tone from the other ones. It's a strange blend of mid-tempo pop and rock and is a revelation really on the part of Ronan Keating.

I was blown away by the blues sound they had. I thought finally a rock band that says they play blues rather than just call it rock. I thought the band had disappeared. Then I found out that they actually made another CD, Wild America! I looked for it everywhere and finally found it. It was just as innovative as the first album and had some better songs. I especially like Amnesia, City of Kings, Cold Fever and Wild America. Wild America is one of the greatest patriotic songs of all time. City of Kings is a nice pounding song. The guitars in Cold Fever are great. Amnesia reminds me of their first album as most of it was bitching about women. If the lead singer didn't have such bad luck with women we may not have had this great album.:) Buy this and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old 80's rock and roll","review":"I've always liked this album and used to have it on cassette.

He is an alien when it comes to his capacity of playing the instrument. The DVD itself isn't a great super high quality production but is good enough to be appreciated for what it is - an incredible display of talent. As an example, to this day I am still trying to play what Terry played with the band Explorer's Club in 1998. Very complex, mental stuff. I don't know how he does it. Chad is also an incredible drummer, but Terry is superior. Like I said, don't expect a high budget production here, but expect out of this world performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot of fun--but don't buy this one for the kids!","review":"The guest artists on this collection are what make it stand out.

This one would be a great selection for Halloween coming up.There's also some of Silverstein's children's music here, \\"The Unicorn,\\" \\"Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout\\", and \\"The Homework Machine\\" are the ones I remember best from my own childhood.

Yes, it does work when used according to directions and can provide some significant relief in certain circumstances. Everyone is different, of course and NO back pain is typical. If you are experiencing pain from weakness of the abdominal muscles for whatever reason it can make your back misalign and cause pain. Keeping the back straight and supported is what this device is designed to do. I would give it a high mark for design and durability.

Unfortunately it doesn't do it for me. I think that together with the seat pad this costs about $120 or more. Upon inspection I'd be surprised if anyone paid half that if they bought it in a store after checking it out.In my case it was too narrow, the frame edges are felt and padding is pretty minimal. It must work for those with strange back ailments, but for me it didn't. It also lacked a good system for attaching it to a seatback, so you'd have to reposition it every time you use it.A tiny person might get some use out of it but I can't imagine what's in it that costs so much to produce. It's a frame, foam and a cheap thin cover that looks like it'd wear through with time.Thankfully Amazon accepts returns on these items. It seems to work for many, but it felt like I was sitting with an ironing board behind me. Literally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good item","review":"I am very happy with this item.

For example, they really ratchet things up with a heavy, harmonica-assisted Midnight to Daylight. THE blemish on the production is the album's ode to the days of disco, Funk It Up. A little lightweight after all that proceeds it. Not helping matters is the bonus track \\"Funk It Up (Disco)\\", as if the original version needed any more of a KC & the Sunshine Band flourish. And for a guy who sadly had his throat stomped on in a street attack a few years earlier (hey, I'm only as good as what I read on Wikipedia), Brian Connelly comes across as polished and capable. It's unfortunate that this album was the beginning of the end for this gifted warbler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever stories of the upper class on the French Riviera","review":"General Besserly is a retired American officer, formerly of the Secret Service, but now elegantly living on the French Riveria. He serves as a singular problem solver and savior of last resort for an assortment of young and old who have strayed from the straight and narrow. Solving the problems of inveterate gamblers, capturing notorious criminals, or working to fulfill the wishes of a dying Baroness, he works his magic, most often for beautiful young women.The stories are short and intriguing. In particular the Butterfly in the Death Chamber is moving and elegant. Oppenheim paints a wonderful picture of life amid the upper class and royalty in France between the wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated...","review":"Though the album might appeal to people still living in their parents basement, the album seems like the drunken ramblings of the guy who staggers into the local fast food joint screaming about the evils of the political system.If you want politics mixed with your music, I can recommend the back catalogues of Bruce Cockburn or Jackson Browne (they both have similar left-leaning views that are actually tempered with humanity) but this isn't worth the entry fee.

In full Razzie form Madonna does her worst Catherine Tramell impression. She was more seductive in the \\"Open Your Heart\\" video. Julianne Moore had a hotter bod than Madge in her one nude scene.

One of the worst films I have ever seen; it was painful to watch. The premise is interesting, but the way it plays out is just dull and lifeless. There are some great actors here (Willem Dafoe, Joe Mantegna, and even Julianne Moore) but they are all just wasted and are overwhelmed by the ridiculous sex scenes. What is supposed to be shocking and erotic comes off (no pun intended) as sterile, clinical, and sometimes even laughable. Madonna's performance is a mystery as well. It's like she's not even there half the time. She is so cold and detached. Now perhaps that is the point of the character, but it still doesn't play right. This film works much better as camp. I mean, tell me that the scene with Julianne Moore slapping Madonna doesn't instantly conjure up images of Krystle and Alexis!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful makes it sound too good","review":"I actually saw this in the theater, and I wanted to walk out. The only thing that kept me from it was being a huge Madonna fan, but her ridiculously bad performance almost nipped that in the bud.

Even Dafoe and Anne Archer give poor performances, probably as it became increasingly clear that this was going to an embarrassment on their resumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"\\"Madonna isn't merely the prime suspect in the scandalous murder of a millionaire with kinky appetites; she's the murder weapon itself in this erotic thriller in the Basic Instinct mode.

Madonna was an ok actress, butshe seemed to use more of her own personality then anything.The scene where they were in the parking garage, was my favorite.That scene was very erotic.

After hot tempered fits of bondage and domination fueled by alcohol split their marriage up, she still claimed to love him. Madonna monotones her lines as she strips to keep us guessing, Did she do the murder or not? William Dafoe snarls, grimmaces and shouts as her attorney seduced by her devious games, at times resembling Talman's Hamilton Berger on Perry Mason.

However, it comes across as a very poor imitation of the sexy thriller genre. Madonna as always is tasty and juicy but acting is not something that she excels in. Her zest is evident in the steamy scenes but she stands exposed in places that require serious emoting.The one dimensional portrayal of all the characters is something common to the genre and is to be taken with a pinch of salt. After the first 15 minutes or so you are pretty well sure of where you're headed with this one, although i must say muff munching and canal digging (hands in the zipper)was most surprising and innovative.However, for me it was Julianne Moore who sizzled in bed rather than Madonna.

Critics blame Madonna for the failure of this movie, but her performance isn't that bad. It's just not that good either. No one comes out of this movie with his/her reputatios intact.

So abysmal that after twenty minutes I found myself fast-forwarding through the movie, admittedly pausing to view the dirty bits involving Madonna and Defoe. The trouble is that Defoe is just about the most unnattractive actor in Hollywood, and Madonna, whilst both beautiful AND sexy, is somehow portrayed in this movie as an utterly sexless thing, almost like one of those blow-up dolls with '3 working orifices'.

Not only does she prove she can act, and that she is sexy, but this looks like a high point in her career (with Dangerous Game) because she looks so young and new to the acting scene. These types of erotic thrillers usually are pretty bad (1994's Mother's Boys) but I guess Madonna fans will enjoy it more then for what it's worth. I found it entertaining, more freeky and odd then romantic/erotic and the sex scenes were kind of funny (there isn't as much sex in this movie as people say) This is overall not a film that makes Madonna fans very proud, but it's bold, shameless and entertaining, well worth a view or DVD purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves NO stars!","review":"What a waste of talent - Willem Defoe's.

As for Madonna, the queen of self promotion, all it was was a chance to prove that she is one of the WORST actresses of all time and show off her body, which we have already seen enough of even without viewing this cheap, trashy, thing.

Second, most of the designs looked like something you'd see in any other house plan book, but with some dirt pushed around the sides and a thin layer raked across the top. That's it! They're mostly rectangular, which is boring. Even if you built one into a hill instead of just doing the dirt comb-over, they'd still be boring. And small. The few seemingly innovative designs were way too small to even consider. Imagine a bedroom that is 8x11 in cross-measurements, except that it's actually a pie shape taken out of a very small hexagonal structure!The \\"underground\\" house/structure books tend to be way more cool than \\"earth-sheltered\\" or \\"earth-bermed\\" house books.

All the usual storyline elements are included. The aunt, who has been the silent suffering servant for most of her life, is rewarded with the love of the two (wealthy) children of her dead brother, to fill the place of the children she never had. Unkind relatives try unsuccessfully to thwart their plans. She and the niece and nephew find a house and make it into a beautiful home, in which many of their college friends enjoy spending time.

It is rare to read someone's life journey with such open-mindedness and ownership. She takes full responsibility for her life and choices. Whether it is an intimate or public act, Jane Fonda stands there exposed for all. She is a marvelous woman who has lived/loved, exhaulted/destroyed, walked/crawled, and cried with joy and pain.

All politics & faith aside, I had to force myself on general principle to finish the book. 200 pages shorter MIGHT have made it a better read.

Instead of heart-felt reflection, in this bizarre memoir, Jane Fonda conveys minutiae that divides her \\"life so far\\" into three \\"acts,\\" running on about her childhood, first films, and her politics, but never saying anything I could take back with me. Evasive and rather superficial,Jane Fonda's My Life So Far falls apart due to meanderings and (rather pathetic) self-promotion.

You almost expect her to commence bombing on Omaha instead of Hanoi. You would think it would have dawned on her at 67 that her struggle against her father has made her what she is or at least what she was for most of her life. At this stage, she still seems to be searching for the public to embrace her, much as Hillary, but with that grating voice and self absorbed manner, even less likely it will happen with her.

But don't hold your breath waiting for her to do the right thing...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Autobiography","review":"Jane Fonda was always my favorite actress and I was thrilled when I found out that she wrote her autobiography.Being a movie buff, I wish she would have written more about her movies and less about her political interests and actions, but at least I know now why she was called Hanoi Jane.Especially her difficult realtionship with her father is very fascinating to read and continues through most of the book.Why she fell for Ted Turner however is totally beyond my understanding. She seemed too cultivated, intelligent and mature to settle for that type of man. I hope she will find a more suitable partner in the long run, because there are some good men out there..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fearless Women Rule","review":"How can people criticize an autobiography? This is not a work of fiction or text. It's her story. It's her life. Like her or not, I applaud Ms. Fonda's brutal honesty and willingness to reveal herself on the page. I could not put her book down. Perhaps it is because I have seen every one of her movies and I worked out to her video in the 80's (while I was still smoking and drinking!) and she has been a constant, steady influence in my life. This book is about her journey and it's also about survival. We all have our stuff that we have to deal with, movie star or not, we are human beings with struggles and challenges and joys. Thank you, Jane, for taking the daunting amount of time it took to write your story in your voice, with your heart and mind exposed for all of us to see. I will forever be grateful to you for sharing all of the memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Fonda Honesty that I Understand and Respect, 10 stars","review":"This book reflects Jane Fonda's admirable honesty. She has had (and I believe still has) a mesmerizing life. She made some errors, recognized them, and always been willing to grow and modify with the times and because of her own experiences.I discovered something that I did not know when I bought the book-to love and admire this woman more.I read it in one night, and I could not put it down! The most important thing about this book is that you will read a portion and then put it down and start looking at yourself.If you have any interest in overcoming problems, (as I did, and anyone should) this is important read. It is about beautiful Jane, and so much more...stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much kvetching","review":"I read this book and was disappointed. It is one of those \\"poor misunderstood me\\" tomes. It is hundreds of pages of kvetching (complaining) and just proves that the famous as well as the infamous can be published no matter how well or how badly they write. The most interesting part of the book is Jane's life with Ted Turner. Sorry Jane,I still think you are a wonderful actress. Stick to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Fonda an Honest American","review":"Jane's book is an honest-heart felt account of her life so far. She made mistakes she regrets, in regards to Vietnam and she discribes that experiance in great detail.She is far from the only one who made mistakes in regards to Vietnam. She also has done alot of good for many other causes.She focuses on her appearance as a strong women but in reality she allowed her 3 husbands to dominate her to a point most woman in her postion would not.Let's give Jane the respect she deserves, not to mention she is a great actress. Welcome Back, hope your third act is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining autogiography that seems to take an objective look at Fonda's life","review":"Heard MY LIFE SO FAR, written and read by Jane Fonda . . . it is an extremely entertaining autobiographyof the activist/feminist/actress/exercise guru that seems to takean objective look at her life--something that is so rare in booksof this type.I gained a much better appreciation of the person fromlistening, particularly with respect to her controversialparticipation in protesting the Vietnam War . . . it gaveme a much better appreciation of what actually happenedand, also, made me see even more similarities to what isnow happening in Iraq.Fonda certainly doesn't shy away from naming names . . . some,such as James Franciscus, come across favorably . . . others, TedTurner perhaps most prominently, are people you'd certainly notwant in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully written autobiography","review":"Wow! What a book! In a raw and candid way Jane Fonda delves deeply into her own feelings. She is not afraid to reveal her pitfalls and what she attributes as the reasons for them. We can all learn from her revelation.I was amazed at the number of similarities between the Vietnam war and the current war in Iraq.She attributes a patriarchal world for dehumanizing not only women but men as well (565). Men cannot appear to have effeminate qualities like being soft, compassionate, being girlie men!!! In fact it is her belief that many leaders, fearing to be considered soft or unmanly have chosen the path of war. However she notes that beneath the surface \\"a great tectonic shift is occurring\\" as the old, no longer workable system is in its death throes (577). Right on!I also loved her observation that \\"coincidences are God's way of remaining anonymous.\\" (111).This book is a 'must read'for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Life So Far Continues to be dictated by males","review":"Jane bemoans her fate over and over and over...her father was distant, she was drawn to men who were equally distant, over and over and over, and she was so taken advantage of. Her lamentations, at her age, get very old.Goodness, she's now 67 years old and still doesn't seem to have a clue. Now she's dipping her toe into the waters of Christianity-- another male dominated culture where women aren't going to receive much, unless they submit their natural intelligence and souls to yet another \\"higher\\" authority.I give this two stars because of her in-depth, behind the scenes look at the making of \\"On Golden Pond\\" and \\"9 to 5\\".Karen AitchisonSan Francisco"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Talk about looking for love in all the wrong places. This woman has an unerring radar for obnoxious,over wrought,nutty men. And the killer is that she was still attracting these losers in her 50's.I was exhausted just reading about it.She and Ted Turner actually sound kind of pitiful.Both had dismal childhoods and are still struggling with them 5 decades later.I found it amazing they stayed in marriage counseling 7 out of the 8 years they were married.

He ignored her, and i suggest you do the same for the sake of your mental health."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth Shall Set You Free","review":"I loved this book. I am one of those who remembers Jane Fonda mostly from her days as a Fitness Queen. I had heard about her exploits in Vietnam and knew people hated her because of it, but there's nothing like hearing the true story from the horse's mouth. This autobiography is well-written and gives you much insight into who Jane is as a person--woman, mother, actress, activist...human being trying to find her way and do what's right. I highly recommend this book, especially to those who have based their opinion of Jane solely on what they've heard. Read this book. Get the truth and be set free from all the penned up anger you have against someone you don't understand. It will change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Life So Far","review":"This was bought for me as a present and I was surprised just how much I actually enjoyed it. Her writing style is very clear and she is extremely candid in telling her life story. I didn't realise how varied and interesting her life had been, from her childhood with her actor father, her own acting career, war activism and fitness business. She comes across as a very grounded person and has a good story to tell. Worth a read.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I found the book tedious, too detailed, too long and lacking in wanting to read on. That doesn't take away from the fact that I think she is a remarkable woman, but there was a lack of excitement coming from the pages. More like an historical account of her life so far which it is, but it needed some pizzazz.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"},{"rating":"2","title":"BREATHTAKINGLY HONEST AND ENGAGING MEMOIR","review":"JANE FONDA shares her life with such honesty and insight (hindsight) it is sometimes breathtaking and always stimulating. She may be known worldwide as a star but she is a woman of great depth who expresses for all of us as women what it is like to grow up with low self esteem and to give up ourselves or lose ourselves for other people, especially our men. And what it is like for her to be the daughter of and then married to three powerful men. I am so grateful that she wrote this book, and that I got to read it. I have encouraged all my friends to read it too. I wish I knew Jane personally. We would have much to say to each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Hollywood Mirror Lover","review":"Hollywood attracts and develops it's own unique version of hyper narcissism and this book is a poster boy of that. The detail of self analysis is overwhelming at times and reflects a lot of the professional help she obtained during her lifetime to explain and modify her behavior.But no psychologist will ever explain away her treason and extreme damage to our servicemen during her Hanoi visit not to mention some of her outrageous comments and other actions like calling our POWs liars........she knows it, we know it, and God knows it; so I hope she prays for forgiveness a lot before she has to meet him sooner than later one day...........I'd like to be the fly on the wall when she does.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra portable?

How their talents were exploited by the white man for their own self gradification. Ma Rainey was a strong black women whom could have helped her band members, but at times I think she only thought of her on selfish needs. I hate to say but her attitude is typical of some artist today, all about them selves and not about helping their fellow man. However I think Mr. Wilson brought out her desire to help others and her determination to get her way in the matter of her nephew, but I think it was at the wrong time and at the expense of the band member.

A strong, assured, fat guitar/bass underpinning to tight, soaring vocals. Not a bad song in the bunch. Just a touch of 'weird' to keep you guessing.

It's one of the best Latin Jazz tracks ever made, in my opinion. Irakere itself is a legendary band, so if you haven't yet heard of them, check out some of their studio albums like Yemaya, Misa Negra, or Exuerancia.

Within twenty pages it becomes clear that Mr. Bane is in fact a paranoid schizophrenic, and that somehow or another his 'release' will coincide with the resurfacing of John Kennedy, who, assuming that he was not killed in Dallas, is most certainly dead by now. Again, this book should not be regarded as anything but a joke.

This is without a doubt My all time favorite album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you ready?","review":"Intense, lurid, boogiefied, and at time even borderline psychedelic.Humble Pie took 1 original, 5 covers, and 1 song which they credited to Ida Cox but has nothing in common with the credited song, and through ripped through them with all the power, intensity and emotion they had for some of the best 73 minutes of rock and heavy blues I have ever heard!The thing I love the most is that they had the ability to make the cover song completly their own. I have heard allot of versions of Willie Dixon's I'm Ready, none was energeic as this one. Steve Marriot is awsome on vocals. There's no frills and thrills here, just solid, pure rock with all the sleazy attitude expected from a hard rock show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live 70s Blues-Rock","review":"PERFORMANCE- ROCKIN' THE FILLMORE is a great live album by Humble Pie, perhaps the top live act of the early 70s, with Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Outlaws being their later-in-the-decade counterparts. Besides bluesy singer-guitarist Steve Marriott, this lineup also boasted the more melodic Peter Frampton on guitar and vocals. This and HOT 'N' NASTY: THE ANTHOLOGY are the quintessential Humble Pie, so go out and get it- fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have live blues-metal masterpiece!","review":"If you only have one Humble Pie album, make sure it's this one! If you only have room for two Pie albums, get this one and Rock On. Live at the Whiskey gets third, primarily on the strength of their amazing \\"For Your Love\\" cover. On the Fillmore East, Marriott sometimes sounds like he swallowed the harmonica, and Frampton does things to his guitar that are illegal in most states! Definitely one of the top-10 live rock albums of all time, this is a great introduction to a band that could've, and should've, been much bigger than the way things worked out. 23 min. of Gilded Splinters alone is worth the price! If you like Zepp, if you like Floyd, Tull or the Allmans, give this a spin -- you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Without Peer","review":"Humble Pie Performance Rockin' The Fillmore is the first best-ever live album to come out of the double lp live albums of the seventies. This album is pure rock and roll ecstacy and is without peer. Bob Seger's Silver Bullet Band album sounds like a bunch of pansys next to this masterpiece. Peter Frampton's Frampton Comes Alive would never have happened had it not been for Rockin' the Fillmore, on which he played a vital role. This is rock and roll at its best. Powerful guitar, powerful singing, and a rock solid and powerful band."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you think you've heard it all...","review":"...get this CD. It'll be like the coolest water on the hottest day. The Godfather of Blues Rock, the late Steve Marriott, with his fine band of merry men (Peter Frampton among them, as well as the late Greg Ridley on bass and Jerry Shirley on drums) take the stage to shred, mince, dice, julienne your mind, and then savagely rip your liver out through your nose and make some sort of weird Japanese entrée out of it. This album is sorely underrated in the annals of rock history and deserves a spot among the best; It establishes the band as a good studio act and an even better live act (As is in the case of Frampton in his solo years). There's only one flaw: the censor's bleep during \\"Rolling Stone\\", which is easily overlooked due to the great quality of the music. A must for ANY rocker's CD library, I recommend it without reservation. ROCK ON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LIGHTS OFF,CRANK IT UP,LAYBACK,ENJOY.","review":"This has got to be the greatest \\"dope smoken\\" album of all time. Rockin' the Fillmore,does just that. You can hear the \\"cast of thousands\\" just having a really good time. You'll be able to even hear a wine bottle falling down somewere in the background. Thats why Humble Pie's next album had to be called Smokin'. Because that's just what you will want to do.

I wore out the cassette I bought in college when it first came out after stumbling on a bootleg tape of Humble Pie AND falling in \\"like\\" with them in '69. Patched that live tape up so many times there were gaps in the songs and mangled parts garbling the sound. I thought I had died and went to heaven when I saw this in the CD store about 15 years ago. All the good memories came flooding back with the improved sound of the CD. Peter Framptom! Steve Marriott! God! Could those guys pump out the rockers together!

However, the 2007 Japan remaster is greatly improved - a lot more dynamic range - sounds fresh for a 30+ year old live recording. Spend the extra money for this Rock classic, the quality speaks for its self. The 2007 version is out of print, but the search for a used copy is worth the effort!!

Oh well. While some of the musical history is interesting, if innacuarate at times, the take on 'Generation Ecstasy' (the title should have warned me) is just off. First off, it's a small sub culture, not some generational happening. Second, it never addresses the whole 'Peace, Love, Unity, Respect' aspect of the scene. Third, it missed out on how important the global aspect of this scene is/was. Fourth, it never quite gets across the music itself, the variations, styles, inventiveness. The way in which it discusses the drug activity associated with raves is probably the strongest element of the book, but overall, I was terribly dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. Reynolds sucks the life out of an interesting topic.","review":"Filled with annoying postmodern pseudo-english, Generation Ecstasy seems to be written by someone who desperately wants to be thought of as intelligent. It is a common failing among young professional critics. The formula is simple - merely add a sprinkling of words which refer to anything which has nothing to do with the subject at hand, then throw in some meaningless but intellectual-sounding phrases like, \\"translates into a whole new dialectic,\\" and voila! Instant tripe! Unless you enjoy watching writers contemplate the contemplation of their navel, forget buying this book.

Remember, this is a \\"Children's Book\\" designed to infect the child's mind with Antisemitism.In today's \\"enlightened\\" world, it is odd that the same people who deny the Holocaust, they actively publish and disseminate the hate primers which prepared the path to the Holocaust!

Hillerman knows his mystery writers as well as he knows the West.These stories are written by really great writers who tell stories of the West. Each story is a keeper.

The sound quality is superb, with great mixing and balance. The video quality is also high. The performances are outstanding. George Harrison is great, calm and resolute though somewhat serious and humble. I think he felt this befitting the seriousness and gravity of the situation that inspired this first rock benefit concert. The other stars also have a somewhat serious approach, except for the delightful performance by Billy Preston (who can hardly contain his joy and enthusiasm!). Bob Dylan's voice is great. He looks very young as he performs some of his most famous early pieces. Clapton plays very well in a supporting role and does not seek the spotlight.The bonus material is very good. The duet by Harrison and Dylan is a great.

Bob Dylan and most of the performers here all do a great job, all at their peak. George Harrison is included in that, but Clapton has been better. This concert occurred shortly after the breakup of \\"Derek and the Dominos\\" (perhaps the best short-lived group of all-time), and Clapton was just reaching the depths of his dibilitating heroin addiction. He had stopped playing music and spent the bulk of his time at his home, and only came because his friend George Harrison was putting the whole thing together. This was Eric's last public performance until Pete Townshend dragged him back onstage for the famous Rainbow Theater concerts in December of 1973 (which effectively sent him back into the studio and onto a great solo career as well).

The Harrison family has done a great job.If anyone remembers the VHS version, the sound and picture qulaity are a vast improvement. The second disc has some marvellous extras and interviews and is a joy to watch. The sense of warmth only fades a bit when you learn about how the record companies bickered about which label would release the music.

I gues i will have to purchase a game wheel and try it out, but to everyone who is thinking about purchasing this for the ps2 and using the regular controler, purchase a wheel first. see on my xbox controler you have rt triger finger controlls the gas and you can press down on it half way and get half throtle, on the ps2 its either throtle or nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Beyond Anything","review":"The plot is very thinly developed.

Bands like Emperor,Dissection,Enslaved brought glory and majesty to black metal. However, bands like Marduk gave it a name of Drunked Evil \\"wannabees\\". First two marduk albums were not so horrid, but still mostly boring. This sounds like noise, this album is crap. If you really need some brutality, listen to Zyklon,Gorgoroth or Gehenah.

A solid black metal album that leaves you wondering in what direction Marduk will take this black metal batallion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marduk's best album","review":"After having listened to Marduk's previous albums, LaGrande is their best effortto date.

They say that since I \\"damaged the ring\\" they would not accept the return, wanted over $50 for a repair (the ring cost $140) or they would return it to me, but I had to pay the 6.95 shipping. Do they think I intentionally broke the ring? I didn't feel any catching or pulling of any sort. Frankly if I had, I would have just taken it to my own jeweler for repair since I would have recognized that I broke the ring. I have dozens of rings, in many settings and styles.

The influence of middle-period Coltrane is prevalent, partially due to the appearance of McCoy Tyner and Elvin Jones.

His hand falls on a mysterious old cracked pot as he looks longingly at the full moon and wishes he could receive a marzipan moon every morning. And so begins a delightful turn of fantasy which keeps our dear little priest and we readers guessing -and smiling - at every quirky turn. I can guarantee that Nancy Willard's \\"Marzipan Moon\\" will be a family favorite. Her combination of fantacy and familar failings in mankind give safe distance to grasp the struggles and dreams we all share. Marcia Seawall's illustrations convince readers of the characters believable delimas, with their sad shoulders or beaming faces and incredible creations of imaginations.

I understand her pain, but eventually you just have to move on. In fact, Coulter should never have even written about this.

It is psychology 101."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really horrible book","review":"Don't buy this book, I did and I really regret it. It's about a heroine who was sexually abused as a child, but who doesn't remeber it until her (loving ! ) husband rapes her, because he can't wait for her to come to him on her own good time (she has reasons to draw back, even if she doesn't remember them at first). He abducts, blindfolds and rapes her while pretending to be a Swiss robber, which creates in plus the problem, that, since she becomes pregnant because of this, she sinks in utter misery and loses the child, nearly dying in the whole process. This is when the hero admits that he was the rapist (he knows she is pregnant and crying her heart out, but no, he won't tell her before). After all this, she thinks she loves him !

In all: avoid this book, I had nightmares after reading it and the deep felt wish to string up the hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Catherine Coulter is a great writer and one of my favorite.

Blindfolding her, just imagine what she must of went through after being abused as a child. All of this would have been acceptable since this is only a book, but he was portrayed as a good guy when he actually was a scoundrel. Catherine has written much better books.

In fact, I think the title of the book is a little misleading. BUT that being said, it is a story of love and healing.

You are pretty safe with her modern mysteries, but her historical romances often dissolve into trite, wooden and unbelievable dialogue.

Having a really good system; dvds either sound great, or pretty bad, this was the latter! I actually gave this two stars instead of one because the picture was real good.

I will say however, that the vegan section was a little lacking as it focuses heavily on soy. While I am glad to be included in a book about nutrition, vegans don't actually eat this way. There's a part called \\"Welcome to the World of Soy\\"... I think it said. I remember thinking, this isn't how things really are and soy is not the only source of vegan protein. While she does mention other non-dairy milks in a couple of locations I just thought the lack of seitan (wheat meat) a glaring error. It's got HUGE amounts of protein, but no mention. Kind of unfortunate, some people will read this and think that they must replace everything with soy products. I'm not anti soy, just pro-diverse diet.

The two sound so good together, it's a pity that this was there only recording date. Although this current release is not a Rudy Van Gelder remaster, it sounds great and is essential for fans of either Hubbard or Gordon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful","review":"Each of Dexter Gordon's Blue Note sessions is magic in their own right. This date, which also features Freddie Hubbard on trumpet and Horace Parlan on piano, deserves special mention. \\"I Was Doing All Right\\" is a swinging, singing, happy and absolutely infectious medium tempo number that exudes joy. \\"You've Changed\\" is one of Gordon's most enduring ballad performances. And \\"Society Red\\" is one of those classic nocturnal, minor-key Blue Note slow struts that captures the distinctive sound and the attitude of that era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Cash Fan","review":"Just bought this CD. I have one other Cash CD. This is a CD of his years at Sun Recording Studios. One can hear his love for gospel music in Belshazzar. That classic boom-chick-a-boom Cash sound as very pervilant in this cd. His man was a great story teller.

That's cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Such a little thing makes such a big difference\\"","review":"I'm not even a fan and I liked it. A lot.

The characters all begin to develop quite naturally by the third or fourth episode and the show becomes quite addicting by that point as well. This is a hilarious look on life in New York from four sassy young womens' points of view, but anyone can relate to the problems that come up in their never-dull lives. The DVD features some nice extra features; however the picture is a bit grainy in some scenes for some reason (that's why it did not get a full 5 stars) which is annoying at times. Other than that, a wonderful release. Make sure you check out seasons 2 and 3 as well.

The girls look hot, and talk hot, but they really bring up real-life dilemmas, say things I've actually said, and/or (sorry to say) heard before (Skipper to Miranda \\"I hope you find what you're looking for!\\") - I can't say enough - it's hilarious!

It was very informative for me, I wanted to find out what all had transpired since I just started watching on New Year's Eve when they had 12 episodes - one whole season - of Sex and the City on HBO. Anyway, one of the things that sticks out is the way Sarah Jessica Parker's hair is always changing. I think this is great for the personality she portrays. You find out that Mr. Big was there from the beginning and you watch all these men go in and out of these 4 women's lives. My husband was HOOKED, ladies. He thought it was nice how the stories pick up where they leave off. It is alot like opening a book when you pop this CD in your DVD player. Awesome quality picture, we were very impressed with the clarity. Hope this helps......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda Dirty","review":"Friends raved so about this show, so I finally borrowed the season 1 DVD. To be honest, I didn't find it as funny as I expected, and much raunchier than I expected. I should've known by the title, but I was shocked by the potty language and the non-stop sex. The behind-the-scenes interviews were interesting, but I found it incredible that they think this show is representative of real women -- not me or the women I know! Still, I enjoyed the funny parts and the close friendship among the women and kept watching to see if the women would get more realistic.Be warned: It's definitely R rated and not to be watched with young ones around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never enough Sex In The City","review":"Its camp!

I was thrilled to see it released on DVD and spent last weekend watching it with my best friend! It's really a quality cast and has outstanding writing, and is every bit as funny (and then some) as the highest-rated network comedies.

These 4 women certainly making being single and in the city look like a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest shows on TV","review":"'Sex and the City' started its first season introducing us to the four gals, Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha. This season, Carrie meets Mr. Big, who will be her on-again, off-again love interest for seasons to come. Miranda dates Skipper for a while and Samantha dates everybody. Charlotte, the more traditional of the group, will not sleep with anyone on the first date, unless it's a certain Jewish art collecter. Hmm... It's amazing how frank the subject matter is. There isn't a sexual topic that this show has looked over. My friends and I started renting the series and having 'Sex and the City'-a-thons. This is a great series and started off really well in its first season. It only gets better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great content but poor video quality","review":"Sex and the City is a great series and it is great to have the whole first season in one dvd collection. So, on content, I give it 5 stars. HOWEVER, the video quality is so poor (no stars) that I could not recommend this set unless you are a hard-core fan. The pictures are incredibly grainy and unclear. In fact, the video quality of this dvd series is so bad, it is not only worse than any dvd I own, it is worse than any vhs tape I have including some that I have recorded from TV shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not Only a Chick Show","review":"When I first heard about Sex in the City, I thought it was another of the \\"Chick Shows\\" that men should run from. I was expecting the demographics were going to be the 35 year old, twice divorced, man hating women of the world. But after the first episode, I haven't missed the show once since (I do have a life, and a VCR).My wife enjoys the show because of the women be empowered and educated. I like the show because they say things that men always want to know. Plus the four ladies aren't hard on the eyes. If you watch this show and don't laugh out loud at some point, go to PBS and watch the Antique Roadshow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex in The City? Not With THESE Folks","review":"Allegedly comic adventures of fluff-brained magazine writer and her ghastly friends on the search for a trophy husband in the ritzier neighborhoods of New York. The cast includes such likeable people as Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, and Chris Noth, but they are playing the sort of yuppie scum who should be sterilized at birth, lest they reproduce.

Sure there is more whining and talk about \\"relationships\\" but its the same old hoochie-koochie in a different dress.So I say rent some porn instead.

I didn't get into Sex and the City when it was on T.V. Maybe because I didn't have enough time to watch it. But when it came out, I decided to buy and fell in love with it. I can watch those episodes over and over again. Those are just lives of ordinary young women who face the same problems we do. It's interesting to watch and learn something from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three uglies and a pretty","review":"the title of this review should say it all. the show basically concerns over-the-hill hag (Samantha), brittle wallflower (Miranda), hatched-face (Carrie), and pretty-sweet one (Charlotte) as they date. Its no wonder the three ugly, attempting-to-sell-them-selves-to-thebest-looking-preppie ones can't find anyone who'd love them, while the pretty one manages to snag 2 husbands by the end of the show.Women try to pretend this is about feminism. Its not. Its about how being slut and going for outside appearances in men leave them, well, jilted (witness how much of a plaything Carrie turns into for Mr. Big- he's a jerk, but a handsome jerk, so she'll do anything for him).The more you watch this show, the emptier they become. sort of like the political rhetoric feminists use to defend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who needs a parody when you can watch the original?","review":"It's called \\"the world's greatest fashion show\\" by people who don't want to admit that they're waiting for the actors to undress.Some say it's about human relations. No, it isn't. It's about sex.Still others have dubbed it \\"feminist\\". Come on, you don't really think feminist activists are watching this trash, are you?Even from a sexist angle, the show is a failure. I mean, the women in the show are ugly. Especially Carrie. Curiously, some of the men are more good-looking! Not to mention the trannies.The only positive thing one could say about \\"Sex and the City\\" is that with this original, you really don't need the parodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"PSEUDO-INTELLECTUAL DRIVEL!","review":"(...)This reveals exactly why the terrorists hate our country. Shallow, materialistic, decadent, pseudo-intellectual drivel. I remember hearing one sentence of the show (before throwing the tv out the window) where the main character said \\"I finally realized\\" followed by some pseudo-existential \\"witticism\\" with a straight(dumb)face. The only positive aspect of this show is to teach kids to stay in school.Oh, and to the people who actually enjoy this show (uninteresting feminists and boring teenage girls), if you want to be considered intelligent, you probably shouldn't admit you watch this show.GET HELPSTOP WATCHING THIS SHOWHELP MAKE TEENAGE GIRLS INTERESTING AND FEMINIST ADULTS LESS BORING, YOU CAN DO IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if...","review":"Call me cynical, but a show about women especially womens sexuality that is written by men loses all possible credibility. This show is the poster child for artistic restraint, graphic dialogue doesn't make this compelling. It is just for shock value, all of it. Every possible sexual maneuver and quirk is brought up and dissected ad nauseum. There's a reason this couldn't be on network tv, its garbage. I mean Will & Grace is much more funny and touching. It also does more to dispel stereotypes and squash taboos then Sex and the City could ever hope to do, SITC is just put your hand over your mouth television. \\"I can't believe they are talking about this.\\" is about the best reaction they got out of me. If thats what they want then fine, but there is better, so much better stuff out there. By the way, I'm a guy, so I guess I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD is for quality!

This DVD collection from HBO is unacceptable! I cant even bear to watch it all. I love the Sex... series alot.. But , I find myself staring at the grainy picture..... I cant even stand to finish the first episode. I have old VHS that looks better than this... even recording at EP mode on a VHS looks more clear than this. One word= GRAINY. They ought to be ashamed to have released this garbage transfer. I am curious to know if the VHS of this is clear. Really, listen to us all.... SKIP THIS! you will be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone needs a good dose...","review":"Even though I've seen every episode since the show began airing, I had to buy a copy of the first season. The show's approach to sex is so witty and blunt at the same time, you can't help but smile at the thing's its character's do.Miranda, Carrie, Charlotte, and Samantha make every independent woman proud of who they are. The diversity of the show's characters, from their careers to their beaus to their level of sexual activity leaves everyone someone to identify with. And yes, we've all had a Mr. Big in our lives. I can't say enough good things about the show, and this box-set, so you'll just have to watch it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frothy","review":"Interesting that one of the more negative posters here makes an issue of Sarah Jessica Parker's appearance. Kinda blows one's credibility, I'd say. Still, while it seems that most reviewers either love or hate this series, there IS a kind of middle ground, at least as far as this first season goes. It's all frothy fun: sharply written and very well acted, photographed and directed. But SEX AND THE CITY's first year falls a few notches shy of greatness. Maybe it's because, ultimately, the characters really are a little annoying in their shallowness--although like most people you get to know over time, you get to like them better after a while and forgive them their foibles, at least somewhat. I think the real problem may be the show's brevity. It probably doesn't clock in any shorter than any network sitcom, but it seems to be trying to say more, do more, be more. And that's hard to do in 20-some minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"There should be more shows this good!","review":"An absolutely charming and witty show about the travails of 4 30-something New Yorker single gals, all quite different but smart, sexy, successful and with a lot of personality. The show takes a humorous and original look at the perils of relationships in the space age. These are women and men who want it all -- but are having some trouble figuring out what the 'all' is.Although the primary viewpoint is female, the show's not anti-male. Rather men are looked upon like strange, wondrous and often infuriating creatures -- much like they in turn think of women.None of this tells you how GOOD the episodes are. My wife and I watch one a night, sipping them like fine wine. All four co-stars are extremely natural and convincing in their parts, and the supporting male actors are generally excellent as well. If you like witty, thoughtful and original comedy, you need look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a straight male, but I still love this show!","review":"First off, let me say that my review of 4 stars refers not to the quality of the show, but the dvd transfer quality. To be honest, they did a very poor job of putting this on DVD. It is grainy and washed out, and looks worse than watching it on an old TV set. That out of the way, the show itself is GREAT. Personally, I like the second season the best, but this first season provides the groundwork for the lives of 4 single, smart, sexy, and strange women living in New York City. At times touching, at times hilarious, and always a little on the blue side, this show exposes the bizarre nature of relationships between people of both genders, and the sometimes loving, sometimes cruel things that people can do. I highly recommend it to everyone, and especially you other single guys who wonder just what the hell it is that women think sometimes! This will open your eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Own It, Watch It and Enjoy this Sex in the City Marathon","review":"For anyone who watches this show religiously, this is a godsend. Not only can you watch the awesome episodes over and over again, but you get to own the entire season on high quality DVD. This original HBO series airs during the summer with reruns and repeat broadcasts on the expanded HBO channels.

Having seen a few more, all I can say is \\"whoops\\". Two of Carrie's three friends are not very attractive, all four are fairly self-impressed and boring after a couple episodes, and the supporting characters may as well be made of cardboard. Throwing in a little Kim Cattrall T&A occasionally does make this show any more titillating than it is annoying.

The most interesting character is Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and that's not saying much. She gives us a look into the convoluted relationship problems of herself and her three friends. These supposed liberated women for the late '90s have nothing better to do than talk about how they can't find a man and how all men are the same. Mr. Big (Chris Noth)and his realtonship with Carrie is an interesting focus of the show, but unfortunately it's not enough. This \\"sexy adult comedy\\" leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"HBO is trying to push the envelope with this trash. It is very sad that these women seek to find love through casual sex as opposed to true meaningful relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shallow show for shallow people....","review":"The premise of this show is to portray shallow characters, leading empty, meaningless lives in an urban setting.

Then, late at night during a bout with insomnia, I switched on HBO and found myself watching an episode of Sex and the City and was completely surprised to catch myself laughing out loud at 3 in the morning! So, I rented (and recently bought) the Sex and the City first season on DVD and what a treat it was! I'm telling you, you will not be sorry. It is one of the most well-written and witty programs on television now. Thank you HBO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series, poor dvd","review":"This is the best series on television right now. Hands down! I would love to see Seinfeld with a DVD collection of its own! Sure, the content can be quite disturbing to some viewers, but I am not one of those. I am a guy in his 20s who loves sex....and the city!My only complaint is the video quality. A friend of mine has teh VHS version and sometimes it produces better images than my dvd copy. And its not my machine, this is a complaint I have heard of many times before.

The characters had no decency whatsoever.If you happen to make it to the end of the book you'llfind that the ending is unbelievable; like it was pulled from the depths of stupidity instead of a logical thinking adult.I started the book thinking i'd find a good read about black women who were upstanding and role models.The only role models these people where for future idots of society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous use of paper","review":"I live in the same small community as the author, so I was looking forward to reading Shades of Justice.

There is no softness or gentleness here. The blues is attacked with full force by all participents. Even the second track, which is at a slow tempo, is played double and triple time by Mclean and Hubbard.I feel that for the overall sound of the CD, some balance is missing, some relaxed, layed back moments that would ease the tension. This is why I would not recommend as a blues album, but as a hard edged hard bop album based on the blues form."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not only blues it's great jazz!","review":"McLean laid down a hard blowing session of six tunes based completely on blues motifs. Bluesnik may be McLean's most accessible hard bop session. Not all of these tunes are blues numbers but they use blues forms. They actually don't fall into the conventional 12-bar structure, and therefore even move hard bop paradigms a bit. The swinging factor of the rhythm section on this album is undeniable, especially the interaction between Drew and La Roca. In all, this is a gorgeous session, effortlessly performed by a soloist with a supporting cast of blazing sidemen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced Egyptian Bellydance","review":"I really enjoyed this video.

We know from experience that duct tape won't hold the weight of the batteries for very long, and while you can buy just the cover if that breaks, the pieces that broke off are attached to the lid itself.

The first thing to go wrong was that the batteries kept falling out and into the trash. The battery compartment door broke. We taped it up, but that means it's a hassle to change batteries. Then, the lid started opening slower and not opening completely, like it lost it's zeal for life. Whether the lid motor is depressed or defective, I'm unwilling to pay $50 for a replacement lid. So, it's almost a year old, and has only worked as expected for roughly half that time.

I have had mine for at least 4 years and only one issue - the inside ring has split but we glued it and it is fine. I really think that was our fault - the bag was too heavy and we pulled on it to get it out and the ring got stuck. As far as the lid not opening - if you press the open or close button instead of just waving your hand accross it will not work (motion) until you turn it off and back on and it \\"re-sets\\" it. I learned that after I had company that pressed the button because they did not know it was a motion sensor. I have only replaced my batteries twice in 4 years. I was on here looking at them for a friend that loved mine when she came to visit me.

The visual gags are first-class, and re-watchable even in this day and age of computer-generated special effects. Some of the stunts (which of course Buster Keaton did himself) are amazing to watch, mostly to figure out how they did it all in one take with a film camera.One of the other reviewers mentioned that their DVD was missing the two other advertised short films--they *were* present on my DVD.

We returned our AAE purchase and got the Kino edition instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT entertainment for the whole family","review":"Buster Keaton has always been a personal favorite and I'm EXTREMELY HAPPY that Kino International is putting out such high quality DVDs of his work. Since many of the copyrights are now public domain, there are many garbage DVD transfers out there. Fortunately the Kino Buster Keaton series is gorgeously preserved.If you are new to Buster Keaton's work, I recommend starting with The General DVD. It is his most seminal work and rated as one of the 10 Greatest Films of all time by Sight and Sound. The scene with the trainwreck is a cinema classic, and one of the biggest budget effects of it's day.2 20 minute extras, 'The Playhouse' and 'Cops' are on this DVD as well, and are an excellent and welcome addition. 'The Playhouse' uses film trickery to simulate multiple Buster Keatons at the same time and stretches the technology of the day to new creative heights. 'Cops' is a great slapstick chase flick which all ages can equally enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, lousy music","review":"This not just one of the greatest comedies ever shot, but one of the greatest movies ever made.Sadly, this particular edition, though featuring a lovely print, has public domain music slapped on it, with no correlation to the action. While watching this movie about the American Civil War, you're hearing music from CARMEN, a French opera set in Spain, and other classical selections by other composers. You have fast music during slow scenes, and slow music during fast scenes. It's disgraceful.Get the Kino release instead. They show far greater respect for the silent films they release than this slapped-together mess. That supreme genius Buster Keaton deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"no words can describe how i rate this...it is so old and weird and just plain cheesy...bad bad choice lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so disappointed! My husband and I had watched \\"The General\\" on TV a week before and loved it, and so I decided to order it. When it came, it didn't have the wonderful, expressive organ music we heard in the version on TV. I assumed that was what it would be. The orchestra music with it is heavy and totally unrelated to what's happening in the film. All the reviews I have read since receiving this DVD are the same for every DVD Amazon offers; some say there are choices to have organ music, but which ones are they??? Certainly not this one. I guess I can turn the sound off, but I really would like to find one with the organ background."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD The General silent movie","review":"The movie is what it is, as I expected!During shiping one of the retainer fingers got broken, That let the DVD move around in the case, and was lightly scratched, but had no effect on the viewing quality.Take care Paul..........The General"},{"rating":"2","title":"American Cinema Glory: the 1920s!","review":"I hate to make the painful choice: Chaplin or Keaton. I love both, but I adore Keaton. As a director he is Chaplin's superior, I think. \\"The General\\" is based on a true Civil War story, but this film is crackingly funny, and well-crafted! Keaton's best picture, I think, is \\"Sherlock, Jr.\\", but any \\"stone Face\\" flick is great. Apparently, Disney liked it too. They redid the same story in 1956 as \\"The Great Locomotive Chase\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing But Marred","review":"This movie made by Buster Keaton is an amazing epic that assuredly has a special place in Hollywood film-making. The only thing about it that actually saddens me is that - like other films I have seen - it treats the North as the \\"enemy,\\" & the finale shows a Union officer surrendering to a Confederate. The Confederates did win individual victories, but was there any war more pathethic than this war? And for a film to take the view that the Confederacy was somehow \\"righteous\\" in its cause & the North was an \\"enemy\\" & shown defeated is idiocy like unto much of the Hollywood view on politics we see today. I love & respect Buster Keaton & admire the technical aspects of this film (4 stars!) - but a definite \\"thumbs down\\" on its view concerning the Civil War!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The General","review":"This silent classic is just as funny today as it must have been to its first audience. The only disappointment we had was that the video is truly silent; not even background period music such as silent movies seem to have when shown on TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic nonetheless","review":"Terribly overrated, but a classic of some sort nonetheless. One would expect a fairer amount of comedy and slapstick from a Buster Keaton movie, but this is really a melodrama of the mildly outdated kind. Only one sequence delivers the goods: Keaton trying to aim a big cannon on the train he's chasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Intro to Keaton","review":"I do agree that \\"The General\\" should have been on the top 100 list. Buster Keaton is the icon of the successful comedy writer/director/actors in the 1920's. It just so happens that \\"The General\\" is a history lesson as well, and scholars at the time felt that this movie was about as authentic looking as a Matthew Brady photograph of the Civil War. It contains the most expensive stunt done up to that time-the locomotive plunging into the river (not a model). The movie was a labor of love from Keaton and crew and deserves to find a place in movie history long after other silents of the era have disintegrated. After viewing this movie, go on to \\"Our Relations\\" and the other fine(and perhaps funnier) movies that Keaton made, and discover the two-reelers, especially \\"Cops\\". But this one is special. It is right out of your history book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a collection!","review":"Much has already been written about \\"The General\\", but I need to point out that the two shorts on this disc are also incredible.In \\"The Playhouse\\", Keaton plays different characters on screen simultaneously. I'm amazed that such seamless multiple-exposure shots were done in 1921! Keaton's solution for distinguishing his girlfriend from her lookalike, at the end of the short, made me chuckle out loud, primarily due to the comic timing in the scene.\\"Cops\\" was the main reason I bought this disc. I wanted a nice print of this masterpiece, and that's what I got. As is typical of the Kino/Image DVD's the prints of this old film looks beautiful.Oh, and you'll probably enjoy \\"The General\\", too...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece of silent comedy.","review":"What else can one say about \\"The General?\\" It is arguably the greatest comedy of the silent film era. The American Film Institute in its recent \\"100 Years, 100 Laughs\\" list of the 100 funniest movies, rates \\"The General\\" higher than any other silent movie, putting it ahead of Chaplin's great films. Kino's print of the film on this DVD is wonderful. \\"The Playhouse\\" is an enjoyable short film, and \\"Cops\\" is masterwork of physical comedy and provides some excellent shots of Los Angeles in the early twenties.Those hoping to start a Buster Keaton DVD collection should start here, then move on to \\"Sherlock, Jr.\\" and \\"Our Hospitality.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film Great Presentation from Kino Video","review":"Kino Video's new two disc version is highly recommendable for the flim itself. The second disc is okay but nothing overly special and most Buster Keaton fans already have the feaures on it. Robert Israel's wonderful score is available as it was on the previous Kino release. Israel's work as so often really makes the movie as he is always able to match the moods and events in silent films he has scored. The real prize here is the Carl Davis score which is very different but equally good and also able to bring the movie alive. What is interesting is to watch the movie back to back with the two scores as you will soon realize they cause you to absorb the film differntly. In one certain scenes strike you differntly from the other just with the change of music. There is also an organ score. While organ scores are probably a more authentic way to watch a film of the 1920's you simply cannot beat an orchestral score such as Davis's or Israel's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this General","review":"There are other versions of \\"The General\\" available on DVD and any would be preferable to this one. It's picture quality is muddy and the score is simply a washover of everything from \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" to Borodin to Bizet, none of it selected with the slightest appropriateness to what is going on on the screen. True, you can watch it without the sound, but why? Even at this low price, to be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quest and Love","review":"This movie is ranked in top twenty best films ever made. It is a tribute to Keaton that words matter so little in what must have been a technological marvel for its day. The incredible danger that Keaton and Marian Mack endured while skipping and lurching on top of very real trains and locomotives would not be duplicated by preening stars today. Part of the charm of a story of quest and love, is the danger endured by the hero and heroine against all odds. As in most films of this era, there is a naive quality to romance. The action however, especially on a big screen is fascinating. How did Keaton think up all the possibilities of locomotive spills and chills? This film is totally original and has influenced 100's of films that followed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The video features the BEST SOUNDTRACK FOR THIS FILM.","review":"When will someone release the Thames Television version of this film on DVD?It has an outstanding score by Carl Davis that really helps the movie. All other prints of this film either have soporific 'film music' or completely inappropriate tracks. Davis is the only composer who seems to know that silent film music is supposed to support the action and work with the visual rhythms of the film.The GENERAL is a brilliant movie that works even better with the right track. While this is true of all silents, it's particularly crucial for this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong soundtrack!","review":"This is the wrong soundtrack. It's just classical music, sometimes doesn't even go with the events unfolding onscreen. You can get this wonderful movie elsewhere, with various soundtracks. The best score was done by The Alloy Orchestra. It has exciting passages and charming musical effects that not only enhance the story, but even are a large part of telling it. It goes perfectly with the action and even sound like a train, etc. It completely changes the dynamic.We accidentally bought this version, and I was deeply disappointed. It is only a shadow of its former self. Buy this wonderful movie somewhere else, when you can be certain of it having better musical accompaniment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, bad music","review":"Funny movie with great facial expressions.

They arrived in a very sturdy plastic bag which I nestled into an airtight container for longer storage. A tiny amount of seeds generate so many sprouts, I can see this one pound bag lasting me a year or more. After about 4 days of rinsing and draining, I spread them out to dry then transfer to an airtight container in my refrigerator; they remain crisp, green, and flavorful for well over a week. I couldn't be happier with these seeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Crime Fans, Rejoice!","review":"When they re-issued the dozen or so Georgette Heyer mysteries recently, I was taken in by their appealing vintage cover artwork. What I discovered - to my surprise and delight - were wonderful English manor mysteries, similar in the Agatha Christie style.These books blend a nice, cozy, old-fashioned mystery with Ms. Heyer's wonderfully snarky and dry wit, which adds up to genuine reading pleasure.

Heyer is better known now for her Regency romances, but her mysteries are very good too. This one starts with a dead butler - a twist on 'the butler did it'. Then you go on to the typical English manor house and meet lots of possible suspects. It's fast-moving and fun, set in the 1930's. If you love Christie or Sayers, you'll like Heyer's mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Mystery Just Doesn't Hold Up","review":"This is a re-visit after 30 years to a novel written about 70 years ago. The overly-complicated plotting, the paper-doll characters, and the staging of the eompletely undecipherable ending just make this a mess.

The result is good, entertaining brain food.My only regret is that I read this volume before the first one in the series, The Vanished Child.

I'm not sure what happened in between these two books but The Knowledge of Water was very dissapointing. The thought behind the book was good. But the book itself was hard to read and easy to put down.

I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was as trashy as Tinseltown itself","review":"When I bought this book, I was expecting big fun and seedy but sohisticated humor. I recieved neither. It was a trashy account filled with sex in almost every chapter (I felt like I was reading Penthouse's stars edition) No real substance or care for the characters, which is important. I really dont recomend it, your better off watching E! and renting a porno."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-Out-Loud Tale of Hollywood Excess At Oscar Time","review":"I was lucky enough to read an advance copy of this delightful first novel. Hysterical spoof of the Jackie Collins Hollywood cycle, following the amoral, hapless lives of the five nominees for Best Actress from the morning of the nominations through awards night. Well-paced and consistently funny, with hilarious plot twists and over-the-top intrigue. A grand romp with genuine laughs on every page. Pefect for plane or beach reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE ... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I was SO disappointed by this novel. A truly original concept gone very badly awry. I felt like I was reading work from a high school student. The characters are pointedly based on loose conglomerations of known actresses. That's the only fun part. Otherwise the characters are so one-dimensional that you needn't waste your time or money. A real let down for me... and I'm a BIG-TIME Academy Awards buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear technique of Offset Printing","review":"I think this book is a must for amature and professional printer who want to develop themselve to be the mast er printing.

It also includes the funeral message that Benedict Pictet preached at Turretin's funeral. In this volume Turretin covers: the Church, the Sacraments, and last things. To give you an idea of how thorough Turretin is, he takes 31 questions to discuss the sacraments.

My car looked worse than before I'd washed it! Ever since, I've tried various other washes and waxes (other brands) and the finish on my car was damaged so badly by Meguiars Deep Crystal Car Wash that I'm now looking into possibly having my car's clear coat re-done!

As a result, I found it difficult to concentrate on the film; I kept thinking of how bad it looked and how much better it might have looked had the money been put into some sort of restoration. I've grown to have so much confidence in these Fox classics, and this is my first major letdown, so I'm hoping \\"The Return of Frank James\\" will turn out alright (though I was so disappointed with \\"Jesse\\" that I've toyed with the idea of returning \\"Frank\\").Anyhow, sadly, I have to advise against getting this unless you don't care about the picture quality --- if PQ matters to you, you are bound to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, just awful","review":"Whatever significance this film has, it derives from the stellar cast. Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda do a credible job portraying Jesse and Frank James despite a screenplay that takes criminal liberties with the historical record. You may find it entertaining, but don't come away from it thinking you've learned anything useful about the James boys. The distortions become all the more shocking when you realize that there were still people alive in western Missouri who remembered the original people and events when this silly thing was released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesse James","review":"This is an awesome Western starring Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda made in the late 30s in stunning color. This movie also stars; Nancy Kelly, Randolph Scott, Henry Hull, Slim Summerville, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, Donald Meek, Jane Darwell, plus others! This movie is presented in Full frame, Technicolor and runs for about 106mins (1hr 46mins). The quality is the best I've seen for a late 30s DVD in color and at some points it kind of looked like I was watching Blu-ray. Overall this is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Outlaw Tale","review":"This Old Classic Tale have been watched by millions of people through the ages who loves outlaw heros.

Probably not a book for someone who believes everything in the Bible is the only truth however for someone searching for more answers than the Bible can provide this certainly gives another area to focus on from a woman's aspect.

I'm no bible scholar, but I think Mr. Grant may have his Marys mixed up. Lazarus did have a sister named Mary, but it was Mary of Bethany (half of \\"Mary and Martha\\"), not Mary Magdalene. Maybe Mr. Grant was not using \\"brother\\" in the biological sense?Amazon.com insists that I apply a rating between 1 and 5 stars in order to post this review. I don't want to be unfair since I haven't read the book, but for credibility I can only give it one star. (If it has the grammatical errors that one of the other reviewers mentioned, that also supports a 1-star rating in my view.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutely timeless work, Mangione is a master","review":"This single album is one of the earliest recollections I have of listening to music(I was born in 1976). My father owns it on vinyl, and it remains one of his prize possessions in an impressive overall collection. The oldest son of our close family friends of over 25 years recorded this off of my father's vinyl close to sixteen years ago and eventually used \\"Consuelo's Love Theme\\" as his wedding music many years later. I feel that this singular track remains just as moving as the first time I listened to it, and I'm not easily moved. Mangione's composition and arranging skills are on full display here for those willing to take a listen, and you get the idea of how great an accomplishment the album was simply by reading Chuck's liner notes. Thank God someone got the good sense to release this on CD again, or we would have been subjected to the slow and undeserved extinction of a true classic of this or any other time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless and Incredible !","review":"I have never in my life been a Chuck Mangione fan...until now. This music is very compelling,especially for someone like me who lives in the Southwest and is close to Mexico. Everytime I play this soundtrack Mangione's brilliant artistry paints the desert landscape in my mind perfectly each time. The vocals,instrumentation, melodies are quite breathtaking and memorable. Bella Via is simply just that;Beautiful. Lullabye,Consuelo's Love Theme are all about mood,feeling, and passion for life ! The most astounding feat of this soundtrack is how Mangione avoided using the stereotypical Mexican \\"Hollywood\\" soundtrack cliched Mariachi or the typical \\"aye, aye , ya aye\\" sound.At times there's almost a sort of New Age/Ambient approach to some tracks (even before New Age was recognized as a type of music back in the 70's). This is a very mystical and magical recording that will never lose it's spark !..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!! After years of waiting for the CD!!","review":"I have worn out an LP and a Cassette of Children of Sanchez.

The only good thing was the music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful","review":"I purchased this on vinyl in the late 70's and loved it. of course I had lost it and forgotten why I was so enamoured of it. I remember the liner notes though I never saw the movie. This is one of the singularly best pieces of music I have ever heard. Passion explodes with every burst of Chuck's Trumpet. He explores the limits of his instrument with unapologetic enthusiasm. The message is all the more powerful for it's lack of polish. Chuck Mangione was a Master!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From mediocre to downright annoying!","review":"There were many classic records released by Blue Note in 1964. This, unfortunately, is not one of them. The ugly cover should have been a tip-off, but I was persuaded to part with my hard-earned paper to get this. The opening track is clever, but is extremely irritating. Hubbard's playing is fine throughout, but the compositions (with the exception of the final beautiful track by Joe Chambers) are abysmal. I concur with the assesment below - a big disappointment. This is a far cry from adventurous Blue Note classics like Wayne Shorter's 'All Seeing Eye (to which Hubbard contributes some fantastic playing), Andrew Hill's sadly underappreciated and out of print 'Compulsion' and Cecil Taylor's essential 'Conquistador!' and 'Unit Structures' (among others). In a word, on sale, it's a buy. Otherwise, avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"This is Freddie and the often awful James Spaulding going over the edge.

It's clear that someone just went on a trip, brought back a lot of chocolate and has been selling them online since w/out any kind of quality control. The chocolate wasn't even mailed in a box to protect it, the vendor used a regular enveloped.The price is unwarranted. The picture of the product is quite deceiving, each bar is half the size of a full-sized kit kat bar.I couldn't recommend - they're plenty of other Ferreo products that taste the same, cost less and aren't expired on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epitome of an Epic","review":"For all intents and purposes, this is THE silent film to own, if one can own just one. It has everything. Drama, special effects, comedy, allegory, myth, good vs evil. Murnau is a director par excellence and displays his visionary propensities to splendid effect in this classic Goethe tale. The inimitable Emil Jannings plays a hearty, red-blooded Mephisto. Jannings as a silent screen actor invokes in one look, or a singular movement, what some contemporary actors could not hope to capture within a fete of endless dialogue. Camilla Horn plays a heartbreaking Gretchen, and the scene in which she wanders the snow with her dying baby is as evocative as it gets. Grab a hankie and do not feel shamed to find yourself swept along for the ride, of which there is a most splendid one included in this film, where Faust and Mephisto glide above a world in miniature. Amazing, exhilarating, absorbing. You shan't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Those Movies With Unforgettable Visuals","review":"This will sound stupid but watching this movie I kept thinking that I wished each frame could be a poster on my wall, especially the one with the Devil over the entire city with his great bat wings. I got this as a gift with \\"Leaves from Satan's Book\\" and both are spectacular looks at a different time and different belief systems. Though \\"Satan's Book\\" had the amazing acting, the visuals in \\"Faust\\" were superior, Murnau creating one indelible image after another. I can't recommend this movie high enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"The restored German version is unbelievably great. I sat down to watch a few minutes, just to see the quality. Eventually, the credits began to roll. HIghly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually Stunning German Silent Film","review":"Cinematically this is a triumph of black and white cinematography. What is done with light and shadow is consistently amazing - mind-boggling for its time. Carl Hoffmann brilliantly creates a world of shades and shadows for these timeless myths to unfold against. Unfortunately, the narrative is very ponderous and slowly paced - one is reminded of Wagner's PARSIFAL in its concept and its execution. The love story between the young Faust and his Gretchen repeats itself over and over until one has to shut off the story and just concentrate on the visuals. Jannings is a stand-out as the sly and conniving Mephisto. The rest of the cast is merely adequate. Future director William Dieterle is not memorable as Gretchen's brother. This is a hard film to sit through but worth it for Murnau fans and for fans of cinematography. It is certainly a visual masterwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy unless you know German!","review":"This product is only sold on the western hemisphere, yet the captions are written entirely in German! I realize this was a German movie, but I do not know German, and nowhere in the product description did it say the captions had not been translated.

Once again, do not buy this product unless you can read German!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real DVD!","review":"This is actually a very poorly made DVD-R! I love this film, but don't buy this version! It's not even a good restoration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning reproduction and photography, good art film","review":"I'm not a silent film buff. But the story of Faust was enough of a temptation. The black and white photography, alone, makes this worth watching. The textures, gray tones, and authentic and artistic style kept me a captive audience. The orchestral soundtrack is something you would expect from Wagner. All in all, an excellent viewing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"After reading Richard's book \\"Earthly Purpose\\" I purchased these tapes because lots of stuff in the book was starting to sound familiar.

For about a month my son would get really bad gas and just scream for hours. You could just feel his super tight little tummy and imagine his pain. The gas drops didn't really do much after his tummy got to that point so I tried this tummy band. It was amazing how quickly he would relax and drift off to sleep. Other reviews mention the band leaving burns on the baby's belly, I always put the band on over clothes and followed the heating instructions and not once had a burned baby belly. The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is it is a little tricky to keep the band from riding up. I want it to just stay on the belly but it shifts easily and can be tricky to readjust.

Plus it smells good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think this helps at all ....","review":"We've tried this a number of times and we just don't think it works (for our baby). Of course, it's hard to know what's *really* causing a baby to cry frequently, so I was skeptical that it would work to begin with. But one *should* buy this with a healthy dose of skepticism. Of course, if you've got a baby that cries a lot, it's probably worth trying anything and everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"We were so desperate!","review":"This product is ok.

For gas, I recommend Hyland's Colic Tablets over anything else (and we've tried everything-having 2 gassy, gassy babies!). They instantly soothe her stomach so she can sleep, and they're a natural, homeopathic remedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe in this product.","review":"This helped my son calm down and relax enough to nap when he was tired instead of waking up from the painful gas bubbles he was having. I only used it for a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"My three month old is having some tummy aches after eating. He would burp well, but still have the tummy aches. I tried gas drops but they didn't seem to help. I tried the Happi Tummi and it has been the only thing that helps him. Within minutes of putting it on he clams down and is much happier. Love this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute... but not very effective.","review":"It's very soft. The lavender smell is very nice. It did not provide relief for my baby though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty useless","review":"I really have no idea why I purchased this product. I think it sounded like a good idea, and my newborn had such gas and GI issues that I was pretty desperate. But I think a hot water bottle or a warm towel could have done the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"gassy days- not miserable anymore hopefully","review":"Can't ask for better when it's FDA approved and you don't have to give your gassy baby those gas drops that seem to make them scream louder until the gas passes. I am looking forward to trying this product out, along with swaddling the baby with the miracle blanket... this waistband and a little light bouncing on the baby's belly on my lap should do the trick on gassy days. It's what will work best for me, you should do what I did and just keep magazine shopping and reading reviews until you find that perfect item that sounds just perfect for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very large","review":"This was too big for our baby, would fit a toddler better or a chunky 9+ month old. Not sure if it works as it was just too big when we needed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"unexpected japan","review":"Bird provides a view of Japan that was unknown to outsiders in that day, and is little known to us today. The scenes she descibes of the interior of Japan would scarecly entice today's traveler; which makes her adventures all the more intriguing. Her extensive knowledge of history and botany enhances the drama; however, had she incuded a glossary of terms, as well as the common names of flora it would have sped my reading as I had to repeatedly refer to dictionaries and botanic references. Her ethnocentrism is revealed as she describes the natives of the area; a pracctice that would be frowned upon today. Never-the-less I look forward to reading more of her works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intrepid back country traveler","review":"Isabella Bird was the first Western white woman to visit the more remote regions of Japan. She did so - as usual, in her travels - with merely a local guide and appropriate travel/camping gear. Her writings offer a fascinating glimpse into local life in Japan in the mid-late 1800s. She was an intrepid traveler, an astute observer of the human and the cultural, and very much a woman of her era - although open-minded for her times, many of her cultural assumptions and societal standards come through between the lines. But it is an altogether delightful read. This and her other books are compilations of letters she wrote home to her sister, who was also her very good friend: reading this, you can \\"be there\\" with her on her travels, just as she must have intended her sister to be. Highly recommended for anyone interested in a close look at a foreign culture, in Japan, and/or in great travel writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced for a \\"so-so\\" filter.","review":"My wife picked up a set of Hunter air purifiers on QVC. The price of replacement filters is outrageous. Nothing special about them and I don't really notice an improvement in air quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"i remember mama","review":"this is an great album and is excellent for mothers day ot for just an good reason to remember mama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reeses","review":"The candy was delivered on time as promised. The only thing I had a problem with is that my product did not taste like what I purchased. Wherever they stored it, it must have been close to bubblegum because that is what the candy tasted like. Just like when some of your food is in the refrigerator too long and starts to take on the taste and smell of another item in the fridge, thats exactly what I dealt with. I hope the wholesaler fixes this problem but until then, I'm done with ordering candy online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent swinging sax combo session!","review":"If you've ever wanted one of those smokin' sax albums for a warm night in front of the fireplace, look no further. Turrentine's sax just sizzles, and Jack Costanzo plays bongos! This is a rarity and a classic, it gently swings, and heavilt steams!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment for those seeking a new career.","review":"If you buy this book looking for help in choosing a new career path, you're going to be disappointed. It is not a serious career guide. The information provided is slim and many of the jobs profiled are pie-in-the-sky occupations (such as actor, singer and, most ridiculous of all, president of the U.S.) that would be of no interest to any serious job-seeker. In addition, the book seems thrown together, with bad print quality and multiple typos on almost every page."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Clue!!!","review":"The author of this book has no clue the work of librarians. I have been a public librarian for almost 8 years, at a reference desk. The stress level is high at many times. Whereas the author thinks librarians have low stress levels. Librarians, especially public ones, deal every day with all types of people. Also librarians deal with many different tasks at one time. Librarians do not sit around reading books. This book is pretty much worthless. Anyone who buys it is wasting their money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Firefighter, STRESSFUL???","review":"Firefighter is ranked more stressful than nursing? Puhleeze! I've seen veteran firefighters crumble under the pressure of a moderately busy ER... This book just perpetuates the...we are fed by the media. The author should do himself a favor and actually STUDY some of the research done about burnout levels and job satisfaction among the various professions. The would be purchaser could do better for themself without buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of information","review":"I'm switching jobs and really appreciated all the information in this book. A friend of mine also recommended another book to me, called Finding A Career That Works For You. It helped me because at first I didn't even know what kind of job I wanted to LOOK for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it with a grain of salt!","review":"This book is good reading for background information on a variety of careers. If you are in high school or college and trying to figure out what career field might interest you, you should take a look at this book. Most people will not be able to achieve the majority of these career paths. I am surprised that fields like President or NBA player are included."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favs","review":"Addicted is one of my favorite books ever, it keeped my attention through out the whole book and made me loose my breath at the ending. Zane is a great writter and after reading Addicted she made me turn to many of her other books making her turn out to be my favorite author. Addicted will keep you wanting more and will have you feel different emotions every time you turn a page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic","review":"I cannot believe the reviews on this book. I am black and have never heard the slang terms used this book and the sex scenes are mediocre for a woman supposedly addicted to sex. This is the first book I have read by Zane and will give her one more chance to write a book with a somewhat believable story line and without an ending that comes out of nowhere. Read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not buy this book","review":"I read this book at first to experience a new writer.I was deeply disappointed , I don't know how they got published because the ending of the book was disappointing and unbelievable that that would be the reason this woman would cause this much trouble in her life. Please do not buy this book, do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Sucked!!","review":"I didn't even finish the 4th chapter before I put it down. There is one thing to BE black and there's one thing to SOUND black and from the GHETTO!! I thought the editor of this booked should have told this author to sound a little more intelligent when writing!!! I didn't even get to the GOOD parts before I threw the book down with disgust. I will NEVER read another book of hers again. I gave it a 1 just because I couldn't give it a 0!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UNREALISTIC","review":"This book was sooo predictable it's funny. I was really disappointed, because I thought it's going to be a lot better. It wasn't suspenseful, it was nothing just boringggg and so unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"This was long read for me. Took me 6 days to read it..It start out really slow. The last half of the book was the best. Instead of 300 plus pages it could have been condense into 200 pages. For all the crab Zoe did it ended unrealistic Jason deserved better than than the trifling \\"Bitch\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The zero star option was not available....","review":"maybe if i had a g.e.d. and read one or two books a year, i might think this is special, but this is just ludicrous. the only reason why zane is successful is because there is a market for black erotica. i have seen 4 black anthologies in the past year alone, so, naturally, a major publisher, is going to pick up her book based on her rep and sales...but a rep and sales doesnt make her a great writer. her style is elementary. graphic to the point of clinical and is beyond hyperbole.but then most people who read black books don't really care about the story or how well it's written so long the guy and the girl get together in the end. it's a shame more talented writers are being slighted, while delusional hacks like her become famous..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nor Addicted or Hooked to Zane","review":"After hearing my sis talking about this author I had to read one of her book and was I disappointed. There is no realism in her novels...and its nothing but SEX SEX SEX...thats how the reader gets HOOKED into her books....I agree with one of the reviewer who called this PORN ON PAPER...this is crazy...what happened to classics like Jane Eyre....Frankenstine....Beloved....Macbeth...have we as society stooped so low that all we can do is talk about sex and leave out other important issues....okay...so she got over her sex addiction that was related to her childhood sexual abuse...but how does that add up in the end...so she is an sex addict and her husband is a whore's son....WOW...way to go ZANE...I wonder if this book has some autobiographical pieces in it....hmmmm....I WONDER....well if you can't entertain brilliant brains than dont write at all....I rest my case"},{"rating":"1","title":"Addicted","review":"I only finished this novel because I feel compelled to finish what I start. \\"Addicted\\" was completely unrealistic and thus unalbe to be enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"read it twice, by accident","review":"It can't be a good thing that I was halfway through the book before I realized that I had already read the darn thing! I know a lot of mass market fiction can be interchangeable, but for the characters and plot to be so forgettable that it took me 100 pages before I realized it was all too familiar...that's crazy. Also, why couldn't the main character have a lot of sex simply because she loved it, not because she was molested as a child. It plays into the old stereotypes that the only women who have a voracious appetite for sex (aldultery, or not)must have been molested as children. When will women be allowed to love sex, simply because it feels good and it's wonderful?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My!!","review":"This was the best book that I have read in a long time!!! I have given it to all of my girlfriends and they said the same thing. I am quite fond of Zane's writings. She is a no-holds barred type writer and her words just jump out at you. She really captured the life of this couple and the trials and tribulations of the relationship. A great read and a must-have!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Addicted? Not exactly...","review":"I opened \\"Addicted\\" with high expectations and closed it high-and-dry, so to speak. I must say, Zane is terrific at creating atmosphere, for example the way Zoe and Jason met, their childhood escapades, etc. But Zoe's childish 'nuccas' and other curses (in front of her passive, middle class Black parents? puh-leese, i would have caught a beat-down!) and tantrums simply turn into adult tirades (I hate you! I just hate you!) when things don't go her way. Yet she's supposed to be an independent, successful business woman? Zoe is neither believable, nor likable, nor dispicable--just annoying. It takes more than erotic scenes to make a book engaging. Less cursing and exclamation marks and more meaningful moments between characters would have made this book more intense and powerful. This fiction squandered an opportunity to address --or even relate-- sexual addiction to real black women facing the issue. I recommend \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\" by Sistah Souljah instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Check back. I will have a real review written in a few days. I am just giving star ratings on all the books I read this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish and unbelievable","review":"I read this because I had heard good things about Zane- but it was really unbelievable to buy into this ridiculous plot about a sex-addicted woman cheating on her husband. I kept thinking it would get better but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many cliche can one sentance have?","review":"I had the misfortune of reading as much of this book as I could stomach. Not only is the story line weak, but even worse is Zane's writing style - cliche after cliche passing for prose. Our book-club has UNANIMOUSLY agreed to trash it. Do yourself a favor and purchase something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK WAS SO BAD IT WAS GOOD","review":"I read this book in one sitting. Not because I thought it was the \\"literary\\" masterpiece some of the other reviewers called it but because it was absolutely RIDICULOUS! I couldn't put it down because when I was not laughing I was shaking my head. The editing (was there any?) was terrible. The story was not believable. I found it hard to accept that a woman like Zoe, an alledged intelligent business woman, could be hopping in and out of bed with met she hardly knew and NOT ONCE MENTION SAFE SEX! What intelligent woman in her right mind would do all that? Would she really do all that without using a condom?! The encounter with Diamond was mentioned as an afterthought with very little details. I will not read any more books by this author until she learns to write like a professional!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Haters Need to Shut Up!","review":"To all the haters out there who don't like this book--when was the last time YOU wrote a book that someone other than your friends and family read? (And they read it only because they felt obligated!) Zane doesn't have to be the greatest prose stylist in the English language in order to tell a story that obviously resonates with thousands of people. Why waste your time writing a negative review when you've probably never published a word in your life with maybe the exception of a poem in the high school newspaper? Stick to valid criticism with REAL insight, if you must criticize, but leave the thinly-veiled hater attacks at the door. Whether you like it or not, Zane is laughing all the way to Chase Manhattan--and you're sitting there plunking away on a keyboard, seething with envy and wondering why people keep buying her books by the millions. Who's the fool? Look in the mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For The Savvy Reader!","review":"If you enjoy a thoughtful read -- Addicted is not for you. It is a juvenile attempt at discussing meaningful concepts. I found the book very shallow and somewhat interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty!!!!!","review":"A friend of my 15-year-old daughter recommended this book to her. I was just about to order it when I decided to read the excerpts. I thank the Lord God that I did. What I read was disgusting!!! Just flat out NASTY!!! Ironically, the girl that suggested this book to my daughter is her 17-year-old, 7-month-pregnant, eleventh-grade friend. Hmmm...!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"book was BANGING","review":"the book was really good read it in one day so go out and buy it you wont regret it:):):):):)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't End!","review":"Don't end is what you will be screaming when you see this book is about to end. Really, it was that good. This is the first time I picked up a book by Zane and I'm not disappointed one bit. The title grabbed you and the plot reeled you. It was very fast paced and interesting. You will be on the end of your seat wanting to know what happened next. One word describes the regret that plague the main characters and it's \\"If\\". If... Jason had only listened to Zoe. If...Jason had only talked to Zoe about his premature exposure to sex. Zoe may not have engaged in her crazy azz behaviors. Not saying she's innocent, but she was a victim of circumstances beyond her control on all ends. I will say no more. Just this, run don't walk to get your copy of \\"Addicted\\" Its fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true page turner","review":"This book was definitely a good read. Zane's descriptions are so vivid, it's almost as if you're watching a movie. As a matter of fact, I think that they should turn it into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"addicting!","review":"This book pulls you in and holds on to you until the very end! Drama packed.....We all know someone similar to the main character!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT, GREAT, POWERFUL BOOK","review":"I couldn't keep my head out of this novel it was good it was really good. I enjoyed it, Zane is an excellent writer who captures your attention with her stories. I can't decide which book to read next APF, Heat Seekers, or Sex Chronicles II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been better!","review":"This book was a very fast read. I do have to say that I enjoyed reading it however. I have several friends who said that I simply \\"HAD\\" to read this book. I do think that the author \\"skimped\\" over one of Zoey's affairs (wonder why?)and that the book could have been written a little better (makes me think that Zane was rushed into writing this). I would recommend this book; however, I do not recommend this book to anyone who is close-minded or does not like to think/talk/hear about sex. If you are any of those things, then this book is NOT for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"T-I-G-H-T Plot!","review":"Addicted is a story of deep down true love with a tightly woven plot that leaves you guessing until the very end. Zane's writing style and surprise twists makes her novel a refreshing read with loads of tastefully done erotic scenes! Her characters built a love that as a reader I was able to believe deeply in. A fast paced love, lust and what's missing story that is a must have on your shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a GOOD Book!","review":"I was hooked from the start. The book flowed well and kept my attention for all 267 pages. It reads very easy, but isn't simple. Zoe lead a very nice lifestyle and seemed to attract people of a different element, which was kind of interesting. There were times I wished Jason wasn't so sappy, but that added to the storyline. The \\"affairs\\" were tough and rough, so I can see why Zane choose that route. The book has sex, lies, murder, intrigue, suspense and all that. I liked the realistic details about the book, then ending got a little far-fetched, but hey, people are crazy this day and age and that could have happened! You won't be disappointed. Way to go Zane."},{"rating":"1","title":"THANK YOU, ally1queen2!!!!","review":"For being one of the few people with an appreciation for WRITING!This book was pretty close to the bottom. I gave it 2 stars because the beginning story was OK. The rest was contrived, unrealistic (people don't speak this way in real life), and unbelievable. It's impossible to feel any sympathy for Zoe unless you yourself have no respect for anyone you love. All she thought about was herself,nothing else unless it threatened her selfish world. And truth be told, I think if some readers were really honest with themselves, they would have wanted to see a whole different ending... one without her. What is happening to literacy in this country???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad there is no 0 stars option...","review":"The story is the most predictable, the language is at fifth grade level, and an 'average customer rating' is four and a half stars?!! Something is wrong here... Anyway, don't waste your time on this book, pick something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I will start by saying this is the first Zane book I have read, and it will be my last solely due to the fact that this one is horrendous.I just read through these 5 star reviews and I am astounded. I have no idea what kind of books these people are use to but this is a piece of trash.I felt like I was reading a 13 year olds fantasy in blog form. The writing is full of ghetto slang and the sex scenes are severely lacking. Zane needs a thesaurus because I was tired of reading the same sentences and phrases over and over.The entire book is unrealistic, ridiculously predictable and left me saying \\"WTF\\".In closing, professional men and women do not use phrases like \\"sheeeeit, that's the bomb-diggity\\", unless apparently, they are in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"This book was a complete waste of money. The story line was ridiculous. The sex described in the story was cartoonish. The plot (and I use this term loosely) twists were obvious. The author tried to throw everything (including a hypnosis, a serial killer, daycare and a message about domestic violence) into a weak plot line and it really dragged on the book. The only reason that I can justify reading the entire thing is that it was like a train wreck. I cannot for the life of me understand all of the positive reviews for this garbage. This was my first and last Zane 'novel'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off Da Chain","review":"I thought this was a really good book. I liked it so much that I had to go out and buy 3 more of zane's books. I could really relate to the way the main character was feeling in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I found this book very interesting. I read a lot and I never heard of Zane until my neighbor introduced her to me. I couldn't stop reading this book once I got into it. It was very well written. I read this book in a couple of days. After reading Addicted I got on the interent and looked up Zane to see if she had written anything else and lord and behold I discovered Heatseekers which was well written as well as Shame on it all which I am in the mist of reading now. Zane is an excellent author. As long as she keeps the material coming I will keep supporting her talent. You Go Gurl."},{"rating":"2","title":"finished and was left semi-satisfied","review":"as i read addicted, it dragged me in deeper and deeper into the world of zoe. i could somehow relate to her, as i got nearer and nearer to the end i was disappointed that the book was ending. i wanted it to keep going on and on for ever. but as i got to the understanding of who the third lover was, i was shocked, well not really, i sort of guessed from the get go. it reminded me of my life, running around with various people chasing me for the \\"good stuff\\". i'm currently awaiting more books to be delivered to my mail box since i live overseas to read. thanks zane"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs Some Serious Editing!","review":"This could have been a much better book if it had been more carefully edited. Most of the story reads like a first draft. And the characters are not believeable. Why is it Zoe, who is supposed to be so savvy, NEVER mentions condoms?! The author attempts to address some HEAVY issues that were over her head. Sadly, some reputable authors call this book a masterpiece--HORSEFEATHERS! This book is nothing more than creative typing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it came with a money back guarantee","review":"I was intrigued by the title and moreso that Zane's books seem to dominate bookstores and reading groups.This particular novel could have been more interesting but the beginning was a bit annoying for me. I understand that it chronicled the \\"boy meets girl\\" scenario but . . . it took something away from the storyline. And the storyline wasn't about addiction so much as it was about a woman who didn't seem to get sexual satisfaction from her mate. I didn't feel that she was addicted and the storyline deviated from that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's get hot, emotional, and tragic","review":"Addicted is one of Zane's deepest novel. This book is really good. It's about a lady who feels she can't trust or fully get commited to any men because of what happened to her in the past. Then she meets up with this guy she thought was nothing good for her, until he started doing everything she loves and never knew a man could do. So it gets sexual and with the great detail of the love making, I mean it seems as if your the one who's being pleased. I would definitely recommend this book to people who love drama, sex, and tragic escapades. Also read her other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was totally disapointed.","review":"I read her previous book and it was pretty cool but this one I am not too happy with. I was totally disapointed in the beginning and the ending. The middle was pretty decent but all else was horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have","review":"I thought that the book Addicted was a great book. The way Zane Wrote was just incrediable. Everything in this piece was breath taking, as you get into the book you have to pry yourself away from it. As for me it was hard to put the book down because as i began to read each chapter i began more addicted to the book, which allowed me to continue reading. Reading the book and thinking about the things that the main character went through made it seem as though she was someone real, someone you could meet in everyday life. It is also a good piece because sex addiction is something that many people have. I think that if people read this book they can see what people with that condition go through. The book allows you to see things from their point of view for a change. I think if you enjoy authors with a excellent vocaubulary, that knows how to use imagary, and make you feel as though you are right there while everything is happening then this is the book for you to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read!","review":"This is up there with \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\" by Sistah Souljah as one of my favorite books of all time. I couldn't put this book down. I can't count how many times my mouth dropped open when I was reading it. If you don't like this book then you must not be from this world, or your're a clone or something. Words just can't explain how awesome it was to read. Zane is definitely on her way to stardom and I mean fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's got it bad","review":"I think that this book was extraordinary! Although you didn't get the hot sex stories that were int the Sex Chronicles, you however looked into the mind of a nemphomaniac. The hard part is that you can see how easily you can be reeled into that lifestyle. I believe that this book also opened many women eyes who may still be at home with the hubby; hot and bothered, because he isn't laying it down. This time a woman can finally get her cake and eat it too, but at a very high cost.This book made me want to stop having multiple friends and just settle down with the one man that I know is right for me. I will have to take the time to teach him what to do, but OOH well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific","review":"This is by far, the most ridiculous attempt at a book I have ever encountered. It staggers the mind to consider that the author made any effort to write it, and on top of that, that it was actually published.The book is composed like a 5th grade book report; shallow to the point that you wonder if the author spent as much time writing it as you did reading it, immature in both content and style, and generally pointless. The concept of sexual addiction is far more profound than either Zane's unlikeable character, Zoe, or her exploration of it which never manages to rise above the sea of vulgarity and graphic descriptions of the act itself.This is the sort of book for people who believe that anyone who can read can write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot, Hot, Hot","review":"Caution---Read at your own risk. Addicted, is filled with twists, turns, lies, love and secrets which make up a lot of drama. Hold on for a rollercoster ride. Unconditional love is what Zoe and Jason shared. Each time I thought the drama was over something else happened. The suspense had me on edge until the very end.My favorite quote from the novel, \\"This is forever.\\" \\"Always has been! Always will be!\\" Deep.Keep up the good work Zane. Be Blessed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"I read this entire book in less than a day. I hear that it is not an accurate portrail of an addiction, however I still felt that it was a very good book. It has a twisted ending, and is the first of a series (I am anticipating the next or 3rd part). I think it's worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT CAN'T GET ANY BETTER","review":"Addicted is the best book I have EVER read. From the beginning to the end, it will keep your guessing, laughing, and wanting to read more. I read book, after book, and after reading ADDICTED, just any old book won't do. I get bored. Addicted is not at all predictable. Zane combines sex, love, murder, mystery, family history, etc. into one plot. She is so gifted. As I said, I don't think it gets better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amarteurish","review":"I've heard that Zane has written better books, so I guess I picked the wrong one to read first. This book was so amarteurish. It was as if Zane started dreaming up all kinds of criminal drama during the second half of the book to make up for the boring first half. Many of the criminal characters are not believable because Zane skims over them, and asks us to accept their actions without much character development. The book starts as a love story and suddenly turns into a crime novel. She also could have done better research on the use of hypnosis. Her description as really silly (a swinging watch)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This book dragged. I did not care to read about how they met. That could have been summed up a couple of pages.The story was about a women that was addicted to sex. She was always more than willing to expeience something new and she wanted to do it with her \\"two-minute\\" husband.The downfall came with the \\"reasoning\\" for this addiction. I don't understand why she couldn't be red blooded women that loved sex. Why did Zane have to bring the story down with undeveloped story of a younger Zoe (main character) seeing a sex act. Give me a break!I have had it with Zane. I have read three of her books and that was three too many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted to this Book","review":"This book is amazing! I just could not sit it down! I absolutely loved it and it kept me going continuously. If you like reading about peoples internal struggles with their sexual feelings this is what you want! It's unpredictable, smooth flowing, a love story, a tragedy, and erotica all at once. Just buy it and love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"I read this book in four consecutive days, and I didn't think twice about reading it again. It is a great book, full of suspense. With great details and graphic explanations, the main character, Zoe, makes you feel as if you've known her all your life. By the end of the book, I was so amazed by what I had read. This book is worth buying. Every page adds a new twist to the story line. A definite must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very sad addiction","review":"I was hoping for a more titillating book of fun and sexual escapes, but somehow I read into more of a real-life human story of someone's real pain of her sad sexual addiction. I wouldn't recommend this book or even pass it on to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not addicted","review":"I feel that Zane is too over rated, people who read her books just blow her up to the point where your actually expecting some good reading, but then you are let down, well at least I was.So, Zoe was addicted to sex, I'm sorry, but I do not buy the bull crap, can we at least refer to someone who's addicted to sex prominsciuos or a flat out dog.................the book was very dull and the begginning was very slow, it took me a couple of days just to read the first chapter. I didnt even get a chance to finish reading the book because it was so terrible, I got about a hundred pages from the end where at Zoe was at it with her multiple lovers, then I just put it down, because the whole \\"I'm addicted to sex\\" attitude is so tired, would I refer this book to anyone, NO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"ADDICTED\\" HAD ME ADDICTED...","review":"I got the book around noon and eight hours later I was done.

I read this book over a two day period! A little slow in the middle but it picks up and turns out to be one that I would recommend for the best seller list!Enjoy if you purchase it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overwhelmingly Addictive","review":"Addicted is not only the title of this book, but also what you will be if you ever pick it up. Mainly because you feel as though you're fly on the wall in the life of Zoe (the main character). You are constantly wondering what this \\"busy\\" woman could possibly do next. Never having read anything by Zane, I was truly impressed. Zane uses her remarkable writing skills to provide us with a book that is \\"off the chain\\". Addicted is very unpredictable and keeps your attention from beginning to end. Caution: this book has some very steamy parts so be prepared!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that deserves a sequel","review":"When I read this book I could not put it down. The way Zoe met Jason was so adorable and how they started dating. It was like a ghetto version of cinderella. Even though she had a problem her husband sticked by her side. I recommend this book for everyone. I think that Zane should write this as a sequel cuz I really want to know what's going on with zoey and Jason"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed...","review":"I went to the local bookstore and purchased this book recently. I had just got done reading a great book by Terry McMillan and wanted another one to read. I was so disappointed with this book. I thought the writing was bad and the book never really had any high points, just lows. I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Just Plain Awful","review":"This book was awful just plain awful. This is probably why Oprah quit picking books for her book club. It was poorly written and executed. It was just ridiculous at the end. Every other page there was one ridiculous scenario after another. I am starting to think that Zane is a man. The erotica if you can call it that was callous and not even sexy. AWFUL - Avoid at all costs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Explosive Debut by the Electric Zane","review":"I must say that I agree with the other customers about this book. It was a great read, and defintely a page turner. I brought the book a year ago, and I can't get out of my head. The author Zane, lets you into the main character's world, and describes that world with beautiful detail and amazing descriptions of sitautions. I never thought authors would be allowed to push the envelope of the sexual revolution, much less the topic of sexual addiction. It made me realize that our society has gone full throttal with sexual images, and ideas, but can not deal with how these things can affect one personal relationships. A dynamite debut by an exciting new author."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not About Sex","review":"I really did enjoy this book. As with others, I had heard so much about the book that I was just dying to get my hands on it. It was presented to me by others as a very sexual story woth no plot. While the story was sexual, it did have a plot and a very deep and intense stroy line. It's not about sex, but about life, love, tradegy and triumph over our situations and life. Read the book, don't take anyone else's word for it. I read it in one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hot Mess!!! Why is this book a bestseller????","review":"I thought this was 1 of the worst books I have ever read........ I am still trying to figure out why this book is so popular, the writing is so amatuerish & annoying. Who is this book supposed to appeal to? I truly believe the graphic sex in this book is the only reason people are drawn to it and are recommending it to others.What a waste of money. I am considering writing a book now, Hell, if people are digging this mess, I know I can write a book.I gave this book away, I didn't even want it in my bookcase. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ADDICTED to Zane","review":"The only reason why I finished this book was because I have a creed to finish all books that I start. This book had to be in the top three worst books that I've read in all my life. I skimmed through some pages just to finish. The characters were severely underdeveloped and the story line was despairingly shallow. The concept would have worked with a different flavor but Zane failed miserably. If erotica is going to be the dominant thread throughout a piece, then it should be presented with taste and proper form. Two thumbs down on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter disappointment","review":"Read the review by \\"kay-mickey\\" My sentiments EXACTLY. I, too, will now question all recommendations offered by the friend who insisted that I read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"PREdicted","review":"I really give this book 0 stars because it was the most predictable, ordinary story that I have read in awhile. The jargon was anachronistically incorrect and some of the events were just not realistic. I'm upset that I can't get back the time that I spent to read this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WAS GOOD","review":"USUALLY SHE RUSHES TO THE POINT OF. I LIKE THAT FIRST SHE BUILDS UP A STORY TO SUPPORT THE WOMAN'S HABIT. ALTHOUGH I DID'T ALWAYS FIND THE POINT CLEAR, THIS IS AN EXCELLENT READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"When I first heard about this book I expected it to be like the other Zane books I'd read-full of off the wall tales of sexual escapades on every other page(not that theres anything wrong with that!) but this book was SO much more than that. It tell the story of Zoe. She marries her childhood sweetheart, has three kids,a great job and a beautiful home. Everyone but Zoe thinks her life is perfect but thats not so. Her husband is sexually repressed and shes sexually obsessed. Then she mets Quinton,a sexy local artist, who turns her whole world upside down in more ways than one! This book is full of twists and turns and just when I thought I couldn't be shocked anymore I was wrong! Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intoxicating","review":"This book was so intoxicating. i could barely put it down as if i was addicted to the book I read it in one day! I love the way that Zoe and Jason had a loving relationship. But when she cheated on him i was shocked at first but i understood the need that she needed to fulfill. The way her and Quinton had an affair turned me on although it was wrong, especially the oral sex parts (nacho cheese)........ By the end of the book when they finally got their live half way back i fell in love with the way Jason and Zoe treated each other. Zane has to be one of my fav. authors and i enjoy reading her books. I feel that after reading this book it should be made into a movie, because as i was reading it i tried to picture all the scenes that happened and i it were a movie we would get to see in more detail how things happened!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Raunchy!","review":"I did not like this book. My book club read this book; well only a few of us actually finished it. I only finished it because I thought it must get better because people raved about this book. It was X rated and raunchy. I am young and like to have a good time, but give me a break. This book was ridiculous! Our book club of 20 and 30 somethings did not like this book! It was way too hardcore and disgusting! All thumbs down here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"After hearing a great deal of fanfare about Zane, I picked up Addicted while waiting in the airport during a 2 hour layover. I will say that the book was a page turner, but not because it was unpredictable. There was simply a lot of drama, and well, who doesn't enjoy drama in a novel? Aside from that, the characters lacked development, and there was zero imagination in the dialogue and plot development. As other reviewers have noted, the sex scenes left much to be desired; they were lackluster and again, lacked in imagination. I was also disturbed by the lack of mention of condom usage and that Zoe seemed to have no reprecussions for the many unprotected sex seesions she had. Overall, this book was a waste of money and time. There are so many more good texts by Black writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have NOTHING better to do...","review":"then you may enjoy this book. I, however, thought it was pretty poorly written. I actually finished the whole book, which is really quite amazing given the vocabulary alone. I cannot believe the great reviews this book has gotten here, which is why I decided to try this book in the first place. I was pretty excited to read it, and then very quickly disappointed. The best parts of the book, in my opinion, were the very mediocre sex scenes. I'm in no way looking for soft core porn here, but at least those parts were interesting.If you're looking for a good book try something else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are way too many typo's","review":"I couldn't get through the first chapter due to the interruptions of words that are connected. I stopped reading the book.I wish I could get a REFUND....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful writing.","review":"I'm no writer but I thought this was terribly written. Too much unnecessary description in some parts, silly slang usage, poor story. I was so happy to be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Addicted","review":"It took too long to develop the story and once the main character began her sexcapades it was disappointing (definitely not addicted). No orgies, threesomes, and very little homoerotica."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEX, DRAMA, LIES","review":"I just want to say that this novel was a page turner. I tried to read Zane's Sex Chronicle but couldn't relate to all the sexcapades. After several years, an adventours husband and more sexual expriences, I decided to pick up ADDICTED. It's loaded with ecstasy, sex scandals, drama and lies. Enjoy it because I sure did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just trash.","review":"I had just finished the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy and a friend recommended \\"Zane\\" to me. I ordered two books and struggled to get throught the first one. Never even started the second. NOTHING like 50 Shades. Reads like the trash you buy in Truck Stops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"A good book to read when bored, very erotic and detailed. I enjoyed it & I have read it twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Once the book got flowing, it was very intriguing! I didn't expect the ending so I was pleasantly please.d. I will read more from Zane."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK But have read better","review":"I give this book only 2 stars because it was an easy read. If the plot was around the addiction to sex, why were the sex descriptions so vague and boring. I wanted more depth from the charcters, but had to realize that this is a fiction based novel to say the least. The characters were really weak. A better read would be \\"Anything Goes\\" by Jessica Tilles. Zane should have taken some notes on how to give more juice to the sex scenes from Jessica. And for all of the \\"Stop Hating\\" crew, it's not hating it's called constructive critisism."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will truly be Addicted to this!!!!!","review":"Zane has done it again! This book has everything from drama to romance to erotica. Zane is nothing short of amazing with this book. From the moment I started reading the book, I could not put it down. It is truly a page turner. The end will totally surprise you. If you are looking for something with drama and suspense, you will absolutely love this book!!!!!! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Amazed","review":"I'd heard so many people sing the praises of this author that I felt I had to read one of her books and boy did my jaw hit the floor.I am an avid reader of \\"fluff\\" novels. I love them. When people ask me what types of books I love, my response is \\"trashy romances\\". But this book...It was complete garbage.I am not sure what I expected, something sexy, maybe. At the very least something intelligent. I mean, cheap thrills are all well and good but even that was sadly lacking. If you want to read something sexy I recommend \\"The Lady's Tutor\\" by Robin Schone. No she is not a black author and the story isn't even set in this time period but it is definitely a sexy book with \\"cheap thrills\\". I am not saying that Zane needs to write in this style, but this is an example of an effective \\"fluff\\" novel.Even fluff needs to be researched and be somewhat realistic. Addicted very obviously was neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"What does love have to do with it?","review":"Addictive delivers the true meaning of undying love, family, friendship, heartache and most of all lessons in being true to thy self. Once opening the book, I could not stop reading. Each page leaves you wanting more. The main character, Zoe, expresses fantasies and fears that many women can relate to in one form or another. The ending leaves one question unanswered, \\"What's love got to do with it?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"TO HOTT TO HOLD\\"","review":"This book was well worth the money spent!! I haven't read a good book like this in a while one that unfolds little by little to the end. Some of the events caught me by surprise by the end of the book. But..that really goes to show that true love really can stand the test with time. I was very hurt by the death of her best friend but if you don't end a bad relationship there's no good ending. Keeping their kids of the terrible mess was by far a good choice so when things did get better they didn't have to feel like they needed to choose sides with either parent. I am passing my book around at work and everybody's reading it so keep up the good work for the next book!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"I rated this book a 5 it had all the right contents.

I have read her other novels as well and have enjoyed them as well, but for this one, I LOVED it. Keep up the good work Zane!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave Good Enough Alone!","review":"I read Addicted in one day, and if I'm on track to reading something in one day that means it was good. And it was up until the end. The story was near perfect until the last couple of chapters. I was so upset. It had enough drama, and twists, and murders without adding more. It just took away from the book big time. I couldn't believe that after having revealed that Zoe almost got raped twice as a child on two seperate occassions that the author would turn around and Actuallyl let her get raped as an adult, and in front of her husband no less. I also found it hard to believe that she was attacked by all those people. There is a such thing as TOO MUCH drama. Some things could have just been left out is all I'm saying. To bad she had to mess with a good thing. Zane, sometimes, you should just leave well enough alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"This book Touch on todays way that must of us live with thelies and decite to our spouse that is extra special to us. This book defentily touches on the old cliche \\" What goes around comes around twice harder\\", this book makes you think twice about commiting aldultry and what could happen if the spouse didn't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book This Year","review":"I simply LOVED this book! It held me captured from the very first page to the last. I could relate to Zoe on a deep level and I guess that is why I was so touched by Zane's writing. Zoe is a very complex character who is humurous, thought-provoking, and enlightening. I think that a lot of women are probably suffering from similar emotional problems but refuse to admit it and/or seek help.I am headed to the closest bookstore to pick up Zane's other books because she has truly earned a lifelong fan in me. I agree with all the readers that gave this book 5 stars because it is definitely the read of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bow Down to Zane!!!","review":"Want to read a good book read Addicted! This is the best book I have ever read! I kept me going from beginning to end. Zoe may have fullfilled some of her sexual desires with 3 people other than her husband but one of them turns out to be a psyco! I think Zoe and Jason need a vacation after all ... they've gone through especially when 2 tragedies strike, but love always prevails and they are going to start their new journey through life. Overall this book deserves 10 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot, Heavy and Heated!!!","review":"This book was awsome!! I never knew people can have an addiction to sex of this magnitude.But more that anything the love that conquered ALL was the best thing about this book to me.This was my first time reading a book by this author...however if her other books are this good I will definitely be reading more of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do some research!","review":"I am kind of shocked that publishers put a book out that the writer has obviously not researched. This is a completely inaccurate portrayal of a sex addict. I agree with another reviewer; it's about a woman whose husband isn't meeting her needs, so she seeks satisfaction elsewhere.Sex addiction is a whole other ballgame.Also, where does Zane get her ideas about therapy?? Therapists don't: give you limitless hours in a session (it's 50 minutes), offer you beverages, act shocked when you tell them your issues, let you wear their gym clothes, give you 24 hours access to their ear, basically act like your girlfriend.Little grammar lesson for both Zane and her slack publisher: it's \\"between you and me\\" not \\"between you and I\\". It actually hurts my poor English teacher ears!Yet I read all these rave reader reviews, which kind of freaks me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"An improvement","review":"I never understood the hype around Zane and her books, she is entertaining at best. Although this book was not nearly as bad as the others, I could see her plot unfolding a mile away. Her charecters have no depth, the story line is shallow and imcomplete, she could have went so many other places with the ending. My friends and family have also read her book, with mixed responses. A good read for people who don't read much more then trashy novels. She is getting better but not what I would consider to be worthy of all the praise she receives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book is not worth the hype. I don't know why the author called the book addicted.It doesn't seem like she's addicted to sex she just wants satisfaction.The first part of the book talks about how Zoe met her corny husband, and is extra boring. There is nothing appealing about Zoe to make the reader believe that someone could become obsessed with her.I wanted Zoe and her punk husband to get killed in the end but the author choose a happier ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst I have read","review":"A true disappointment: unrealistic, one- dimensional dialogue, rediculous slang, simplistic and predictable. The main character was so annoying it made me feel ashamed to be a woman.I wouldn't even check it out from the library for free. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Come Everyone Loves This Book So Much?????","review":"This is the first novel I've read by Zane. I chose it because I've heard nothing but positive feedback from so many other readers. I must say that I was very disappointed. It starts out pretty good and even midway through, it maintains my level of interest. However towards the latter part of the book, it takes a turn for the worse and becomes incredibly unrealistic. Especially the part about Zoe seeing a psychiatrist on a regular basis, and the psychiatrist divulging information of her sessions with Zoe to Zoe's husband. Whatever happened to Doctor-Patient Confidentiality. Towards the end of the book, it strives to become a murder mystery novel. GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!! As I mentioned this book was a definite dissapointing read for me. Before the ending you'll lose total interest in the characters and the storyline. When I first picked this up, I was anxious in reading other works by Zane. Now I probably won't even waste my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. There was a lot of time covered in such a small book. I think Zane could have expounded on some things and made the book longer. I don't think this book was trash, but it was explicit. It painted a very vivid picture (wouldn't recommend it for teenagers). I read \\"Shame On It All\\" which was good and I look forward to reading \\"The Sex Chronicles\\" series and \\"Heatseekers.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting!","review":"Exciting book to read. The type of book you can't put down until you read the entire book! Zane keeps you guesting to the end, and what a surprise!!We Be Book'n, Book Club read the book and rated it a five plus! We decide the book should be made into a movie, and we also discussed what actors and actress should play the leading roles.Thank you, Zane"},{"rating":"2","title":"INTERESTING! ...","review":"ADDICTED is a very interesting book, meaning to the point that once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. I finished it in a day and 1/2. Some of it was a little too raunchy for me, but I guess the writer is just keeping it real! I would read other books by ZANE."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIDICULOUS!!!!","review":"This is the first and LAST book I will ever read by this author. I read it because I've heard so many people talk about this and other books by Zane (never really knowing what they were about). The book was not interesting at all because you already knew that if this woman met someone she was going to sleep with them. It was entirely too predictable, which is not an attention-getter to me. I consider this book to be \\"porn on paper\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprisingly disappointing","review":"I was very excited to read this book, which may have been the source of my let down. As I read further into the book, I became increasingly less interested. The story line was filled with outrageous twists, that in my opinion, did not enhance the novel. All in all, this book was just too much attempted shock value to take in."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIMME A BREAK!!!","review":"I give this book 2 stars, because I was in it for the ride halfway through until physical violence started to dominate the rest of the book. Seriously, how many times can one woman get beat by the four different male characters in this book? I honestly wished I hadn't finished the book, because I can't buy into the fact that Jason and Zoe's relationship was still going to be intact without one of them being put on antidepressants! Very unrealistic book! Gimme a break!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGUSTED!! Those with intelligence stay away!","review":"This was absolute garbage. I read page after page of the same thing. I thought it would never end. The final thirty pages are in a word... bizarre. The author has a complete lack of intelligent imagination. I would venture to say this is the worst thing I have ever read. The plot,the story...EVERYTHING was done poorly. Unless you enjoy nonsensical trash, do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads Like A Soap Opera","review":"After reading the reviews of this book, I am so disappointed in the work itself. Of course, my cue was that the titles of the reviews were \\"Da Bomb, Da Bomb Diggity, Off Da Hook\\" etc., and that was an indication of the age and intellectual capacity of the audience.Zoe Reynard, the main character was so unbelievable and so unlikable that I found myself reading to find out what ridiculous thing the author would have her do next. ...I read this book because it is for my bookclub. We voted to have a sexy book, but the sex in this book reminds me of highschool. I can't wait to tell the hostess what I think of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy, Not Classy or Erotic","review":"I agree with the other readers that this book had just too much going on. Every plot cliche you can think of was in this book. There was no real motivation behind the characters actions, and I can't believe the husband didn't want to have oral sex. There were a lot of sub-plots that did seem like after-thoughts, the affair with Diamond, the friend getting murdered, it was all just too much, and the writing never rose above a junior high level."},{"rating":"2","title":"another excellent book from zane","review":"addicted is about a woman named Zoe who was very very much in love with her husband Jason, he is the perfect that you can get but the one thing that he can satisfy zoe and thats SEX, so she goes and commit adultry. while shes on her cheating run she runs to a whole lot of trouble that involves murder and all sorts of drama to follow, Zoe is a character that you cant dislike becuase you actually feel sorry for her and want to reach out in the book and help her yourself. this is truly a book that everyone need to read, i read shame on it all first and kept stalling on getting this book but actually should have been read this novel.this one it truly a page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT????????????????????????????????","review":"What man out there, would refuse to allow his wife to perform oral sex on him? I don't know of any! I bought this book because of all of the great reviews but was disappointed with Zane's writing style and the overall story.At the end of the book, everything was so conviently rushed into one neat package. Very unrealistic! I finished the book feeling like there was something missing. As far as sexual addiction, what type of research did the author do in preparation for the book? What made Zoe a sex addict? She was more of an adultress than an addict...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this girl some handclaps of praise!","review":"Man! I loved this book. It had the right mix of mystery and erotica.I am not one to tell the story but you will not be disappointed with this book. This is the first Zane book I have read. She has talent and has put a very well rounded story together.I have just now read HeatSeekers. It's ok but once you have read this one(Addicted). Heatseekers will not light your Fire.Come On Zane, write another one like this, I have faith in you Girl!! I look foward to reading Sex Chronicles I & II"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the talent?","review":"I can only describe the writing as a cross between a 6-year old being naughty and a male trucker hooked on pornography.Sex scenes are great in a book -- that is, when they are well described. Zane must have some sort of mental problem that she disguises as a talent for writing. Yes, book profits are important but so is integrity.Skip this junk and go with Playboy's Hugh Hefner or ANY male sex/violence fiction writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star is being generous!","review":"This book is not recommended. Read the reviews before you buy the book. A 1 star is being generous. Where was the addiction? Erotica? Zoe was an adulteress and the so called erotic descriptions was something out of a porn magazine. Leaves nothing to the imagination. Raw!! Her husband not wanting oral sex --- get real. What man would turn that down? ... Don't waste your money. I'm ashamed to give the book away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted by Zane","review":"I really enjoyed this bbok. Zane kept the storyline going and get kept wanting to read more. The story just flowed together. It was as if you were right there with the characters in the book. It seemed so real. You just felt like you knew the characters personally. It is wonderful to be able to find a book that makes you want to know more. At some moments in the book it gets a bit much but I realize that it had to be written that way to get the point across. Great book and I cannot wait for her next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF A KIND NOVEL!!","review":"I have absolutely NEVER read a book like this one...; the storyline was fabulous and encompassed absolutely everything...love, sex, deceit, adultery, drama..this book has it all! I so loved the story behind the relationship between Zoe and Jason; the fact that they were childhood sweethearts, and that we grew up with them in the book. I was completely shocked at her affairs and the fact that there were several..but I so loved all of the drama that inevitably accompanied them! Let's all applaud Zane for not being afraid to show the world, especially the African-American world that:1). Often times it is women who are involved in the adulterousbehavior2). All of us could perhaps stand a little mental healthintervention every now and again.Hats off to you Zane, for going where no one has gone before...at least not to the extent that you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable Characters","review":"I've heard that Zane has written better books, so I guess I picked the wrong one to read first. This book was amateurish. It was as if Zane thought to herself, \\"what drama can I throw in next?\\" She needed to decide what kind of book she was going to write. It started as a sex story and turned into a crime story at the last minute. The first half of the book is boring, so I guess she threw in some action to try to save the story. The problem is she didn't develop the criminal characters enough to make their actions believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I read 'Addicted' awaiting to be impressed and stimulated but failed to be given thoses emotions. It was a big let-down for me. The content was all there, however, the manner in which it was expressed was unintelligible. I was expecting something that proved the highlighted credits on the cover and the back of the book to be true. It wasn't a page-turner for me (maybe because of her style of writing) and I was hoping for something more even when I finished the book. I felt the story abandoned adequate information to make this novel as spectacular as the cover emphasized.I will always uplift Black literture but I wouldn't recommend this book for a friend to read because I would feel too ashamed after they finished reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU DONT HAVE IT.........GET IT !","review":"I just finished Addicted and if I would have had the time, I would have finished it in one day. I really enjoyed it. It kept my interest and I looked foward to each chapter. I was thankful it wasn't about a perfect couple living in a perfect world. Last night, when I came home, I was reading the book at red lights in my car and that was in the middle of the night! I was surprised when the murderer wasn't who I thought it was. I can't believe Zane wrote the book in such a short period of time. Zane is really talented. I also think the cover is very nice. I can't see anyone not enjoying the content of the book. I hope Zane gets the sales she deserves and hurries up and writes some more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Because of all of the hype surrounding this book, I broke down and brought it. First of all, I can't understand how this book got so many 4 and 5 star reviews when it is chock full of grammatical errors. Also I felt as if points should be taken off for the constant use of uppercase lettering. Call me petty but I couldn't stand all of the shouting. And last but not least it seemed to me that the author was much more interested in shock value (she didn't do this very well either) than with providing an interesting beleivable story. If you'd like to read some real erotica, I suggest Jaid Black or Lora Leigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Addicted to bad writing","review":"... Im an avid reader and there is no way I could ever say that this was even a good book. It was bad. ...The dialogue in the book is juvenile, even after the characters become adults. The time lines in the book are totally off. Teens in the 80's werent saying \\"my bad.\\" The story is unbelievable, even though I know its fiction. Zane, give us a break. Zanes use of vulgar terms does not make a scene erotic. She should learn that lesson from good writers like Eric Jerome Dickey and others. And if I read \\"boo\\" or \\"nucca\\" one more time, I thought I would puke. Zane could have had a good story, but she has to do a lot more homework and make use of an insightful editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 4 the Car","review":"I bought this with the primary intention of in car use. I was worried when I read the car kit instructions and it was noted that a \\"rotating sound\\" was \\"normal\\" with use of the car adapter. I have listened to other people's car adapted CD players and never heard such a thing; but as soon as I set mine up in the car I heard the rotating NOISE! Worse yet, the music volume was about a 1 or 2 on a ten scale. Had cleaned the cassette heads on the car and followed the instructions and still it sounded SO BAD that I was so frustrated I really wanted to through it out the window while doing 55. The only reason I can give it 2 stars is that I then tried it with batteries and the headphones and it worked. It didn't sound spectacular but it sounded good enough that I would use it if I wanted to walk around and listen to CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"When I first bought this product it was great. But after 6months i dropped it from about 1 foot up on a hardwood floor and it shattered. So besides the fact that it is unreliable and cheaply made it it a mediocre player.

The first one wasn't so good, as I could not get the monitor to work with an ADC to DVI adapter on my Power Mac. But, I feel that this is a limitation of the video card, not the monitor. The screen works beautifully via VGA, and when I upgrade the video card to DVI, I'm sure it will work even better. (...) Keep in mind, if you are going to use it on a Mac with an ADC port, it may not work with the ADC to DVI adapter. I would upgrade the rating to 4 stars, but don't see how to change that aspect of the review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good monitor, but bad rebate policy","review":"The Princeton SENergy 714 is a very good LCD monitor with sharp image quality and good viewing angles. I'm not sure about the \\"16ms\\" response time because different manufacturers measure response times diffrently, making this spec pretty much meaningless. If you are a gamer, you won't be happy with the streaking you'll see when playing fast-action games. If you are a digital photo enthusiast, you should get a Sharp LCD monitor which still has the best image quality, or just opt for a good ViewSonic or Sony CRT, which no LCD can match in terms of color accuracy. But for most people, this is a good 17\\" LCD monitor for both text and multimedia uses.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This monitor... is just great. I honestly was not prepared for the incredible quality of this display... color is just insanely saturated (reds in particular are incredibly vivid), and the backlight is super bright, so much so that I am tempted to turn it down. As another reviewer said, there is a very slight bluish cast that I corrected with a custom color profile. No dead/stuck pixels. No ghosting. Came with all the cables. DVI at this price is unheard of, I'm so glad I found this monitor and didn't have to compromise with a (strictly) VGA one, and am able to take advantage of my PowerBook's DVI connection. Speaking of the PowerBook, this display put the PowerBook's to absolute SHAME, I was intending to use the 'Book as a secondary display, but I can't even look at it in the same glance after looking at this monitor. Anyway, again, this thing is phenomenal.

The movie is more colorful, the humour funnier and the lion-dance competition adds a nice touch of originality to the series. Mok Siu-Chong (aka Leung Foon) is great in the comedic role and Hung Yan-yan (aka Clubfoot) makes some stunts that are to be seen to be believed. Also, I noticed that the characters of Wong Fei-hung (Jet Li) and Aunt Yee (Rosamund Kwan) and their relationship had evolved since the first movie.The DVD transfer is good (but don't compare it to others such as Fight Club or Terminator 2... you might be disappointed!) and the sound is not too bad. In fact, it's comparable to the previous two of the series.While the DVD was quite expensive, I still thought that it was worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lions get in the way","review":"I have never found a Jet Li movie I haven't truly enjoyed until this one. Like a lot of his movies, there are a lot of martial art sequences and some are terrific. But later on the lion dance competion is hectic. There are lion costumers everywhere and it's hard to tell what is going on. However, it is probably something you won't see in another movie so if you want to see a different kind of martial arts competition, try this but it may not be for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the Lions!","review":"I completely understand and genuinely enjoy the Chinese tradition of the lion dance. It is a visually stunning and moving thing to see when done by a capable dancer. But this movie, while building to the climactic end scene, has about 500 lions dancing at the end. All of the lions are trying to defeat all the other lions, and all the while the viewer is left to be confused. Clubfoot was a great addition, but enough with the lions! ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely good, almost measured up to the previous two","review":"This was a excellent movie staring the ever amazing Jet Li, although the final scene could have had more of a one on one fightng theme the overall quality of the movie, as in sounds and picture quality have been drastically improved from the previous two. The induction of Club Foot and an ancient Triad group are also cool. Jet Li is as great as ever.

The nuanced performances, beautiful yet realistic sets, intriguing and thoughtful cinematography, and a powerful control over the pacing and the rhythm of the film were simply unforgettable. I felt like watching the film again right after it finished. At many times it reminded me of Kurosawa's \\"Ran\\" (another Shakespeare adaptation), especially by the chamber drama aspects present in \\"The Banquet\\". It will not be everyone's cup of tea, to be sure, especially those who expect to see a martial arts film, which this is not; or those who expect a literal adaptation (or those possesed by semantics...)...but if you can enjoy a slower-paced film that takes its time building intricately nuanced characters and deep psychological studies, then this is the film for you. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I watched this movie 6 times within 1 month just because I like it so much. Zhang Ziyi's performance was so great. Music was good.

Boy, what a HUGE disappointment! I am a big fan of art films, but this movie was more torture than entertainment. The pace of the movie was painfully s-l-o-w. The main character spent more time pacing and smoking cigarretes than actually having a conversation with anyone, which I guess is what qualifies this as an \\"art\\" film. But watching paint dry would have been more meaningful and certainly more fun. I did give it one star, however, because the couple of intimate scenes in the movie are pretty steamy.

I have just returned from a month long trip to Europe with my family and while on the trip read Europe 101. The book completely enhanced the trip for me by providing the cultural and historical background for the art I was seeing. Yes - it covers several millennia of art and history in 500 pages, yes it is a survey but it is the best overview and survey I have read.RS is very open in the book that this is an opinion piece and that it is NOT a scholarly work. However, it does a great job bringing to life and placing into a meaningful context what you are seeing.

While there isn't anything really new that hasn't been covered before, the book is a good compliment to others previously published on the Earhart story.

It also provides some coverage on design patterns, framework (struts), security, transaction and state management using HttpSession or stateful EJB session bean. If you are involved in a J2EE project, this book will serve as a good reference for high-level design concept which puts together all J2EE related knowledge that you might have learned from elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"made me nervous and i got sick af. kwfow efwefwe fwefwef wef weffew wefwef wefwef wefwef wefwef wefew wef wef"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin & Weak","review":"This paperback edition barely qualifies as a book.

Using terms and illustrations from baseball, Petrash shows that to be a good father takes similar qualities required to be a good player: be present, establish routines early in a child's life, keep bad situations from escalating out of control, and avoid dwelling on parental failures by focusing on successes. Covering Home is one of the most reader friendly, accessible, and effective \\"how to\\" books on parenting ever written specifically for Dads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack Lalanne'd diet book","review":"The book was Okay but so simple I already knew the stuff in it.But We love his juicer and use it all the time.And we read his stuff on line."},{"rating":"2","title":"$10.99 for 2 mats","review":"The color is as pictured.

Marcia and Max Nass have done a great job of addressing a serious issue in a fun, educational, and entertaining way. The lessons are clearly written, fun to teach, and practical.

The selection is good and features the classic themes though I wasn't too fond of the Ennio Morricone or Giorgio Gasilini music and a few of the music choices I would've made different but overall it's a nice compilation."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],H={key:0},N={key:1};function M(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-6573c845"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/65.md","filePath":"guide/65.md"}'),R={name:"guide/65.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
