Now, about 1 month later, she has shown no signs of thumb sucking again. Thank goodness. My only recommendation is to use it in small quantities on the offending digit, as we originally put excess amounts on all of her fingers and then she complained about eating, etc., as mentioned by another poster above. Once we dialed back the dosage to just the target thumb and only applied a small amount near the tip, all seemed to work well for us.

The examples are good but notalways complete. At least it is written with some humor andpersonality...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst programming book I know of.","review":"The only use for this book is if you -already- know perl well, and you want to read entertaining insights in a somewhat random order about miscellaneous topics. Do -not- get this book if you are new to perl, or if you have specific problems to solve, or things you want to do. For example, two common questions might be, \\"How do I write a class?\\" or \\"How do I write a constructor?\\" You won't find the answer clearly spelled out anywhere. You must persevere through pages of humorous text with side excursions and nebulous warnings before coming to the final explanation. Ditto for many other language features or common questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the last version","review":"I bought this book and have been very satisfied with it. It has a reference section for perl functions which is very useful and missing in the previous version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chapter 3 alone would be worth the cost!","review":"The must have Perl resource. It was written by the the creator of Perl for goodness sake! Offers thorough reference to Perl's rich set of text manipulation features. Not a tutorial but more of a intermediate/expert reference manual. Get Learning Perl(Camel Book) and this book. You will be a perl hacker in no time flat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book for Learning and Working with Perl !!!","review":"This is by far, the Best Book for Learning and Working with Perl. I never work without it next to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the experienced programmer","review":"As with all O'Reilly books, Programming Perl is an excellent publication. The Camel, as it is known, is written for programmers who are experienced. Larry, Tom and Randal do an excellent job with this absolutely necessary piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first edition","review":"I was disappointed with the second edition of Programming Perl. The first edition taught me the language. It was rich with examples and simple explanations. The second edition, however, I find to be lacking in the examples of the first. Sure, it shows all of the functions, syntax, and other necessary things, but this book confirms something for me: the object-oriented features of Perl are ugly and are nothing but an add-on to the language. The structure and syntax are awkward and difficult to understand. Even when I am programming for a Perl 5 interpreter, I still find myself reaching for the first edition over the second edition.This is the first time I've ever been disappointed by a book from O'Reilly and Associates. The second edition is still an excellent reference and I do refer to it, but I'm keeping my first edition handy for its readability, examples, and better explanations. It may be a \\"must have\\" for Perl programmers, but don't discard your first edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Own","review":"If you are trying to Learn Perl get Learning Perl, But if you already know it YOU MUST have this book. I write perl for a Living and this book never leaves my desk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Perl Beginner","review":"This book is a good reference if you really know what you are doing in Perl and want to just look up particulars on a specific function in perl, but it really bites when you are tyring to use it to answer any question like \\"How do I do ____ in Perl?\\" It reminded me of the age old question. If you can't spell a word, how do you look it up in the dictionary? I must say that the included brochure reference guide is a very good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK for experts; Bad for beginners","review":"I have been a Perl programmer for the last two years and I thought now is a good time to buy a reference book in Perl. Obviously my choice was \\"Learning Perl\\" by Larry Wall. Content is good, as a reference it is excellent, as a study book it is weak and it is not at all good for the beginners. At some places you may feel the language need not be this artistic. I wished that the book contained more examples and a little more detail on how to use PERL functions.I have been looking into various Perl books which are good for people good in Perl (some sort of reference + as a study book). One book which is worth mentioning is Perl Black Book. If you wish to buy only one book in PERL -- The \\"Perl Black Book\\" is the best one. It starts from the basics.. have enough examples, goes into details about everything and does not miss out anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good reference book","review":"I find this to be a very frustrating and time-consuming book to use as a reference. The main complaint I have about this book is its astonishing lack of examples. No user wants to try to extract syntax from paragraphs of commentary. If you have the time and want to sit down and learn the \\"theory\\" behind Perl, then maybe this is a good book for you. Otherwise, look for a book with examples rather than expository."},{"rating":"2","title":"Programming Perl for Web Use?","review":"I'm come from a heavy ASP background, and as I've started learning the Linux OS, Perl appeared as something good to learn. Hearing the \\"Camel\\" book was the best, I went and got it. My thoughts: Its a terriffic Perl scripting reference!!! BUT, for those of you who want to learn Perl for dynamic web page authoring, this may not be the book you want. It's written much more from a Unix admin standpoint, using Perl for automation, and report generation. It does little special to help you with common dynamic web page tasks. Eg. No section on connecting to ODBC data sources for database publication, etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reference book for perl/unix experts only!","review":"Indispensible as a reference book, but a poor choice if you are just starting out with perl. The geeky attempts at humor and general tone of \\"look how clever we are\\" frequently get in the way of explaining the concepts at hand, apart from being very tiresome. Chapter 4 on references and nested data structures is particularly obscure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reference Book - Not a Text Book","review":"I picked this book up because it was the text book for a college class on Perl. The chapter on regular expressions is a God-send for those who haven't ever done any pattern matching. From there, the book maintains the quality of an excellent reference manual.Several weeks into the course, a couple of us in the class decided to get another book to help learn the ins and outs of Perl. We bought Waite Group's Perl 5 Interactive Course. Using both books, the class created some amazing scripts, icluding a web server.I particularly enjoyed the humor in this book, especially the references to Star Trek and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. A definite plus!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible programming book I've ever read","review":"This is not a good book for a technical or a new Perl user. There's a few examples for new users and little programming information for experts. On the other hand, you can find a lot of unneccessary information about mathematic, philosopher, \\"love story\\" in this book. For example: to explain the filehandles: \\"Unless you are using artificial intelligence to model a solipsistic philosopher, your program needs some way to communicate with outside world\\"; to explain operators \\"..and as we know in studying math in school, mathematicians love strange symbols. What's worse, computer scientist have come up with their own version of these strange symbol... You could find hundreds of sentences like these in the book but you could not find a good example to tell you how to write a package, object class, etc. It' not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"This book is not for Perl Begginers, i found it hard to follow, it is not intended for self learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great, Perl reference","review":"Hey, it's an O'Reilly and Associates book, so you know it has to be good. Nevertheless, I am not so impressed this 2nd edition compared to the 1st edition of this book. The 1st edition has more code examples (highly instructive) and has a much better layout.If you can get your hands on the 1st edition (covers Perl 4, not Perl 5, but almost all of Perl 4 code works fine with Perl 5) of this book, I recommend reading that one instead. The 1st edition is definitely a \\"10\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE best one","review":"This is apparently the best Perl book I have ever read. It is a complete counter of what the heck we are doing with perl, or at least trying to do with perl. Get one if you don't have one yet. Having this, it is hard to imagin what else they, Larry, will come up with next"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine book, but with some major flaws","review":"It's a fine book. Obviously the one to get if you're serious about Perl.I have two complaints about it:1. It's overproduced, with too many footnotes. This style of writing is all too common in computer books, and one that makes them very hard to read. Nearly all of the footnotes in this book should either be in the main text, because they are relevant, or omitted because they are irrelevant and just clutter up the discourse.2. The index is terrible. Many keywords and other important Perl concepts aren't indexed at all. For one who doesn't have the language memorized, this is very inconvenient.But, even with these irritating flaws, the book is extremely valuable, and I couldn't imagine using Perl without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"THE\\" Perl Book","review":"I recently purchased a copy \\"Programming Perl\\" and found it to be easy to understand and that it didnt leave anything important out that other books I have bought on perl have. The book is exellently organized and was enjoyable to read. And if I, a 13 year old can have a clear understanding of what the author is trying to make clear and teach you from reading the book then anyone can pick it up and enjoy/learn from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Read It","review":"I met Dr Jaikaran on a plane from Houston to Atlanta. Among other things, he claimed that no single doctor has ever helped a person, and the medical professionn was a business. This enraged the passenger in front of us, who eventually refused to speak to us.Dr Jaikaran also claimed that life expectancy dropped dramatically 3,500 years ago, at the same time of Noah's flood, where God told Noah that we could start eating animals(before that, according to OT wisdom, men we vegetarians, and had a life expentancy of 1000 years). He also tried to convince the very nice woman sitting next to me that the medical profession was worthless, although she was about to begin her residency program in Atlanta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monetary revolutionary or nutball?","review":"He makes some interesting points.

The point of the game is to have the bank make offers that correlate to the $$$ left in the remaining briefcases. In the card version of the game, the bank offers are random cards that are drawn. Thus, the game makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It is a cheap rip-off for people that are fans of the gameshow. We had 4 remaining briefcases with a total of 151.01 available, but the offers were $325 and $400k because the bank cards are drawn from a pile, instead of having the true odds calculated.A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deal or No Deal Card Game","review":"My family loves watching the TV show so we decided to get it as a birthday gift for my 5 year old. She and her 6 year old sister love taking turns being the \\"host\\" and the \\"player\\" of the game. My husband and I join in the fun too. Because the playing pieces are actual cards, they do get a little bent when my kids play. Overall, a lot of fun for everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bank's offer is random, does not consider odds!","review":"The whole object of deal or no deal is that the bank's offer is a calculated factor between the lowest and highest numbers on the board. My husband prides himself on determining the bank's offer before they call because HE calculates in his head... something me or the kids don't do.Anyway, this game doesn't use that, you pick out a random card from a deck for the \\"offer\\".Thus the whole point of the game is void.Completely dumb.Also, it takes a long time to have to spread out all of the cards and then insert the dollar cards underneath them.I think an electronic version of the game is needed so it will automatically display the correct odds so the game can be played correctly, and this will also avoid the time it takes to set up each and every game with all the cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Planet of the Apes Legacy Collection","review":"Why even bother????

The sound as mentioned by others is terrible. The DVD's also are not enhanced for Widescreen TV's so when watching one of these on my widescreen everything is stretched. Since 1999 this is the 1st DVD that I have bought that was NOT enhanced for widescreen tv's. The other was Scarface. It's a shame they couldn't have spent a little more time on the audio. I have purchased Ben Hur and Lawrence of Arabia and they did so much more with the sound and video on those DVD's. If you have a nice home theatre system this is not a DVD set to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"About time Fox released the DVD.

I was all set to replace it with the DVD version, but it's not anamorphic, so it doesn't seem worth it. If you're buying for the first time, DVD should be your choice.

(Did I really have the shelf space for a big rubber Ape head?)The Amazon description of the 5-movie,1-documentary set shows the Aspect Ratio as 1.33:1. This concerned me, since one reason to replace VHS is to get WideScreen.Upon checking my set (I haven't watched it yet), I see that the 5 movies show the Aspect Ratio as 2.35:1, where the documentary \\"Behind ...\\" disk is 1.33:1.This distinction and detail is nowhere to be found in the Amazon description."},{"rating":"2","title":"whoot","review":"good quality copy of the clasic movies, if you liked them the first time its worth buying. plus the lawgiver intro is fun if your having a marathon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding!","review":"The first film deserves a full five stars but I'm giving the series four because the sequels should get three (the last four are very entertaining but flawed in many aspects).

The \\"Planet of the Apes\\" depicts an intelligent sentient group of beings that is first suppressed, then turns the tables on its masters, and finally comes to live side by side with humanity. Rod Serling, whose \\"Twilight Zone\\" TV series was always fond of dealing with social causes, saw in this movie a depiction of the racial struggles that were happening in the United States in the 1970's.

Planet of the Apes is awesome. This is about Sony and whomever made these disks. These will not play in a sony bdp-s370 so don't bother. In addition, Sony support is worthless. I spent over an hour online with them trying everthing from inserting an 'empty' usb flash drive to resetting the player. None of it worked of course. Now I'm told I have to call back on the phone and do it all again with someone else. It's the frikking firmwear you rubes.After several calls to Sony support - and several hours repeating the same steps over and over, they finally agreed that the bdp-s370 does indeed have a problem. Here it is over a month later, and still no firmware update. I'm wondering if Blu Ray can actually survive with this kind of crap. If the people that invented it can't even get it to work, then blu ray might as well be dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ape Madness","review":"This is a great set. A great use of bluray on some classic movies. There are some great additions to the set as well with the booklet and the extra features which outline the history of the movies. I never knew the story behind making Planet of the Apes like I do now.One negative is that there is no real case for the disks.

If you get this I recommend you also buy a couple of extra CD cases to hold the disks after you watch them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bonus!","review":"What a great surprise!

The THX transfers of all five films and the superb documentary are INSANELY perfect. No pixilation, no poor colors, just razor sharp images and great sound! The animated menus are fantastic too, especially on the first film, where an image of Cornelius morphes into Zira, Zaius, etc. The sound on the menus is great, esp if you have a sub woofer (you'll see!).

Heston never reprises his role after the first film, which is truly sad, but the series is not lost.Filled with hours of extras and bonus material, this is a must have box set for not only fans of the movie, but for anyone and everyone, as this is one of the great series in all of cinema history. Particularly the first \\"Planet of the Apes\\" which has one of the most classic lines and scenes of all times in it.The Classic Line being: \\"Take your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape!\\"The Classic Scene: Heston rides up to the remains of the Statue of Liberty, realizing the horror that this means, and then proceeds to pound the sandy beach with his hands lamenting, \\"You Maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!\\" Truly only a scene Heston could pull off.Each DVD will leave you racing back to the box set to put the next disc in.

Watching them as a 47 yr. old, I now realize that only the original 'Planet of the Apes' deserves an A+ and remains a sci-fi classic.I grade the 2nd-5th titles in this series as follows:2nd: C-3rd: D (But with a brilliant, haunting ending. Unfortunately it was not filmed particularly well.)4th: D+5th: DThe production budgets of these films decreased over time, from $16 million for the original, to way less than $2 million for the last one (see Wikipedia for more specifics) and boy does it show. The scripts for 2-5 make little sense and often contradict each other. If I had it to do over again, I would purchase only the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"five buck a film!!!","review":"Without a doubt this is fantastic deal.

Evidently there is some copyright protecting software on the disc for the original movie only that prevents me from being able to play it on my computer, where I watch most of my DVD's (the discs for the other movies were fine). It'll play on the DVD player connected to my TV, but to play it on my computer it appears that the only codec that will allow me to play it costs $20 or so.

By the way, I loved the Brazilian's music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours you will never get back.","review":"A talent of mine few people know about is that I can quite easily sit and look at a picture of Pen��lope Cruz for hours. I can, nearly as easily, listen to her squeaky voice, or observe her quirky ballerina-like mannerisms. This film really put this task to the test. I gave in towards the end and fast forwarded to see how it ended. Aside from beautiful Pen��lope Cruz, I found this movie simply unwatchable.Pen��lope Cruz plays a gifted cook from Bahia who suffers from motion sickness. She leaves her cheating husband and moves to San Francisco where she stars in a T.V. cooking show and makes men all over town insatiably hungry. You'll have to figure the rest out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the single worst movie you will ever see","review":"Everyone involved with the making of this film should be put under house arrest and kept away from cameras for the rest of their lives. The dialogue is garbage. The music is sappy, ethno-philiac garbage. The actors--all of them--are garbage. Let's not talk about the lighting. Let's not talk about the makeup. Let's not talk about the absurdly horrendously stupid cooking subplot. Or about how all Latins, apparently, do nothing but cook and dance and sing and make lo---ve all day long. This isn't bad like, Boy you have to watch this movie to see how bad it is. It's bad like, Please don't ever watch this movie, because you won't be able to forigve yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries so hard to be quirky","review":"This film was a real letdown. With a star as charismatic and charming as Penelope Cruz it's hard to make a truly unbearable movie. But director Fina Torres has just done that. The story about a woman who flees to San Francisco to escape from her miserable life in Brazil, this movie was full of possibilities.But it fails on every level. The romance is cliche. The comedy is so very predictable. And the movie tries so very hard to be quirky..but it ends up being annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the full version","review":"I was very disappointed (as was my wife, for whom the movie was a present) to find that this is not the full version. Significant parts have been edited out of even what is shown on cable TV. The package is not marked as such, but this is a real hack job, wrecking a lot of good scenes. Thumbs down on this release, my first major disappointment in dealing with Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Terrible movie.

It has too much farcical humor, poor graphics and terrible scripting to be much fun. I kept waiting for the film to redeem itself, unfortunately, it never quite did. I'm just glad it was a prime rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dopey movie with bad ending","review":"I was disposed to watch this movie, think it was cute, and never watch it again. I was sorely disappointed, though. The movie follows Penelope Cruz, a girl severely stricken with motion sickness. She leaves her cheating (but good looking) husband, and comes to the US, where she ends up hosting her own cooking show.Now, I think fluff films can be fun sometimes, but this one really wasn't good. The movie ends up following her deciding between two men, and eventually trying to get back a sacrifice she made to a goddess of the sea so she would no longer love her husband. In the end, I felt cheated when she went back to her husband who cheated on her, and never really seemed to love her.If you're looking for mindless entertainment, see this. If you want a movie where you can at least agree with the ending, don't see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible movie so I ordered it","review":"I went to see another movie with a friend but this was the only one that wasn't sold out. During the whole movie I was groaning and laughing at how terrible it was. As I was leaving the movie, I was still laughing. The movie stuck in my head. I have a copy on DVD ordered. Rent it first, before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pity for Penelope","review":"I feel sorry for Penelope Cruz for making this silly movie. Its about a woman that finds her husband with someone else, so she heads to the U.S. She lands a gig as a cook on a cooking show, everyone loves her. She finds a new guy that digs her. The desperate husband tries to get her back and after persuing her, he does!Too many inappropriate things for me to like here. Let's see she has a guy that dresses as a woman, and the fact that Penelope's character goes out to the ocean and offers offerings to some goddess. Too pagan for my Bible believing ways.Penelope is a sweet actress. She's believable, however this movie is all too wrong for her to show her talents. Actually it was well done for a film with a small budget, but unfortunately not good enough to keep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless","review":"Other reviewers have outlined the plot, such as it is. A majority of this movie consists of close up shots of Penelope Cruz which can be duplicated by simply staring at her photograph. The plot is time worn. Although Ms. Cruz's character is supposed to be one of a confident woman who is intelligent enough to do quite well on her own, her choices in men indicate no such intelligence and would suggest all that women want in life is to be in the arms of a man. I was still waiting for the movie to develop into something when the credits began to roll. Don't waste your money. If you really want to see it, rent before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Good movie","review":"I thought the movie was great! It made me feel good watching it. The whole vibe was so soothing and the music was superb. Penelope Cruz did a good job for it being her first english spoken movie. Her husband is hot as hell, and you could tell that they were meant to be from the beginning. It really capitalized on the essence of love. Great chic flick, sends a good message to woman. Despite her decisoin with men, she realized that her husband was her true love in the end. I now want to move to Brazil!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons of fun","review":"This romantic and romantic story, with elements of \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" or \\"A Walk in the Clouds\\", is also incredibly funny and sensuous. Isabela flees her native Brasil to escape her domineering and filandering husband, and she comes to San Francisco to stay with her drag queen friend Monica. Isabela ends up working at a chef school, where a TV producer offers her a morning cooking show. He, and every male around, falls in love with her, and then her husband arrives. Much humor ensues in this delightfully madcap, romantic tale. I love how everyone ends up in love at the end, including Monica!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deserve 1 star!","review":"This disaster does not deserve even 1 star. Horrible acting - especially the husband/boyfriend seem to read their lines from a teleprompter. Screenplay is dumb and boring. The scene were half of the cities male population follows in P.

It is a thriller that, for the most part, keeps a strong momentum going, and has a lively cast of characters (although it is an unrealistically good looking group). It's a lot of fun to watch, is not going to strain anyone's braincells, but is much more emotionally involving than most films of this kind. Judy Reyes, who is from the TV show Scrubs, plays a detective. It's a much different role for her, and she gives a standout performance. Also, Lori Huering is very impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not a Poker Film -- LOL","review":"Watch out folks! If you are intrigued by the film's title, I assume, like me, you are avid poker players or at least have a strong interest in the game.Unfortunately, this film tries to cash in on the poker craze and takes advantage of unsuspecting poker aficionados.Don't waste your money (save it for the next session's chips), as this film very briefly touches on a poker game and is nothing like Rounders in brilliantly conveying what the game and lifestyle are all about.I can't fathom why so many reviews of the movie are positive.

If you must purchase one, buy the LINKSYS!!! I got it on sale at Best Buy for only $50 and it works with any game console, not just the XBOX. The XBOX WIFI does not have it's own power supply, it has to get it from the hardware itself, causing it to heat up even more. As if you needed to get it any hotter then it already is, especially with it's hardware problems.When you add the adapter to the 360 premium system, that's $500 right there!!!

The fact of the matter is, the Xbox 360 should come standard with WiFi, like the Wii and PS3.

Of course, they claim that \\"most consumers don't want/need built-in wireless networking.\\" Bull.And of top if it, MS has the nerve to charge close to $100 for this?

While it does enable your Xbox 360 to connect to a wireless network, it does a terrible job of it. The transmit strength of it is nowhere near what you'd find on a laptop or desktop computer, meaning that while your laptop might get a good signal where your 360 is, the Xbox probably won't get as good a signal. Case in point: I can download movies incredibly quickly on my laptop from my entertainment room, while my 360 often struggles to even connect to the network.Only get this if you have to. If you can, use ethernet instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great! (For 30 minutes)","review":"The adapter was super easy to set up even with wep and mac filtering in place.

I believe it IS possible to use third party wireless bridges like we did with the original Xbox, but it seems non-trivial.Setting up the Network Adapter takes no time at all, and it just works.

Even the Nintendo DS comes with WiFi, and that's $129 for the whole game system.In short, this is never worth buying new.

The only problem is the expense of this product. The PS3 has a wireless adaptor integrated.

However, it needed to be connected to a PC for firmware updates (making it impossible for Mac users), and was generally more difficult to set up than the \\"official\\" adapter from Microsoft.I ended up getting this adapter on sale, and setting it up was a snap. It gets decent throughput, and saves some energy over an external adapter, because it only uses power when you have the Xbox 360 on. It was also nice to see that this supports WPA networks.If your time is valuable to you, this is probably worth the extra few dollars over similar products. You just snap it on, enter your network's password, and you're off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of compatiblity issues","review":"I have a D-Link DI-524 revision E 5.1 Firmware.

It seems that the Wireless Adapter can easily find the network, but I cannot successfully connect. I've tried using WPA and WEP, but with no success. I ended up giving up and returning the adapter. The DI-524 is on the compatibility list, but only for certain firmwares [which means, certain revision]. The latest revision of the DI-524 doesn't seem to be compatible with the XBOX 360 Wireless Adapter. I even have a Zonet wireless adapter for my laptop, and it connected to the router fine. I would suggest reading the fine print carefully about what routers are compatible to the wireless adapter. Having a newer firmware doesn't necessarily guarantee compatibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Limitations Are Not Worth the Cost.

The device works, and at the time it was the best, user friendly option I knew of. However, when he purchased a new Wireless N router this year (an Apple Time Capsule) we had trouble configuring it because it can only work with older wireless standard and not WPA2. We had to set the whole network to only run on wireless A specs to get a decent level of security. For roughly the same price you can purchase an Apple Airport Express (works fine with Windows too).

Garion's power continues to grow, and his affection for the little princess Ce'Nedra continues to confuse him (and her).The characterization of the relationship between Ce'Nedra and Garion is masterful, if a little stereotypical (do ANY real teenagers argue that way? I argued a lot, but I recall being a bit more quiet about it), but that doesn't detract from its fun. There are numerous other good scenes in the book, culminating in a classic wizard's duel.

When I heard that Angel was being made I would have NEVER dreamed that it would be as good as Buffy even though Joss W. created both. But after buying Angel the first season I'm in awe. It might even be better than Buffy. It really works! And although it isn't exactly like Buffy, it has a lot of similarities. Cordelia, Wesley and Angel have a great chemistry.

Please release Angel on DVD or at least on VHS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah","review":"I cannot name a season of Angel I have not loved!That said, I liked this one for it's attitude. Angel felt like a recovering alcholic the whole time, fresh from his break-up with Buffy. A lot of people thought they did too many cross-overs, but I disagree: it needed it to get off it's feet.Sara and David are so good together as actors. The episode I Will Remember You is amazing. Worth the whole dvd to watch. I hadn't fealt this much emotion since Season 2 of Buffy in The Becomming prt. 1-2!I would recomend Angel over Buffy any day! Buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glenn Quinn","review":"The first season was wonderful, which is why I'm giving the set 4 stars. But the late Glenn Quinn was not mentioned, interviewed, or in any way acknowleged in the set, which was released before his untimely death. Other actors who played more minor parts in the Buffyverse were accorded more curtesy than that. Not only was he not ever brought back but his character's death was not even spoked about. Jenny Calander's death was spoken about in the second season Buffy DVD. I know that it has been said that it was Doyle's death was planned from the beginning, but I feel that the character and the audience have been treated shabbily. I hope he is remembered on the aniversary of his death on December 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel Season One","review":"If you like The Buffy series of DVD's, you'll like this Angel first season.

When he finally leaves her and moves to Los Angeles he runs the town, makes the decisions and fights the evil all on his own. For about 5 minutes anyway. Then he gets his own sidekick, vision-getting guy Doyle. Episode one Angel saves Cordy. From then on its the three of them Angel, Doyle and Cordelia fighting evil. Instead of the slayeretts (Buffy, Willow and Xander) I guess they're like the vampiretts but cooler. Whether you watched Buffy or not you'll really enjoy this. And they do give a brief backstory incase you don't know who Angel is or what he's fighting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good","review":"This is a really good show the only thing it lacks is well......Buffy(and maybe a few of her puns too), the reason so many fell for angel in the buffy series. this is the only reason i dont like this show as much as buffy. they took him out of buffy and put him in his own show-might i also metion without puns."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"I love the show Buffy, and to be honest I just can't get into Angel.

BUT ... for anyone with a religios or chrstian background it is a disappointing show, if not downright offensive. when I started watching the first few episodes I found it quite amusing and the acting was done well. but witchcraft, spell casting, and curses became more prevalent than anything else. and it only grew worse. after about 4-5 episodes I actually could not stomach it anymore and threw it in the garbage. \\"WARNING\\" to parents, if you dont mind the demonology, buy it... but if witchcraft and spell casting, and possession offends you then BEWARE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel the first completed season","review":"i really like angel, but i don't have a card so i was wondering if you have and order form that i can send a check or cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire as Metaphor","review":"From the opening cello through the last moments of each episode this smartly written, superbly acted series has a subtle intensity not to be missed.

I face it, sometimes spin-off just don't work. But after watching \\"City of ..\\" I knew that Angel was going to be a hit. It was great to Angel try to make on this own, with a little help from his former Sunnydale friend Cordelia Chase and ex-watcher Wesley and later Gunn, Fred, Lorne. But not let us forget Doyle who helped Angel realized that he could not hide from the world.This a must for any fan of Angel or Buffy(who visits Angel a few times) Can't wait for more to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel- Not Disappointed","review":"Funny thing was that I was not too interested in Angel when it first came out... I had watched some of Season 1/2 of Buffy but didn't become a fan until later. BTVS seasons 1-3 are great DVD packages and Angel season 1 holds its own.Writing is pretty sharp. There are a few weake episodes that are too Star Trek-esque in their deus ex machine plots BUT the characters are still good. Cordelia rocks in this season with her snarky lines and on the sleeve self interest. Cordy in the current season is a waste of space but back then she was great, not a love interest!The first few episodes with the demon guy are fine but when Wesley shows up the season picks up. The two Faith episodes near the end are top 10 Buffy/Angel episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved this","review":"I loved Angel when it was first released.

Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasant for my face","review":"I am glad I discovered this stuff. My face turned out to be way to dry according to a dermatologist. So I had many dark spots and blotches. She adviced me to discontinue my daily use of clarifying lotion since it dried out my face. I didn't believe her and continued with the same routine. Until I was really pleased with so many Neutrogena products and I thought why not try their toner? Boy did I do the right thing. My face significantly cleared up, it also made my skinproducts work better and it did not dry out my skin. It also gets rid of my blemishes (that's why I did not want to give up my old toner) and completely gives your skin that clean feeling. I guess the dermatologist was right after all. I am not sure about my pores getting smaller but they are not big to begin with. I am 40 and this one is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't want to use it","review":"I brought this product last month but I don't like its smell and sometimes it makes my skin painful.

Maybe it's because my skin is too sensitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good....but not good enough.","review":"I was somewhat skeptical when searching for a pore refiner because I've had a lot of flops in the past. Unfortunately, this product falls in line with all the other failed experiments. After six weeks of use, I've seen no change in the size of my pores. However, I did notice that my skin has been less oily since I began using the product. That's nice and all, but my chief reason for the purchase was to see the promised reduction in pore size. It just hasn't happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite toner!","review":"I use this toner every night after I wash my face. I've been using it for several months now and I see such a difference in my skin. My pores look smaller and my skin even looks a little less red! My skin is clearer and just looks brighter. My skin is more on the dry side and I don't find this toner drying at all. I always moisturize after the toner had completely soaked into my skin and it's worked well for me. My skin is also on the sensitive side and this hasn't irritated my skin at all. As soon as I run out, I will purchase this product again, because I love it so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No noticable difference!","review":"I have noticed over the last few years my pore sizes has increased.

I was already using a toner after washing so I thought my face was clean......until I used this toner. I never knew there was so much dirt and residue on my face after I washed it. This is really great stuff; does what it says and the price is excellent. Now watch them stop making it (as soon as I find something I like they always do :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is OK","review":"Does what it says it will do. Been using it for years and have no complaints. For best results, use along with a moisturizer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely works!","review":"I was inclined to try this after learning about what toner does to the skin (chemistry background). It has definitely improved my skin and I use it once a day after the shower, followed by moisturizer. After you wash off the dirt and oil in the shower, toner returns the skin back to the correct pH, making it the way it's supposed to be.

This product claims to reduce the appearance of pores and lines, which I didn't really notice, but maybe you have to use it for longer. Though this toner had a fairly strong medicinal fragrance, I didn't find the odor objectionable and it seemed to dissipate rather quickly after application. I'll continue to use this and see if the appearance of my pores improves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent results","review":"I am 42 with oily skin and large, visible pores. After only a few applications of the toner I noticed a drastic difference in the size of my pores and my skin was less oily.

Otherwise, the American disc is up to the usual high Criterion standards. - Anthony Baker, Somerset, England"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiler alert","review":"This is a decent but mostly run of the mill film. I was fairly interested in how the plot line would resolve itself but hugely disappointed in the incredibly simplistic and clumsy manner in which Baines the butler was exonerated. Furthermore, none of the characters stood out to me as anything more than typical murder mystery types. Had Baines shot himself when he took the gun from the drawer it would have made for a much better ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie from a childs viewpoint","review":"There are no villians or heroes in this movie, just people bumbleing around being people. Just poetic pathos.Very believable childs eye view."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fallen Idol","review":"This is really a fine film, intriguing, suspenseful at times. It is about a young boy with torn loyalties, he knows he should do the right thing and tell the truth but the man he looks up to is suspected of a terrible crime and he may hold the key to what really happened. Very engrossing and this new digital transfer is a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't fall for Fallen Idol but would recommend it","review":"Enjoyed the movie.

Escalating gradually, a remarkable tension grows, broken by flashes of humor. This film is worth seeking out for the story craft, the film craft, the performances, and simply to enjoy a well-told story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strongly romantic interpretation on modern instruments","review":"This recording is definitely not for listeners concerned about historically informed performance: the use of modern (metal?) instruments and little or very soft \\"legato\\" articulation produces a sound very remote from that what is considered nowadays an authentic performance style for early baroque music.I nevertheless give it one star rather than none, because people inclined to romantic flute music might like this recording. Moreover it is an interesting demonstration how deep the gap is between classically trained performers and performers specialised in early music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I am a big fan of Tom Holt, who writes \\"intelligent\\" fantasy in an incredibly funny style. He is best when he sticks to subjects related to mythology (classical, Aurthurian... just about anything, actually) and history, as that is what his background is. This book, on the other hand, felt like a rush job. Parts of it made no sense (even for a book about elves), the characters were one dimensional and trite, and the book dragged on f-o-r-e-v-e-r and should have ended about five times before it actually did.If you are interested in reading a laugh-out-loud fantasy book by someone who knows his mythology, read \\"Flying Dutch\\" or \\"Expecting Someone Taller\\" or \\"Odds and Gods\\" or anything that has a historical or mythological basis before you form an opinion of Tom Holt. He really does have his brilliant moments: this book, however, is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Lines, Not Great Ending","review":"Tom Holt stories are typically more than a bit eccentric and fantastic, with a hefty dash of humor - word play and situations that might be at home in Terry Pratchett (Guards,Guards or Witches Abroad period more than the more-recent novels) or Douglas Adams book - almost always in the displaced-fish-out-of-water mold. Like Pratchett, Holt stories often have a large dose of supernatural or magic in them, but many of them take place in England. Great ingredients for light hearted fun.This book has some of the best individual lines and a great premise, but the characters aren't as engaging as usual or even likable, and even worse, the ending is flat-out depressing. I found it the least re-readable of his books.For an introduction to his funner, lighter-escapism with great humor, try Snow White and the Seven Samauri, or Who's Afraid of Beowolf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money - buy Flying Dutch","review":"Save your time and money - this book was a disappointment. I have always enjoyed the Holt books I have read - but Little People was a complete waste of time and money. An interesting idea, that is poorly executed; boring and tedious. Why, when there are so many good Holt books, was this the only one on the shelves of my local Border's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic and","review":"The next day on the job was always full of surprises. I could not put it down. A great and realistic read about the sweat and toil of the paper/lumber trade in Oregon. Bucchi goes undercover and you feel almost like you working next to him as he attempts to find the good and the bad within the organization's entry level employees; all the while trying to fit in and not stand out. Very ture and realistic in how the soical structures of the blue collar workforce operate within a given organization. You never know what your neighbor is doing or what they are involved in. A good read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with a grain of salt...","review":"While the subject was interesting, and Bucchi seems a pretty good story teller, I got tired of his ego. Throughout the entire book you keep reading how he is the greatest investigator he knows, and he is always the center of the action. He is cetainly the hero and he wants you to know it. I also got very tired him thinking that he is the only one who speaks with proper grammar and understands puns, and how his wit is just too sharp for everyone around him. This book will keep you entertained and is an easy read, but don't take it as strictly a non-fiction biography..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"I too had heard an interview with the author and thought it would be very interesting to hear his story. Although many callers on the radio interview with the author were in disbelief of his stories, I believed him and was interested to hear a story of undercover work that was non-fiction. But after reading half the book I could not go further because it seemed to fictional to me. Kind of like a James Bond movie - if that's what you want, then you'll be satisfied.

But the *majority* of women who are having awful periods, terrible pain, hurt like hell every time they have ..., and so on are well rid of their uterus. Having a hysterectomy was the best thing I ever did. Even ... is 100 times better! So who's promoting these scare-stories?

Also its strange that the old version money denominations went up to $5,000 and the new one only $1,000, I guess we've experienced deflation in recent years?

My 2 toddlers love to hear this one at bedtime. It gives us such a wonderful opportunity to talk on their level about how God requires obedience, but forgives us and still loves us when we don't listen if we say we are sorry. Like someone else mentioned in their review, I'm online today to order several more of these stories for the kids' Easter baskets.

It is written in such a way that a fluent teacher should not have to spend a lot of time planning and producing lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent...","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews on here, if you like JKX, you may or may not like this DVD. It does seem like he struggles at different times throughout the show. It's extremely raunchy - like jokes about 5-year-olds masturbating?!? It's stupid at times. It does have a really high production value though.Some of the extras on the DVD are \\"jokes that weren't funny enough\\" which is a set of jokes they edited out of the main show because they were worse than the already \\"average\\" jokes that made it into the show. Then there's another \\"bonus feature\\" where he re-uses a joke that his opener uses, thus totally embarrassing himself. So the \\"extra features\\" are actually very dissappointing.Overall this is incredibly average and Jamie is just simply better at the Jamie Kennedy Experiment. I recommend any of the three seasons if you truely want to see Jamie at his finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable","review":"This was ok.

Kennedy uncomfortably meanders from topic to topic, only at ease when playing the wacky characters that are supposedly the backbone of his comedic ability. He has no point of view, no personality, and, it seems, no jokes (look it up on IMDB; four writers are credited). In a market where original voices struggle for years to get this kind of exposure, its sickening that a vapid pseudo-celebrity like Jamie Kennedy can manage to convince the masses that this is stand up comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jamie Kennedy CAN do stand-up","review":"I know Jamie Kennedy from Malibu's Most Wanted and the Jamie Kennedy Experiment and when I got this DVD I thought that it would be okay and it was only 10 bucks, so it wouldn't be that horrible if it wasn't hilarious. Jamie makes jokes to keep it funny even when things are going wrong, he makes fun of a woman who tries to correct him and he makes fun of a cameraman behind him who drops a camera. This DVD was hilarious, the extra features aren't that great, some are funny, most of the extra features section called something like \\"jokes that weren't funny enough\\" really weren't very funny, but the first one on the list called \\"CSI\\" was pretty funny and I think they should have put that on the main thing.Anyway, this is a very funny DVD, it was unfortunately only about an hour long (i think, i don't actually remember the exact time) but from seeing other stand-up DVDs, they are usually pretty short, so this is actually a good length for a stand-up dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great surprise!","review":"I gotta be honest, when I saw that Jamie Kennedy had a stand up DVD and CD, I was skeptical. I knew him from TV and movies, and thought he was funny, but stand up???? I figured that he's just an actor who's trying to capatalize on his fame. But, like I said, I think his movies are funny, so I decided to give it a chance. I bought both the CD and DVD (the DVD had extras). Let me tell you, I was so surprised!!! He is hilarious!The DVD is almost an hour of great stand up. His presence on stage, the voices, the attitude, everything....just wonderful. His joke about how people who work at Chinese restaurants yell at the help but are nice you...I had to rewind it 4 times, it made me laugh so hard.And the extras were great too. He really put a lot of bonus stuff on here for his fans, but honestly, the stand up wouldn't been enough.Kudos to Jamie!-RB"},{"rating":"2","title":"haha!

Oddly she is a publisher and claims to only publish books that she thinks will change the spiritual landscape. Her own book falls quite short of this.

Ok--so a woman named Claire brings her \\"brother\\", Kip, with her to the beach and they meet up with August, a gay playwright--just like Williams--who is struggling to have one of his plays produced on Broadway. These three characters engage in meaningless dialogue for the remainder of the play while they're haunted by ghosts of the main character's past.

Brotherhood Watch will attract wealthy donors only as long as it is newsworthy. Vincent has shown up at just the right time. This is serious stuff, but Francine Prose injects it with humor and biting satire. Her characters are finely drawn. Their voices ring true. Even Maslow is not perfect.

The young Milanov sounds much better than on her recordings from the 50's even if her singing is the same. Moscona was a good bass. The Missa doesn't sound quite as good. The soloists often seem too far from the microphone. Kipnis comes across much more clearly than the others.

The amount of quality work McCartney and Lennon (Yes Yoko, I changed the sacred batting order. Deal with it!) churned out in the span of eight years was extraordinary. Though at the time friends, they must have been fiercely competitive and drove each other to achieve what they never would have achieved separately. This is evident in much of their solo work. Though both have had some nice moments, they have never done anything solo that has broken new ground. Though touched by the simple poetry of Imagine, I am thoroughly bored by the tune and question the longevity the song might have endured had Lennon's life not been so abrubtly ended. When I listen to \\"How Do You Sleep\\" I wonder what is was that McCartney did to piss Lennon off. It must have been pretty bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the most over-rated album ever","review":"Possibly the most over rated album of the rock era, this is bad politics married to catchy tunes by a shallow thinking pop-star. If you need proof, listen to the title song: \\"Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try... not thinking to live or die for... above us only sky...\\" Perfect description of Pol Pot's reign of terror. Then the cute attack on Paul McCartney, and the pop ditty about Yoko... Lennon's musical value is muddied by all the adulation. He isn't horrible as a pop song writer, actually pretty good; but his gift gets lost in the legend and this album attained legendary status much too quickly to be of any real value; which is part of the problem with all rock music criticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"A few days ago I listened to this album for the first time in many years. My thought is how sad it must have been to be so angry to have written lyrics like those in Gimme Some Truth, and How Do You Sleep.

It is only OK for a quick shave but it leaves a lot of stubble and I do not have a heavy beard. I have cleaned and lubricated it regularly and changed the heads but no improvement. For a better shave I have returned to my older models even my old corded one with old heads does better, and an older cordless I travel with. I recommend avoiding this model and get the new 3D 1280, or a Braun with the cleaner for a close shave if you get a newer model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norelco Electric Shaver","review":"I purchased the Norelco 8140xl electric shaver recently.

I recommend the Norelco 8140xl electric shaver without any reservation. They are the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The seller is top notch, but the Norelco shaver is sub-standard. I should have made sure it was on a par with the Quadra shavers they made several years ago, but it is similar to those now offered by Phillips Norelco. The new models are no where near as good as those made in the past. The speeds have been slowed to the point that a clean shave is unattainable. You can go over and over the same place time and again and still never obtain a good shave. The factory rep told me the new shavers were intentionally engineered to run slower to make them quieter. I don't know why a company would intentionally ruin a superior product. The new shavers offered by them are a waste of money. Give me a noisier shaver any day if it will run faster and perform like the old ones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Norelco going down hill","review":"I bought it to replace an older Norelco, mainly because my old one could not hold a charge.

The problem is that Mr. Dorough spends most of the time singing. The closest I can describe his voice is that of a male Carol Channing, and his original songs are also, well, cute.You may very well adore this CD, as Mr. Dorough does have a following, but do yourself a favor and listen to the samples above first.

(I have no idea what that really means.)Whether writing about standing up to the slings and arrows of outrageous bad hair days; confronting the sleazy demon that's her crumby muse; spinning comedy gold out of the straw of common grooming products; or taking flights of fancy that everyday \\"safe\\" ladywriters like Anna Quindlen couldn't pull off without someone spiking her Chamomile tea with a powerful hallucinogen, Claire Zulkey delivers.In short: Buy this book.

And it's not machined properly so the pieces don't fit well. You have to have it perfectly aligned to get any rotation on it, otherwise you WILL break it.

However it is filled with errors. I've encountered several errors in the exercises that make it very difficult for beginners.

Rather, I'd suggest Waters of Eden is what new age music was originally intended to be - exotic, lush, laid-back in tone yet passionate in presentation. If you've wondered what the music of any of those generic Windham Hill types would sound like with energy and vitality, as opposed to remaining in the predictable zone of soulless elevator music, this album should be a treat. As long as I'm tossing out labels here, classical, qawwali and jazz can also be applied to one degree or another.But the best way to listen is to ignore the labels and take the music on its own. Moving, haunting, passionate. It's not necessarily invigorating or exciting (unless you're thinking in a creative and spiritual sense), but something to drift to.

Most of the functionality in which I was really interested was quickly breezed over because there was \\"much more functionality than this chapter can cover\\". At less than 400 pages, I think they could've made the chapters large enough to cover a little more of the functionality. After going through the book, I have a better understanding of what the Office 2000 Web Components do, but I've still had to figure out mostly on my own how to do it all. In the end, I feel like I paid for a press release or spec sheet rather than an instruction manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much more than what was in the help doc/MSDN","review":"This is probably the best book on OWC avaliable. This is mostly due to the fact that it's probably the *only* book on OWC available.There's not substantially more information in the book than what is in the online help file.

So I gave this a try (free from my library) and they both said it was the first thing to really help them. I had them sit and watch, then pause it and take notes on each issue with algebra that came up. Admittedly, there is a guy at a chalkboard explaining math, so it was a shock they got so much out of it. Personally, we homeschool and algebra was a long time ago for me. Well, the kids raved about this guy. He puts everything into simple terms, no complex craziness; he really breaks it down. I'd say giving this 5 stars was super easy...but I borrowed it for free. Perhaps your library can do an inter-library loan on these? If not, and you have the money for it, get it. It's awesome.

From the first few notes you can feel that this music was written for dance. The first piece is the most important and long one. It offers lots of different rhythms and moods. The other, shorter pieces can be cut together as one needs them. There are instrument solos as well as short versions of popular songs. And there is a VERY long but interesting tabla solo - it's not really a solo, it's supported by the band. And guaranteed to make you sweat. The orchestra is nice, old fashion with real instruments insted of those tiresome synthezisers one get's so often nowadays.

Worse, if you don't put the paper in exactly right it grabs three or four sheets at a time and jams up fairly regularly. The text is poor to passable but figures are murky.

Three chapters expound on the Catholic way of life, including their faith, their transformation in Christ, and their affirmation. Brantl then sums up with a concluding chapter on the \\"last things\\" - death, judgement, purgatory, hell, and heaven.For those looking for a brief summation of the Catholic religion, this may be a good place to start.

I was very impressed. It gave very detailed information and the photos were wonderful!The only problemm I have with it is that it ran a little long in places.

With a combination of Scott and Kevin's voices automatically you find yourself in complete awe. When you add Barry's ground shaking vocals,Elliots smooth tones and Jeff's unbelievable beat,you have a sound that is beyond comparison. Not one other group can come close to this talent. This album offers a variety of beats and chords that are undoubtedly amazing. I recommend this to anyone and everyone who enjoys talent because you haven't heard it until you listen to Rockapella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockapella 2 IS as good as previous works","review":"I am a fan of all of Rockapella's work. It is true that this album has a different feel than previously released albums... but it is also *I think* the first album without any influence from Sean Altman who has been a dominant influence on the \\"feel\\" of Rockapella. I personally feel that this album is as good, if not better than previous works. It pioneers a cappella into new styles, sounds, rhythms and sophistications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great compared to Don't Tell Me You Do","review":"Many people who have given this cd 5 Stars have not heard the album \\"Don't Tell Me You Do\\" by Rockapella. \\"Don't Tell Me You Do\\" leaves this cd in the dust and is by far their best cd, and makes this CD sound plain and boring. \\"Don't Tell Me You Do\\" also includes the vocal percussion, vocal bass, and Folgers song if that's what customers are waiting for.

So I returned it, another headache, I'm a seasoned engineer, but once the lift is locked in it is near impossible to remove to pack back up.

A couple of observations:1) its rather limited recline (recline can be adjusted but has to be fixed) 'forces' you have a straight posture, unlike some 'executive' leather chairs which tend to be more forgiving towards less than perfect postures. This can be thought as a pro or con depending on one's needs.2) Its mesh back is a definite plus in summer.

Mesh material is stretched already after only 2 months of very light use (I'm 5.7\\" 125 lbs and sitting upright position most of the time).4. The under-elbow arms are too hard with almost no cushioning.5. Seat made out of thin fabric with a very little cushioning also (I'm using a foam pillow to soften it).Overall = for this kinda discomfort...price must be twice cheaper. About bells & whistles... who needs it, if comfort is THE priority #1 for any type of chair.Just think about; nobody in the whole industry trying to do the comfort of the home/office chair, that would be equal or even close to the comport of the cheapest car driver-seat.

I often love the deals like this you find on Amazon, but this was not one of them. It had rusty parts inside the internal mechanism. It made strange noises and clicks. It was not any more comfortable than my $50 awl-mart chair. But worst of all was the smell. THe mesh must have been made from a petroleum derivative. It stank up my entire office. I thought it would go away. For a week it was still as strong. After another week it was fainter in the room, but still strong if you were actually sitting in it. I am not a hyper-sensitive person. But this gave me headaches. Hate to say it, but if you want a great chair, you have to pay for it. Returned this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality and Design","review":"I would give this chair less than one star if possible. The description and price make the chair attractive. After receiving this product last year as a gift, I have done my best to use it and try to ignore the discomfort and poor quality but I have to urge you as a potential buyer to look for something else. It is not comfortable for me to sit in this chair for long periods of time. I'm a computer programmer and need to spend at least six hours a day in my chair. When you initially sit in the chair, the mesh back will pull your shirt up. Should you ever sit in the chair wearing something like a t-shirt, it feels like a cheese grater running over your skin. The seat doesn't have enough padding. After almost a year of use, I feel like I'm sitting on a board now. Both foam arm rests have broken.

It's comfortable, and I like the mesh back as I think it will keep me a little cooler in my home office on summer days. I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 because there is a little movement in the chair back from side to side. It uses just two bolts to connect the chair to the back, and tight as I have tried to make those bolts, I can't eliminate a slight wobble. In using the chair, I almost never notice it. All in all I'm happy with the purchase for this price. It's not worth paying 2x - 4x as much for a fancy chair; this one gets the job done well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jan 2013 review - Chair is easy to put together","review":"The bad: The arm rests were NOT brand new.

It is a comfortable chair and a great value. When I first received the chair, a plastic piece that covers the bottom mechanism was cracked - presumably during shipping. The piece was not a functional part of the chair and I did not want to pack it back up and return it over such a small thing. I called the customer service number, fearing the worst, but was greeted immediately by a friendly voice. She promised to ship out a replacement piece and took my information in just a few minutes. A few days later the correct piece arrived. Easy to assemble and looks great. The no-nonsense customer service was refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good chair, doing the work...","review":"The chair is very convenient and is exactly what I expected.The assembly process is straight forward and it took me about 30 minutes to assemble it.The only reason I gave it four stars is that one of the handle is not strait, however this is not a big deal and I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfy computer chair","review":"It is probably the best computer chair I've ever sat in or used. It is extremely adjustable (even the angle at which you are stilling, as well as the back-rest and height). The mesh back is comfortable and so is the seat itself. I bought it after my last good computer chair wore out and it definitely lessens fatigue if you are sitting for a long duration.My only knock against it is the mesh back is tacky and will grab your clothing. So if you plop down sloppily into the chair or slouch as I do, it will lift your shirt. It definitely is annoying. But for me, it is no deal-breaker, and I simply lay a blanket over the mesh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair","review":"This chair is great!For it's price, I suppose it's good.I used to use a $100 synthetic leather chair from Staples that used to be extremely comfortable.However, after about 3 years of use, the leather wore out and the so did the cushioning, making the chair extremely unpleasant to sit on for periods of longer than 30 minutes.So far, this chair has been great to me, it feels nice and I don't notice any discomfort during work or play."},{"rating":"1","title":"arrived broken","review":"this is actually an OK product overall. but it arrived with one of the ergonomic control levers broken off, and it wasn't as if it had broken off while in transit. if it had, the part which fell off would have been somewhere in the box. no, this lever had broken off, and some person had decided to pack the chair up and sell it anyway. and that's the chair I got.shipping it back is too much of a hassle, but obviously I'd recommend you skip this and find a chair made by people who have standards and self-respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it.","review":"- It arrived in a very good condition without any missing component.- I assembled it and sat on it to find it is SO GOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to assemble, comfortable","review":"Purchased this chair after researching a number of chairs for home office. Assembly was quite straightforward to do by myself. The product overall seems sturdy and solid. Tilt adjustments are good - seat and back can be adjusted.

But since I don't have $800 to buy the top of the line, I gave this chair a ride and I am glad I did. It has all the features of the more expensive ones and is quite comfortable. The cushion is soft but shows that it was well made and will stand up to long periods of sitting. I am quite pleased with the 3-say adjustment too, it really lets me find perfect comfort spots throughout the days movements.Thanks Lorell for a great chair at a darn good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent after a little seasoning","review":"I've found this chair to be very comfortable, even after long periods of time. It has a nice range of adjustablity.However, upon removing it from the box, the plastic housing that covers the tilt mechanism on the bottom of the seat. However, as this doesn't affect the function and isn't really visible unless you 12\\" tall it wasn't a big enough issue for me to return it.My only real complaint about this chair is that for the first several days I had it, it was giving off fumes (think new car smell, only unpleasant). These fumes had a mildly unpleasant odor and were strong enough to give me a wicked headache and stomach nausea after 2-3 hours of sitting in the chair on the first day.My advice- after you assemble the chair douse it in febreeze and sit it in an unused corner of the room for a few days until the smell goes away. After that, it's a wonderful desk chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomforably small, incredibly difficult to assemble POS","review":"I purchased this office chair as a replacement to the one I had had for quite some time. I would have just repurchased my original chair, but it was a gift and there was no listed manufacturer on the chair itself.I began my search for a new chair by simply looking for the highest rated chair on Amazon. Somehow, this garbage is at the top.First off, it came with the incorrect hardware for installing the arms. The knobs that they sent along to secure the arms were the incorrect size, and I could not get them to screw in properly. I ended up having to MacGyver them into place with a bit of drilling and a quick trip to HD to get some proper bolts and nuts.Second, the chair just isn't very comfortable. If your shirt rides up in the back when you sit down, the \\"ventilating mesh\\" turns into a cheese grater.I do NOT recommend this chair.

Fabric durable and the mesh backrest gives support and ventilation. Controls allowed me to set the position of the chair to match my body contours. Assembly easy and delivery was faster than advertised. Chair has a good quality feel to it. Arm rests are nice but I prefer not to use them. I am happy the manufacturer designed it that way. The only thing keeping this from a five star rating is the casters. I would like a little more friction in the movement for better stability. This is a minor detail. For the price this chair hits the mark and I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Ergo Desk Chair","review":"The chair has 3 levers to control the position of the back and seating....love that! It has saved my back from much pain which was often when using basic office chairs.

I've used Aeron chairs at work for many years and like them. However, the price is steep for home use. I have used this chair now for almost three months and it is comfortable throughout those full days in the home office. It is also easier to adjust quickly compared to the Aeron chair. I particularly like the fact that both back position and seat angle can be adjusted to maintain good posture. The only reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the seat is fabric covered and I suspect it will be more difficult to maintain over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid chair for reasonable price","review":"I'm very pleased with this chair. It arrived in good condition and setting it up took less than an hour. (Even after I screwed up and put the arms on backwards, and had to redo it.) The chair is solidly made and all the adjustable features work as advertised. The mesh back is very nice when sitting in it for long periods, keeps air moving a bit.

One worked smoothly for the valve operation. The second valve was stuck when I received it. I disassembled the valve and retightened it, which helped a little, but still the valve was difficult to operate. I put the valve knob in a vise and rotated the body several times, which removed some molded plastic inside the valve that was causing the binding. Since then, I've used the valves frequently without issues and they work flawlessly with no leakage. Very convenient to have at the end of a hose so you don't have to go back to the main faucet to shut off the hose when you want to change attachments. I can't complain too much, since the price is so low (what can you expect?). Anyway, I've been pleased with the valves, and I would purchase them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting approach","review":"This story of three friends gone their seperate ways after an accident made me relate to my own experiences as a youth out of college.

Each David experiences new encounters with interesting and somewhat ironic characters that help shape their personalities and attitudes. One of the most intriguing things about this book is the style in which the author tells the story through the Davids.

It's hard to believe it was so long ago, but I still love slapping the cassette in my car stereo and bangin' along to great tracks like \\"Man in the box\\" and \\"Sea of Sorrow\\". This album really helped defined not only metal, but grunge as well. As much of a crossover as their could be at the young age of grunge and the changing face of metal, Alice in Chains was a pioneer on both fronts, and rarely gets the credit they deserve. Not as refined as later releases, \\"Facelift\\" packs in power, emotion, and sometimes slightly more trite lyrics, but the end result is still great. Should be considered a classic and a must have for all music fans.(NOTE: This review was originally written Oct '99)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal Gets A Facelift","review":"Alice In Chains debut album came along right as hair metal was dying and just before grunge was about to hit. As a result, it contains both of these elements and provides a hint at what this brilliant band was capable of. \\"We Die Young\\" starts off with grinding downtuned riff by guitarist Jerry Cantrell that would later become standard. \\"Man In The Box\\" features singer Layne Stayley wailing about censorship. Creepy, dissonant numbers like \\"Love,Hate,Love\\" and \\"Confusion\\" sound like Godsmack's primer. Stayley begins examining his heroin problem on the 80's metal-ish \\"Put You Down\\" and \\"Real Thing\\"(where he asks his rehab doctor if he can \\"borrow 50 bucks\\"). A decidedly dark affair that today sounds downright cheery compared to the band's later albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overlooked Classic","review":"I recently bought this album to complete my collection of Alice in Chains albums. I must say this is my favorite AIC album by far. I would classify the album as a hard rock/metal sound and should not be lumped together with the work of Nirvana, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam or even AIC's later work. The songs are performed with a lot of raw emotion and creativity and there is a large amount of diversity of songs: all out metal 'We Die Young' to the jazzy 'Sea of Sorrow' and the upbeat 'Sunshine' and 'I Know Something (Bout You), this contrasts to 'Dirt' which seems to be very dense and dark. I truely don't feel there is any filler songs on the album. Finally, the sound quality of early/mid-90s CDs are absolutely supurb as they haven't been over-compressed yet. Thus, if you can get the 1990 vintage CD, the audio quality is sublime.If you enjoy Alice In Chains or early 90s rock, I would highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outgrew it, but it's still one of the best","review":"I bought this CD 7 years ago when I was 14 and just learning how to play guitar. I actually saw the Man in the Box video on Mtv and was totally blown away. I had no clue music like that was out there. Needless to say, I was in total love with Facelift for months. Everyday it was in the CD player. Not quite the case now. It's probably my least favorite AIC album, but that's just because all the others are so amazingly good. Layne and Jerry sound great together, and the music was so heavy for that time. So maybe my review is just a little biased. This is the first \\"amazing\\" CD I ever bought, and it inspired me to play guitar. But if you're looking for classic \\"ol' school\\" AIC, Facelift is where it's at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant classic and one of the greatest debuts ever!","review":"Couldn't stop playing Facelift forever when it came out and it still sounds as fresh today. Everybody I knew also seemed to be playing it and even new people I met were playing it, amazing debut. Instantly enjoyable with incredible depth and contrast that keeps it from getting old. While Alice In Chains showed the obvious influences of the time, Seattle Grunge, they really had their own sound and did it so well they were practically genre defining. This is one of those discs you want to buy as a whole and listen to as intended. In my opinion Alice in Chains best!

The slow-brewing intensity of the latter song sets it apart from the straight-up metal of the rest of the album. I really liked AIC back in the day and think both Cantrell and Staley are great talents, but I could never get into this album. Dirt, Sap, and Jar of Flies are all superior to Facelift so if you're new to AIC check those works out first."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can remember!!","review":"Without any dought, their best album!!

Oh, yes...one more thing...you all keep talking about hit-songs, like \\"Man in the box\\". I say, that one of the best songs EVER is on this album, and that is \\"Love, Hate, Love\\". Why ??

Also gas wants to spill out of the fill cap when the unit is lifted by the handles to move it, if the gas tank is near full. (The gas tank should be flipped in the frame IMHO). Also I think the on/off switch seems to be mounted intutativly upside down,which I corrected. In addition the soft rubber wheels really stick out board from the main generator frame and they tend to get caught on different items in my garage. Having said all that, I would still buy it again.

I took a quick look at it today and found two mistakes on the first page I checked, page 295, question 3. The author insists that \\"none\\" always requires a plural verb, but all the best usage manuals (Fowler, Follett, Garner, even the OED) say that it may be singular or plural, with plural being more common. The sense is clearly plural, not singular in question 3 (\\"none of the fish are native\\"). Also, in question 4, who in the world would ever use \\"you and me\\" instead of \\"us\\"?

Almost every explanation encountered dealt with this average-student on the SAT who almost always misses the hard questions, thinks like an idiot and scores less than the average on the actual test. Bla bla bla approach which paradoxically (!?) occupies half of this book.The book is filled with all kinds of paranormal approaches, irrelevant references ( the one where you are told to compare the reading section with the tale of a thief who robs banks???)On the other side, there are some things to consider : three almost realistic tests with an experimental section, some hard math questions well worth passing through ( though I noted some errors in giving the right answer...)and excellent reading passages.Yet I cannot help not being haunted by that famous Joe Bloggs whenever I open this book so...Try the College Board book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, but ...","review":"I love cats, and my favorite color is purple so I was happy to find these - and they were reasonably priced.It would have been soooo much better if the kittens on the earrings were made to face each other (one facing left, one facing right) rather than both pointed in the same direction. I like symmetry and balance. What you don't see in the item photo is the hole in the center of the Amethyst Stone. One of the cats almost covers it, the other is farther up on the stone, making the hole more noticeable.

The light is fairly white, with perhaps a scant trace of blue. The receptacle is round and can rotate 360, perfect for horizontal or vertical sockets. It also takes up only one socket space. The product picture is not very representative of the unit. You can see a better picture of it if you search on the web. It's a very well-designed little fellow. As an aside, it's amazing how many of the available nightlights are lacking in one way or another. Makes you appreciate this one all the more.

The strap I got first doesn't seem to be available ant this thing is just nasty1 - I cannot use it with the charger/downloading base I have.2 - Installation is a PITA3.

My wife and I both did not like the rubber strap provided so we bought a replacement strap. I looked everywhere for a velcro/fast-wrap that you did not have to remove the pins to download/charge the gps. You won't find one out there. This strap is great: stays in place, resists moisture/sweat, easy to fasten.

Keep running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than oringinal strap","review":"Much more comfortable than original strap & fits my small wrist better too. It is a minor inconvenience to use the inclosed tool to disconnect one pin to charge it(in my case once a week).

The band works great although it is blukier than the regular one that comes with the Garmin 305. It did take a little getting used to b/c of the added bulk.

His singing and songwriting really jells on this cd.I was lucky enough to catch them with this lineup on tour in the US that year and they were very high energy and blew the headliner off the stage. They get lumped in as a metal band...but I never thoughtof them in that genre....there was just too much intelligence and taste coming out of this band on stage and in the studio.

The new comer then was Paul Raymond who replaced keyboardist Danny Peyronel. Raymond's proficiency at both guitar and keyboards added versatility to the sound of UFO.Light's Out has a lighter and more progressive rock sound than its predecessors (Force It, No Heavy Petting) and successor (Obsession) of the 1st Schenker era. The title track is the only one that can be called heavy metal. Most of the songs are more of the arena rock genre that was popular in the day.

What's with you people? (I am speaking to you, the public.) Why haven't you risen up to demand your UFO?! With all the obscure ---- out there, I would think there's got to be at least a few buyers in the cyber-world for this excellent album/CD. It's almost worth buying for the title cut alone! OK, this music isn't for everyone. It isn't very sophisticated. It definitely has a sort of retro-70s hard pop rock feel (with a couple of notable exceptions). But, at least on this album, UFO gets it right. It's one of those rare ones where almost every song is great. It's light years ahead of stuff from the likes of Metallica, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest et al. So, why can't I replace my scratchy old LP? Rise up America! Lay your hands upon the monitor. Say it with me, WE WANT OUR UFO."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of UFO's Best!","review":"My friend used to crank this album in his car every morning on the way to high school. The title track with it's galloping riff always got us ready for the day. Other than Obsession I think this is UFO' best. Mind you they did put out some good albums after Schenker left, especially No Place To Run and TWTWATI. Light's out contains some of UFO's finest classics like Too Hot To Handle (great chorus), Lights Out (great ballad with a classic solo), Alone Again Or (written by Love), and Love To Love. I never got into Just Another Suicide or Electric Phase but they are ok. I also recommend Force It, Obsession, and Walk On Water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This is the keypad that came with our Genie garage door opener and after 3 years, we have to replace it.

I had to slide the spring back from the end and hold it while getting a pliers on the end fitting to tighten it. Damage is a possibility.

It provides an insight into Alexanders life before coming to Russia and what circumstances he was presented with once he arrived. Parts of it are written in his perspective and it is great to compare this with Tatianas from the 1st book.You are left hanging right up until the very end of the book as to whether or not Tatiana will find Alexander and then be able to save them both.I have read all 3 books 3 times over and thoroughly recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is the 2nd book of 3.

The story is split between Tatiana, who manages to escape to the US while pregnant, and Alexander, from the time he came to the Soviet Union throughout WWII. Simons is a talented author and great storyteller, who is comfortable touching on touchy subjects such as soviet politics, the treatment of prisoners, etc., which gives a lot of credibility to the story. The Soviet Union and WWII are more than a background to this story and I learnt a lot through the experiences of Alexander and how he managed before and during the war as an American at heart. To me this wasn't the best book by Paullina Simons (the best being The Girl in Times Square), but I enjoyed it a lot and it will touch a lot of readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recieved on expected time","review":"I got my purchase on time, I dont like when I asked for specific info and they sent me a mail with a lot of info that I didnt need, But delivery time was great and the book in excellent condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"TATIANA and ALEXANDER","review":"I needed more Tatiana and Alexander, so the book was a real treat. However, I am not writing to review the book, rather to alert people that \\"TATIANA and ALEXANDER\\" is the same book as \\"THE BRIDGE TO HOLY CROSS\\" by Paullina Simons. It has a different title and cover picture, but the ONLY OTHER difference is the size of the print. I did receive a better price on \\"TATIANA and ALEXANDER\\" and the print was larger."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read Series!","review":"I recommend this series to everyone! You will be on the edge of your seat and not able to put the books down. There is so much history about Russia and the war in these stories.

Even when the knife bound in the drywall, the blade didn't slip out of the housing.My main problem with this knife - it's very heavy. Almost inappropriately heavy. There's no reason a strong knife can't be made without feeling like it's going to break your toe if you drop it.If it was a little lighter, I would have given it 5 stars. It loses a star because of the weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good value","review":"It works great, have been using it for a couple weeks now and so far the knife has worked very well.The blade is easy to replace but need to be very cautious doing so since the mechanism is very close to the blade itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Grabbee Shepherds Hook","review":"This small Grabbee Shepherds hook is a wonderful invention.

I was hoping for another great LB book.I kept on putting this one down feeling that it was discombobulated and somehow incomplete. After more than 100 pages I stopped reading the book. I was frustrated with some characters who just didn't seem real and what did another reviewer say...something about this book being \\"over the top\\" at times.

Not only did I think it was slow moving, but I felt that he wasn't writing some of the women characters well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment!","review":"I know that one should not take a serious writer's style for granted (and Lawrence Block is certainly a serious writer), but I have always looked to Mr. Block for something other than what was offered in his latest work. Since the publishing world seemed to think it was a book worth reading, I guess I am just too provincial to appreciate all the gratuitous, kinky sex in \\"A Small Town\\". From now on, I think I will check out Mr. Block's books from my library...at least, when I put it down, unfinished, I do not have to regret wasting both my money and my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanging on the edge of your seat - brilliant.","review":"Best book I've read in years. Fabulous book. Brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Block's Best Effort","review":"Normally what I expect from a Lawrence Block book is a plot-driven book with interesting characters. Small Town is a character-driven book, with a meandering plot that moves very slowly. And every one of the characters in this book is unlikeable. The book is filled with long stretches of these characters musings and they just extremely tedious. Even the kinky sex, which you would expect would spice things up, is so over-wrought that it too becomes tedious after a while.I listened to this as an audio book, and I kept plowing through it thinking it would get better since it was after all a Lawrence Block book. It didn't, and it was a relief when it finally ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst Block book ever","review":"I love the books of Lawrence Block. I think the Scudder series is as good as any fiction done in the past 25 years, with only a few exceptions. But this is horrible. The sex scenes are just filler. I understand the point of showing passion in New Yorkers, but these scenes just brought the book to a screeching halt. If these scenes were taken out it still would not have been much of a book. Obviously Block knows and loves New York, but this just is not a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts with a Bang, Ends with a Whimper","review":"This book started out in a fascinating way - a janitor discovers a body, a writer is possibly guilty (but doesn't remember the crime), etc., but then goes downhill fast. Once the murderer is revealed, it becomes dull, since we know the ending. Plus, the kinky sex scenes with the art dealer are embarrassing, juvenile, and actually got boring after awhile, since they seemed to have nothing to do with the book. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"story of many perspectives","review":"Funny how Manhatten can become a small town. At least that's Lawrence Block's premise in writing this crime drama from several folks' perspectives - folks that don't really know each other but bump into each other often. The sexual tension with Susan is pretty extreme -- pretty much an X-rated read with explicit detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a compelling read","review":"This book was my introduction to Larry Block and a fine one at that. More than a mystery this book is a real novel! That said, I do think that there are moments when Block is a little bit over the top. In particular with the character of Susan. The long psudo-porn scenes with her brutal to read and add little to the plot. Maybe her sexual obsession is her way of coping in a post 9/11 world, but I didnt buy it personally. I thought everthing involving her was a tad indulgant on Blocks part.That aside though there are pleasure's aplenty here for the decerning reader and I would recomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"thineagle","review":"I'm a real Block fan, but where this book was concerned, I just wanted it to end. Where is the Block who gave me those concise Matt Scudder books where I was hooked for hours on end until the end? Instead, I'm subjected to \\"New York\\" where everything is sex, sex, sex-- excuse me, where is Lawrence Block, the novelist, not the porn expert? Please, Lawrence, don't get senile on us-- get back to Matthew and his problems and those neat mysteries we can cozy up to with a hot toddy and our recliner and lose ourselves in your great prose. Please..."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER THE TOP SEX AND LOOSE ENDS GALORE","review":"Despite all the favorable reviews I read in this space, I thought this was an awful book. Major plot lines were left hanging. Heroine has outrageous sex with many people in bizarre and embarrassing ways, ends up loving the protagonist -- who still may be a murderer. Everybody ends up happy when they shouldn't, when in reality they wouldn't. The 9/11 stuff is so unreal. There is no motivation here that makes sense. This is the kind of stuff that Harold Robbins was famous for, but at least he tried to tie things together; Block doesn't even make the effort. If this is the kind of stuff you guys are reading and enjoying, you need tomove up in the world and try other authors of some quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"you know how in lots of big books there is one storyline that you don't care a lot about, and secretly think you have to wade through to get to the storylines you do are excited about? Well, about 2/3 of the way through SMALL TOWN I felt that all of the storylines were that one. None of them were bad per se, but none of them captured me and I kept waiting for it to get better until the book ended and I realized that it wasn't getting better.I'm a huge Lawrence Block fan, but this book just didn't do much for me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Good stuff...but all in moderation","review":"I like Block and this is an excellent novel. There are some great ideas here, but it could have been short. Furthermore, there is just too much graphic sex in this book--soft porn almost. Why is that needed? I'm not sure what it adds to the story, even if it about people discovering who they are...I'm pretty open minded, but I really think it distracts from a fascinating story. Block loves NY and is to be commended for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not very good","review":"Well, I've read Scudder, Bernie, and the other Block main characters, so I know Block. This book starts off well, with a very interesting plot. It even has an interesting and surprisingly sympathetic, murderer.But the over-the-top sex scenes were just plain boring after a while. By the end, I didn't really care much for Susan. And are we really to believe a macho former police commissioner would let himself be so utterly dominated by a woman? And are we really to believe that this same woman \\"teaches\\" another man he's gay? Please.Finally, the ending is just too little, too late. By the time the Carpenter meets his maker, I'd just about had it with the book.In short, this book was too long, and the heavy emphasis on sex made the story, and the characters, LESS interesting than more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I picked up the unabridged 13 disc audio version of this novel at my local library. I can't recommend it.While the \\"killer on the loose\\" part was fairly interesting, the sex scenes seemed to be just added to lengthen the book. I'm not a prude, but practically all of the sex scenes could have been removed and this would have been a much more interesting \\"thriller\\".The book was long and at times just plain boring.In fact, disc 6 was defective and wouldn't play, so I skipped it entirely, only to find that I could still easily understand the rest of the novel.I wanted to see what was going to happen to the \\"killer\\", but every time the story turned to a \\"love scene\\" it was more of a turn off than it was a turn on.The book could have been MUCH shorter.

Found this book to run on and I didn't like any of the characters. If this is what small town New Yorkers are like...I pity them. Getting back to the book. I am a great fan of Lawrence Block from Bernie to Matthew to the man with the Lithuanian princess for a roomy. I picked this book expecting to be entertained and couldn't wait to finish it so I could get away for the going on and on about nothing. I got the picture on the characters early on and the only mystery to me was who exactly who would catch the bad guy. And that turned out to be anti-climatic or was this so the ex-cop could prove his manhood in the end. (no pun intended). But, I'm going on and should stop now. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Block says that this is his first book that his mom did not get to read. Whew, I wouldn't want my mom to read this either. To me, sex in a story is like salt in a soup. Every life, every soup needs a dash but in this case when there is scene after masochistic scene of sex torture it's just nauseating. I couldn't even finish this book, the characters were so dull that I didnt even care what happened to them. Up until now I bought Block's books in hardcover. Now I will peruse them in the store before making the mistake of buying them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I bought this book as a present for the huge James Bond fan in my life and it was perfect. He really enjoyed looking at all of the classic posters from the various movies. If you have someone who really is a Bond fanatic, this is the way to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond the Icon","review":"The only reason I am not rating this book 5 stars is that the selection of posters from my favorite Bond film, 'You Only Live Twice', was limp. That said, the book exceeded my expectations for showing 'the images of the fantasy' of Bond: the debonnaire sexual animal, the wry expression on his face, the ever present gun, boobs, booze, and world saving mission....A wonderful surprise was all the foreign posters, which really added a dimension of how other cultures have interpreted Bond. The book is wonderful more for its great collection of Bond posters than for any high art book production quality (although the reproductions are fine).Bond was my idol as a boy. This caused some problems in later life, given his unending cycle of kill a guy, save the world, screw a woman, have a drink. So I have definite mixed feelings about the character, but marvel at the whole dramatic creation of it all......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Digability is part of my \\"day is done\\" routine.","review":"I finally found just the right CD for my \\"day is done\\" routine.

The United States of America was founded by people fleeing religious persecution. Here Mr. Farar advocates turning back the clock to allow churches to control what we see and even how we raise our families. Anyone with an education in history knows that religions have for the most part failed to prevent violence and immorality and in most cases have exasperated these problems. How can any modern citizen seriously propose that America withdraw from international politics in our world of deeply interwoven economies? Restoring freedom by advocating censorship has the ring of Stalinist doublespeak.

Yeah sure, let's all march backward, and believe in Farah's God, and that is going to solve all our problems.

It has been so long since we had America. Now I plan to re-read to see if I missed something. Maybe then we will be able to take back America. This is my dream. I come to this country as immigrant.

She choose a beautiful selection of songs, and the band behind her sounded great (that's why I gave 2 stars instead of one), but these songs are just not for her. These beautiful ballads highlight the fact that she has NO vocal range whatsoever. She goes badly off key in numerous places, I winced a couple of times -- I guess they can only work so much magic technically.I am a fan going back to the 70's and continue to be a fan of her original work -- she needs to stick to what she does best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"My wife saw this album touted in the newspaper and asked me to buy it.

I mean how could I ever go wrong with Carly Simon, right? She's been a top favorite of mine since the 70s. She has some of the greatest hit songs I've ever known. And her albums are wonderful! I have every one of them as a matter of fact. I say all of this to let you know, if you bothered reading this, that I am not trying to put her down in any way. I LOVE Carly Simon!! BUT, what's happened to her? She sounds flat on a number of these cuts, and sounds lackluster on most of the others. To all those folks who gave this cd five stars, have you really listened to it?? My gosh! It's pretty bad. I don't want to keep it. I've listened to it several times and can't get over the sad feeling it gives me. Hopefully this was just a fluke. Maybe she'll bounce back with something hot and sultry, like the old ones, that'll knock our socks off.

Yes, she was one of the earliest pop stars to record songs from the Great American Songbook. Too many pop stars have gone down this path with equally bad results (Rod Stewart and Barry Manilow) Very few have been successful treading these boards (recommend: Bette MidlerMemories of You, Boz ScaggsSpeak Low). However, just because Carly was there before most of the others, doesn't mean she is good at it or should continue to crank out mediocre vocals on great songs. On this cd she sounds very stiff and wooden. No nuances here, folks. You are much better off spending your money on the great singers who first sang these songs: Ella, Nat Cole, Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughn, Fred Astaire. Or if you want more recent folks try cabaret artists like Wesla WhitfieldHigh Standards, Andrea MarcovicciAs Time Goes By: Best of Andrea Marcovicci, Ann Hampton Callaway ,To Ella With Loveor Phillip OfficerFancy Meeting You."},{"rating":"2","title":"This a real showcase from Carly","review":"If for some real reason you arte tired of pop music, then there is an alternative. try this great sounding anthology from her.

(Sadly, Iactually plunked down the money to buy it without hearing any ofit first.) She sounds listless and almost as if she's strugglingwith the songs; and speaking of the songs, most are so overdoneit becomes tedious. How many more versions of \\"I Only Have EyesFor You\\" do we need? Spare me! The arrangements are also run-of-the-mill, almost Lawrence Welk-y in their blandness. I havealways loved Carly, but this appears to have been a bad idea fromthe start. Give a listen to \\"Torch\\" from 1981 if you want tohear how great she could sound singing classic material.

It might be ok for a small camera, but telescopes need a wider base of support with no play in the moving parts; otherwise your image jumps all about.

In several others, answers were there, but didn't match the questions (in numerical order). Many times the answer was written correctly but aligned with the wrong letter. The CD ROM was good, but several answers did not jive with information given in the book.

At first I wasn't certain if I was listening to a joke or the musical version of Jack T. Chick. Ultimately I realized it was a joke and a fine one, at that. The lyrical content of some songs doesn't pull punches; \\"United Nations\\" sounds like a far-right militia theme song, and the more humorless out there will NOT find it funny.But there's some pretty interesting stuff. I'm not a fan of experimentalism in general, but Conn smartly refrains from doing nothing but \\"experimenting\\", sparing us a torturous album. He blasts the Heaven's Gate cultists (\\"California\\"), wannabe stars (\\"Baby Man\\"), rich-kid jerks (\\"White Bread\\"), and the more extreme edges of the right (the aforementioned \\"United Nations.\\") This is a good, fun, genre-jumping album and one I fully recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful intrigue","review":"This is an excellent, well written, fast paced novel of intrigue, conspiracy and deception at the highest level of government based around the search for a cure for Alzheimer's.The protagonist is a likeable fellow who I expect may show up in Avila's subsequent novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap board, not great concept","review":"most cranium games are worth the money, but not this one. the board is paper weight, the little shells are durable but hard to get to work in the piece that's supposed to make noise. my toddler was not at all interested in it, and frankly I don't blame him.

This one is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Played with ONCE","review":"My 4 year old wanted this and played with it when she first brought it home, hasn't played it since.

The seashell sits on a plastic thing... it took both my 3 year old and 5 year old several attempts to sit it on there right to play the sound back. If you accidentally bumped the seashell off the plastic holder, it's starting a new turn.Also, the little shells that are to plug into the seashell... the kids kept lifting up the seashell to plug and unplug them, thus causing the seashell to start over.I'm actually really surprised this game made it onto shelves... stay far far away from it. It's just not a fun game at all, and I wouldn't call it a learning game either."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expeected better from Cranium","review":"I bought this game for my 3 and 4 year olds. They love Cariboo and Hulabaloo, so I figured a Cranium game couldn't miss. Well, I was certainly wrong! The game is boring once you've played it a few times. Once you can tell that the sound is, for example, a dolphin, you really don't need to stick the key in the shell to tell you that. But if you don't, the game doesn't work. And, of course, if you jostle the shell wrong, it messes up the whole game. Luckily I got this on a really good sale because it's now occupying space in the back of our game closet. Cramium should have known better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Taints Reputable Cranium Brand Name ...","review":"Cranium Sounds of the SeashoreNot sure why this product made it past Cranium Marketing. My kids were so confused with the instructions! Plus, the plastic seashell does not properly fit on its plastic base and it failed to work when turned on. We could not tell the difference between a sea sound and the on sound. The instructions did not provide much guidance to that, and most importantly, how to play the game.To play a good memory game with preschoolers, I recommend using an old-fashioned deck of cards or buying the old-school Original Memory Game by Hasbro:Original Memory"},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed for boredom and frustration","review":"For a Cranium product I was pretty disappointed with this. The \\"beginner\\" level could easily be played by a toddler (18 months) and the advanced level is not much more challenging. I echo the frustration others had with the shell restarting a new sound every time it was lifted or jostled. The conch shell was telling us hooray! we were finished, when we still had about 6 shells on the board. At least dealing with that issue added a challenge to this otherwise completely boring game. If you think hearing a boat sound and then flipping over pictures until you find one of a boat sounds fun, then this is the game for you, otherwise I recommend parents of preschoolers get Cranium Cariboo instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fun game","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers; this game is bad.

We didn't notice it right away and my daughter cut her finger. Didn't need stitches but it was a deep and long cut. I then inspected the other handles and see that one other one had a visible crack and you can feel the edge raising a bit. Unlike most of the other handles in the faucets at my house, these don't look like they screw on. I'll have to shut off the water and pull the fixture out. I tried finding the company online, and they have been sold recently and all I can find is an address and phone number. I'll call them, but from other reviews I've found on the Web it seems likely I'll be on the phone a long time. I don't know that it is worth it. Better to just write it off and never buy from the company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"We like it!","review":"My daughter, 3, really loves these games and can now play them by herself from start to finish. It's all very intuitive, so she can easily move from activity to activity.

When the DVD rom in their computer malfunctioned it somehow managed to break the disk that was in the drive... her Dora game. My daughter has since replaced the DVD rom and I just had to get Naomi another Dora game. She loves it!!

The plot was pretty good and fast moving (almost too fast at times). Unlike a lot of books, this one kept my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Depiction of Chem/Bio Terrorism","review":"The book boldly explores the freightening world of chemical and biological terrorism. It is action packed, beginning with the raid on the Army chemical weapons depot to the attack at the Olympics to the National Guard response. There is a fascinating subplot occuring in Bosnia that also ties in with the incident. The characters are well-chosen with specialized skills that neatly round out the book. It definitely made me a believer that the threat is real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy It's Not","review":"The idea could have made a geat book, but the author just couldn't pull it off. The book has way too many typos and grammatical errors. There was no character development. The plot jumps and never grabs your attention. The only reason I actually read the entire thing is that I work at the facility that is destroying the Utah Chemical Weapons stockpile and was curious. Otherwise, this one would have been abandoned after 20 pages. Don't waste your money. In addition, the book contains significant technical errors. There are no GB (sarin) mines; GB is odorless and colorless; it does not hang around in a mist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential plot disappointingally developed","review":"The plot is pretty good and there are some great descriptions of the effect that Sarin has on humans (although the same description is repeated several times), but . . . The plot moves way to fast and there is no character development. A realistic plot but weakly written. The research was lacking a little. I live in Salt Lake City, grew up here, and will be involved in emergency operations at the Olympic games and I found a lot of the geography to be incorrect (e.g. the opening ceremonies taking place at the Delta Center instead of Rice Stadium, the ski events at \\"Snow Mountain\\" in Cottonwood Canyon instead of at Snow Basin in Ogden, where is Copper County?). I get the impression that the author got the idea for the story and was in a hurry to get the book out before the games, rather than actually writing a good novel. I wish Clancy had written it because the plot had so much potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"New type of mystery.","review":"I never thought about how \\"game wardens\\"could get involved in murder and mayhem. This series is a new perspective on crime and criminals. I will read all the books offered in the series. CO Service is a good, down-to-earth type of cop who cares about his job and carreer.

It's true, this way of cooking will require more planning on your part, but it was still a lot of fun. Actually, it was more fun cooking this way than other methods I'm used to. I imagine as I become more familiar with this way of cooking it will become much easier. While I've only made a few of the recipes so far, I have to say they were the best tasting meals I have ever prepared.

Maybe if I were Amish! In addition to being expensive and taking forever to arrive, this cookbook was just too much work and hassle. It took all weekend to make about three recipes due to the author's lengthy soaking and fermentation times in her recipes. The stuff I tried wasn't that incredibly tasty and the banana bread made me feel ill( maybe it isn't a good idea to let the batter sit out overnight.)

Recommending animal products and discouraging vegetarian lifestyles is exactly what puts readers' health, as well as our environment, in danger time and time again. I found out that Fallon's organization, the Weston Price foundation, is composed of \\"farmers\\" who sell and profit off of animal parts and fluids. That is exactly why they are so anti-vegan and anti-soy.

My second attempt was as bad as the first, and according to one of the online forums I found, I'm not the only one who's had trouble. I like the ideas behind many of the book's suggestions but putting them into practice made for very flawed results. The Banana Bread overflowed the pan and over-browned on the top without ever cooking through. The Breakfast Pastries were so wet, even after adding more and more flour, that rolling them was a joke. Then they just dissolved into very flat cookies, but considering the recipe didn't call for any rising agent, what else could be expected? It's like whoever wrote these recipes never even tested them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science in your Kitchen","review":"This book by Sally Fallon has a lot of great information. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in high quality nutrition. Unfortunately, most of her recipes are extremely bland and fermented fruits and vegetables are pretty much inedible in this day and age. Unless she's prepared to come into your kitchen and prove that her foods can possibly taste satisfactory, be prepared for a wealth of information and some fun inedible science experiements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"What a dreadful book. I bought this book at the beginning of last year and took on the books advice due to ill health. I have suffered even more illness because of it - my cholesterol levels have sky rocketed, I feel tired all the time and I can't sleep properly at night. I also suffered a stroke mid January. My doctor is terribly disappointed because I ignored her advice to eat less meat products and those yummy fatty foods. I was in fantasy land when I thought that this book would solve my health problems!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"One friend told me to get this book when I talked about going to raw foods. Another friend said she thought it would help her with intestinal yeast overgrowth. Both friends were wrong. For someone on the Standard American Diet (SAD), to follow the precepts in this book would certainly be an improvement. But for someone who already knows not to eat processed foods and wants to go vegan or raw vegan, or get rid of chronic yeast overgrowth, there are better books out there: For vegan wannabes or anyone who wants info on juicing, The Hallelujah Diet by George Malkmus has it all, the why, the what, the when and the how. If this diet doesn't also get your intestinal yeast overgrowth repaired, there's always The Body Ecology Diet by Donna Gates."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far I've bought 3 of these","review":"This book will change the way you think about food and about the American diet. It is not only a cookbook. You are really getting two books in one. The outside edges of each page are full of research facts and tidbits of information about either the recipe on the page or the ingredients. I find myself reading it over and over because it is so full of information I have a hard time taking it all in.Linda A"},{"rating":"2","title":"great resource","review":"I am really enjoying this book, both for the recipes and the extensive information in it. Most of the recipes are really good, I give it 4 stars because sometimes the instructions are not very clear and there are a few recipes that are not very good as written. But a great starting off point for changing my diet and I rely heavily on this as a base for all my cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a wonderful book full of nutritional nuggets and wonderful recipes. The book really debunks the current view of nutrition with all it's low fat and fat free nonsense and instead emphasis cooking with food in its non processed state. There is a lot of prep time involved and I am getting used to thinking and shopping ahead. An example of prep time is soaking grains, legumes for 12 to 24 hours and marinating meats for 7 to 24 hours. I am planning on making my own stocks from meat bones soon. There is also a wonderful section on sprouting.After over 40 years of cooking plain dishes for my family, I am learning to cook in a more gourmet fashion and really enjoying it. I have experienced no weight gain from cooking this way which is really important to me. This could be because there is absolutely no sugar, white flour, white pastas or white rice products used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reclaim your health one meal at a time.","review":"Nourishing Traditions provides recipes and reasons, not only for personal health but for the health of the planet.

Study report findings, research of ancient cultures' food habits, and good common sense all rolled into one facinating, easy to read guide to food. If you've ever heard about or bought kefir, kombucha, or fermented vegetables, but just didn't know how to make your own, this is your book. Step by step instructions will have you mastering them all quickly. This book is by far one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Cookbook","review":"I love this cookbook.

I refer to this cookbook frequently and definitely use it more than any other, but it is also fun to just read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the message, contents too much","review":"I would have liked to know how detailed the book goes into using strictly organic foods. I wanted something more simple, and it's always better with pictures. The basic concepts and how they are written makes for good reading and education indeed. I love the cover, it is a great book to set out, but how many of those can I use. Unfortunately I regret buying this book because I will not use it.

Most people assume whole foods are better, but don't really know why or which ones to eat. This book is sprinkled with many food lessons from history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common sense approach","review":"An excellent overview of basic nutritional information. Although the authors are followers of the Weston Price model, the actual biochemical information about how nutrients are metabolized is sound. It's refreshing to read a book that actually offers a solution to the on-going diet debate. It really goes back to basics--the diets our grandparents were eating. One can start a little at a time with the whole food program and modify as confidence increases. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about a sensible nutrition program. It was a real eye-opener to read about how foods we take for granted as being \\"natural\\" such as butter, eggs, milk, meats, fruits and vegetables are manipulated, engineered, enhanced, and fortified and are nothing resembling the same foods our ancestors ate just a couple of generations ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of lesser known, but valuable information","review":"The chapters are easily accessible in this book and it is easy to find what you are looking for. Some interesting items I did not know include: Nuts need to be soaked overnight (12 hours)and then dried out in the oven at 100 degrees. This neutralizes enzymes in them that inhibit digestion. It also makes them taste wonderful. (So far we have done almonds and pecans. Oh it works at 170 degrees also as that's the lowest our oven will go.)The authors challenge many food myths and they explain why in enough detail that even this relative newcomer to healthy cooking is adequately educated. The book is also written simply enough that you do not have to be a food scientist or nutritionist to use it. Excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and informative","review":"Fascinating and informative, this book is a common-sense look at eating that advises a return to traditional eating.

After you read this book you should check out the Weston A. Price Foundation website for updates and ongoing articles related to the book's material. Then for a new spin on the same foundational research you should read William Wolcott's Metabolic Typing Diet which takes Weston Price, Pottenger and others' research and applies them in a very sensible way to help you eat your way to wellness.

I was 30 pages into the book and there were already over 75 citations to scientific research studies backing up the things being said about the food industry and modern diets.

This book has some very interesting and relatively easy to follow recipes. (If you feel intimidated, I recommend starting with a couple things, such as the chicken stock to get your feet wet.)

I am now confident about my food choices and preparation tecniques. Sally Fallon explains what is good for my health and why....and all the recipes I have tried thus far have been fabulous! I have learned how to make the foods I love more nutritious and flavorfull. Things I have not been able to eat for years because of food intolerances I now can enjoy.

Im enjoying the book, except for the raw meat chapter, its not really my thing, personally. But overall, most of the recipes are from different cultures and folk. I enjoy the side bars which are full of interesting articles.One thing I didnt like is the recipe for the Russian 'Kvass'. Her recipe takes a month to prepare/ferment.

She explains the fallacy of eating too much (and the wrong kinds) of carbohydrates. As you read through this book, you really get a good idea as to why bad nutritional information is ubiquitous in western societies and consequently, why we maintain such poor diets. Believe it or not, but the main cause of obesity in western culture today is our inability to get the nutritionally dense foods that our bodies crave. Instead, we try to sate our hunger with all of the wrong things.

As a professional head chef with 20 years experience on the line, I defy anyone to actually eat the dishes created from these horrible recipes.

I purchased this book in an attempt to find good recipes for cooking breads, whole grains and organ meats (liver recipes are difficult to find in everyday cookbooks). I could not find one. If you like food, do not get this book. There are other books out there with far better recipes for everything. I tried several in this book with limited success. And I am no rookie in the kitchen.

Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Some of the info in this book is correct, but enough is wrong to warrant not buying it. For example, the emphasis on dairy. Research consistently shows that dairy is not healthy for humans. Sally Fallon isn't a scientist, she's as likely to be misinformed as we are.

This book advocates eating raw meat, full cream butter/milk, lots of fatty dairy products. It belongs to a time when men where men and women cooked in the kitchen. And real men hunted and killed their own meat. There have been numerous studies linking the kind of diet this book recommends to bad health. If you want a proper book on eating backed up with proper scientific studies then I would highly recommend 'The China Study' by Dr. T. Colin Campbell.

It claims to have scientific support for the most ridiculous claims that I have ever heard. It is a bizarre mixture of Atkins and neanderthal diets and wants us all to live on raw meat and fermented milk. The \\"scientific\\" evidence is drawn from extremely poor media sources. Where even fringe science can't be found to support her claims the author discards decades of work by real scientists and makes vague statements that \\"the evidence supports\\" her ideas without any citation. Good studies are occasionally used but she is just as likely to discard balanced, well-designed studies in favour of a single unrepeatable finding or the evidence of Kirlian photography. Picking and choosing in this fashion allows you to make whatever sweeping claims you want.

So when my brother gave me this CD I was surprised at how quickly I came to love it.I know absolutely nothing about Chucho but apparently he is one of the \\"heavy hitters\\" of jazz. Most of songs are piano driven and there is a great mix of slow smooth songs and frantic piano playing. Some of the songs sound like salsa and none are ever boring which is usually the problem for me with jazz. There is some singing but it's mostly instrumental.I would recommend this CD to the non-jazz fan looking for something different. This CD is great anywhere and also makes good background music. It's the type of thing you might hear and enjoy (but not recognize) in a coffee house or bookstore.Bottom Line: A good intro and some serious genre transcending jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upbeat and exciting","review":"Firstly, I can't understand why some reviewers are complaining about the sound quality. I think the sound is amazing, on both my little portable cd player as well as my big surround sound system. This is my first introduction to Chucho, and I simply love it. The wonderful latin percussion and rythmn, as well as the fire and energy emanating from Chucho's brilliant piano playing. Track 6 \\"Drume Negrita\\", Chucho's sister, Mayra Caridad Valdes, joins in with a stunning vocal. I really cannot say enough good things about this album. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what's wrong with the recording engineers at Blue Note?","review":"The good news is that Chucho Valdes put some very interesting latin-flavored jazz songs on this CD. Based solely on the songs on the CD I would give this CD 4 or 5 stars. Unfortunately, the sound quality of this CD is extremely poor in comparison to other CDs: the sound is extremely muted and lacking in energy, clarity and sound stage. Compared to vibrant live recordings, like \\"Dee Dee Bridgewater Live at Yoshi's,\\" you have to wonder what's wrong with the folks at Blue Note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get excited about this!","review":"Funny, I went to see Chucho at the Vanguard last fall and although this CD is from his spring performance there, I was terribly disappointed in this music. If this is your first introduction to Chucho, you may be impressed, but if you have ever heard him live, or listened to virtually anything else he has ever done, this is a great letdown. This appears to simply be a way that someone found to take advantage of his popularity. For the record, I have seen Chucho perform live at the Vanguard, Bluenote, Carnegie Hall, and on and on; I have met the artist and, notwithstanding, cannot recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Quality Stinks","review":"I bought this CD when it first came out a few years ago. Something didn't click; it just didn't sound right. As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the problem is with the recording quality, which sounds very muted.Although I am a huge fan of Chucho, I gave this CD to a friend. I just got mad every time I heard it, wanting it to sound good.If the record company were to remaster the CD and improve the sound quality, this CD would be a terrific addition to your collection.Oh, and it would even be better without the vocal track featuring Chucho's sister. . . but that's just my bias against vocals in latin jazz records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality.","review":"A couple of prior reviewers have it right on: the sound quality of this CD stinks.It's a shame and waste of the band's talent and skill. Live on stage, these folk are wonderful. Too bad the recording technicians screwed up.It's just that there is something wrong with the sound quality of this CD. I bought it despite the warning from the prior reviewers, and regret spending my money on it.

Don't get me wrong, I'm pleased with these loppers but when you compare them to other brands, there are some notable differences. I own a pair of Fred Marvin loppers of similar size and I prefer the Marvins to the Felcos. The Marvin loppers open much wider to handle larger branches. The Felco loppers have a different type of angle and because of that they don't seem to be able to open as wide. They open so narrowly, they're almost like hand pruners with long handles. In any case, I do like these loppers. They are very durable and they cut nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for someone","review":"The recipient of this Felco was jut thrilled.

Guess what it looks like? People are fatter, trees are wider, buildings are lower and longer, etc. The viewer gets their first warning of this problem during the opening titles when you can see that the sides are cut off and the complete credits are not readable.

The characters are so [sad] it's extremely frustrating to read. I could not read it page by page---one week felt like twelve years. I can't imagine a more disappointing romance. Buyer beware.Try Scarlet Feather by Maeve Binchy or anything by Pilcher for a well-written romance in this genre. Give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative five","review":"This is the kind of novel that gives the genre of women's fiction a bad name. Like Selina, one of the main characters, the book is shallow and manipulative. The so-called mystery upon which the plot depends has a solution that's obvious from the beginning. Most of the book is taken up with descriptions of houses and the antics of an over-sized dog. And the author's view of human beings is sit-com superficial, with all the enforced happy endings that such a view demands.The publisher wants you to believe that Willett is the equal of Maeve Binchy and Rosamund Pilcher. That's just not true. Skip this one and re-read The Shell Seekers instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rosamunde Pilcher wannabee","review":"This book was weak in all ways, I was disappointed to say the least. The characters were overly exaggerated in either their evil ways or their goodness. Having read a lot of books from England, Ireland, etc. I can say that the only British things about this book was that they occasionally drank tea, and their location. The plot ties up in a highly improbable way and still leaves things unfinished. My advice (if anyone cares) is stick with Rosamunde Pilcher... she is a sip of a hearty ale, versus a sip of light beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful British women's novel!","review":"I discovered Marcia Willett in our public library last year (they had one British edition of an earlier book of hers) and just loved it! Being an avid Rosamunde Pilcher fan, she fit the bill for my taste in reading. I eventually ordered all her other novels from amazon.co.uk, as none were available in this country till now. I am so glad to see her books starting to be published in this country as well. If you like Pilcher, you will definitely like Willett. I think that some of her other books are actually a bit better than A Week in Winter, but this one was quite enjoyable too. I am looking forward to more of her books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It started off seeming like a good story. I recommeded it to a friend.

Personally, I am currently using this book as a companion to the bible study written by Kay Arthur which also concerns different names of God.

Technically poor, mostly boring, mediocre performances from the actors, confusing and not accurate. Hector Babenco sure has done better things, such as Ironweed, Pixote or The Kiss of the Spider Woman. This movie could have been at least more honest on telling us the whole story about the police and immates clash at the Carandiru prison, which of course, wasn't motivated by a fight during a soccer game, and everybody who's informed about the events knows that, huh Hector? Instead of telling us the real story, Hector Babenco prefered to serve us with a stupid and inaccurate politically correct version of the things. HIS biased version of the things. It's more like watching a fiction movie. An awful fiction movie, I must add.Not worthy watching or renting this piece of junk. Don't waste your time or money with this, I regret wasting mine.

(City of God,((about life in the slums of Brazil)) is one of the best movies you will ever see/real-to-life/with DVD option to see real footage). Powerful/natural acting/doesn't even seem like they're acting.When you view the documentary, you'll see that their characters were true to life, 100%.

This is a little underproduced compared to Bridge of Sighs but is still a classic. It was only available for a long time as one of the two on one cds (with Bridge of Sighs on same cd) and then that went out of print. I guess if you want the debut of a master musician, this is it.This would be better for the fan that is already familiar with Trower and just wants a new copy for prosperity or whatever; the new fan may be better off with \\"The Essential Robin Trower\\" as more of an overview of Robin Trower.Solid playing on solid songs, no nonsense and yes, for those that don't know, if there are any, it is derivative of Hendrix.

Since it came out in 1973 this is as good as a cd can get when it compares to my vinyl versions of the 1970's. I am the biggest fan of Robin Trower, on the planet. This is a must have unless you have a mint vinyl, good turntable and great stereo. This still may be better for a lot of technical reasons, very good bottom end for a older recording.

There isn't a bad song on it really. They are all different unlike a lot of crap that's passing for rock these days. Has a very ethereal spacey sound to it. No I don't think it sounds like Hendrix whatsoever. I get tired of hearing that comparison or accusations that Trower is imitating Hendrix. Isn't so in my book. So would I recommend this CD? You bet. It's a must have for any Robin Trower fan period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trower's First Album & One Of His Best","review":"This was Robin Trower's first solo release and it's one of his best. It's not quite up to the level of his tour de force, Bridge of Sighs, but it's still an album that's worth having.If you're not familiar with Robin Trower, he was one of the best guitarists of the 1970s. He's still active and his latest album The Playful Heart retains his place amongst the best guitarists around. Jimi Hendrix was one of his influences and that Hendrix influence is quite obvious on Trower's first two albums, Twice Removed From Yesterday and Bridge of Sighs.If you like electric guitar virtuosity, Robin Trower's first two albums should be in your music collection.Robin Trower seems to be overlooked these days, which is unfortunate since he's still putting out great music. His latest album The Playful Heart is excellent.If you're not familiar with Robin Trower's 1970s work, start with his second album, Bridge of Sighs.

Rozz is emotive and powerful throughout the performance, so it is definately a worthy addition for any fan. The music is more rock-oriented than dark and melancholy. The sound quality slightly pales in comparison to the Triple X Records release, \\"Iconologia\\", and the deletion of the Christian Death songs performed during this show is a disappointment.

It is absolutely wounderful to hear the fantastic voice of this beautiful woman sing pop, blues, balads, R&B with absolute domain of her great voice. The thing that impresed me more about this album is the way in wich Myriam imprints her feelings in each of her songs. \\"Mi ni?o\\" made me cry, \\"?Como ser��a?\\" gave me such melancholy, \\"Me hice Mujer\\" filled me with tenderness, \\"Coraz��n sin due?o\\" gave me strenght and \\"Cuesta arriba\\" gave me the chills, and her first single \\"Sin ti no hay nada\\" is in my mind all day.

THE MUSIC SOUNDS SO SO SO OLD AND AS ONE PERSON SAID IN ITS REVIEW, IT SEEMS LIKE MYRIAM IS SINGING WHEN SHE IS DRUNK AND HEART BROKEN, I WAS WAITING FOR SOMETHING BETTER FROM HER BUT SADLY, THIS IS JUST ONE MORE PLASTIC ARTIST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This singer got her start on the widely popular \\"La Academia\\" series on Mexican television (comparable to American Idol), however, as other competitions ensued, her popularity faded and her fan base marginalized. I don't recommend this album as it features covers in its large majority and the vocal stylings of this amateur are comparable to an agonizing sea terne. Spend your money elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!! A WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I bought this CD cause it had great reviews, but I honestly do not know what people are thinking when they recommend it. Myriam is a housewife-at-karioke-on-friday-night-with-a-few-tequilas-and-a-broken-heart at best. She has absolutely NO talent at all and I would now recommend it to my worst enemy. All songs on this CD are poor attempts at singing, and barely reach a mediocre standard. If I were you and you are looking to find some good spanish music, look for Alex Ubago or Ana Gabriel, or if you are a die-hard fan of La Academia, the best bet is Yahir, who not only has original songs, but also performs amazingly well for a newcomer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Work Out of the Box","review":"The tubing that comes with this fountain doesn't match the pump provided, nor is it long enough to stretch from the pump to the top of the fountain pot. Fortunately, a good friend took the tubing and pump to the local hardware store. He bought longer tubing of the correct size and also clamps to hold the connections in place. Now it runs just fine. Not something you just plug-and-run, sorry to say. But once you have it up and running, it works fine. You can change the type of \\"burble\\" noise it produces with rock placed in the splash tank. (Now I have to figure out what plants to put in the pot itself.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!","review":"So when I bought this movie I thought I was making a good choice... oh how wrong I was... I found that this movie was very slow paced and was rather boring... now to fully understand the film, one must know something about argentine society because there are a lot a subtle critics about corruption etc... I was fully aware of these allusions as I've travelled and lived in Argentina, but it simply didn't help... this movie only had a few scences that were of any interest. I saw this movie for the first (and last) time with a group of about 10 friends, and at least 5 people fell asleep. There are so many wonderful Argentine films out there.... but this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wipes, great product carrier","review":"These wipes are just wonderful. You need a few of them to stash around for when you need a moist wipe in a hurry. I had one in the car glovebox, in the diaper bag, and on each floor in addition to my wipe warmer. The package is just the right size to have for the \\"just in cases\\" that always seem to come up. These make wonderful shower gifts since you can reuse them over and over again with the refillable packages. They are great life savers and keep you have having to run all over the house looking for a wipe for emergencies. Gotta love that! Once the diaper stage is over, keep one in your purse for wiping up after meals out, days at the park, etc. Great product idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good container...very dry wipes","review":"I was very unhappy with the quality of these wipes. They are a nice thickness but far too dry. I would not recommend the wipes at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your paying for a box","review":"I don't get it, the soft pack travel wipes have 30-40 wipes. This hard pack only has 16 wipes. For the same price with the soft package you get 2x as many wipes. I don't think 16 wipes is enough to even get through the day if you're traveling.These are soft flexible wipes that won't get damaged, why do they need to be in a hard case anyway? The soft pack will hold them just fine and takes up less space. Plus with a soft pack you can feel how many wipes are left by squeezing it.It seems to be that this is a product where you are just paying for packaging and not product. Some executive needed to come up with a new product to sell and this was the junk he came up with. It's a complete waste of money and in no way functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"75 year old baby","review":"Due to a recent diagnosis, my internist recommended Huggies Natural Care wipes instead of toilet paper.

I would not recommend this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"Overall this is a very bad quality album and if you listen to just one of the sample clips you'll see why.

Their reconciliation at the end is completely unsatisfying. Re-read \\"Sweet Savage Love\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, read something else.","review":"I probably read hundreds of romance novels. The general formula is: handsome man finds beautiful woman; they have some conflict with each other but they can't help falling in love with each other. During this whole time, they are monogamous. At the end, something life-threatening happens to one of them and they declare their eternal love. This book is NOT a romance novel at all. This MARRIED couple fights during the entire book and sleeps with multiple partners without any care for fidelity or just self-respect. They are both despicable and frankly their reconciliation at the end is very unconvincing. This was a waste of my time!Instead of this author, try Jude Devereux, Johana Lindsey, or Judity McNaught. You'll have far better written romance novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD really swings.","review":"When i first got interested in Big Bands, Charlie Barnets Orchestra was one of my favorite's .

I really like the song Cae La Noche. The two balads; Sentimiento de Amor, and Yo Se Que Tu Estas Aqui are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price!","review":"I received this as a gift when my daughter was born and have used it since. There are no \\"chemical\\" smells in the fragrance, and the fragrance itself is subtle. The cream is very thick, so a little goes a long way and you get your money's worth. I like being able to read the ingredients and know what most of them are because they are plant based, and not long chemical names that I can't pronounce.My daughter has sensitive skin, and this product has not irritated her skin. We use it as an all over body cream for after her baths, and as a diaper cream.Again, a little goes a long way, as you will see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey, but good stuff","review":"Granted, our baby has never had a diaper rash, so I can't say if it would work well enough under that circumstance. You might want to get the heavy duty zinc oxide stuff for that. But for everyday use, this cream is nice. It's very soft and smooth, spreads very easily, and if you get some on your hand you'll think you were using a fancy hand cream. It has little if any smell, and the smell isn't medicinal, which is a plus in getting my husband to change the diapers. Yes, it's expensive, but my infant seems to like its soothing properties and she poops A LOT, so that's important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change in product formula","review":"Beware that the decades old formula (manufactured in the United States, yellow in color, with a sweet smell) for this lovely cream is no longer available. The company is now using instead the formula from its German manufacturer, which is white in color and has a medicinal odor. The new cream seems to do the job, but it's a more run-of-the-mill product, its special character gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the product advertised...","review":"Not the product advertised, not the product I ordered. This is a different cream from the same company, Weleda, and is often confused but I thought Amazon would have better quality control and service than this.

But it does, it really works! When I put this one on, they tend to settle into their beds and go to sleep or just look out the window. I love the music too. I like it better than any CD I've bought for MY relaxation. Definitely a must for your musical library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Near worthless","review":"It looks nice but you are better off just squeezing the food item with your hand.

I have been attending bluegrass shows, and buying bluegrass albums for 40 years, and I have never in my life seen such an incredible show. Take 8 songs off this CD, and four off their Bluegrass Vagabonds CD, and you will have the best bluegrass singing CD you can get. There are a lot of great pickers around, and Cherryholmes has really good ones, especially on banjo and fiddle (their double fiddling gives their sound a special appeal), but most groups have only one style of bluegrass singing. Cherryholmes has four or five combinations, and a couple good leads. And amazing stage presence. This CD is nominated for a Grammy, and it is easy to see why. An absolute must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, even better in person. Highly recommended.","review":"An excellent CD, filled with a great new song set and beautiful family harmonizing that can't be beat. It may be even better than their previous CD, \\"Bluegrass Vagabonds\\". I saw them at the Central Virginia Bluegrass Festival in Amelia, VA and they were great live. I highly recommend seeing them in person if you get the opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a horror story&#65533;","review":"This book is about more than just vampires. It's about a time and a place; the confused, lost society of the 80's. The House of Caine is about people searching for meaning, order and identity in that era. What makes this book interesting is reading between the lines, looking for the metaphors planted there by the author. Ken Eulo is known for giving his tales multiple meanings, and this book does not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic parts","review":"I would never buy a Sony product like this again.

More than a 4, almost a 5!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a crap TV movie","review":"A blend of fantasy and sci-fi give this little indie what little lift it has. The theme is a search for the meaning of life. There's a bargain with the devil, of course, and that comprises most of the movie. The acting is pretty bad throughout, and many of the scenes were shot on the same streets in Manhattan's meatpacking district before it became gentrified. This is a pre-9/11 film, so we also see the World Trade towers. I found the whole thing a bit tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"really?","review":"This movie is like a very very very bad play- the story is nice, but the directing and acting performances are as bad as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal for the Bucko's","review":"I already own a ball bearing pointed center but wanted a live cup center to make it easy to recenter the work.

I was at SEMP (know it?) in Costa Mesa, CA, and there was only one copy. I thought the cover art was cool, so I listened to it. I didn't take off my headphones for 3 days straight. I don't really know how to describe their sound, but I guess it would be called grunge with a little bit of acoustic rock thrown in. These guys have the most passionate lyrics I've ever heard. The best song is \\"Never the Less\\", a yearning, kinda slow ballad. \\"Bring Me In\\" and \\"Own Devices\\" are also great- they illustrate some real struggles. I also like \\"Life in Eve's Time\\"- the chorus is \\"Pushing my way out/I'm shaken, I'm shaken.../Picking up the pieces to survive\\". Overall, the best CD I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is horrible","review":"I really, really, do not like this CD at all. In fact, I plan on throwing it out tonight.

Batman has no idea what he's about to be in for.A good comic; you can almost feel Croc's body break as you read it! Be warned; this is just the clam before the storm - and perhaps the most tragic downfall of a hero since the 'death' of Superman (perhaps more-so)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute pictures and story","review":"I remembered this book from when I was a child and just recently my mother gave it to my daughter. It is still just as adorable and delightful as it was then. Little critter tries so hard to find some way to give something to his mother, but keeps \\"messing it up\\". Of course we know, as Little Critter finds out the love of a child is reward enough for any mother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just for you","review":"The kid tried something for his mother and every time he did something for his mother he screwed up on it.

We like it so much that I've given several copies as gifts to nieces & nephews. My son loves the artwork (there's a lot to look at on each page) & the story isn't too long for wordy for his gnat-like attention span. When my son picks out a book for me to read to him, 9 out of 10 times it's a Little Critter story (usually this one, Just Shopping with Mom, or Just Me & My Dad)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My face is normally oily is most parts ...","review":"My face is normally oily is most parts and dry in some.

I have a copy of the \\"Legend of Bigfoot\\" on several other sets and would have liked to see something different instead included. \\"The Capture of Bigfoot\\" is probably the most entertaining of the bunch for me. However, I would like to have seen more of the creature. It is a nice little bigfoot feature for those who like to watch these movies. \\"Shriek of the Mutilated\\" is hilarious and rather poorly done. The creature is laughable, though, there is more to it then initially meets the eye. \\"Search for the Beast\\" is just terrible. There is little focus or direction and many things seemed to be included to simply increase the run time.

The reason I give this collection 1 star is because it was put together by the corporate powers that be for 2 reasons. #1 They knew many folks would not want to pay the $50 for the six CDs, so they released this compilation, gauranteeing them big $$$. #2 They included the DVD in this compilation only, because they knew that the real fans who shelled out the $50 for the 6 CD version would also go out and buy this so they could get the DVD...How's that for a corporate strategy!?!?!

And how can you possibly get off on it any longer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, pretty good","review":"This is a great album, but I feel that some of the tracks lack the energy that Dave Matthews Band can have when they're at their best. Since \\"Everyday\\" was not my favorite album, I was somewhat disappointed to hear a few of the songs from that album on this one. It was nice to have a live recording of \\"The Song That Jane Likes\\" since none of their previous live releases include this song. The DVD that comes with this album is awesome. The tracks are great, and the footage of the Gorge Amphitheatre is incredible; it is now my goal to see DMB there one of these days! This is a worthwhile buy for anyone who enjoys Dave Matthews Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of The Gorge","review":"Yes, it is quite hard to really sit down and watch this dvd, due to the constantly moving camera angles.

I honestly don't get it at all. Stay with the shot for a while, for crying out loud. Most edits are one second or less.The sound is good to me, and I haven't even heard the cds yet. It's really not a 1 star purchase, by any means. I am a big DMB fan, and would have bought it anyway, but don't expect a chance to really see the band. It's all about the editor, imho.

Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to the real thing as you can get.","review":"As one of the lucky 20,000 attendees of the Friday show captured on this album, I can say with certainty that this set captures the feel of the band's live performance like no other. The sound clarity is crisp and accurate while still capturing the cheers and ambient noise of the crowd, giving it a sense of reality rare in a live concert CD. However, I highly recommend purchasing the full 6 disc set from the band's website as it includes the entire three day concert from beginning to end with all commentary and encores. Although, Dave's notorious 10 minute smoke breaks between songs appear to have been edited out (thank god). This is a set you can throw in the changer, light up sone \\"incense\\", close your eyes and really believe you're laying on the grass of the ampitheater overlooking the beautiful landscape and enjoying a world class live concert. Yes Dave, \\"Heaven's Ampitheater\\" it truly is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally awesum Cd (and dvd) for anyone!!!","review":"This new Dave Matthews CD is great!!!

It mounted up easily enough with the multitude of hardware that was included, though at the end of the day it really didn't remove much thatch and did a great job scalping the lawn. After running the blade at a slow speed (mower loping at idle) in an inconspicuous place, I borrowed a Bluebird dethatcher to do the whole lawn with.

I love the Black Jewels series, but even in that series I was a little underwhelmed with how Bishop got rid of the bad queens.You see more depravity from the inquisitors in this book. In fact, it's even more sickening and heartbreaking. While reading it, I kept thinking, \\"man I want at least a good 5 pages of them getting everything they have coming to them.\\" I was extremely disappointed. This book lacked redemption and it did not leave me happy. Most characters meet their mates in this book, but because there are so many people that pop up in this series, you get maybe one line or a paragraph saying \\"oh they are now lovers.\\" It fell flat. Again, I'm going to go back to the first book and restate that Bishop created Lucian who I thought would be a character with more depth and interest than Neall, but she chose to demonize him for the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story of Mystery and Magic","review":"If you love good fantasy, well developed characters that aren't perfect and a writing style that absorbs you into the story, this is a great series by Anne Bishop. Things are not as they seem at first and an unlikely character can help save their world from being destroyed by those who would control and manipulate in a battle of not only light and dark but male and female and the tensions and desires between the two. This is a fantastic story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Black Jewels clone.","review":"After thoroughly enjoying \\"The Black Jewels\\" novels I was delighted to see that Anne Bishop had released another series. The Tir Alainn Trilogy is perhaps not as entertaining as her earlier novels but still worth reading. Anne Bishop discloses a slightly more serious side in this novel and her characters are not quite as sympathetic as the \\"Black Jewels\\" family. She has tried to flesh out her new characters by making them more tragic and bleak (a Shakespearian effort) but has missed building our empathy and involvement in them and their story by a fine margin. House of Gaian (and the Tir Alainn Trilogy) is still vintage Anne Bishop and far better than her later efforts of \\"Sebastion\\" and Belladonna\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Paean for Gaian","review":"What happened to Bishop? I loved her Black Jewels series, but this one seems like a regression. Was this her first novel? The characters are stiff or annoying, the plot too conceptual and obvious. The Back Jewels stories are creative, complex and interesting. She minimizes the boring black/bad vs. white/good split. For example, her twist of usually \\"evil\\" names used for places, and for characters who are often more good than bad. The Gaian story is simplistic and predictable. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant ... very entertaining","review":"Although I haven't yet read the first book Pillars of the World, I have read The House of Gaian and Shadows & Light ... the last book in the trilogy is wonderful. Anne Bishop is able to explain the relationship between the Fae and the witches, and give us more about their history. The book is filled with little comics, some romance, and the preparation of war. The reader is compelled to keep reading, its really hard to put down. Absolutely wonderful, I would definately recommend this triology to others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like!","review":"Bishop keeps going!

I think Anne Bishop is a wonderful writer who really captures you and pulls you into her stories. This whole trilogy was just as great as the Black Jewels trilogy, which i also strongly recommend.

I love the way Anne Bishop writes I could read her books over and over. The book had a great blend of humor and suspense. I wanted more storyline on some of the characters but the book seemed to drop them. Ari was not in this book much which was too bad, I like her character. The book left an opening for another book or a spinoff.

I recently started eating salmon and I must say this book has wonderful recipes with clear instructions of dishes that I would be confident to serve at a dinner party to wow my guests. The ingredient lists are relatively short, but there is no compromise on flavour. Peterson lays a lot of emphasis on texture and the marriage of ingredients.No wax paper for papillote? He tells you how to do it with foil. His explanations and alternative methods are meticulous in detail.The great pictures are a bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I find it very hard to buy cookbooks sight unseen, and unfortunately I am not so pleased with this one. The positive reviews along with the book preview made me think I might like it, but it just isn't what I was looking for. Although it shows some photos of the completed dishes, it lacks many. I was looking for healthy ways to cook the Salmon without salt and oil added, but this book is at a loss for that. Some of the comments made by the author were not well received such as \\"Giving exact directions on how to do this is next to impossible because everyone's oven is different, oven thermostats are unreliable, and it's very hard to come up with a salmon the exact weight you need for a particular recipe.\\" Although I took a few cooking tips from the book, it is unlikely that I will be preparing any of these recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aldous Huxley Review","review":"This book is a must have for anyone even vaguely interested in comments and essays from the most brilliant minds of the 20th century. Aldous Huxley is definitely at the top of this list. His interests and essays span all aspects of human nature, politics, sociology, films, politics and the list goes on. You have to get past the stigma which normal critics have placed on his work and (like Tesla) actually read his works with an open and nonjudgmental mind. His views will challenge your perception of the everyday world we live in and the influences which are pushed at us from every aspect of mass media. Huxley had quite a variety of views so I would suggest to anyone to read his works. Most readers too easily discard his works after reading only one article or two.

I was amused by this young, attractive Holmes. In most of Doyle's stories Holmes is a young man, even though most actors who portray him are much older.

This is the Holmes the BBC should have done as a man of action rather than the latest version of the Hound of the Baskervilles with Richard Roxborough.

The language was awful, thoughts flying back and forth, ignoring the titles of chapters. Some of the concepts are facinating, but if anything, this book turns me away from synchronicity, because of its incoherence. This kind of writing is not scientific enough.

I purchased a Sorby bowl gouge & scraper, and the quality of the steel in the Sorbies is far beyond that of these Delta tools. What do I mean by quality? The HSS in the Sorbies will not blue, it holds an edge much better, and the edge is sharper. This adds up to a much more enjoyable turning experience.

They STILL snap, crackle, pop, hiss, and fade in and out despite the TERK-1000 firmly attached. Apparently, it is an unrepairable characteristic of AM signals that they become garbage at night, and NO antenna will help you with that, even this good-looking, tunable home AM antenna.If you listen to AM in the daytime then you can use this antenna.

I read the reviews, and even Bose recommended this item. However, it made zero difference for me. On the Wave Radio, at least my model, there is no way to connect this amplified antenna to the radio for better AM reception. It has to be used in wireless mode. It did not help at all. I'll just have to tolerate static and fuzzy reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work for us","review":"It didn't work for us.

I tried wiring this thing directly to a Boston Acoustics radio in my kitchen. It actually made the AM reception much worse. So I disconnected it and tried it in wireless mode - absolutely no improvement. I wired it to another BA radio in my bedroom. Again, it actually made the reception worse, even when I put this antenna in the window, as suggested in the manual. And again, the wireless mode did absolutely nothing. And to top it off, the shipper required a signature upon delivery. Don't they know that people have jobs they're supposed to be at during the day?

Were it not for the preview pages of the table of contents, one would have been fooled in thinking that there are THREE practice tests, when in fact there are only two full OLD practice tests from 2000. Its so-called third practice test is not another TEA practice test, but a descriptive self-inventory, which was already included in the Steinberg 10th edition.

After turning off the power to the old switch at the circuit breaker, I opened the switch and saw that the instructions referenced different colored wires than what I saw. I went to the website for further instructions, then called the support number. A very nice man listened to the description, then told me how to connect the switch, properly.It was easy to set the time, to program the on/off settings, and to operate manually. It has been controlling one light with two CFLs in it for about a week. No problems. Lights come on at 5:30pm and turn off at 10:30pm, just like we want.[UPDATE AFTER FOUR MONTHS OF USE]This switch has worked perfectly. The internal clock has been accurate. Reprogramming the \\"on\\" times for seasonal sunset changes is easy. Reprogramming the clock is also easy (for daylight savings)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Timer I've Found","review":"I have used Intermatic and Leviton wall switch timers. This one is the easiest to use and the most reliable. I installed it to turn my pool light and outdoor cage rope lighting on for my lanai nearly two years ago. It has worked flawlessly ever since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"\\"Great quality product and excellent technical customer support! I will by from this company again!!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for CFL control","review":"The Swylite LST100 solved my problem--a security porch light that had a 100watt equivalent CFL light in it. The device works flawlessly and reliably. It is easy to set if you have the instructions--and if you lose them, like I did they can be downloaded on their website (I traced the brand by my Amazon account history). In short, I'm very happy with the unit. Does the job competently and reliably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best that I've Found","review":"I've gotten several switch timers over the years and this has proven to be about the best that I've found in terms of ease of programming and reliability. I've had two installed for well over a year now without any problems and recently added two more. The installation is pretty straightforward, just hook up the wires like any similar hardwired item. Programming is self-explanatory ... as is evident by the fact that I can figure out how to reprogram every six months with day-light-savings-time. Some other models can be a major hassle to figure out how to program especially after the instructions are long gone, but this one is easy to figure out. Too, it's nice being able to easily turn on or off the switch out-of-cycle just by flipping the toggle switch. I have another Levitron switch and it will automatically revert back to the program after 15 minutes which can be a hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.","review":"I installed one of these in July, 2006 (about a year ago now), and I have been extremely pleased with the results.It has been very reliable, and has worked flawlessly with my outdoor lighting. As a plus, it looks great. I use it with traditional CFLs.It was very easy to install. However, if you have a tight switch box, it will take some pushing and juggling, as it is physically bigger than a three-way switch. However, since the LST100 was my replacement for a non-CFL-compatable wall timer, it was just a drop-in for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"Bought one last March, installed it shortly thereafter to replace the last in a series of Intermatic units that only lasted a few years until the main on-off switch became worn and difficult to operate. Sorry to say, this unit's on-off switch began to become unreliable after a couple of months - the light would flash on and off, with the light staying on in either position of the switch, and as often as not, triggering the 10-min auto-off mode instead of the regular turn-on. It finally ended up so touchy that tapping the wall with a fingertip would cause the light to flash madly on and off. Judging from another reviewer, looks like quality control leaves something to be desired.It was also excruciating to install because the body was absolutely as large as allowable and the wires left the body in the worst possible place.I just replaced it with the current version of the Intermatic that shows slight hints of a redesign, and so maybe will last longer than its predecessors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best wall-timer switch available","review":"Purchased item from maker through Amazon with low $5 shipping. Comes with great installation and operating instructions. Had trouble installing in a 3-gang box due to lots of wiring (not a fault with product).Only product certified for use with compact flourescent lighting.Simplicity: single event timer with optional random on/off (15-minute)Although I've had for only a week, it looks much better made than anything available from Intermatic, the only wall timer brand available from Home Depot. Went through two Intermatic timers. The rocker switch on the Swylite is sturdy while the push button on the Intermatic is cheap and flimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gondry never fails to amaze","review":"This collection of Director Michel Gondry's work is nothing short of amazing.

Her ego was boosted way too much, she pretended to act all punk-ish (\\"Tell Me a Story\\" music video), and she had no talent whatsoever.Not only is voice computerized, but she is accompanied by a huge amount of background singers who are like, 40 years old. They need to get a life and do something productive, rather than waste their time singing back-up for a no-talented flop.Even with the heavy backup and computerized voice, she stills sounds horrible, and surprisingly really young. If you didn't know she was 15, by listening to her music you'd guess she was 10 or 11. Even though her acting skills are by no means amazing, she should stick to doing that. Going into the music business was a HUGE mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilary Needs to Stick To Acting","review":"Now don't get me wrong.

Hilary Duff has a squeaky, awful voice that completely takes all the joy out of listening to Christmas music. The songs are, quite simply put, strange slaughterings of classic tunes (I especially liked the techno-ish version of \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\") and don't deserve to be listened to.

When I first saw the cover of it, with Hilary looking as if she's about to pull a chainsaw out of one of those ribbony boxes and kill us all, I knew I was in trouble.I'm sorry to say, but I don't think that our queen Hilary Duff has quite the type of talent for the music business. If she insists on staying in the spotlight, I really think that she should stick to acting (though apparantly the only character she knows how to play is a \\"dorky\\" girl that the hot guy has a secret crush on) and stay faaaar away from singing. It's just that she can't carry a note, and she seems like she's talking a whole lot more than actually SINGING. Not to mention that her voice is entirely computerized throught the whole bloody album!Come on, is this the best that anyone can come up with anymore??

Hilary Duff looks absolutely psychotic on in the picture on the cover. If you want my opinion, don't waste your money buying this CD, that is unless you are looking for a great gag gift, in which case this disk would be absolutely perfect. One final thought, Hilary Duff should stick to her little show on the Disney Channel (which isn't very good either) and leave music to those who actually have so talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"am i the only one with ears?","review":"She is very cute, and I love Lizzie McGuire, but she can NOT sing!

I am a huge Hilary fan, and absolutely love her music. This CD, however, was recorded over two years ago. When comparing Santa Claus Lane to her latest release, the difference is astounding. Now she has a much stronger, deeper, and more talented voice. I still listen to this CD for Christmas, because even with her voice being high pitched and more digitallized, she still is far more tollerable than the whiny groan of Celine Dion. I would buy this CD for the 8 - 15 age group. If you are looking for Hilary's developed, natural vocal talent, go for the self-titled \\"Hilary Duff\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilary Duff Rocks","review":"Hilary Duff sure can sing.

And heck, I actually took it from my sister's CD collection two years later (and bought another for myself when it accidentally broke three years ago). Her voice is airy and a bit basic, but it fits very well together for the Christmas season. Whoever put it together kept a very gentle Pop touch-up on traditional favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"~Alright~","review":"Hilary is really talented but i think she should stick with acting. or just choose one and if its going to be singing then she really needs help. she was doing fine until she started singing, i mean its not like AHH!

Now THEY have talent. In comparison with Jump5's \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town,\\" \\"Rockib' Around the Christmas Tree\\" or especially \\"Sleigh Ride,\\" among others, Hilary Duff's versions are barely passable. This CD does, however, have a couple of songs which are considerably better. But if you want a great kids' Christmas CD, do yourself a favor and just buy ALL THE JOY IN THE WORLD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personally i don't even think it deserves one star","review":"Yeah its that bad. A seven year old had it and told me to listen to it so i did. it's AWFUL She tries to hit notes that are too high and it tells and on wonderful christmastime well the chorus [is not that great]and to the person who sayid can u do better yeah i think i can its that bad. Don't waste your money if u want a good christmas cd i recomend Jump5 All The Joy In The WOrld so much better and they CAN sing.

Hilary Duff is hot. But does that help her singing skills? I think not, unless you can add as much reverb and chorus to the tracks as these producers have.

With its Widescreen presentation you would think they would find the uncut version, especially with its hefty pricetag. The scene cut is the spear in the Cyclop's eye aftermath where he pulls it out and cries. A nifty scene that is in all prints I have seen, so why not here.

But this release is flawed from the start, creating demand later for the \\"uncut\\" version. I have ordered several vids from the WB Archive collection, \\"Between Two Worlds\\", and two others. I received a defective disc on one account (which WB promptly replaced), but all the discs had trouble loading and playing on any computer ROM, or stand alone player & I tried them on at least 3 different computers. The discs are exceptionally cheap and substandard. The price is much too high, and I had to burn copies of their movies to DVD blanks (removing the copy protection) so they would play without hanging up.

Pan and scanning is unacceptable, I don't care what broadcasters and regular people think... the true audience of this footage are people interested in history and want to capture every single detail. This is unacceptable, in fact, it's so far out and ridiculous that I can't even believe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary","review":"Albeit focusing in the British point of view of WWII, this is a great documentary, plenty of footage and made while many people that participated in the conflict - Albert Speer, Adolf Galland, James Stewart - were still alive and able to give their testimonies. Curiously, by the time it was released (1973) the cracking of the Enigma code machine was still a secret and it is not mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and draws emotion","review":"I have not been through all the DVD's in this set as of yet. I see one or two several times to get the history, then compare to other historical documents and old VHS tapes on the particular subject matter I am researching. As for what I have seen thus far, this is exceptional information. I do recommend to any, who want to get a close view of events and even documented motives of those who would lead such encounters. This is so far a very accurate work, my hat is off to the editors and film crew of this study, from my perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World at War - DVD Documentary","review":"The definitive World War II documentary, emotionally gripping and edifying on virtually every level: excellent production values, with superb photographs, top-flight film footage and accurate descriptions of the sweeping political movements, gargantuan military engagements and profound human tragedies that defined the conflict - made even more compelling by means of a superb narrative from the legendary Laurence Olivier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Documentary","review":"This is a fantastic collection of WWII narratives.

Truly an incredible and important series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good. Probably THE documentary set to own","review":"This kept me going for months (in one hour segments at a time). There is so much material presented here and I learned a lot.I wanted to give 4.5 stars and only knock a half off for the sometimes annoying menu (it could have been presented in a more orgnaized fashion, I thought), or other small problems, but half points aren't allowed on the system. Very close to perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No closed captions/provisions for hearing impaired","review":"The miniseries was terrific but the DVD has one unacceptable (for me) flaw: It has no provisions for the hearing impaired. There is no closed captioning. I bought this as a gift for someone who is hearing impaired and was forced to return it.Such a cheap, shoddy decision for production is unworthy of the fine miniseries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slanted towards English","review":"Many of the documentaries are very well done but there is an overall theme that the British won the war with a little help from everyone else.The Pacific War - along with Pearl Harbor were very disapointing. Also the constant overtheme that the Americans were there enjoying themselves more than fighting and sacrificing was rather insulting. Some great documentaries, but if you want to see anything about the American involvement - buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the quick delivery!","review":"This is a Christmas gift so therefore I don't know yet if this set is any good. However, the price is excellent for 11 disk and they it delivered very quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the British supposedly saved the world","review":"How can anyone produce a documentary about the allied campaigns to liberate North Africa, Italy, and France without once mentioning General George S. Patton? And when the subject turns to the Battle of the Bulge, this documentary presents a Wehrmacht turned back thanks to the heroic efforts of the British led by the ever fearless military genius General Bernard Montgomery. Patton didn't even merit a footnote, and that's enough for this documentary to get a single star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Ever WWII Footage; Worst Ever Quality Control","review":"At one time I too owned this set. I returned the box set back to the seller for a full refund. Possibly the best footage of WWII ever put together, HOWEVER both my sets were defective. The picture constantly broke up (pixelation) and some chapters were entirely missing.The World At War was released prior to the 30th Anniversary Box Set and the quality was worse than this version.The original release was a mess...Example: Disc 4; Side 1 and Side 2 were exactly the same and EVERY disc had a pixelation problem.The 30th Anniversary Box Set I experienced pixelation on a number of discs. You would think they would get it right the 2nd time.I ended up returning both sets and decided to wait for another release. Too bad, I LOVE THIS SERIES.My recommendation is to wait until the series is re-issued by another manufacturer. If you wait long enough, the set may also be remastered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Production","review":"This is an absolute necessity for any student of WW 2.

After viewing side 2 of disc 2 I put side one of disc 3 into my dvd player when something odd struck me, I had felt a little deja vu after viewing side 2 of disk 2. I checked the disk with the case and the episode titles were completely different, but I had seen them before, and I knew where, on side 2 of disk 1. Side 2 of disk 1 one had been duplicated onto side 2 of disc 2. The set was missing side 2 disc 2. I did not have my receipt so I could not return it. So if you happen to have this boxed set check to make sure you have all the episodes, and if you are thinking of purchasing this set do not throw out your receipt until you check to make sure you have the entire series. Aside from this problem this is one of the best documentary series ever made for television and holds up well today, and will hold up well for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best ever, believe nothing else!","review":"This is without a doubt the best television ever....the best documentary ever....and why amongst all others?

It is even better on the DVD Disk in that the commentary about all the research that went into producing this great piece of history; and, the people that did it. I believe that this documentary should be every school in the nation. I am 68 years old and I think that today's schools are not covering history in the classes as they should--this documentary certainly explains how the war came about, what happen during the war, the countries involved, and the conclusion of the war.

He has really enjoyed it! He says the details and information are exactly what he wanted. The episodes are about an hour each, so the huge length of the entire set is made into more manageable pieces to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Documentary on WWII","review":"Made in the early 70's, this documentary is still the best one available on WWII, augmented by the fact that it was made while many of the participants were still alive. The documentary includes many interviews with eyewitnesses and actual combatants. The filmmakers, by their own admission, do not cover every aspect of the war (such an endeavor would require watching 100's of hours of filem) yet it still covers many of the major events and gives the viewer a very clear sense of how the war affected so many (the losses, the victories, the horror and human suffering) and how it shaped history."},{"rating":"2","title":"As It was","review":"The definitive documentary of WWII's European theater.

Since the documentary was made in 1974 most of the WW II veterans interviewed were in their early fifties and sixties. Including a few high profile individuals such as Albert Speer, Curtis LeMay, Arthur Harris and others. I especially like the addition of color footage. Something which was not part of the original series.

Apart from the erratum in my box set, the series itself is great, albeit with a British perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Fantastic, How Can One Fault It.","review":"Simply put, it is one of the best total documentaries on the Second World War.

I originally saw this as a kid in the UK, when it was first screened in the mid-70's on ITV on Sunday afternoons. Those unforgettable B+W images of a time only 30 years gone made a massive impact on me back then.So naturally I wondered if re-watching this series again now might show it all to be badly dated in the post-MTV age. I couldn't have been more wrong. Just seeing the combination of those haunting opening credits along with Olivier's haunting human narration and Carl Davis's moving score all over again felt like a punch in the stomach. In these dark violent times, this wonderful humanitarian series chronicling possibly the only worthy war in mankind's history hasn't dated a bit. Indispensable stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Standard Definition Version","review":"Considering that most of the original footage was 16mm, one would have thought that the manufacturer would have presented in the footage in the original format. They did not. The Blu-Ray version is merely re-scanned with the top and bottom of the images cut off to fit a 16 by 9 format. A great deal of visual information was lost. Buy the DVD. I'd give that a five star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"World at War","review":"Not only it give the events of what happen doing World War II, it gives the who's, what's and why's.

Awesome and inspiring, brimming with historical fact and intrique that is anchored into your psyche by the perfectly narrated and soundtracked epic. I have personally watched this documentary in its entirety over 7 times. No small feat but time well spent. I carry its images in my mind and dreams and conjure up images felt every time I think about men in war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray butchery","review":"I have to join those you decry the fact that they have chopped the original 4x3 image ratio in order to make the image fit on widescreen televisions without black bars. This is particularly egregious when they show the original newsreel footage which cuts out vital information and has to resort to pan and scan techniques in order to convey some of the images.On top of that, this edition leaves out the producers introduction to each episode which conveyed important and fascinating information as to how each episode was made and the challenges facing the filmmakers.A very shoddy presentation of a documentary masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cropped, eh?

And most importantly that he did not and could not do it alone. All the carnage, mayhem was hailed at first as an example of good strong government. In the guise of valiant community effort and sheer fright of the people.Oh how we all love to be led like lamb to the slaughter, we will give up our basic human rights and freedom all for the mother land which ever; and where ever your mother land is.After our 9/11 we could have embarked easily on this type of rule ...but the difference was that we are Americans, bred to think for ourselves.This DVD is very powerfull and I recommend it to all who thought they knew all about Hitler,,,, He was one man but a whole nation and a whole following as well.Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gifted The World At War","review":"I purchased this for a gift to my 17 year old son.

I found multiple times I wanted to fall asleep on some episodes, but stayed awake out of some desire to feel I watched the whole thing.

Especially Pacific theatre combat with the Americans was almost none existent, as if British combat and especially in Burma was the only real thing that happened. It does have good insights into the Nazi's and rewards itself here and there, but overall I think the British slant and focus ruined the series.I also found it humorous that the narrator tried to label Hitler as \\"right-wing\\" when he was a Socialist dictator.

Note the seventys hairdo.Although 26 hour-long episodes may seem like a lot, the content is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Documentary/Poor Blu-ray version","review":"As mentioned in other reviews, cropping the original film for the Blu-ray version was poor planning by the editors. Ignore the history revisionist clown that goes by History Reader. What he says and the texts that are listed are from the less than one percent lunatic fringe that occasionally spouts off. Just ask a veteran that served in WWII who witnessed the liberation of the Nazi death camps, they are well documented. Sadly, may of the veterans from that war have passed away. It would be better to purchase the DVD than the Blu-ray for this fine documentary. I will purchase a Blu-ray version if they restore it to the original aspect ratio.cave canem"},{"rating":"2","title":"best documentary","review":"I have been looking at WW2 documentaries for years, and this is the best that I have ever seen. This set has footage that I have not seen anywhere else. I am usually not interested in interviews in documentaries, but they have interviews with VERY big name people from both sides. They also cover \\"theaters\\" of the war such as Burma, that are frequently not covered in other documentaries. If I could only afford to buy one WW2 documentary, I would definitely buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This was a wonderful documentary as originally broadcast, but I'd avoid this product if I had it to do over again: the maker's quality control is awful. Disk 1 skipped badly. And I the same problem others have reported: two copies of one of the five disks (with me, disk 5), and one disk (disk 4) entirely missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but missing disc 2","review":"Wish I could watch this highly acclaimed series but DVD 2 is missing and instead I received 2 copies of disk 1. Another reader review had this same problem so why the heck has Amazon.com not addressed this problem?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Master piece of propaganda","review":"The story is blatantly biased in favor of the allies and their treacherous leaders who have butchered the European people on the altar of the New World order designed by roosevelt and his internationalist advisers keen to destroy what was left of the Christian culture in Europe. At least the film demonstrates, against the author's intentio, that Germany has been used as spacegoat for triggering a new conflict between the European nations which will kill for ever their national pride and install the new world order decided by the winners. The report of the conflict on the Russian front looks like propaganda pictures delivered by the stalinist information ministry praising the miraculous recovery of the Red Army when it was shooting ten of thousands of its own troops under the pretext of cowardice. Not a world about the Ukrainian and Baltic people revolt against the communist sect supported by Roosevelt and his financiers. This is laughable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best series,by a long shot.","review":"I would recommend to all the fantastic (and all theatres of WW2 covered) dvd boxset of World at War,from the BBC and Amazon.It remains the foremost.Two other documentries \\"The nazis,a warning from history\\" and \\"Auschwitz\\",both from the BBC and written by Laurence Rees would compliment this series as they look in depth at the Nazi \\"Final solution\\" and Life in Nazi Germany and should be bought alongside the massive WW2 set narrated by the late,great Laurence De Olivier who loans the series so much pathos and gravity and accompanied by archive footage,actual interviews from survivors,soldiers,etc of the time.The music too is haunting and it has stayed with me for years.What an amazing set.Its worth every penny/cent.If you are going to invest in one war documentry-let this be it.Its an investment.You cant put a price on Knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cultural vandalism","review":"For decades films were ruined by panning and scanning, hacking the sides of the image and only 4:3 material was shown correctly. Now audiences are accustomed to black bars on 2.35-1 films on widescreen TVs we get the ludicrous irony of 4:3 material being butchered so those with no visual sensibility won't complain when it doesn't fill their 16:9 TVs.The World at War is the greatest documentary series ever produced. It is nothing less than cultural vandalism to restore it only to present it with the 30% or so of the image missing from every shot.I'd buy this in a moment if it was presented properly. I wouldn't pay a penny for this version. If everyone boycotts it Freemantle will rapidly change their mind and release it at 4:3 so as not to loose a fortune in sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boondoggle! Avoid this set and get the DVDs","review":"You can still get the 12 DVD set of this series with excellent mastering and the correct aspect ratio for a third of the price of this bluray set. The image quality on the DVDs looks just as good as the sample frame grabs from the bluray. And the DVD has two additional hours of supplemental material.All you get with this bluray boondoggle is a third less picture and three times the price tag... Oh! And a documentary describing how they chopped the image up so they could sell it to cable TV. Swell.The people who made this set are not your friends. Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Image has been cropped on the blu ray edition","review":"People should be made aware of the fact that the makers of this blu-ray version have cropped the original 4:3 image in order to fit widescreen tv's. Shame on them. These are important historical films that should be preserved in their original aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"I saw this series when it first was presented on television and enjoyed it very much. I decided I wanted to see it again and spent the $40 bucks for the privelege. It is well worth it. It seemed more objective than other films about World War II, notably Victory at Sea which strikes me as jingoistic wartime propaganda, even though it didn't come out until after the war. A couple of segments of World at War struck me as curious. In the segment about the Battle of the Bulge, there was no mention of the heroic holdout at Bastogne. There was also no mention of the Remagen Bridge crossing in the presentation about the Rhine crossing. The British Black Watch division or regiment or whatever, was given credit for the first crossing of the Rhine. Is that a British bias? I am watching for that as I proceed through the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect gift!","review":"I bought this as a Xmas present for my fiance & he LOVES it. He raves about it every time he watches one of the segments. With 11 DVD's it's going to take him a while to get through it & he seems to be enjoying every moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else can be said. Its the best WWII doc made.","review":"As my title states, there not much more that can be posted about this documentary series. Its wonderfully made...loaded with footage and first hand accounts from all major war participants. I really enjoyed this set, particularly the interviews with Stephen Ambrose, Traudl Junge, etc. Highly recommended, of course, if you have even a lukewarm interest in history or, more specifically, the history of WWII. I would have liked to have seen a little more coverage on the workings and makeup of the SS in particular...though the set does examine Hitler's Germany in fairly good detail and what conditions allowed for such a regime to be created and ultimately take hold of the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"The world at war series","review":"Excellent archives of the history of World War II and astonishing film footage. This is a history buff's need to buy for their collection. I also recommend 'Century of warfare' series as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Series on WWII","review":"I'm glad I bought this series. The old footage is amazing--from all sides of the war. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to have a better historical understanding of WWII from beginning to end with a perspective on all of the countries involved. Freedom is not free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cropped? You're kidding","review":"Hey A&E, your customers are not idiots. All of us with widescreen TV's have figured out how to deal with 4:3 images. Depending on preference we either go with black or grey side bars, or zoom the image. Did you think we go in to a panic if we stumble on an I Love Lucy rerun?? There are plenty of 4:3 movies on blu-ray that that haven't been butchered. I will not be buying this set although I was really looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop watching it","review":"This series does the war of the century a great deal of justice. I purchased it about 4 months ago and have watched every episode at least twice. The European side of the war gets a bit more coverage, but the episodes on the War of the Pacific are superb, particularly the one that documents the battles of Tarawa, Iwo Jima, Leyte Gulf and Okinawa (on disk 6). The series is also effective in showing how the civilian population was affected in various countries. You will probably gain a great deal of respect and sympathy for the Russian people after watching the episodes on Leningrad and Stalingrad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clarks should be Platinum...","review":"This is an excellent compilation of many of the most popularly-known Clarks songs. This is my second purchase, owing to the fact that I WORE OUT my CD by playing it so much. I am new to the PC vs. Android issue, and I thought when I purchased this for the Kindle Fire HD that it would also play on my PC; this is my only disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"the shame of Pittsburgh","review":"The Clarks are terrible and boring. Listen to good music like Herb Alpert, Ill Bill, Merzbow, or Burzum instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor knock-off of a quality scoop","review":"i bought this scoop thinking i was adding to the 3 i already own and love, but which do not have any indication of the manufacturer name (which i now know is RSVP). the cuisinox scoop doesn't have the right balance or heft to the scoop or length in the handle. it also has some noticeable and unattractive weld marks that joins the scoop to the handle. the web picture looks just like the ones i already own - oriented and lit so you don't see the flaws or subtle difference (or maybe it's not even a picture of what you get!) now i know better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"real people and beautiful shots of Mexico","review":"This movie has a natural exuberance distinctly not the result ofbig stars or fast-action or urban glam. Two other things I liked about this movie:the characters are real people, not fantasy Hollywood people. Its refreshing to see a movie in which the actors are not big professionals with big Hollywood personas. They do a better job of acting real ordinary people with ordinary and flawed personalities like the rest of us. I also liked it because the occasional interspersing of nature shots, mexican wildlife, gila monsters, lizards was so interesting andtastefully done. The music was also first class and matched thestory and pace perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding???!!!","review":"This is one of the worst movies ever produced.The actors (especially Alisa Conaboy) are pathetic,to say the least. They've taken a magnificentlocation and bastardized it in a worthless storythat ends in mutual defecation. That about sumsup the entire story - people defecating together,like any roadside toilet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tropical Treat!","review":"As a longtime visitor to Yelapa, Mexico I'm probably a little biased, but I've watched with plenty of people who've never been there and everyone agrees this film is a real treat. From the hilarious plot of a kid on a spritual journey to the stories of romance and family -- the movie charms in unexpected ways. Then there's the beautiful way it captures the richness of the place -- everything from the pueblo to the beach to the dogs that live on the beach. The guest spots by locals, including our friends Freddy Glumaz, Isabel Jordan and Philippo Lo Grande are an added bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Film Makers should have asked, Which Way!","review":"We all have a certain amount of hours to live from birth to the grave. Don't waste a second your life, or your money buying this boring film, it's a load of cods-wallop!.The settings may be pretty to look at, but all the characters are so dysfunctional, that they become irritating to watch. If they could act it may have been somewhat tolerable. Unacceptable language (and there's plenty of that) is no excuse for a lack of knowledge of the English language.The camerawork and storyline is definitely first month Film School, which begs one to suggest that the production team should have asked \\"Which Way, Por Favor?\\" before they started on their journey into filmmaking. They certainly got lost on the way.I give this film one star, only because the transfer to DVD is acceptable in both picture and sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a word - magnificent!!","review":"Obsession is a magical record and 30 years later, I'm still trying to find something as good. The music on Obsession is the sound of a band at its peak. Truly essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Obsession' w/ 'extra live tracks'","review":"'Obsession' is my favorite UFO CD so I was very happy when it was remasterd and released with the 3 'bonus live tracks' which are 3 songs from this CD. They are the live 'Hot \`n Ready' [which is pretty similar to the 'SITN' version] as well as the live 'Pack It Up and Go' and 'Ain\`t No Baby'. I can\`t get enough of the UFO with MS so if you are a big UFO and Michael Schenker fan, then you need to own this as I feel the studio work of 'Obsession' is definitely Michael\`s best with the 70\`s version of UFO and the 3 live songs are great too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say, it's the best.","review":"Michael Schenker at his best, just before leaving the band. A great album, the only one I have on cassette, vinyl, and two CD versions. One of the great British rock bands overlooked by most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 5 stars:) there may be better UFO","review":"Many people think this is UFO's best recording. I personally prefer the new Covenant, Lights Out, and even High Stakes and Dangerous Men. I really should have given that recording 5 stars. Hay, we all make mistakes.I can't find it but there is a website that has votes tallied of people's top favorite UFO recordings. Every recording is someone UFO fan's favorite. peteway has other UFO links which is a good resource of line up changes and lyrics etc.If your an old UFO fan get some new UFO. If your a rocker who doesn't own any UFO I recommend Lights Out as a first purchase. However, their new stuff is as good as ever but takes a few listens to like unlike Lights Out which just blows many away right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Game!","review":"Desert quad STINKS!

It is not worth the $10 I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look No Further","review":"I love that the main ingredient in this lotion is aloe; that alone must be why this product was able to heal my cracked and bleeding dry hands in just a day. I have dry, sensitive skin, and this lotion so gently heals I'm even able to use it on my face. I also prefer it over all other \\"pregnancy\\" stretch oils/lotions I've tried (even natural ones like EMAB) for relieving my 9 months prego itchy baby belly. It's hubby's favorite lotion too; works quickly and well, and doesn't leave a scent. We're hooked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke out","review":"I have used this product for years and ran out so I found it on Amazon. I see by the package that it has improved its formula. I tried it three times and it made my whole face red like sunburn and the first time it lasted about an hour and after that it lasted for at least a day and my face was sensitive for several days. I will not use this product again and am disappointed because I loved the original formula and never had issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves me greasy ans smelling funny","review":"Every summer the NW atmosphere curses me with dry, tight, ugly looking skin, and this year has been the worst in memory. I picked up a bottle of Jason Hemp lotion because I do swear by hemp oil (the stuff is absolutely amazing) and because I use Jason vitamin E cream and have had no problems with it. Sadly, this lotion just wasn't worth the cost. It leaves my skin greasy, which causes irritating bumps, and, for all that it has a very, very faint smell, it makes me smell funny. To clarify, my partner has not noticed the smell, so it can't be terribly strong; nevertheless, I notice it, and that is bad enough.The bottom line is that I would not recommend this lotion unless your skin is flaking badly and it is the only hemp lotion available. I know I will not be buying Jason Hemp lotion again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great skin product","review":"I've used this product for years, and like it very much. It can be used on and around your eyelids and does not migrate into the eye itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too strong","review":"Be careful with this product. We like other Jason products. In fact, we use the Rosewater bath gel and love it but this lotion is waaaaaay too strong. It sort of smells like rosewater but it's so strong and pungent that my whole family did not enjoy it. You may, but just letting you know what we think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smell is unbearable","review":"Few years ago I have similar lotion from the same brand, and I liked it a lot. So I didn't hesitate before buying it. However, when I finally got it I was really surprised. The lotion is different now. The smell is unbearable!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this product. The scent (lavender) ...","review":"I really liked this product. The scent (lavender) was nice and not overpowering.

The sound quality is just amazing and can't say how awesome the experience of not having the cords are.

It wouldn't but the MB210 would. They were extremely helpful, had me return the MB200 to them and then they shipped the MB210 to me. I read the short manual, charged the headphones, and they worked!! Can't say enough about how nice, helpful, and knowledgeable the Wi-Gear people are! Couldn't believe the iMuffs worked right away with no issues, after reading some of the other reviews on the MB200, but these work flawlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After using these Imuffs for 8 months the battery died. At first I thought it was enjoyable to be wireless so I proceeded to use them for at least 5 hours a day. Unfortunately for me I started using them months after I bought them (largely due to them being too flimsy and not being able to use them in the winter). So, the battery died after the warranty had expired. It took several emails to get the company to exchange them and it has been a waiting game ever since. When I receive my replacement set I'll use them until they die and I'll definitely be switching to another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this product and company","review":"I purchased this product about a year ago. It never worked well. Almost every time I used it, I needed to jiggle with the connection by either removing and replacing the bluetooth adapter or turning off and on to keep the connection and hear anything out of the connection. After a few minutes it was workable with adequate sound quality. I continued to use it because of the convenience of wireless operation and the fact I had paid so much for it. After about 10.5 months, they stopped working altogether. I called the company and they had me return them for evaluation. They then said they would not honor the warranty because of water damage. This if far to much to pay for a mediocre product and a company that won't stand behind them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!","review":"This product is atrocious garbage. The headphones did not perform particularly well for the 6 months that they worked. Volume was very low and the ipod attachment kept falling out. Add to this that the sound quality is less than acceptable.The real topper is that after 6 months the phones would no longer take a charge. When I returned them to the manufacturer they refused to repair the item claiming that they are wet from my head perspiration!! Now I perspire as much as the next guy but please give me a break. If the phones can not stand up to normal sitting in a chair or walking perspiration they are useless. They claim the USB port is moldy. So fix it then! This is what the item is made for and it is still under warranty.I didn't pursue the matter as much as I might normally because the product stinks anyway.BUY A LOGITECH PAIR-They work better, sound better and after 3 years they are still dry!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charging Problems","review":"I bought this product and it worked well for a month or so. Then the headset would not take a charge. I returned them and they sent me a new unit. Two months later the new unit will not take a charge. I am sending them back now. The unit sounds good when working and the cordless feature is great for the gym but the battery life on the Ipod is cut to about 3 hours maximum with this unit. I am constantly chargeing my Ipod. I have read other reviews about moisture on the headset. Mine get soaked at the gym but so far customer service has not said a work about it. they are good to deal with but you have the shipping costs and the time lag to deal with. All in all I think it is easier to put up with the cord and have you unit last longer than it is to fool around with these especially at the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMuff Headphones","review":"IMuff Headphones did not work well with the IPhone.

Very time consuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough for the price","review":"These headphones are OK but I have 2 main problems - the fit is poor and I have a hard time keeping them on my ears. Also, they cut out constantly. I think if you plan to sit still and use them it might be OK but I find them constantly cutting out when I am moving around trying to do yardwork, walk, ski, etc. Seem to have a conflict when they come near anything else electrical. Great idea, poor execution and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ever you do, don't sweat!","review":"I've used these headphones quite a bit because I love the wireless functionality. They sound great. BUT, even though they say you can use them for sports, sweat will cause the whole things to corrode. The charging USB port is located on the bottom, which is where sweat collects. I've returned them several times and had them replaced, but now the company seems to be getting crabby about such returns and won't replace them because they don't cover \\"moisture damage\\".It seems to me that the main use for bluetooth headphones is active pursuits, such as biking, gym, running, etc. where you want to put the iPod in a protected place (bag, camelbak, etc.) and be able to control the ipod. So, for a pair of bluetooth headphones to be so completely unprotected from sweat is pure follyStay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable","review":"i recently purchased this product. i used it maybe 12-14 times working out before it completely shut down. i am so disappointed, as soon as i started using it i knew it was not built very well i did my best to protect it from the smallest things but still it just stoped working i didnt drop it, i didnt get it wet, i didnt do anything it was simply on my head and stoped. these are the worst headphones i have ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going back to wired","review":"Over time I have found the link to be fragile.

While it is hard to beat the depth shown in Bultmann's _History of the Synoptic Tradition_, the type analysis Dibelius performs goes farther into the actual structure and levels of specificity and abstraction involved in each type of literary element. Bultmann categorizes frequently based upon the content of the element, where Dibelius categorizes on the form more often.

Jet Li, John Wayne, Donnie Yen, these and similar names are the names that appear on most of the movies I watch. So you can see that romantic movies are not something I spend much time with. So if I say \\"see this movie\\" it's not something I say lightly. Not since 'Castaway on the Moon' have I been drawn into a love story that not only interested me so much but made me root for the characters and wanted them to get together and all those things that romantic movies try to accomplish. If you don't like romantic movies, give this one a try, I believe you will be in for a surprise. I certainly was. If you like romantic movies and haven't seen this one, then I'd question whether you really like romantic movies. Regardless, watch it. Besides the above mentioned Castaway on the Moon there is not a romantically inclined movie that I would more highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very romantic movie!!","review":"It's a very romantic movie!!!

But how far will Garth's hunger go before it effects the ones Miranda is closest to?If you like young adult romance/suspense/horror novels, then you'll probably like this trilogy (Dark Moon Legacy). \\"The Curse\\" is the first book, followed by \\"The Seduction\\" and \\"The Rebellion\\".

Good thing I picked it up at a dollar store. The story started out alright but I think it was when Barf stumbled tipsily onto the scene that things went down hill. The last scene were they were in the woods was.....about as romantic as watching a dead tree rot.The L.J. Smith type cover design attracted me to it despite the giggle worthy red eyes of Garth, our \\"hero\\" (snort) and the way Miranda's sprawled across it like one of those cheesy 80's romance covers. And if I remember right (this book is in a deep dark place in my closet and will hopefully never be unleashed on the world again)Garth even has a mullet..and then there's the demonic blood shot red eyes staring out from the cover.)My suggestion, L.J. Smith is worlds better and I'm just glad I got this book for a dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"So hard to read just one page a day of this rare and exquisite book.","review":"I read many pages in this rare and appealing book every week.

Znosko-Borovsky's book was very instructional. He discussed why things did not work.A good computer program can do what Harding's book did and probably do it better.For quality instruction for the beginner/intermediate check out Chernev, Keres, Euwe, McDonald etc.I apologize if I am coming off a little harsh but I have only come across two chess books that I really did NOT want to finish and Why You Lose at Chess was one of them.

I bought the DVD in July at Fry's, and was rather disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the music is out of this world fantastic, it was just that the focus was not particularly on the Blue Men. In addition, in the Chicago show, there were only three band members, and they were up in a screened-off loft with glow in the dark t-shirts. I didn't like in the DVD how there were half a dozen band people sprawled across the back of the stage. And the vocalists were actually quite a major turn-off for me.

They are pure genius...one of the most entertaining groups out there. The extra music videos are really cool that come with the DVD, also...one with Dave Matthews and another with Gavin Rossdale.

I have to give the Megastar DVD the nod as the best of the two DVD's. Watching the concert in HD is such an improvement. The light show is far superior, the music tighter and more refined. Sound is slightly better. Their new female vocalist Adrian Hartley projects her outstanding voice better than the Complexes guest vocalists. Megastar also has a Ace of a cut playing Pink Floyd's One Of These Days. It is one awesome over the top rocker that might make you say, Blue Floyd Rocks, Pink who?Last comment, HD TV is like looking out a clean window, while the old tv is like looking out a very dirty window. If you can afford one buy it. Blue Man Group Rocks!

The show has been amazing, having been to several performances of their Complex Rock tour, I have truly been blown away.

If you missed the biggest Rock tour of 2003 pick up this DVD, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Average Band Live In Concert DVD","review":"The Blue Man Group is not easily pigeonholed. This DVD is a multi-level work. At one level, it's a rock concert; at another it's an exploration/parody of just what a rock concert really is. I'd be better able to review the DVD if I'd seen a performance of The Complex Rock Tour in person; I suspect there's an impact to the experience the DVD can only hint at. That being said, I found the DVD engrossing if slightly schizoid - and I don't meant that last in a bad way.BMG forces an audience to suspend expectations - you can never be sure what BMG is doing, or how it will turn out. But, along the way they provide moments of magic, wonder, and even some thumping good tunes. Exhibit 13, one of the scenes from the DVD, is incredibly poignant. My own particular favorite is \\"I Feel Love\\" with Venus Hum.BMG is hard to judge because they stand alone.

Rite of Passage presents a series of backpacking vignettes told by a number of different authors, in a variety of styles and settings. The problem is, with a few exceptions, the stories are all the same: a covert hookup in a hostel, consumption of an unusual animal by-product, a mugging that common sense could have avoided, or a \\"love\\" that was just never meant to be. I really hope there's more to Europe than that!

Delta should be admonished for not providing an instruction manual. Shame on Delta for not providing better support.A word of caution, a work piece can and will shift in the jaws with heavy chisel pressure and this shifting is more pronounced if the end stock is removed and/or the work is out of balance.

I cut my finger trying to open the case. This has got to be a major flaw which PalmOne designers totally missed. The case itself is nice, has a rubber edge for protection as well as on the back. The hinged aluminum cover is where the problems begin. You need a finger nail in order to open the snap of the case. The edge is sharp and if you happen to slide your fingernail against the edge of the case, you can expect to get cut which is what happened to me. The price of the case does not warrant the design flaws and it is way too expensive considering that the Life Drive already costs an arm and a leg. I hope that PalmOne will take a look at this case and make improvements for functionality and safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad case for a good PDA","review":"I recently received a Palm LifeDrive with this hard case.

Unfortunaetly there are not many accessories for the lifedrive yet so although I hate the case and it increases my stress level I am still using it.Palm was not thinking when they made the lifedrive since the speakers are in the back of the devive and are shielded by any case you are to get.

It's a hard pull. I have healthy, strong nails, and it broke one of mine. It also cut me under the fingernail.Other than that, it's a nice design, but who cares? The whole point of a PDA hard case is to use the PDA in the case so that it stays protected. The only way to use this case without wrecking your nails is to slide it out of the case every time you want to use it.I received it today. It's going back today."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse case ever","review":"I have to use a dime to pry open this case. Look at the \\"catch\\" on the door- it is uncoated aluminum and is designed to be opened like an old fashioned mint tin. It can be easily bent or pushed in and this could damage the glass surface.

The title is a clever one dealing both with the common perception that Mr Hague is in the shadow of illustrious predecessors, not least Margaret Thatcher, and also hinting at his own political leanings. While most of the book is dedicated to the political life of William Hague, the biography also gives the reader a touching insight to the man himself, from his youthful address to the Tory party conference to the private man of today. It is a fascinating insight and the reader learns some amazing things, such as the fact that he and his wife Ffyon like to recreate the famous \\"pottery\\" scene from \\"Ghost\\" in their private moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but...","review":"These \\"tubes\\" are an awesome buy but there is a slight problem with the. While they protect your ipod, they actually scratch it when you take it in and out. This isnt really a problem since you should have a cover on all the time but I think its kinda silly that the very thing that is suppose to be protecting them is scratching them.

I like my nano so much better with them on because the turn-dial is easier to use and it just feels less fragile and dainty. They fit skin-tight so there's not really any added bulk or thickness, and there's access to the hold button. Taking them on and off is not too much of a problem, though it does take a few tugs. But there's no protection for the screen.........and that's important. So even though I have a tube on my nano, I still have to worry about protecting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product!","review":"The quality of this product is superior, however, the fit is quite tight.

An opera singer rapping about cowboy life and philosophy, accompanied by children singing about holidays and shopping at Walmart.

I used to listen to them over and over again and memorized most of the songs and even sing some today with my guitar. The only reason I don't give this a 5 star is because it is a collection of music from different TV and Live appearances and is sort of \\"disconnected\\" It's not the producers fault. I don't know that Jim ever recorded a whole show of just his music. There are some interesting anecdotes that he shares the one I recall in particular is how he ended up writing \\"Roller Derby Queen\\". Get the video it's worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Croce Fans Will Enjoy","review":"By 2012 standards this video is really lacking, but if you're a Jim Croce fan and you know this is the only video available of the singer, then it's worth having. His stories about how he got to writing certain hit songs are very interesting. His singing voice is great and the voice quality overall on the video is very good. The family photos and background are a nice touch. I thought this would be more of a live concert with a lot of audience feedback, but it is just a series of clips, many without an audience. But it's still better than just listening to a greatest hits CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic- All the favorites and personal history of Jim's life, well done","review":"Great classic music from the late Jim Croce. Very well done with lots of full length performances in different settings. Also a lot of home video footage and interviews with his loving wife as well. Pretty much tells his whole story...what a tragic loss of a great song-writer and musician. I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gem","review":"In a word, my friends, this DVD is a gem!

I love his music and when I saw this DVD collection I had to get it. Jim Croce was a true genuine authentic person and artist. It comes through in his music & the film footage on this DVD. The footage is very good quality to be from the 70's, this is the only surviving film of him preforming live. I also enjoyed the audio interviews with Jim's wife and son A.J.. It was so touching and personal. It brought tears to my eyes that such a beautiful person as Jim was taken so soon. Thanks to the Croce Family for sharing this with us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected!","review":"Purchased directly from Amazon for $13.49.Recently, my local PBS station aired an edited version of this DVD and immediately, my mother (who was in her early 30s during Croce's time) asked me to see if I could get it online. I too, have become a fan of Jim Croce and this DVD is better than I expected. It's about an hour of live television performances and the DVD has a separate commentary by his wife, Ingrid.Some other reviewers have listed the songs/videos, so take a look at those for the details. I can say the quality is good considering the videos are from various live television performances (two are slideshows). Seeing Jim's facial expressions as he performs really elevates the listening enjoyment of his music.If you're a Jim Croce fan and you don't have any DVDs of his live performances, then I highly recommend you get this one.Hope that helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly Prudery","review":"Heaven forbid, this book has actually got naked bodies in it! *How terrible...*.

We need to be open with our children - or we'll end up with a teenage pregnancy on our hands. Here is a fun, non-threatening way to introduce the subject of puberty to your children. Read it with them, and YOU are in control of how you talk about it, and just how much you want to tell them. Honestly, the easiest way to deal with it is just to tell them what the 'sticky stuff' is when they ask.

My son was 10/11 at the time and she thought it was an amusing way to pave the way for a more serious discussion. It was too simplistic for him and he pooh-poohed it, but my 6/7 year old daughter was fascinated by it. Now that she's 9 and facing these issues herself, it's helpful for us to use this book as a non-threatening explanation of what's happening with her.

I ran it wired in parallel for 2 ohms (EXACTLY like every other dual 4 ohm sub I've ever had) at about 1500w RMS. All levels were turned down to less than 1/2. The sub lasted for four minutes at 15 out of 60 volume on my head unit with NO bass boost. After the initial song (Blunt Blowin' by Lil Wayne, not exactly a banger), I turned up the volume to 25. Within a minute, the sub blew. Cut it apart to see the damage and sure enough, both coils blown. I'm not impressed. As a matter of fact, I'm disgusted. Four minutes WAY below RMS? I understand its cheap, but damn.Pros: Cheap and loud, while it lasted.Cons: Cheaply made, poor sound quality even at low levels, power is FAR over-stated.

There are many, many fan fiction stories which are superior to this one. Even the bad fan fic is over before you have time to worry about it's shoddiness. The basic errors (Daniel's BLONDE hair) and AMANDA Carter proved to me that this book was thrown together. I wish I had waited before buying this book. Live and learn, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"This review is going to sound like the others...","review":"Good point: The plot is an interesting idea.Bad points: No background for the characters, jumps right into the story and the story does seem to end VERY swiftly.

This book was more like pre-chewed gum!Weak and not for a person NEW to the TV series. This is my first read from the book series and I hope the first three books were BETTER. Maybe starting from the beginning would have been better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now, don't say no one ever warned you ;)","review":"The book, The Morpheus Factor, left me speechless... and not in the good way. Sam seems to be cursed -- in this book she's refereed to as 'Amanda Carter' which gives me serious doubts about the author's familiarity with the characters. Daniel somehow went blonde. Jack and Frasier flirt. There are weird, endless dream sequences with seemingly no meaning. The plot was a joke and the conclusion nonexistent -- as though the author had simply up and stopped writing. It's not that I haven't read bad Stargate fiction before... it's just that before TMF, that fiction had always been free on the Net and written by unpaid fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful book!","review":"Seldom do you get such a clear idea of why a series of books has been discontinued. The author not only got several key details wrong (calling Daniel a blonde, at one point referring to Amanda Carter), but the story was convaluted and pointless. It seemed they pulled the resolution out of thin air. I don't know about you, but I prefer a little more thought to go into solutions. It also ended way too soon. How did they get home? How'd they get past the aliens? We don't know and, I believe, neither does Ms. McConnell.If they plan to make more Stargate SG-1 books, perhaps they could find someone who has actually seen an episode or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"does the author even know who the characters are?","review":"When the author used the name Amanda Carter, my suspicion that this novel was not all that good, was cemented.

Find a fanfic writer you like <or 2 or 3> and stay with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bitter disappoinment","review":"Devoted viewers of Stargate SG-1 will be dismayed by the rampant factual errors and wonder if the author has even once watched the show. Casual readers will be horrified by the lack of a plot. Readers new to the fandom will hope that the show isn't THIS bad. All will be pleased to know that (supposably) McConnell's contract to write these books has been cancelled (which might help explain the total lack of an ending)?You can find infinitely better stories about these characters written by fans, on the internet, for FREE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than The First Amendment","review":"This book was even worse than the last one. I waited alomst 6 months to buy this and it was an utter disappointment. It was either incredibly boring or just plain ridiculous. The aliens in the book seemed to resemble colorful Ewoks. Then, there were the dream sequences. These seemed to drag on forever and grew increasingly more stupid by the page. Such as O'Neill swimming with an Ewok transformed into an octopus. This novel seemed like a sick joke. I kept hoping as I read it, that I would wake up and find that it was just a horrible nightmare. Even more so as I found mistake after mistake. The ending seemed like something I would have expected from a Goosebumps book. I think it's time for the people at Stargate to hire a decent author like Peter David."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the others but not much.....","review":"No offence to the author but I think its time we had someone else take a crack at the SG-1 novel. As others have pointed out there were plenty of inconsistancies and downright errors. As I recall O'Neill keeps refering to Daniel as Jackson which seems kindoff formal. The Amanda Carter error really bugged me (Im a fan, what did you expect?). I agree that the ending was waaaaay too abrupt. There should have been at least 50 more pages wrapping up the story. After I read the last page I remeber thinking, \\"Where the heck is the rest of the book?\\". I found myself rereading the last few chapters to see if I had missed something. If this is going to be the norm for SG-1 novels in the future this fan is going to loose interest fairly quickly. At ten loonies a pop they are a likely to become a tough sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morpheus put me to sleep","review":"Is she kidding? This was worse than the last one of hers I read.

The plot was just so ludicrious that I didn't connect with the story at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"The characterization of the core characters is very good, and drew quite a few chuckles along the way. Sometimes, you can just picture the respective actor/actress saying those very lines. The ending however was too fast and too short, especially when the pace of the book only starts to take off towards the middle of the book. The romance angle is also rather inconsistent (based on having watched only the 1st & 2nd season of SG-1), I thought it was supposed to be slanted towards O'Neil and Carter (?). The latter half of the book has a tinge feel of Bill McCay's style and depth in his series of Stargate books (Incidentally, is he ever going to conclude his story arc?). Overall, it is a very enjoyable book and certainly recommended for fans of the TV series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashley is familiar with Solaris","review":"I see that the author appears to have read Solaris. Good,I can see references to it, in the way the SG-1 team reacts when they meet the aliens, and start having problems with lucid dreaming,which is by the way,readers,an actual military project.

The claim that socialist central planning dominated the 20th century from World War I to Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan is equally absurd. Although this DVD is purportedly about Economics, there is no discussion of the underlying numbers and statistics and no discussion of the role of technological change.

It's totally misleading on the subject of China & Deng Xiaoping. Using Lee Kuan Yew as the ONLY expert on China is definitely biased.I am in the middle of the 2nd disc.In all, I guess this program is a Euro-America-centric re-interpretation on the subject of \\"capitalism vs. socialism\\", which the West won by pure accidents, yet the authors were trying to rationalize this great event.I may change my impression after I finished the 3 discs in all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commanding your attention","review":"Free markets or central planning?

Competition is what drives productivity and quality improvements.3) Little mention of the level of corruption in many third world countries.

Previously the signal come through rabbit ears to a small TV. The station, by FCC regulation, changed from VHF (channel 6)to UHF (channel 15). The ad of the TV-1 does not show that an UHF loop is a separate piece. That piece must be attached with screws to the back of a TV set. As I recall UHF connections of this sort was possible on much older TV sets. I had purchased a new Samsung TV and there is no way I can attach the UHF loop. The TV-1 is worthless for my UHF use."},{"rating":"2","title":"No contest","review":"After trying several more complicated, more expensive antennas with my DTV box, this product produced the best picture and, relatively speaking, occupied less space and did not need to be plugged in. It is no substitute for cable or satellite, but works beautifully with the new boxes.

The first problem is that the cable that goes from the antenna to the TV is too short. It doesn't reach from the back of my TV, through the back of the entertainment center, to the top of the entertainment center. The antenna only picks up channels if it is on top of the entertainment center, but to hook it up there I have to have the cable go in front of the TV. The other problem is that the antennas only move side to side. They are not adjustable from front to back. I have only been able to get two channels. Overall, I haven't been impressed. I'm going to have to buy a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT so good","review":"I bought this based on reviews. It works, but not so good.

I have a Sony HDTV KDL26M4000 with in built HDTV tuner. First of all, the installation instruction is sketchy and confusing! There is no option on my HDTV of connecting VHF and UHF separately. The instructions that accompanied the product did not show with any helpful diagram how to connect. Also the product came with a loop (which I guess is the UHF loop). The installation intructions do not carry any information about how and where to attach it. None of the reviewer has mentioned anything about this either. With auto programming options, I could get only 3 channels coming clearly. I live in an open area without ant big tree or building and I tried with placing the antenna on my window shield! Can anybody help please?"},{"rating":"1","title":"UHF ok, VHF is separate with no attachment!","review":"I'm not impressed. This is a UHF antenna that comes with a completely separate VHF \\"loop\\" that you have to attach entirely separately directly to the back of your TV, and if your TV doesn't have the VHF screws on the back of it, there are no suggestions for other ways to attach the antenna--not that there is any SPACE among all the wires back there even if my TV had the screws...

I have tried it in Vermont, the Lake George area of New York, and Connecticut. It never pulled in more than 2-3 stations, and they were always full of snow.

The cushions are stained and worn-out after numerous washes. The trays, while we were using them, could never be set completing straight so cups and plates would slide off constantly making for even messier meals than you'd normally expect with a baby/toddler.

So, unless you are a walking dictionary or a grammar nazi (none of which I am, though closer to the first), make sure to have a reference source, like wikipedia or something. Other than that, it is great for beginners like myself to learn the Irish language and be able to form basic sentences. (Finally,someone who clearly explains how they make a sentence!

If someone transfers any interest without telling the bank, the whole mortgage could be called with 30 days notice. This might be ok if mortgage rates are falling, particularly if the buyer has good credit, but if that's the case, why wouldn't they want a new mortgage at a lower rate? If mortgage rates are rising, and the credit risks don't match current lending criteria (which is the case with lots of marginal borrowers when money is tightening), you could lose everything.I realize Mr. Cook doesn't want to face litigation for giving specific advice, but its really quite pointless to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Advertisement!","review":"The first few chapters peaked my interest and had me looking for more.

I don't know why some people put it down. I loved the nasty raptors and ferocious T-Rex, and of course the sex scene in the truck just before the girl's dopey boyfriend got ripped to pieces. And Dr. Hyde was a good villain. I also thought the blonde woman in it was hot, and that there were many cool quotes. And the guns? Forget it! They and their users were all that and a bag of chips.

Near the end, when a guy uses a forklift against a T-Rex, it looks so stupidly fake, you cant even see the person in the remote control forklift they are using.

They just took dino attack footage from Carnosaur (1993), Carnosaur 2 (1995), and Carnosaur 3: Primal Species (1996) and sandwiched it in between the poorly developed story and the even worse acting. I really don't understand why Raptor wasn't released as Carnosaur 4. Maybe Corman realized that not too many people liked the Carnosaur movies (but I liked them all), so he just slapped a new title on this stinking pile of poo to get more audience. Either that, or he didn't want to tick off whoever got the idea for the Carnosaur Box Set.So, I do not recommend this movie, unless you are a hardcore fan of B-movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raptor The Matchwork Movie.","review":"This is the most disgusting piece of movie directing & editing it has been my misfortune to see.

I use the scope to spot targets anywhere from 25-100 yards away and could easily spot up to 200 yards away.

I can use up to mid evening then the targets get harder to see hence dim light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ceiling fan!","review":"We installed this in our bedroom and it looks and functions beautifully. It is very quiet compared to the ancient one it replaced, and we love the remote. The only thing we didn't like was that it didn't come with a longer drop bar (I think the longer one included was only 6\\"). We have high ceilings, so a longer one would have been preferred, but we couldn't find one in a suitable color nearby. Despite that, it's still a great fan for the price and I would definitely purchase again.UPDATE 6/13/2012 - We loved this so much that we bought another one in the same color (brushed steel) for our living room, and we got the 12\\" down rod this time. It works just as well, but needed a shim since it hung lower. Even so, it is still quiet and cools our room down perfectly.

The only enjoyable things about it are the Chanel costumes and Seyrig's beauty which is definitely helped by lighting, make up, black and white film stock and the clothes. I fail to see the reason nearly everyone raves about this film. I speak French, am a filmmaker, and I understand and have read many reviews about what Resnais was attempting to tell us. The bottom line: this film is just flat out boring. If, in real life, you've visited a palace such as Versaille or chatted with a young woman in a beautiful dress at a social gathering, there isn't much impact for this film to make on you.Mozart said of music: \\"it should never be painful to the ear but should flatter and charm it, and thereby always remain music.\\"This applies equally well to the seventh art form and this film is painfully boring to sit through."},{"rating":"1","title":"94 Minutes of Torment","review":"I am an avid fan of foreign, avant-garde, bizarre, challenging and/or enigmatic films, but this one is just plain agonizing to watch.

Mishima's prose, as interpreted by Sargent, is striking, vivid, and ultimately quite beautiful. \\"Patriotism\\" is a tragic love story that is rich in eroticism.

The music sheets only have a short portion of the song and end before I think they should.

The first time we purchased it was for my step-son several years ago. The quality appears the same in this most recent purchase, which is for my daughter. The basic premise is simple - fill the flutes with water to desired level (it tells you the pitch) and when you blow into the flute, it produces the desired pitch. These are a long way from those little water filled bird whistles from when I was a kid.

Learning how to fill them and understanding the science behind them is truly great. The sound they make seriously gives me a headache whether he is using them appropriately or not. I highly advise if you buy these you plan on them for outdoor use. Also it is easy to accidently suck up water using them by mistake (or intentionally) so if you are going to use them I highly suggest truly non-toxic soap or plain wateer in a clean tub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work well and the kids love them","review":"These are a big hit during bath time with my 2 and 4 year old kids. They work just like described. The more water you add, the higher the pitch.We're currently working on blowing with \\"inside breaths\\" to make it more tolerable on me.

There are scenes from New Orleans that only a native, or visitor, could appreciate.I can't get over the pictures. So many favorites. So many memories. So many dreams....Canal Street will never be the same. And, plus, the street cars are back.

But Jim Reeves wasn't a mere country singer; he had a style more like a Perry Como but with heartfelt passion.

Other than that, Sam's comedy is unlike anything you will see today. He will really be thought of as a comedy legend. These DVD's will crack you up. I would recomend buying the Sam Kinison CDs, Live From Hell, and Have you seen me lately? The Cd's(just listen to them in your car or at home) will give you the complementary material you need(plus the HBO specials) to truely love Sam Kinison.

It is hard to stick a label to this music suffice to say that if you thought JJ Cale was laid back try this. It is entirely instrumental and includes one Taj Mahal number.

It is as good a listen as Songs From the Wood or Heavy Horses although somewhat darker. It's too bad the classic rock stations don't air anything from this album. I was delighted to finally be able to replace my vinyl copy of it. As always Ian Anderson's passion and humor show through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Tull Album","review":"Stormwatch seems to fly under the radar of most Tull fans. When I am in the mood for Tull, I often reach for other disks before I would grab Stormwatch. I am not sure why that is, Stormwatch is a very good album, the last of the 70's era Tull. The instrumentals on Stormwatch, Warm Sporran and Elegy, are fantastic! And the song Dark Ages is worth the price of the disk alone! I guess there just isn't anything that makes Stormwatch stand out like other Tull disks. If you are a Tull fan you have to own this one, if for nothing else that to hear John Glascock's last songs, and to hear Ian Anderson fill in on bass for most of the disk. Plus this is really the last Tull album that came out before plunging headfirst into the Keyboard and Synth heavy 80's.

This song is one of the highlights of the CD.Warm Sporran is another strong entry.\\"Somethings on the Move\\" is another great rocker and again has great flute, the way only Ian Anderson can play it.Dun Ringill is on this album and is one of my favorite Tull songs ever. Its an acoustic piece. Its played in the classic style that only Ian Anderson can do.Elegy closes the album.

I have quite a few Tull albums but have often come away disappointed.Stormwatch is a nice change. I've had the CD for years but have never really listened to it until recently. When I did, it sort of crept up on me. It is actually quite good. It is not This Was, it is not Aqualung, and it is not Passion Play. Yet, it is still Jethro Tull.

Katy rose is a great writer, and although she doesnt have the greatest vocal talent in the world, the music and the lyrics completely make up for it. One of the most beautiful song's on the CD is snowflake, with other amazing songs such as Glow, and Teaching my Self to Dream. Each and everysong has such a unique flavor to it, making it an awesome album. People say it's just a wannabe avril, or puk girl, but she is far from that. You should really give her a shot! it's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"something more than pop","review":"katy rose is one of the best new pop-rock artists i have heard in a long time. sure avril was ok for awhile, but katy rose is 5x better. on her first single, overdrive, she talks about everyone who goes to LA to get famous, but end up having their dreams crushed. many of the other songs on this album are great, and will work to make her more famous. over this is a great album that everyone should buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Avril","review":"Katy rose is one of the best artists ive heard in along time i first stumbled across her when i watched thirteen and mean girls and ever since i've been hooked.

She's just a wanna be Avril LAvigne and shes doing a really bad job of it.Dont buy this c.d!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off!!!","review":"Although I will give her a break for being able to play insruments instead of only being able to sing, she is certainly NOT ORIGINAL. There is no doubt she grew up listening to Veruca Salt or maybe her friends or parents did. Her first single is a complete Veruca salt rip-off in EVERY way; voice tone changes, music sound, song progressions (from verse-chorus-bridge) and that \\"yeah\\" added on at the end of many lyrics that is signature to Veruca Salt. Just take a listen to \\"Volcano Girls\\", \\"Seether\\" from two of VS's albums. You'll immediately hear the eerie resemblance.This continual \\"breakthrough\\" of new solo artists owes a lot to the groups like Veruca Salt, Juliana Hatfield, and others who got little radio play in the mid '90's and phased out by the record industry because all of the attention was either still on grunge or bubblegum boy and girl bands.Give credit where credit is due."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"All I can say is I cannot take one more artist that:1.

Take some voice lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh boy","review":"Katy Rose's music sucks. Does her band play the same thing in each song. She is boring and repeatative.

It all sounds the same, isn't challenging, different (and in this case, even CATCHY) and it sounds like the groundwork for a band soundtrack to an even worse teen movie.i give katy rose 7 months before she fades into obscurity.....if this album ever makes it off the ground.sorry...but i was expecting better. even for someone as young as her"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This was such a great album. My faves were definately I Like, Catch my Fall, Vacation, Teaching myself to Dream, Enchanted and Because I Can.Enchanted was such a beautiful song.

It made me jump up and dance and sing along with her.I hope you have another album coming Katy because I couldn't get enough of the first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Katy Rose","review":"I LOVE this Cd.

The book has woven into it many principles that I personally agree with. It's obvious from reading the other reviews Mangum has made at least one liberal mad. Well I say good for you Mangum Keep writing, we can't have enough reminders about good behavior and correct principles.

The author uses very complex mathematics, that most graduate and professors don't even understand. When coming up with the formula he skips steps that he assumes everyone knows how to do.

Even if it wants to be called a \\"movie\\", it is really bad in comparison to what is out there (seen thousands of those, most much better than this). Sure, the filming is technically pretty good, but that's about it. If you love paintball, don't waste your time. If you're thinking about playing paintball, don't waste your time. Try something like \\"Cereal Killerz\\", \\"Road to World Cup\\", or \\"Heroes for a Day\\".

Best-known and probably the best tune is \\"It's Bad You Know\\", played on WXRT in Chicago, who turned me on to the album.

A great airplane and vacation book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Good Things","review":"I'm sorry to say I was duped into reading this boook by all the good reviews on this page - but after struggling through the last 200 pages I can only think of a few good things: a terrific plot idea and a clever way to keep most of the characters straight by matching the first initial of their name with the first initial of their occupation (e.g., Nora - nun, Charles - CPA, Renee - realtor, etc.). But too many things fell apart in the middle of what started out to be fun. When Foster the fisherman just left the island and nobody ever noticed or wondered where he went - and when even the \\"Control\\" lost count of how many people were left alive, the book simply lost what little credibility it had. Like Reilly's Temple and Deitrich's Getting Back, the book had potential but didn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's time to leave, the tribe has spoken......","review":"If I could give this book 0 Stars, I would. I'm a HUGE fan of the show Survivor. When I heard about this book, I went to many book stores and libraries to find it. I finally did and was very excited to read it. I was very disappointed in t his books. This is nothing like Survivor or \\"reality shows\\". It alomst seems like the \\"reality\\" aspect was just an afterthought. What this is really about bioterrorism.The characters are so weak, and flat, its' not funny. They act in away that makes the characters unreal. The dialouge is flat people just dont' talk that way.I suggest that if you like shows like Survivor then stay away from this 24/7.*hold paper with 24/7 on it. It's time to leave, the tribe has spoken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like Survivor","review":"As a fan of reality tv, especially Survivor, I was excited when I found this book. I was so disappointed when I started reading it. This book is nothing at all like Survivor. In fact, this book is more about biological terrorism than reality tv. I know a lot of people gave this book good reviews, but it just wasn't at all what I was expecting. I don't recommend this one at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"When reality comes too close!","review":"Chilling what could someday be about a reality show gone chillingly *real*.

I think that if your in to reality TV, you'll enjoy it. It has an interesting concept and a decent enough plot. To me it seemed to somewhat linger, yet for fans of trapped and island like scenario's, you will be delighted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey So Far Back in Time","review":"This version of the Gilgamesh story is written for children as historical fiction. Told from the point of view of a young potter who learns to write and is commissioned by the queen to report back to her the events of a journey to the distant mountains, this story takes place in the city of Sumer which later became Babylon in what is now Iraq.The plot is interesting and insiteful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sincere but nothing unique","review":"This was a very short book. It took me less than half an hour to read it. My favorite thing about this book is the title. I agree with the message of this book but it isn't anything I haven't heard before. I've read a number of books related to women and spirituality, and Lynne Hybels' story is pretty typical. She seemed to convey a sincere awakening but it wasn't anything unusual. If you've never read anything related to women's spirituality and you don't like reading long books, this might be for you. But otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get moving!","review":"What I liked most about this book is that it motivated me to get moving. Over the past year, I've been on a journey of self-discovery and this book helped me verify a lot of important issues, the main one being that my voice does matter! It's short and so simple to read, yet filled with life long lessons. Who wants to watch life pass them by? Not me and obviously not Lynne Hybels either. I'd strongly suggest this book to read alone or in a book club. It's not set up for discussion, but there's no doubt that you'll have plenty to talk about. So, get moving!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Honest","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.

It reads more like a little devotional with very little substance. I expected more from the author and was very disappointed. I definitely do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far, the best boot I've ever worn","review":"I've been in the military for 8 years, and have gone through probably a dozen different types of boots. These are the best combination of price, comfort, and durability. The pair I'm about to retire have been going strong for almost 4 years, and in those 4 years the only issue is one of the boot laces frayed. I wouldn't recommend these as extreme cold weather boots because they lack the insulation to keep your feet warm in a Korean/Alaskan/Upstate NY winter. But for weather that's warmer then freezing, these are extremely durable. They've done dozens of 3-6 mile ruck marches, and a couple of 12 milers without any issues with my feet. They've also held up well through two deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, so if you require a durable boot that breathes well, and is comfortable to move in all day, this is a great boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great boots!","review":"This is my second pair of boots from Altama and they are fantastic.

PARABENS?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It smells like sweat to me","review":"This deordorant smells like sweat. When I put it on I just fell sweatier. Others may find the scent pleasant and the deodorant effective... me and my nose had the opposite reaction.The first day I tried it, I spent the day thinking I needed a shower. Instead of my usual moisturizing bar, for 3-4 days I used antibacterial soap. Didn't help. I was still \\"ripe.\\"I let it rest for a few weeks. Maybe it was reacting with some food.... Nope! Phew! Couldn't stand it!I tossed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective","review":"I'm sick with a cold, so I've mostly been sitting in bed the past two days while using this deodorant.

It just doesn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice smell, not strong enough","review":"I love the Jason brand products in general - especially the hair products.

I naturally dont sweat a lot and I have never had a lot of problems with that kind of stuff. So I thought why not try it? Trust me this stuff is disgusting! It made my armpits sticky and smelly. It doesnt do anything and makes everything worse. I have never had such smelly, sticky and slimy armpits before. Nasty! Thank god I didnt go to work that day. Even my husband made a remark if I have forgotten to use deodorant/shower today. I certainly do NOT recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"This deodorant does not last long enough and it completely discolored my skin. My underarms are way darker than the rest of my skin now and it started peeling so I stopped using it. It might work for some people but it didn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS!","review":"I love this Deodorant. The scent is fresh and for me it is long lasting. I work out, have a strenuous job, and stay fresh all day long. It is not an anti-perspriant so I do sweat, but I like to sweat it is what my body is supposed to do. I love the fact that this deodorant is all natural and keeps my underarms looking their best (no redness or irritation!) I really love the smell. Get it you will not be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long-time user","review":"Like that this product does not contain aluminum. It works fine for most days and has only a slight fragrance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth purchasing","review":"This deodorant smells really awesome on it's own, but when you put it on it doesn't block the smell of sweat at all, the smell of apricot and sweat just sort of mix together (as someone else mentioned) and you're left with this other strange smell that isn't really an improvement from not wearing anything at all. It also feels a bit greasy for a while after you put it on. I don't sweat much either because I'm almost always cold. Definitely won't be purchasing this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice smell, bad odor","review":"What's the point of deodorant if it doesn't work or last?I agree with another post that said it doesn't last long enough.Even with no sweating, no strenuous activity, no stress, and winter weather... odor still comes back within a few hours.I want to say it's almost better to use nothing at all.The standard 'salt/alum'-based deodorant \\"crystals\\" are WAY better than this.Granted, the salt crystals have no smell, but at least they prevent smell/odor well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisiting Liberia","review":"Although this is a fictional account, it really is about Liberia.

Differences abound, however, in Harlow's additions of relationship complexities and her drawing class and cultural tensions between various groups of islanders. The book reveals a great deal about life for fishermen on the island of Newfoundland and of the immigrant Irish culture. The book would probably be meant for a slightly older audience than \\"Wreck of the Ethie\\" because of the various group tensions, but I actually feel the this book does not do as good a job depicting the shipwreck (perhaps because the point of view is solely from the shore rescuers whereas the \\"Ethie\\" offers both points of view).

It is harder to describe a scene than to draw it. Still, this book just didn't meet my expectations. HB's \\"girlfriend\\" (also found in The Lost Army) isn't a particularly sympathetic character. I actually found her quite annoying. Hellboy's father Trevor Bruttholm(sp?) is also written badly, acting one way one moment, and in somewhat inconsistant way the next. He doesn't come across as the brilliant man he is repeatedly stated to be. The plot itself is okay, but it just seems to go on for about 60 pages too long, and you can see many of the plot developments coming a mile away. That might be alright if the writing drew me in a bit better, but it doesn't.So, if you are a big HB fan, and have loved Golden's other work, it might be worth giving this one a try, but I can't reccomend it.

This album is a reaffirmation of that fact, returning to the days of breezy melodies woven together from analogue synth effects. Beneath that, and slightly set against it, never enough to become fully jarring, is a series of rhythm arrangements that pulsate like a long-frozen clockwork heart, slowly warming up. Whatever the gliding beauty above, the undercurrent countermelodies have just enough chill to suggest that the wall of ice may be chipped in some places, but you won't get more than a touch of the girl beyond.

Granted, if all non-Schenker UFO is rubbish to you, this disc won't be capable of changing your mind. Regarding Pete Way comments, \\"The Writer\\" and \\"Dreaming\\" are both solid, and the fairly mellow \\"Back Into My Life\\" is one of Way's tunes.Measured up against some other Hard Rock of the day, say Def Leppard at the time ofHigh 'N' Dryand the Joe Lynn Turner Rainbow era, and you'll find yourself having an enjoyable listen, plus I'd also liked what teaming up with then UFO Keyboard/Guitarist Neil Carter did for Gary Moore's output (Wild FrontierandRun for Cover).Expensive for sure, but perhaps with the recent run of UFO extra-track remasters this too may be added-- so long as folks quit ragging on this one.

I might go as far to say the sweetest ballad (slower tune) ever recorded by UFO was \\"Back Into My Life\\" #3 on the CD. If you'r looking for old school UFO you won't find it here.

There's also a cover song, \\"Something Else\\", that sounds good, it's pure rock and roll.Ther rest of the songs have a special hard punch, with all the members delivering the goods. Phil Mogg's voice is absolutely crystal clear and strong here. As for Paul Chapman, of course he could not compete with Michael Schenker's virtuosity, but the good thing was: he did not even try! Instead of trying to emulate the master, Chapman instilled the songs with his particular signature and style, and the result was very satisfatory, displaying well constructed and melodic solos.MECHANIX is one of those lost gems that sometimes we find around.

I suggest spending a few bucks more and getting a better quality meter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal!","review":"Having made my living in electronics for over 40 years I have worked with equipment of all manufacturers. I have used expensive equipment and cheap equipment. I have used well made equipment and poorly made equipment. I have read the other reviews of this meter and find some of them amusing. This is a cheap meter. It is not the best made meter either. But the price is also cheap. If I had paid $150 for it I would have been outraged. But for the price I paid it is an excellent value. It is easy to use, is sturdy enough for general purpose work, and its accuracy is sufficient. It was not built to be a $150 dollar meter either. I like it. It does the job I bought it for. And, yeah, I'd buy it again. I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok; kind of.......","review":"Well, this thing is not that much reliable due to either loose connectors or generally malfunctioning device to rely on when needed. In other words this type of multimeter would sometimes read voltage parameters and in most cases it wouldn't and when it happens than you need to start playing with its connectors in order to make it working which as the outcome is definitely not a good product by any stretch of imagination. My final review words are that 'I would rather like to send it back for a full refund'.

It does everything I need it to (dc V&A, ac V&A, resistance, continuity (with audible tone), and a really effective cap tester). I haven't tried the IC/transistor tester yet, but all other functions have worked great. Only down sides are the test leads are rather difficult to snap into and out of the multimeter. I guess that means they have a great connection but I'm sometimes afraid that I'm pushing so hard I'll break the meter. Also, the image is slightly misleading, I was expecting the shell to be blue, instead it's kind of a weird orangeish yellow. All in all though it's a great meter for the money ($20)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"Works just fine for V,A and Om. I haven't tried various fused/unfused combinations, but i think it'll work. It's kind of big, which is not so apparent from the picture. it's like half of a regular desktop keyboard. Looks solid and firm, but when you touch it, it's cheap feeling, but as one of the reviewers noted - you get what you pay - no one should expect super quality from a 19.99 item (that's what i paid). The soft protecting thing (blue on the picture; mine is orange) is helpful and there is a small leg that opens on the bottom, so you can place the meter on reasonable viewing angle as opposed to just laying it flat on the table.The reason why i gave 4 stars is that the reading screen is screeched and there are a few dust or whatever particles stuck on the screen (as if the item has been used before) that does not destruct overall readings, though. Maybe it's the peculiarity of my item, but it is there and somehow ruins the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but cheap and overpriced.","review":"Battery was DOA and it's cheap.

This worked about as long as the original battery did after being fully charged. My main complaint is that I get intermittent warnings to replace the battery even when it has just been charged ... or I get a message telling me to insert a battery when one is already in the camera. So there is some sort of miscommunication but the battery does hold a charge - it is just very annoying to receive an error message while trying to capture a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best spa music out there...","review":"I was given this series at the last ISPA convention for my Buddha Spa.

Really, what ruined this for me, I think, besides the fact that it's boring, is that I purchased and listened to Evoken's Quietus before this album. As far as I am concerned, Evoken are the reigning gods of funeral doom. In fact, they really need to come out with another darn album.

Because of the rules of Islamic law it is much worse to have children abducted to the Middle East than to other places. However it is important to realize that all the Arab countries are not identical and that their legal systems may have very different characteristics, laws, traditions, etc. While Islamic law is normally cited as a basis for the Arab secular laws it is interpreted very differently in different countries.

As the cover of the book lets you know in no uncertain terms, the enigmatic Chad, who was previously seen as someone who had no supernatural abilities whatsoever (remember how he had to be told where to punch in his first battle with a hollow?), may actually be far more important to everyone's safety than we thought. Meanwhile, Uryu challenges Ichigo to a test to see which group, the Quincies or the Soul Reapers, is more efficient at dispatching hollows. Ichigo accepts, with dire consequences (but sets up a multi-book story arc, so there you go).

It is faily inexpensive, but you will want to expand the memory (Compact Flash) which now is fairly cheap, but you will need several at 64mb. Sound is barely audible. If your budget is tight and this is all you can afford; wait a year until better products fall into this price range. You will be much happier and won't have to dispose of this unit. Our solution was to buy a well rated low end dvd unit for around $400. This is for the family, but she can use it.

However, if this part is not placed precisely, or if the strainer part is not exactly where it should be, it doesn't spin. And even when it spins, it doesn't seem to have the same power as the Oxo I had formerly, and it takes many spins to dry the lettuce. Tonight, after less than two months of ownership, it broke. Unlike the Oxo, which works with a pump action, this Rosle has a pull cord, and now I cannot get the pull cord to retract. Tomorrow I will go find a stainless Oxo one.

There was alot of build up between the hero & heroine but then, like letting the air out of a tire, the heat would just go flat!

Perhaps the most impressive thing about it is that 2002 did not use any nature recordings; all sounds are by musical instruments and wordless vocals, which makes the imagery linked to the ocean even more astonishing.

Instead this book provides nothing more than a rehash of the documentation with extremly simplistic samples. The section on \\"Code Behind DHTML\\" is a mere 3 pages (should be a large chapter) and is totally incorrect - based on Preview 1 information. There is nothing on deployment. The so called Advanced topics are really Beginner at best. One of my team members just said he was going to throw his away.

I used some rustoleum (I got a clear spray at Home Depot) to protect the \\"galvanized\\" metal. Still shows rust.The double gate kit? It states easy as 1-2-3 with images. The problem is that there are no pre-drilled holes for the drop-rod kit, but you have to drill through the metal gate assembly yourself (of course, there's another spot for potential rust).

For a first-timer, preparation is essential.This book lays out the basics of the deposition process and gives helpful hints to avoid common mistakes that people make at depositions.

The album's closer, \\"Innocence is Beautiful,\\" is about as perfect a song about your children as have ever been written (every bit the equal of Al Jolson's \\"Sonny Boy, but without being so maudlin\\"). And having seen Grushecky perform in person, I can attest that he is a much better guitarist than his friend Springsteen.If you've never heard Grushecky and The Houserockers, get this album today.

You're better off just going to your local dollar store and buying any shampoo.I've bought dozens of products through Amazon over the last few years and this is the first one that I hate and makes me feel like I've been ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly different","review":"Not exactly as the last shampoo!!!

This makes it really hard to find a good shampoo. This product was a god send! My hair feels so clean, like I just went to a salon. It gives my hair a lot more bounce and has made it so soft! As fair as adding thickness, I can't say yet. I've been using it for only 3 weeks - so far it has given my hair body but mostly because it's been making it so clean and soft. I can only assume the new hair growing in will be thicker. That aside I would highly recommend this to anyone with thin,flat, easily dirtied hair like mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I hate this shampoo. It smells like cheap dish soap and cleans like it, taking all of the good oils out of my hair. And it seems as though more of my hair is falling out, unlike what other reviewers say.

I never noticed any difference in the thickness of my hair. I did in fact notice that it made it a ton easier to pull my hair out (not matter how gentle I was) when I was shampooing with this stuff; a lot of hair came out, which is scary! I gave up and went back to Neutrogena Shampoo and my hair stopped coming out.Side note: Well, at least the shampoo didn't smell and Jason's thin to thick Conditioner seems to work much better; although I can't tell if it has helped with the thickness part...sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frizzy, flat, super dry hair","review":"I really like that this product is good for the environment, but i absolutely hate what the product did to my hair.

I have not found this to be any sort of real scalp therapy that works. It is a nice light shampoo, smells pretty good even though there is tea tree oil in it, but it does not work as advertised. I am now using homeopathic remedies on my itchy, dry scalp such as applying this: Simmer 12 tbsp. plain, old fashioned oatmeal in 6 cups boiling water for an hour. Strain oatmeal, reserving the cooking water to which you then add 5 drops rosemary and 5 drops lavender oil. I have also substituted warm virgin olive oil for those two oils, and mixed 1/2 C. of the reserved oatmeal water with 6 Tbs. apple cider vinegar. Allow mixture to cool before applying to scalp. Leave in hair at least 10 minutes before washing out. You can use this once a week to relieve dry scalp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered and not as advertised","review":"I ordered what is pictured on Amazon, Jason Natural Cosmetics Shampoo, Tea Tree Oil Hair and Scalp Therapy with the bear on the blue bottle.

The sweat bacteria infected my hair follicles and it won't go away. I've had to wash my hair every single day even when I didn't work out and it was still a problem. I was searching for a natural remedy to cure my situation, not just mask it. I have used this shampoo now for 2 weeks and I haven't felt this good in so long!! I still have a couple little itchy spots and I haven't attempted to skip a day of washing just yet, but I don't sit at my desk at work all day scratching my head anymore!

I used this shampoo for several days in hopes it would \\"normalize\\" my scalp. As a result, my hair was left very dry and frizzy. The worst part was that after a few days my scalp became extremely itchy and dried out. Brushing my hair produced massive amounts of dandruff. I actually started using the shampoo on my feet to cure my athletes feet. I guess the shampoo has anti-fungal properties. I would suggest using Joico Daily Care Treatment Shampoo instead.

It not only smells great but leaves a refreshing feel even after each use. My scalp can get very itchy and dry, especially when it is hot outside. After using this for a couple weeks my head doesn't itch at all anymore. Tea tree oil rocks! I just wish I would have found out about this stuff years ago. my roommate turned me on to it initially for acne and skin care (100% Australian Tea Tree Oil + FREE Tea Tree Oil Soap Bars). I used the oil on my face for less than a week and my face literally looked ten times better than it had probably ever.

My husband and I thought she wasn't washing her hair good enough and had really been on her about doing a better job. But after washing it twice myself, I realized something else was going on. We tried three different shampoos and none of it mattered. Then, I looked up on the internet and discovered that she might have some kind of fungal problem. So I ordered this shampoo after reading a recommendation for it. My daughter has now used it three times. After the first time, the smell was completely gone!

I thought itchy scalp was just something I had to live with until I tried a shampoo from Pytho that actually controlled the itching. Unfortunately that shampoo was discontinued. From then on I had went on a search for a shampoo that can tackle my itchy scalp.I tried Garnier Dandraff shampoo, Neutrogena T-Gel, Jason scalp therapy, and even some African black shampoo. None could control the itch in any reasonable degree. Neutrogena seem to perform better, while Jason performed worse than regular shampoo. Maybe the Jason shampoo was meant for dry hair?Finally tried this one called \\"Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength Anti Dandruff Shampoo\\" and finally I'm back to having no itchy scalp.Of course, different shampoo works for different folks. My only advice is to try the cheaper shampoo first before moving up to ones that cost 15 or 30 dollars a bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I was having trouble with an itchy scalp so I did some research about remedies and this particular item popped up.

It has a horrible chemical odor...EXACTLY like pesticide. I tried a few more times to stomach it, but just can't do it.

In my view, the large collection of songs are rather hit and miss, but not a bad value forthe price. Highlights include Elisir, Gong-Oh, Alle Prese con una Verde Milonga, and Ballato Di Tutto. Best songs keep to his rhythmic swingand pulsating piano with catchy key changes. There's also some nicestand-up bass and guitar on a few tracks. Songs fall flat when tooexperimental with voice or tacky musical stylings.

First, at times, Otis is not easy to read. Better editing would have helped. Secondly, Otis mentions the dangers of materialism in American society, but fails to elaborate much on this topic.

Luscious Jackson's song is a one-note throwaway. Track 8, by Oh, is a monotonous two-note, 6-minute techno noodle.

It says my \\"HD Connection\\" is \\"low.\\" Which basically means sorry about our crap-tastic connection to you, but heres an \\"HD\\" video that looks like someone recorded it with the first cell phone camera. For giggles I test my FiOS connection (25/15) and actually get 31/23. So, as I figured, its not my ISP. So I try to download it to watch it in the quality I PAID FOR and they wont even let me do that without installing software.... So I can buy items and use them, buy MP3s and play them where I want, but one damn show and I have to jump through hoops and install invasive software (I read up in it before I agreed to install it) to watch something I just paid for.

But this \\"book\\" is an really an extended New Yorker article with far too much focus on MLK's funeral and irrelevant context with Dinah Washington and Billie Hollday - just how many times do we need to know that wx-DJ Louise Bishop is now a member of the House of Representatives?

Buy the DVD of Tom Dowd - it's cheaper and much more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some oldies but goodies, some filler","review":"Most of the CD is great; the only 2 tracks that slightly disappointed were reduxes of \\"Just Like Me\\" (Paul Revere & the Raiders) and \\"Helter Skelter\\" (Beatles). Not done badly; just was a slight letdown from the unique compositions of her 1st \\"In the Heat of the Night\\". Maybe ran out of original material for this album? \\"Fire & Ice\\", \\"Promises in the Dark\\" familiar tunes.

Still one of my favorite Benatar albums overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"Yes, this is an admittedly \\"odd\\" disc, but that does not in any way mean it's bad. There are a couple megahits, \\"Promises In The Dark\\" and \\"Fire And Ice\\". The rest are either obscure, or overlooked due to the two megahits, however this is actually a great album. Everything's well-balanced and it's the perfect length of time. All the songs are amazing, except \\"Evil Genius\\", which is remarkably out of place, or so it seems. This is my favorite album by my 7th favorite artist of all time. I must say I love the Beatles, but her \\"Helter Skelter\\" cover is mindblowing. It sounds like the original needed to sound. Awesome album, listening to it ASAP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dear","review":"As much as I love Benatar, this CD is not worth the plastic it was burned onto. The ironic thing is that it was her only No.1 album. It sounds very amateur (asides from a cracking version of the Beatles' Helter Skelter). Fire & Ice may have won a grammy, but all I can think is that the charts were lean on quality songs that year. Anyone who knows me knows of my undying love for Pat & Neil. This album is not testimony as to why........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precious Time","review":"This is Pat Benatar at her finest! From Promises in the Dark to her excellent cover of the Beatles Helter Skelter this album is great from beginning to end and perfect to take along on a road trip. It will keep you rocking from beginning to end. If you don't own anything else by her, this is the album to start your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Benatar Time","review":"Pat Benatar released a string a solid & successful hard-rocking albums in the early 80's with Precious Time being the best of the bunch. \\"Promises In The Dark\\" is a frenzied rocker that starts the album on a good foot. \\"Fire & Ice\\" follows it and is a great showcase for her powerful voice. The song's title fits the pace of the song as it coolly slithers along before Ms. Benatar heats things up in the chorus. The title track is a solid rocker, but she missteps on the cover of The Beatles' \\"Helter Skelter\\" as she misses the down & dirty feel of the original. She does better on a cover of an old Paul Revere & The Raiders' \\"Just Like Me\\" singing with an appropriate amount of sass. Precious Time was her only number one album and it established as the queen of rock for her era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat Benatar's Third Great Album In A Row","review":"PRECIOUS TIME is Pat Benatar's third great CD in a row. \\"Promises In The Dark\\" is about betrayal and deceit, and the title song is a woman calling her man out on his unfaithful behavior. This album, which seems influenced by Steve Miller circa BOOK OF DREAMS, Foghat's FOOL FOR THE CITY, and the harder side of Heart, was Benatar's last great album. She put out some excellent ones after this, but never quite attained the quality and consistency of the first three again."},{"rating":"1","title":"really flimsy & need support underneath","review":"The material of this spice shelf is really really flimsy and made of real cheap plastic. I put several small spice bottles on the top level of the shelf and the whole shelf sank. You need to put something underneath to support it so it will not go down from the weight of your spices.

It should worth 50 cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive Ska","review":"This is one of the most unique ska albums ever recorded. Naturally, the critics beat it into the ground because The Selecter dared to break the mold. It's especially depressing given the rave reviews Too Much Pressure, a by the books ska project, got back in the day.I have this edition of the CD. The bonus material is nice, but it's the original album you'll want to hear over and over again. Songs like Deep Water and Red Reflections give me the chills every time I hear them. It's very intense, emotional music.I'd like to live in an alternative universe where this album was praised the day it was released. It could have really opened up a new path for ska, which has essentially remained exactly the same for the life of the genre, except for this album. Some bands have moved beyond ska, but only The Selecter dared to expand and evolve the genre. it's too bad they were punished for it, when they should have been richly rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ska with a creepy edge.","review":"Those of us accustomed to the fun loving beat ska of Prince Buster, The Skatalites, The Specials, and the skinhead fun of Symarip will be put off when first listening to this album. There is fun to be had here, with lively beats and those orgasmic bass lines that make ska one of my favourite styles, but there is a much darker, more sombre edge to this album than to most ska. The music is haunting, intruding, not the carefree skanking tunes we are used to. The lyrics of ska have always been darker than the music, but in this case the music meets the lyrics emotionally, making an innovative and at times brilliant album. I have the vinyl version, I just got it for five dollars, so I don't know about the asterisked tracks, but the original version is overall quite good, an interesting addition to a true ska lover's collection. When just getting introduced to the style, The Specials or Skatalites might be better representatives, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basketball Pro","review":"I think this is a good book.

Or else they're gonna lose even more customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"BC-21e cartridge expensive, junk","review":"My condolonces if you own any Canon printer that uses this cartridge. It is so unreliable. I've seen 2 BC-21e cartridges (not to be confused with the ink tanks that go in it) fail, after very light use - after just a few replacements of the ink tanks. There's no excuse for a $50 \\"non-disposable\\" part to fail so readily, after barely any use. The Multipass C-530 printer only cost $, so we won't be throwing good money after bad. NO MORE Canon printers! Next time it's an HP or Epson. (Had an Epson Stylus Color for 5+ years before I gave it away, still working good as new.) If you only print occassionally, inkjets in general are not the way to go. Laser printers are much more dependable, and can sit around longer and still work when you need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just pure garbage","review":"Canon makes things that look good in the store, seem reasonable on the price, but when you take them home, they fall apart. Such is the case with the BC-21e cartridge. This thing cost as much as the printer itself, and mine FAILED after only 3 replacements. I don't abuse my equipment. I use it for normal tasks. Canon's product was just not ready for regular use.It would be nice if most people are as fortunate as the last reviewer, who has been able to use this past 5 ink-cartridge changes. Unfortunately, from my experience, I think that's more the exception to the rule.Stay away from Canon. It's a roll of the dice that you are probably going to end up losing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Cartridge","review":"I maintain and use 5 printers that use the Canon BC-21e cartridge. These cartridges sometimes fail before the replaceable ink tanks are empty to a maximum of 5 tank changes (using genuine Canon BCI-21 ink tanks). The longest life that I have seen is by refilling the tanks before they run out(between 3 and 10 refills).I have been using Canon bubble jets since the BJ10ex and have had few problems apart from the short life of the BC-21e cartridge. I don't know what actually fails in the print heads but they generally fail with the printer unable to detect the cartridge type and refusing to operate until a replacement is fitted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but trouble","review":"I have owned a Cannon BJC-4100 printer and now have a BJC-5000. Low price was the main reason I purchased them but for the troubles I am having with the print cartridges I am going to purchase anything but a Cannon printer.First of all, when ever the ink tanks run out you either install a new one right away or end up with a line across every picture you print. This is actually the best you can expect be cause the other thing that can happen is the print head gets gummed up with ink that drags across the paper making a big mess.Secondly, any long periods of inactivity causes one or all of the colors to stop printing even with full tanks leaving to other choice but to replace the entire print head assembly.Lastly, no matter how much cheaper the color and black ink cartridges are than the print head, after two or three cartridge changes the print head is shot costing ... if you have a BJC-5000.Maybe other Cannon print catridges are better, but I can't afford to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for saving me money and hassels!","review":"After reading the other reviews, I've decided to box up thisBJC2110 and drop it off at the thrift store.

The ink isn't too expensive, especially at warehouse clubs - but these cartridges are really a hassle, and WAY expensive.On top of this - I've never seen or heard printers that seem to have more wasted motion.

But I have a question: does it make a difference if one removes the cartridge to install ink tanks (as the directions say), or if one installs the tank with the cartridge still in place (as I did)?

They agree, in the main, with the 10,000 BC date for the end of the Ice Age, and contend that civilization is much older than is generally believed.The makers of this DVD seem to be promoting the view of James Nienhuis that the Ice Age ended much later, around 2,000 BC, which is not supported by any scientific evidence that I'm aware of. Out of curiosity I googled this author and sure enough, he's a Christian fundamentalist seeking to prove the Biblical creation story.Anyone trying to decide if there's any truth in the legends of Atlantis would be well advised to look further afield, and further back in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the alton ellis song alone.....","review":"I thought this was a great buy. I haven't heard some of these tracks since I was a kid. A good number of these artists bring on the funk. I love each artist's take on the Beatles. On the 3rd cd Alton Ellis brings the fever. His take on \\"And I Love Her\\" is hotter than the Beatles could even imagine. That was the jam back when. Not every song is stellar, but overall I'm happy that I bought it.

After using Pureology Hydrate, I don't have any remaining hairspray or mousse flakes and my scalp doesn't dry out. I'd recommend this shampoo and the matching conditioner to anyone!!

Blige to perform the classic \`Can't Knock the Hustle'. The result is a short but sweet CD with Jay not missing a beat. While most mainstream rappers need flashy lights and naked dancers at concerts to spark excitement, all Jay needs is a mic and an audience. You can tell the crowd is excited to be there (even through the CD) and they sing along and interact with one of the all time greats. It is somewhat a promo spot for his recently released at the time \`The Blueprint', but it's also a summary of his career up to that point. If you're a fan of Jay-Z then this is a must buy because it shows his love for the game, and even an emotional moment when he performs \`Song Cry'.

In a way Cabell does a credible examination of Dante, he suggests that Hell is made in Jurgen's fathersmind-something that children are taught at an early age-and the Devil is merely a shadow of God.I wish Albrecht D��rer's illustrations were part of this volume too.The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation, Bilingual Edition (English and Italian Edition)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and laudable translation of a great classic","review":"Pinsky's verse translation is absolutely splendid. The words seem to flow off the pages with a grace that is unparalleled in many of the modern translations that find their way into circulation. Reminiscent of the Loeb Classical Library, the Italian text is found on the opposite of the English translation and if perchance the reader knows Italian they may find this an added luxury. Pinsky has done an excellent job of keeping the translation simple yet beautiful at the same time.

In any case, everyone in his family (except his brother Ben) is extremely hateful towards her, causing her to call her sister (Claire Danes) for moral support and move into a hotel for the duration.The whole thing about the bedrooms is silly. Why can't the two brothers share? Why can't the two girls share? Why is the gay deaf son with a hearing man? That's not likely.

The plot features a man bringing his fiance home for Christmas to meet the family. The sad part is the people are all middleaged, but behave worse than kids. The groom to be's brother falls in love with the fiance after observing her drunk and dirty dancing. His receding hairline reminds us he is too old for this nonsense. Next the groom to be falls in love with his fiance's sister. One wonders why he is smitten as the sister is masculine enough to compete in Roller Derby. And how many comedies end with mommy dying of cancer? As for political correctness the producers covered all their bases with one actor who is gay, handicapped and black. Appealing scenery, costumes, background music and good acting are absent. This is a movie I consider pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Family Has to be Stoned to Enjoy The Family Stone.","review":"I rented this movie yesterday only to realize that I'd rented it last week, except it was called In Her Shoes and about one star better than this. Okay, I felt sorry for Sarah Jessica Parker's character, but this movie was sad in that it wasn't one bit moving or convincing. You could see which brother was going to end up with which sister the moment both pairs first laid eyes on each other, and Diane Keaton's skunk hair was almost as distracting as her mere presence is in most films. She was dying in THIS movie? Let's go way back to Annie Hall and tell me that again. There is more chemistry between two 300 year-old corpses than any of the cast members of this so-called comedy (I laughed once), and it's a waste of time for somebody as talented as Craig T. Nelson. I agree with another reviewer here; want a good Christmas themed movie with several characters and storylines that are both funny and touching? Get your hands on Love Actually instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST movies - One of My Favorites!","review":"Despite of all the other NEG reviews - this movie is one of my favorites. I have watched it 6 times on HBO and just decided to out right buy it! It's a keeper for the DVD library. This movie is about FAMILY. Dysfunctional...maybe, but WHO lives in a \\"Brady Bunch\\" family? As far as I am concerned ALL and MOST families have DRAMA in them and that's what makes them family. This story is about a family dealing with there own share of DRAMA. As a matter of fact, I see a couple of my family members in this family:-) See it and enjoy - it is truly a GREAT film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda movie","review":"After all the cruel treatment Sarah Jessica Parker's character endures throughout the movie, I was waiting for that satisfying ending where she is finally warmly accepted by the family and amends are made on both sides, but we are denied that. Despite her flaws, one ends up rooting for Parker's character, who is trying hard to please but just doesn't have the charm and wit to win over her fiance's family. We are sympathetic towards her because the family members are downright nasty and judgemental and gang up on her just because she clears her throat annoyingly. I can't help but think that this movie, based on savoring the misery of one character at the hands of the others, was a venue for liberals to unleash their hostilities toward conservatives. Attempts at glorifying the liberal family end up showing them to be intolerant, mean-spirited and uncouth instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I left the theatre in almost a lost for words","review":"I can't imagine how ANYONE could give this movie a positive review.

They use every emotional trick they can to make you cry. The saddest thing about this movie was how little I cared about any of the characters or what happened to them. My entire film class agreed. I would give this movie a negative rating if I could. I'm not the snooty critic type either- I enjoy cheap laughs or cheap cries. This movie has nothing to offer more than a few celebrities.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first 20min were good","review":"This movie started off so good and then it just completely fell apart. Once Luke Wilson comes into the picture and sees Sarah Jessica Parker you pretty much know how this movie is going to turn out. And then her fiance gets his first glimpse at her sister and he's already found a new love. I just didn't buy it at all. What I really liked watching was Sarah Jessica Parker as this shy, out of place person trying to fit into this family. But in the end, we never really get to see her accepted as one of them. We never get that moment between her and Diane Keaton. The movie just skips ahead a year after she's dead and everybody has moved on. Really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood takes the joy out of Xmas","review":"I too had an open mind to this movie. But your mind can be open only so much. Let me first state, that this movie had a chance if it had a \\"hopeful/holiday\\" script. (They defintiely had the actors). But it doesnt have hope, instead the plot takes you into an area that is dark, sorrowful, and depressing with some bigotry on the side. It is by far the worst Xmas time movie I have ever seen. I call it an xmas movie because they promoted as such, and it came out during the holidays. Definitely avoid this one, unless you feel like being pushed over the edge and out a window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Wretched","review":"I can't believe I wasted my time watching this trash. Evidently some Hollywood moron thought meshing all of these wonderful actors into one movie would instantly create a blockbuster. Wrong! The family is so horribly judgemental and unyielding that I literally wanted to throw something large and heavy through the screen. I couldn't even finish watching this disgusting excuse for entertainment. For those of you who said that people who don't like this movie don't get it, you are mistaken. Yes the mother's illness was tragic and something that a family should never have to endure, but that is no excuse for the petty, nasty behavior that was displayed. All of the actors are better than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY IMPLAUSIBLE","review":"There's NO WAY this could happen in real life.

I guess maybe some things looked better on paper than they actually turned out to be. If you enjoy seeing miserable people making each other miserable then this might be the movie for you!

The only reason I can imagine why this movie got any good reviews at all is because people that stand to benefit from the movie's success are padding the vote. The reasons the family doesn't like Meredith are rediculous (clearing her throat????). The big blow up at the dinner table over the question \\"why would you want your child to be gay?\\" made me want to eject the dvd and break it in half. And then, as if things weren't horrible enough, Meredith's sister shows up and everyone turns into swingers (Meredith hooks up with the brother and Everett hooks up with the sister) one night out of the blue.

Please save your money for a better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Trailer's Better","review":"Gosh its was promising but they did it all wrong!Im not giving anything away but if you want to see a movie full of annoying characters (no one you will like,really) and unrealistic situations,then check this one out.Forget the cast,this one is BAD.Dont waste your money.Trust me,I started watching this movie expecting to have an enjoyable 90 minutes and I finished it feeling annoyed.So there,you've been warned.And yes,im one of those people who felt relieved,Diane Keaton's character died in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving Trailer","review":"Family Stone is similar to Rumor Has It, great cast and potentially great story line, tagged as a romantic comedy. But in actuality Family Stone just like Rumor Has It, is just a melodrama with a side of comedy. It's two somber and depressing for me I expected light, funny, good feel movie, what I got was a downer, depressing, mother dying film that ended not making you feel great but all sad cause the mom dies. They need to start advertising these movies for what they are melodramas with actors that usually play comic roles. The movie is boring, long, and drawn out don't wasted your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"What a warm touching movie. Great acting.

The movie arrived when it said it would and it was in great condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only I could GIve Zero Stars","review":"Oh the Family Stone....This movie was marketed as a comedy. This movie may have a few funny moments...but for the most part is a family drama. I was expecting laughs, not tears of sadness. I also bought this to watch this expecting it to be funny, not about cancer and death...which was upsetting to some other viewers in my household. About the other themes within the movie, some of the political correctness of the characters was soooooo over the top....and most of the time I was pitying Parker's character and cheering for when the mother and nasty sister would be seriously hurt. I almost cheered at the end of the movie, no wait I did for two reasons, the mean mother was gone and the movie was finally over and I could return it immediately to the video store!! Wish I could get my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A TERRIBLE waste of time....","review":"This movie was terrible!

Oh yeah, now I remember. The funniest scene in the movie was when the entire Stone Family was shocked, yes shocked, that Sara Jessica Parker questioned whether the gay deaf brother and his lover should maybe think about the child first before considering adopting a baby together. The only normal person in this movie was SJP, even though she was made out to be the freak. Oh well, that's Hollyweird for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUDGE IT FOR YOURSELF!","review":"It seems everyone has a strong opinion on this film..as I do also...I loved it, didnt expect to like it as much as I did...matter of fact came here to amazon to buy a copy. I was totally shocked to see the mixed reviews, as much as I enjoyed this film...It does deal with a lot of sensivitive areas, and maybe that scares a lot of people. If your open minded, and have a HEART...you will love this movie as a lot of others did. Dont let the others discourage you, judge this one for yourself!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Press for America's moral decay","review":"How can one feel anything but sick inside when the realization comes that this movie states very clearly where we are as a nation with respect to family and morality. We think we're getting better as a people by being accepting of what should be unacceptable, but the truth is that the more we embrace \\"anything goes\\" we lose our ability to function responsibly. We willingly sacrifice the possibility for a future in exchange for our temporary pleasures. It hasn't worked for any previous society and it doesn't and will not work for any of us. This movie is an example of Hollywood advertising FAIL as acceptable. I came from FAIL and don't care to see it portrayed in a good light. Some have commented that they think the movie is \\"real\\". They're absolutely correct, and that's my point. I wish it wasn't so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Family Stone presents a wrong message to family systems","review":"The movie Family Stone present a wrong message to family systems.The union of a man and a woman in marriage is the center of a real family and contributes to life reproduction.

Well played, and life like. Definitely not a comedy.This is a movie which may creep into your favorites group. It has done soin my case.Do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"I was not expecting much other than boy friend points when I took my girlfriend to see Family Stone. The previews did not do the movie justice. This was not another piece of light hearted comedic fluff.Instead the I was treated to a serious story with moments of levity and intensity. All of which could be related to. The characters are not perfect, they all have personality flaws which makes them seem real. The plot does not entirely follow the standard format, throwing several unexpected events at you. And the store line is not taking place in a $500k house that most Americans could not afford. It is a very down to earth relateable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Family Stone","review":"I love this movie, it made me laugh and cry sometimes laugh till I cried. Wonderful cast! Would love to see a part 2!! :):)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three cheers for Diane Keaton","review":"Another astonishing performence by Diane Keaton. Even though she is almost 60 she can still give a heck of a performence. It is her best since Something's Gotta Give. She plays Sybil Stone\\"The Mother\\" of 5 loving children. Her favorite son comes home to ask for \\"The stone\\" so he can propose to his gilfriend. She wouldn't allow it because no one in the family liked her including herself. Having cancer doesn't make it easy for the family. Slowly the family members start to figure out the moms secret. As the Christmas holidays go by and the moms life fades and fades away. She learns to get along with the bride to be(Sarah Jessica Parker). She finally gives her son the ring because she's dying and she only wants her son to be happy. The son ends making a better choice for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have to see","review":"One of my all time favorite movies! It's funny, sad, romantic and when a little action packed.

Love this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart & funny","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. Sarah Jessica Parker's performance is dead-on. The girl who is uptight, judgemental and prudish (Sarah Jessica Parker) meets the family of her boyfriend (Dermot Mulroney) who are cool, relaxed, demonstrative in their feelings... total opposites. The family obviously hates the girlfriend and comedy ensues. It's one I like to watch at Christmas to remind me that during the chaos of the season, the love of your family wins in the end. Watching Luke Wilson's character coach Sarah Jessica Parker's character in how to relax and be in the moment is hilarious. There is a sad story line as well, which to me just adds another peek into how this family operates. Definitely worth watching, and has lots of \\"re-watchability\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL movie","review":"Hilarious- touching- even my husband really liked this movie. Great movie for all adults and a wonderful Christmas movie in my collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only christmas movie I own","review":"I like this movie because not only does it depict how family is really like at christmas time, but its also got great sub-story lines in it that make it a good movie to watch year-round."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good \\"feel good\\" movie","review":"Enjoyed the movie, does a good job of portraying a large family and different struggles they have.

Loved the different characters and how they play off of one another"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story is Predictable","review":"This movie is almost painful to watch. It is another movie portrayed as a comedy in the trailers, but it turns out that if you've seen a trailer, you've seen every funny part already. It's a drama and not a very good one at that. The writing fails a potentially good story line. The viewer isn't given enough time to believe that Everett could actually fall out of love with the main character and in love with her sister based on knowing her for half a day. Bad writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageous","review":"With 167 reviews in the can already, I can only say that I really hated this movie. Thankfully, I saw it on DVD and was able to stop whenever I wanted, which was often. The movie was simply overdone to the point of viewer exhaustion. If you have to see it, rent it or catch it on a movie channel. Don't waste your money on this bad flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like anyone in this movie...","review":"....so I think I will watch the ending now and skip the middle hour. Too bad. From the commercials I thought it would be pretty funny--all it is is mean people acting up. Yeech. With that cast, I had high hopes.OK...watched the ending. Nothing in it that made me very curious regarding the path to it.Life is short--skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I despised the family in this movie.","review":"Many of us have in-law troubles, of course. But the Stone family didn't even give Meredith a chance and hated her upon sight. They were very unlikeable. Of course, the movie tried to make you feel sorry for the Stones because the matriarch was dying, but they were all so mean-spirited without any reason. I would NOT recommend this movie. Note - the family never really apologized to Meredith for being so mean to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dreary holiday film, not rescued by a good cast","review":"If you're looking for a fun holiday film, then you'll want to skip this one. In spite of a good cast, the film falls flat, primarily due to the fact the 'quirky' Stone family come across as mean spirited and self-absorbed with no empathy (or even courtesy) for anyone else. There's little chemistry between the characters and for the most part it looks like everyone is just biding their time until this unrewarding mess of a film fades to black. Your time will be better spent watching 'A Chrismas Story' for the hundredth time (or just about any of the holiday staples)."},{"rating":"1","title":"same ingredients, same taste with different dish titles","review":"endless family gatherings stories, either this or that, outsiders, rich or poor family background, try to mingle into the clan, difficulties, personal problems, family gossips, throw in some cancer patients, gay and lesbian fmaily members, all the same ingredients cooked together, come out with the same taste but in different titles on the menu at different prices. in addition to african americans played as women in the black comedies, what else is new and what else you guys in hollywood could show me with some really serious creations? are we not having enough yet? give it a rest, okay? and one more thing, i could not agree more with some other viewers that diane keaton should retire and refrain from signing up any new movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseating","review":"Not that original, not very funny, transparent acting. You might rent it, but I wouldn't recommend buying it cause I don't see how one could watch it more than once. :-P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberals Beware","review":"If you believe in any tenets of liberalism, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. It must have been written by a conservative because every liberal person in the plot is portrayed as close-minded, self-indulgent, intolerant, and narcissistic. The only character willing to discuss topics openly and work hard to be accepted by the other characters is a conservative woman. Also, every liberal in the story comes off as being uneducated. None of them are able to defend, yet alone discuss, their beliefs. Whenever they are challenged, they can only respond with irritation, disdain, shouting, and violence. Definitely not a movie for the holidays, though it is described as one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood garbage","review":"This movie introduces the audience to a large family that is struggling to accept the mate of one of their sons. This movie has the typical Hollywood character traits: Marijauna advocacy, parents and children converse about their sexual experiences, and homosexuality. This movie has an overused plot. This movie lacks even a hint of original humor. Its a waste of your money and if you believe in traditional family values you will be disgusted with it in the first ten minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dysfunctional isn't the same as interesting","review":"I have to admit, it took me several days to watch this all the way through. Fish out of water Sarah Jessica Parker meets her fiance's family over Christmas. She's pathetic and dull, and the family is snide, nasty and dull. After half an hour or so of waiting for something interesting to happen, or not even something interesting but *something*, and hoping Sarah Jessica would bail on these nasty losers & end the film, I wondered who thought this movie was a good idea? It's like watching a train wreck in v e r y s l o w m o t i o n. My advice: wait for the Lifetime Cable version and watch the commercials instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"What a bad movie the Family Stone is. It's unfunny, unbearable, and unentertaining. It's a really bad movie that tries hard to be something it's not, and that's a comedy movie. The fact that some romantic elements were thrown in for bad measure makes the movie that much worse. Please, avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun movie. odd, but fun","review":"first.. claire danes didn't pass out presents in the movie... sara jessica parker did. that was what made her character a bit more loveable. the story is basically about her adjusting to a family environment that she is in no way shape or form used to. watching her adapt to the family, and their incredibly slow acceptance of her is hillarious. any girlfriend who's going home to meet the parents would enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, poignant","review":"This really is a fun, insightful and evocative movie. It has a great ensemble cast that includes a few new up and comers. This movie isn't a pure romantic comedy, and is certainly not a pure drama/tragedy but a mix of the two with more of the former than that latter. I really do recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"This is by far one of the worst movies I've seen in years. I'm with the guy who said if you paid a dollar to see it you paid too much, about 98 cent too much.I expected so much more from the stars in this flop and I'm very surprised anyone would play these roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to Feel Uncomfortable for Two Hours?","review":"We are big Sarah Jessica Parker fans, so we came into this movie with an open mind and expected to be entertained. Instead, we were treated to a couple of hours of feeling bad for Sarah's character as her soon-to-be-fiance and his family mistreat her for no apparent reason. Without giving away any more plot - I'd ask any potential buyer to SHUN this movie, especially if they are Parker fans. You'll just be uncomfortable for two hours and mad for another two at the end of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad storyline","review":"This family is like your mean relatives, you just can't wait for them to leave. The mom is just opinionated & know it all & when she dies you don't really feel bad for them. The rest of the story is like watching a blender, mix a smoothy, you see it spinning, know something is happening, you catch a glimpse, but you don't know what is in it. I'm just glad I did not pay admission price at the theater to watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE SAD THAN COMEDY","review":"This movie was such a good movie. But from the preveiws, it looked like it was a comedy. But when I saw it, it was actually more of a drama.It was about a man and a womanwho are engaged to be married. But the woman has to meet his family. When they get there, the family doesn't give Sarah Jessica Parker(girlfriend)an exact warm welcome. They are actually really mean to her. And alot of stuff happens besides that. The brother likes her. The sister doesn't. The mother is hiding a secret from her family which causes chaos. The father doesn't know what to do. And she just feels really unwelcome. Now I'm not going to ruin the movie for you and tell you what makes the movie sad. but this movie isn't really a comedy either. It's more drama. I do recommend it to anyone who likes a sad, but great film. Yup, this was a real tear-jerker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, more enjoyable every time I warsh","review":"This has become a family favorite to watch, mostly arounfpd Christmas.

So my advice, if you didn't like it the first time, watch it again, you might change your mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch \\"Love Actually\\" instead.","review":"I watched this movie having no great expectation. It did have two thumbs up, and I find that I usually enjoy movies with that rating. What I found instead was a poorly crafted example of a politically correct agenda. Five minuets into the movie I hated the entire family. For example at dinner, when Sara Jessica Parker expresses naive opinions about gays she is immediately shut down. Whatever happened to discussion, debate, or even a good healthy argument? What ever happened to manners? Everyone in this movie is judgmental and one-dimensional. Additionally, this movie isn't funny and the laughs that it does provide are too few for the price of wasting your time sitting through this rubbish. A much better ensemble cast movie with lots of heart, laughs, and a better message would be \\"Love Actually\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Cast, Weak Movie","review":"Given the cast I had high expectations for this movie, but unfortunately it didn't deliver. The storyline and plot twists are totally unbelievable even given the most disfunctional of families. There are some nice perfomances, granted, and for this reason alone I gave it two stars. But even with that grace, it's not enough to warrant giving it the 100 minutes of your life to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this movie supposed to be funny?","review":"I couldn't tell if this was supposed to be a romantic comedy.

A crazy family who was always fighting and out of sorts. I couldn't tell who was who. OK, the mom was ill, but the family didn't know it in the beginning and they were still weird and unpleasant.

The homosexuality (as all new movies seem to have these days) is too blatant and in your face, and when a character tries to discuss it, gets the usual knee jerk homophobic reaction from the pro homosexuality camp.

We returned the defective unit for a credit and purchased a Bemis seat from a local store. It was disappointing to see that the paint finish was blemished in multiple places. I know, its just a toilet seat, but hey if they can't make toilet seats right these days, we're in big trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I would skip this unengaging work and head to others by the author (Bend in the River, etc) unless completeness is your goal. The prose was uninspired and I found myself rushing to finish. A completely different work is the beautifully written and truly comic novel, Suffrage of Elvira."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Half Novel","review":"I am a great Naipaul fan. I have been, ever since I read A House for Mr Biswas. But Half a Life was disappointing. It doesn't hold together well, the ending is abrupt and I didn't get the point. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed","review":"Having read many fine works by Naipaul, I was totally disappointed with his latest effort, Half A Life. In this Naipaul tells the story of Willie Chandran, an uninteresting character, who does not have a story that deserves to be told. Willie Chandran comes across a man who is best forgotten.This is not Naipaul at his best. It is the kind of book that makes for labored reading. Something you force yourself to read just because you bought it.Makes me wonder if Mr. Naipaul is losing his magic touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done, Just Not Memorable","review":"V.S. Naipaul is one of those writers with tremendous talent, so much so that even not his best work is still very well done. He writes so much better than most writers, but the problem with Half a Life is that it really is not a very good showcase of his talents; it's not one of those books which I will remember months from now as being wonderful. The messages won't linger for more than a few weeks. I still think this is a well done work, compared to much of what else is available, it's just that coming from Naipaul, I found it a bit disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, but depressing","review":"As usual, Mr. Naipaul has written a highly readable book. I did miss the beauty of the Trinidad dialect that is sometimes in his books, but this story of a young man from India who goes to England and then Africa, remaking himself, is strangely intriguing. I cannot say that I liked the main character as a person -- I don't understand his motivation -- but still, the book is worth reading. I am hoping that the sequel will make all clear to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Life","review":"I'd heard Naipaul was such a great author I tried slogging through this novel. What a bore! The prose is stilted, he wanders aimlessly telling stories about minor characters we don't care about. I finally threw it against the wall. Give me something that makes me Feel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Captivating, but ended without making too much of a point ...","review":"I am an Indian. Indians seem to be proud of Mr. Naipaul as he is of \\"Indian Origin\\". This is the first book I read of his. Earlier, I had read about him sometimes on the web. And the image I had of him was that he was somewhat of a bitter man.While reading this book, this image of his seemed to be reinforced. He does not seem to be able to see too much good in others. Though he has a sharp eye for seeing the quirkinesses.The book was captivating. I do not know the reason for this though. Maybe it is because he is a good author. Maybe I am captivated too easily. There did not seem to be too much in the book. And it finished all of a sudden. As if the author got bored of writing and so decided to stop.Reading some of the other reviews, it seems his other works are better. I surely will try to read some other book of his some time.But my suggestion would be to skip reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slim work, slim ideas","review":"V S Naipaul usually sketches on a vast canvass with a range of ideas that usually outnumber the pages in the book; However, this time, he seems to be obsessed with just a few themes, the curse of birth, caste system, inter-racial sex, unsuccessful writers, land rovers, and escapism. Again and again, he comes back to the same familiar themes, as though the slim book was written over a long time in a state of constipation for ideas; So that each time a theme came up it took so long that it was forgotten that it had already found its place in the book in a similar setting. It appears that the author wrote the book in a few spaced-out sittings and was involved in some other projects in between. I was looking forward to a satisfying read and had to actually push myself to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"get a life and pass on half a life.","review":"I expected this book to be much better written. The author dwells on the obvious. The struggle for the protagonist to grow beyond his very limited background is only touched upon in a limited way. The writing is not intelligent or clever. The characters are flat. The historical background is superficial and leaves the reader wanting to know more about the historical setting and timeline. At best, this should have been a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I found this book to be quite a dissappointment. This is the only Naipaul work I have read and can only assume that his previous offerings must have been far superior in light of his recent Nobel prize award. This is definitely not a page turner. I forced myself through this book hoping it would develope and get better, but it didn't. I found myself disliking the main character to the point of simply not wanting to read about him any more. If this book is indicative of Mr. Naipaul's prize winning qualities I should perhaps conclude that I am not intellectually savy enough to appreciate his style. I did not enjoy this book and would be curious as to why this would appeal to anyone. Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing skill is of no concern, message is.","review":"I have heard and read so much about writing skill and well written or poorly written this book is. Seems to me we forget the reason why this book made it. It contains a message we ignore since we still do not do what this book says, GIVE. I could care less if a book was written as poorly as the ingredient label on a bag of Cheetoo's, as long as it tells me something of value I got the message. It is so sad that we overlook the message of this great book. Here is a message of value. Another great book which will succeed due to its message is Karl Mark Maddox, SB 1 or God"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"I'm sure that VS Naipaul is entitled to the accolades that he has received for HALF A LIFE, not for this work but on the strength of his former works. I believe that sometimes the critics feel that the time of an author has arrived and they want to reward him for his achievements. Such is probably the case in HALF A LIFE. I have read A BEND IN THE RIVER and HALF A LIFE repeats many of the same themes. Once again the main character is having sex with his friends wife or lover. Once again there is a man who is displaced from his culture and his family and trying to create a life for himself in a new world. Naipaul is a fine writer and I find much of his prose beautifully written. Someday I'd love to take a class or be in a discussion group with a Naipual scholar who could trace many of his themes and characters. But this is one book that I really can't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A colonial wanders the empires","review":"The story begins in India, moves to England and then to Portuguese East Africa. It finally ends in Berlin. Willie, half Brahmin, half 'backward', struggles through life in societies all severely altered by a colonial history. Even when he arrives in Berlin, his last chronological stop when the novel ends, his world is still mentally enmeshed in a third world fabric - poor Tamils coming in to sell flowers at restaurants and the blacks taking shelter in phone booths.I experienced Africa in the way I have experienced Indian rural life. Naipaul sees hard, sharp and with a deep, wide span. I often shudder at the strength of his gaze. In the beauty of his prose, there is a sweet poignancy even in the melancholic 'sea of Africa' and the harsh nightlife Wlillie takes to. I had the feeling of being lost there myself, such as in my boyhood days in Bellary or Davanagere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big problem","review":"I like the watch and it works well but I can't use it because the plastic band broke after I had it just a few days and I don't know how to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Digital Watch","review":"I think this watch bangs a lot for the buck.

I live on a hill and the weather doesn't seem to be a factor. That would not be so bad, but adjusting the time manually is quite complicated. Save the watch manual for reference! The pure-silver version of this watch looks nice but with most watches being very accurate, \\"downloading\\" the absolute correct time is pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"The book reads like a movie reel with description that enhances the reader's imagination. The plot is driven by a murder, a disappearance, and the fate of those close to the victims. Unexpected twists build tension and greater suspense, keeping the pages turning. At the end, the author leaves the reader wanting more. I'm waiting patiently for Robert Giordano's second book. His first was a tremendous debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This book is a great summer read. Fast-paced, plot twists, and good local scenery. I am an occasional customer of the writer and knew he was writing a story. I am not a friend or family member so there is no bias. I was so surprised by how much fun I had reading this book. The story really picks up speed in the second half and I doubt many readers will be able to put this one down. I hope he writes another one soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"csi: a companion book to the tv series.","review":"i just started reading this book ,and it is GREAT!i have watched c.s.i. off and on since the show started,and this book is a great way to remember how it all began.i love reading about the different episodes and then finding out how the creator came up with the idea for the show in the first place,the inspiration for certain episodes,the back story,[and some times,previously unknown history] of the different characters etc.really a great book to have if you love c.s.i. or similar shows, and if you want to find out about the show that changed c.s.i.s,from just \`fingerprint guys' on other cop shows,to the main characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Title says it all","review":"For my money, the best T-Birds album hands down.

This is a sequel to a Conan rip off. I mean, this movie has greatness written all over it. The first one was made to be semi serious, but it didn't exactly come out smelling like roses. So the creators saw what they had to do to redeem themselves. Make a tongue in cheek sequel. So they made this abomination. This movie had some one liners that were pretty funny, and then it had others that came out as ridiculous as a man wearing clown shoes in a mine field. This movie is good for watching with friends so that you can laugh and have a good time. But otherwise, don't bother.What I learned from Deathstalker 2: Huts do not have doors, and barbarians carry ninja stars as weapons.If you liked this movie, I recomend: Better taste in movies.Caution! Conan fans will be offended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back! By popular demand! :)","review":"This is a great \\"B\\" movie. I rated it a 5, which i don't ever hand out to \\"B\\" movies, but as far as they go, this is one of the greatest. Obviously it can't compare with greats like BraveHeart and such, but you have to know what you're getting into before watching this.I believe there are 4 Death Stalker movies. 1 and 4 try to be \\"serious\\", kind of like Conan rip-offs.... not real great. 2 and 3 go the more \\"humorous\\" route, with 3 failing pretty badly.But Death Stalker 2 is GREAT! Adventure, comedy, action, slashing, and for those that like beautiful women in their movies, Monique Gabrielle doesn't disappoint!Be ready for a cheesy movie, but it's fun cheesy! Lots of great (and bad) one-liners throughout. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the B-Movies","review":"One of the best of the 80's sword and scorcery movies, Deathstalker 2 still rules. It has everything: swordfights, an evil sorceror (is there any other kind?), swashbuckling action, semi-clad beauties and a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that ties it all together.For DS2 fans who have the VHS version and are wondering if the DVD version is worth buying: Yes! This version includes a feature-length audio commentary by director Jim Wynorski, Toni Naples (Sultana), and John Terlesky (Deathstalker himself) for behind-the-scenes information you didn't even know you wanted to know....S&S; B-movie fans in general and Deathstalker 2 fans in particular will want this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deathstalker 2 DVD","review":"Simply a great DVD. This is personally my favorite movie in the Deathstalker series. It's worth it just for the excellent full-length commentary. The picture and sound transfer are very clear and sharp.

I read it once, years ago, when I was in elementary school (I graduated high school in 1983 if that's any clue as to the many, many years that have passed since then!). I don't remember details, but I remember much - the storyline, the main character, subplots, emotions... it was the emotions that brought this book back to me today. I am going thru a \\"fitting in\\" issue right now, as was Carol in the book, and the story came flooding back. Of course, at this point - some 30+ (oh-my-gosh, I'm that old?) years later - I cannot attest to the writing quality, the flow of words, the desciptive state (altho I believe it was quite vivid and detailed), so to give the story a 5 star rating would be unjust until I read it again. However, the fact that I remember so much - that this story stuck w/me enough for me to even remember the title, then it must have been good. At least it was for the little girl I was back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accepted","review":"I bought this book about a month before I took the test to go to a very competative high school.

I have had mine since high school (yeah, I am old), and I decided to save it before the vinyl deteriorated. It also makes it handy to listen to in the car. Anyway, I think it is a crime that this gem was never issued on a CD. Hopefully, someday Jello Biafra will issue the CD on Alternative Tentacles with a generous amount of bonus tracks, so I can get the CD too. I did, however, notice that it was produced by East Bay Ray, so who knows if they will ever quit their feuding and release this on CD and maybe even have a TRUE Dead Kennedys reunion someday. It's not the Dead Kennedys without Jello. As far as I know, this is the only material released by the almighty Part-Time Christians.

Loved the setting, characters ect. Could even imagine the 'plumbers crack' of Kits nephew!

For instance: \\"As much as I love my brothers, I've never been able to tell them things that I could have told a sister. Mama was senstitive to that and tried to compensate. But some things I would have felt more comfortable saying to a sister instead of Mama.\\" This, to me, is not interesting writing. The plot is not much better than a Danielle Steele formula book. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thud","review":"Lucia, Lucia is nowhere near as good as Trigiani's Big Stone Gap series. This story is predictable and dry. The events happen with a thud instead of a delicate \\"unfolding.\\" I found it depressing and unbelievable that characters severed or maintained relationships when their good sense should have told them not to. I felt no sympathy for Lucia. She made bad choices.I might have enjoyed the book more if I had read it myself instead of listening to it on CD.

There are many better books to spend your money on in hardcover that aren't as pulpy as this one. I recommend instead buying The Dogs of Babel, The Pursuit of Alice Thrift or The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, all three far superior to this one and worth the money.

If you have some old relative (yiddish, jewish, italian, hispanic, black, whatever) and you love to hear their stories, you'll like this book. Yes, the plot is filled with cliches-- women must remain virgins until they're married, devout Catholic families are intensely suspicious, old-world men frown upon career girls, a mother's only job is to serve her husband and marry off her kids, we're forbidden to marry outside our culture. The book over-dramatizes these cultural elements, but it adds amusement to the plot.

Author Richard Rashke has fashioned young Esther Raab's escape from eastern Poland's Sobibor death camp into the quintessential survival tale of World War II, e.g., she stepped on dead bodies to avoid the land mines, sustaining a Nazi bullet wound to her head. In this evocative narrative, Rashke has created an artistic coup as well as a powerful epiphany for freedom seekers today in this mesmerizing account of the human condition under siege. Letters from children deeply touched by Esther's story reveal inspiring love, empathy, and cogent responses to the cruelties she endured and overcame. Splendid five-star achievment by Rashke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a 3-way socket","review":"I ordered this to be fully functional with a standard base 3-way bulb in a 3-way mogul socket, but does not function as a 3-way socket, just as a regular on-off function.

It takes place about a couple years after Caroline's mother remarries a man kown as Mr. Holbrook.Caroline, now nearly 12 years old, is kept busy at her family's farm and is excited about the year's events. She is particulary excited because for the first time, a school will open in Concord, Wisconson and her family is expected to board the new schoolteacher. She also begins a friendship with a new neighbor, Charles Ingalls. Charles is charming, and she likes him very much.Now, the only complaint I have about this book is that the writer was foolishly inaccurate with the accent of Wisconsin and displayed it as a southern, uneducated drawl. She also made several silly grammar spelling mistakes and I would think a writer would know better.Anyway, the whole book story is very interesting and enjoyable.

It all makes sense, and, best of all, it works!! Taking even a few of her suggestions will cause you to lose fat and feel great about yourself.I don't understand the other reviewer, who said that she got so weak she had to quit the program. If she was truly following the program, and eating only when she got hungry (vs. famished), then I don't see how she could have ended up with her result, absent some other underlying medical problem...I highly recommend this book to all women who want to lose weight, but especially those who have tried numerous diets without success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever.","review":"what I've been doing to my body and health all these years with yoyo diets and not eating enough.She has cleared up so much for me and helped me lose weight.Some pointers...DON'T DIET! no more counting calories, weighing yourself and yo-yoing, focus on eating when you are hungry, not for emotional or social reasons, and eating during the day and not at night, drink more water, and exercise!!I learned SO much from this book about my body and HOW i lose weight and store weight.

Whenever someone tells you not to diet but to put your efforts into exercise instead, that is great advice indeed.

I was starving, then bingeing, then starving, then bingeing, etc. Somehow I managed to starve more than I binged, and I slowly lost weight. Unfortunately, the book explains that my fat cells were steadily expanding. I know what the author says about fat cells never dissapearing through a diet is true. Even when I was 90 pounds, I still had 23% body fat, maybe more. The average for a woman is like 20%. Then I gained all the weight back. Then I dieted again. Then I gained, then dieted, etc., etc. Well, thanks to this book I am less fat, more muscle, and a really fast runner, too!

This movie to me, made no sense, showed nothing but naked chics playing in the dirt, and some chic raping a heavily sedated king (can you do that?)so she could be queen or something!

The plot was thin. I now know exactly what people refer to when calling characters cardboard- there was little to no character development. And realism? The 6-year old son of Noy speaks of his various classes in school: arithmetic, geography, history- a 6 year old? And he complains how lame one arithmetic class is. Also, President Underwood demands that the secret service not cover him while he confronts \\"the bad guy\\". Not to worry- they outfit him with a gun! Not realistic at all, in my opinion.I've read a number of Wallace's books: The 3 Sirens, The Plot, The Second Lady, and The Almighty. These were excellent, riveting books. Perhaps Wallace was not well at this time, because this novel is a shadow of the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"Just what I wanted. A solar powered watch that looks good.

When i turned it on the voice was slow and distorted it sounded awful so i changed the batteries. But even with new batteries the voice was still slow and distorted. I read the directions and troubleshoot section and it mentioned to reset the recorder if there were any problems. So i got a paperclip and insert it into the reset button. WA-LA it's all better. The voice is now fun and exciting and it works well.So for those of you who have had trouble with the voice maybe if you reset the toy it will do the trick.

I showed it to my brothers and ended up picking up another three for them. Picked up another for my granddaughter. We all love it and can't get enough of it! It makes us smile and laugh out loud, not to mention marveling at the technology behind it. For me the main value besides the fun is the soothing music, the light show, and the stress release / relief.

The Zoundz is a compelling blend of functionality and artistic creativity. It is also easy to use, so you don't need to be very technically inclined to enjoy all that's offered.

After listening to Portishead, any other type of music is completely boring. It's very strange, very different, and it just enchants you.

I only note this, because obviously you wouldn't want this one a new vinyl record. It's not on all the songs.if I had any complaints, it's that the two records are jammed into one slot, in paper sleeves. this might be why it's so cheap. as opposed to a gatefold with color sleeves from other 2 LP releases.

While the lyrics swell with her emotional authenticity and heartfelt wails, the music accentuates it perfectly. Hard beats and heart-thumping bass on one track usually follows a string-thin symphony of high, piercing, tear-inducing little concertos.

The orchestrations and sounds used in this album are exotic and beautiful, but contian the haunting mystery so typical of Portishead. My favorite track is the last one, with its beauty and melancholy tones. I recommend this album to everyone in need of cleansing of the soul. It brings forth the pain and despair of a woman, connecting these emotions so directly between Portishead and the listener. Exotic and enchanting, beautifully done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Darker Than Dummy, a Scary Sequel","review":"I gave this album two stars for a very simple reason. I dont desire to play it often in my cd player. I couldnt get Dummy out of my system for 6 months straight! Yet, this album was digested in less than a month. I gave it an honest listen. It is not without highlights, check out the big band sound of ALL MINE. For the most part though, you may feel as though you are listening to the background sounds of a haunted house. There is an artistic integrity to delving into the deep and dark places on an album, but this one sinks so far down that I dont bother to visit it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Beauty","review":"The one thing that appeals to me in music is intriguing a listener with unexpected chords, melody, etc. This album is filled with that. The first time I listened to it I was amazed at what was occuring harmonically. It was gorgeous. The beats are so straight out and delicious. This is an incredible cd. So why did I label it a 4? I guess because I want other Portishead fans to know that this is completely different from original Portishead. The beats are pure trip hop and her voice is a little more exposed, while the harmonic progressions are completely unexpected. Although, I think it was an absolutely positive progression, others might not. If you are a portishead fan, I think it is necessary to have this in your collection. Buy this cd-it is absolutely delicious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!!!","review":"The vinyl version is the REAL way this record should be listened.Every deatail in this album is incredibly produced, that analogue atmosphere is unique.A master piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting, Beautiful, Astounding, Unbelievable, Psychedelic","review":"Aside from being the most beautiful sounding music I've ever heard, Beth Gibbons' ghost-like voice captivates my consciousness like a mind controlling substance.

Beth's voice is so perfect for this music, not hollow or empty but more like an echo. Although Portishead's Dummy release does set a definite standard for the group, here they have an album which is still above the standards of what passes for music in most mainstream circles.

Though it lacks \\"Mysterons\\" and \\"Sour Times\\", which were my favourites from their debut album, they make up for it with great songs like \\"Half Day Closing\\", \\"Cowboys\\", \\"All Mine\\" and \\"Only You\\". This CD is also much eerier than their earlier album. \\"Cowboys\\" and \\"Half Day Closing\\" are songs that you wouldn't want to listen to while you're alone. A fantastic album.

Most anyone who knows their previous album \\"Dummy\\", can pretty much expect the same thing on \\"Portishead\\". This is a bit darker, and there's no obvious stand-out tracks, but as a whole it's still very strong, and sets a nice mood. This is actually one of my favorites of the genre, along with \\"Mezzanine\\". \\"Beth Gibbons\\" continues to do an excellent job, and her voice really is a perfect match to the music. Overall, I'm not sure if I'd call it as good as \\"Dummy\\", but it's the next best thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ALBUM THAT TURNED ME ON TO TRIP-HOP","review":"Back in '97,I heard Portishead's \\"Only You\\" and fell in love with it.It was the first trip-hop song I had ever loved and that alone made me pick up a copy of their self-titled '97 release(which I believe was one of the best albums of that year).I loved it as well.Beth Gibbon's sad,Dido-like voice paints the darkness of moodof trip hop in Technicolor even while sounding dreary.This album is full of gems:\\"Cowboys\\",\\"Humming\\",\\"Seven Months.I may not be a \\"proper\\" dance music critic butI know good music when I hear it and \\"Portishead\\" is right up there.Also recommended on the trip hop tip are Morcheeba,the ingenious Tricky,and Massive Attack(I used to love those guys).Also check out Portishead's exellecent '94 debut,\\"Dummy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomparable","review":"Within its genre, Dummy was a great album.

It is \\"Lovingly Remastered\\".\\"Desperate\\" was a solid rock album all the way through. Highlight is \\"Elsie\\". An intimate(dark) look inside an isolated disturbed mind. I purchased this disc before I knew whether or not it was a remaster. I already own the original release, it was worth the risk of duplication!After Desperate \\"The Divinyls\\" were oriented towards singles, all albums pale in comparison.When an individual reads a review, one hopes the reviewer will tell kindred spirits about the product in hand. Instead, often we get a unoriginal run down of what is already posted on a web site, printed in the liner notes or published in an autobiography."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must own for this rocker","review":"Nearly every song on this effort is a rockin' good time. Great guitar timbres, powerful and tasteful drumming, fused to bouncy and fun melodies. But for me, it is the vocals that really take this into the \\"Classic\\" status. Christina Amphlett's phrasing is fierce, frustrated, nearly out of control - yet presented with incredible skill and taste. The well-placed squeaks and falsetto lapses seem to emerge from some emotional depth that can only hint at the singer's desperate passion. Now I'll admit to not liking ballads too much, but every up-tempo song on this CD is a real keeper. When was the last time you could say that about an album? A stunning effort and worth adding to your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic album, tags are a bit mixed up","review":"Classic 80's rock. For me, this album redeemed Divinyls from the one-hit-wonder status they had from \\"I Touch Myself\\", which is how I first heard of them. This has the song \\"Ring Me Up\\" from the soundtrack toSixteen Candles (High School Reunion Collection). [The scene where Samantha approaches Jake Ryan and freezes up, at the end of the school dance.] How that song didn't make it to the \\"Essentials\\" compilation, I'll never understand.Anyways, as of now, the tags for these songs are mixed up. [Thought you should know that.] The song titles are incorrect, and not just on the preview clips, but on the actual mp3s. This was just released today on Amazon Downloads, so it could be fixed by the time you read this.So, after you re-tag the songs, enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Classic.......","review":"This album definitly covers alot of ground. power-pop, punk, hard rock, with vocals dynamic enough to match the searing guitar work.

I would be the first to know how it is supposed to smell as it is the ONLY perfume I have worn for the past 3-4 years so I purchase it or receive it as a gift quite regularly. If I had to guess at the problem it is either the perfume is very old ( been on the shelf for well over a year ), or they are selling knock-off perfumes. Whatever the case I am very disappointed in this purchase. It has made me rethink purchasing anything from Amazon other than kindle books, so I have not bought anything else from Amazon since. Also, I did register a complaint with Amazon to which they have not responded. The seller, who I also complained to did contact me, but never followed through in sending me my $ back or an Amazon gift card for the purchase amount.

He accepted, an army was quickly formed and thy proceeded up the Hudson, past Ft. Ticonderoga, Crown Point and on to Quebec. On a bitter cold evening on Dec.30, they finally tried to storm Quebec. He was killed, they lost, but by tying up the British forces foe almost a year, it kept them from sending supplies and reinforcements to Boston where General Washington had his hands full. So in a way it was a victory. It also describes the hardships of an army in severe weather. It also makes one think, if the battle had went the other way, under what conditions might we be living today.Book well researched. A. L.

We discussed many things and the conversation soon came round to British sitcoms. I, having been a long time fan of British comedy, mention several that I knew of, which of course were ancient history for the couple from the UK. They suggested \\"One Foot in the Grave\\" and I ordered the first season. There has been no turning back since. We continue to enjoy the series, as much as we enjoy Seinfeld, as a comparison.

The story lines are written so that they interweave and come full circle - where DO the writers come up with some of these ideas! Fine acting by both main characters and I agree with another reviewer that this is NOT just for old people! Most episodes have social commentary hidden underneath that makes you think and the difference is the Mr. Muldrew doesn't take it lying down but lets others know how he feels about things.

I have really oily and sensitive skin. Anything with fragrance makes my face explode with red pimples. It takes a week for the reaction to go away. I switched to Avalon organics products now because there is nothing hydrogenated in it or any chemical fragrances that cause irritation. I'm not even going to take the chance with this product to use it. I just know what makes my skin react and those ingredients are exactly what I don't want on my face.

I could feel and see the signs of irritation instantly, after applying only a small amount of the cream. Again, I do not have sensitive skin and don't often have a poor reaction to any beauty-products.It also has a rather yucky fragrance, sort of a \\"fake fruit\\" scent, like cough syryp.

For this, the book is worth reading.I had difficulty however with keeping track of the various characters and who they were, for some reason.

Up through November 22, 1963, I was as mesmorized as I remember being when I read \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" at age 14.

I have the IR extender cable in use with the sensors on top of the devices on the back side of the cabinet door. I've moved them around about 20 times looking for the sweet spots, no luck. Can't blame the remotes either as I first had these results with the OEM remotes. Thinking they might be weak, I bought a Harmony One universal remote. No difference - same results. If I open the cabinet door, the remotes all work perfectly across the room from in the kitchen.If you're trying to control devices behind closed doors in a cabinet, skip this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I'm amazed that they can even sell this junk, or that Amazon sells it for them. I have to believe they get 99% of these POS's back immediately. I had the old style which worked well but then China started making them. Can't wait until they start importing cars and airplanes from China. It will be time to walk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sporadic at best.","review":"The setup: I'm using this with a TiVo remote - the transmitter is on one side of a standard wall from the receiver (3ft away). The receiver is in a dark room with all the sensors arranged in front of the TiVo, the transmitter is also in a fairly dark room.Usage: I've found that the response is very sporadic. Sometimes it'd work perfectly, sometimes I'd get double-keypresses, sometimes I'd get no response at all. I found with the no-response instances, waiting a minute or two seemed to \\"reset\\" synchronization between the sender and receiver and then it'd work fine for a while again. I'm pretty sure it's not an issue with the remote itself as I also use it to control the TV directly and have no problems.Can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work as advertised","review":"I purchased this item to control the Dish receiver box for a stand alone television in the basement, instead of renting another receiver. It was easy to install but didn't work. In talking with the Terk technician, he said it wouldn't work with a Dish remote controller and to try a different manufacturer. The product information said it would work with any satellite remote, but it doesn't. I feel like this is false advertising to sell a product they know won't work with certain remotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much work for me","review":"Not what I expected. I just needed something that won't be rendered unusable if someone bumps it. Even when the stars were aligned the lag was frustrating and range was disappointing in my application. I may not know what I am doing as well as some folks but just too much to mess with for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works decently.","review":"They work decent: it doesn't catch every button press, and there is a bit of lag, but they do work. Only complaint is that the IR blaster took a decent amount of work to position on the front of the Tivo so that it would allow the remote to work around it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain and simple, does not work","review":"I had high hopes for this product, but got absolutely no results, I have to hold the remote 5 ft max from the reciever and it takes 5 or 6 button pushes to get it to work. The LED's on the product are inconsistent with the description in the instructions, overall, im highly dissapointed :( The packaging is the cut your finger off hard plastic that you need a machette to cut open, which makes it impossible to return :(( DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works okay but with a lot of work.","review":"These definitely work. You have to point them directly at the product you are trying to get work. If you have a WIFI point near this it will mess it up. (3 to 4 feet)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharpshooters only!!!","review":"This is by far the worst item I ever purchased from Amazon.. the other reveiws are correct; unless you stand a foot or less and point exactly at the unit and I mean exactly; it may work.I had this mounted on the plasma and only 4 feet away; it does not work and you have to press your remote a dozen times and continually move it up and down it may work.I returned this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with satellite TV","review":"As advertised I was hoping to be able to view tv in another room. The advertisement stated the product worked with satellite TV. I set it up which was very easy. The advertisement states it works within 100 ft. My other room was far shorter, yet I receive no reception at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terk LF-IRX Remote Control Extender","review":"Product works great. Receiver in LR and sender in BR. Works like I am in the same room. You won't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Complete junk. You have to hold the remote about 2 inches away for it to work. Don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, the new silver square version is garbage","review":"People should be warned. Terrible product. Terk should be ashamed. The signal relay is very unreliable, even when the units are right next to each other and you're holding the remote 2 feet away from the transmitter. Just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"LF-IRX Leapfrog Remote Control Extender","review":"I ordered the titled item to allow me to change channels on a Satellite Receiver from one room to another, and it did not work, so I returned the item and received a replacement and it did not work as advertised , that item was also returned and Credit was issued, thankyou, This item should not be sold to anyone else as it will not operate as expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Range and Performance","review":"The benefits:1. I was able to change TV channels and Stereo volume in myFamily Room from the Kitchen!2. Very easy to setup -- just plug in and go.The drawbacks:1. The IR Extender line uses a weak sticker(recommend upgrading this to a strong velcro sticker)2. The Antennae are long and shoot straight up (no pivot to turnthem if in a tight area). I had the transmitter on top ofmy TV and the receiver down under my TV inside the TV stand.This worked fine for a year until someone closed the door onthe antennae and bent it.3. The two units need some sort of weight or velcro to hold themin place. One was on top of the TV (up high) and was knockedoff when someone walked past -- this broke it and now I needto get a replacement?!?Other than that, this product outshines Jensen's. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Used with my FIOS remote, if it works at all, I have to click my remote (with new batteries) several times before it responds. Usually, it only works if I am pointing directly at it and am less than ten feet away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work - Flimsy, science fail contraption","review":"Bad! Bad! Bad!What can I say, this thing did not work. I got maybe 1 or 2 signals to actually reached and functioned my component inside my cabinet.The design is like something a child would design for a 5-grade science project--and it would earn an Honorable Mention ribbon at best. Thin plastic casing. Light weight...the satellite receiver's (short) cable easily moves the transmitter out of position when you are trying to position the dumb things. And who uses a metal, external antennae any more...this is 2012, right. Enough said.Never said this before about a product: DO NOT BUY THIS THING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terk comes thru","review":"I was a little sceptical about this product living up to the manufactures claims. I bought this to control a cable box in the basement which was hooked up to a tv upstairs and one in the basement. When I first set the Terk product up, the receiver in the basement and the transmitter on the first floor, you needed to press the button on the remote multiple times before the action was received and carried out. The problem was the receiver, although within 1ft and pointing directly at the cable box, seemed not to relay the signal accurately. The issue was resolved with the addition of the remote eye extender (included), which plugs into the receiver and then placed directly onto the IR sensor (of the cable box). The system then worked flawlessly, the only small snag is you have to be within 15ft or so of the transmitter and point your remote directly at it.I am pleased with the product and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terk LF-IRX Remote Extender","review":"The remote extender works great on our satellite system and it took only a few minutes to set up and get working. It makes life so much easier while watching TV in bed. The system works through walls without any problems at all. The satellite box is located in the lounge room and is something we should have got sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even easier than it looks","review":"Our new cabinets did not include glass doors and I was in a fix as to how I was going to get the remote controls to function. This is the neatest product. All I had to do was plug it in and everything worked. Amazon's price was also excellent. It was $18 less than the local electronics store."},{"rating":"2","title":"does what it's supposed to","review":"I installed it in the same room with the emmitter quite near to my equipment so I really can't say I tested its limits, but for me it works like a charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Operable out of box","review":"Although sale went well and ANTOnline provided product as described in a timely fashion when I recieved the leapfrog the reciever end would not power up. I tried various trouble shooting methods without result. I did not notify ANTOnline since the shipping cost half as much as the product. I will not use TERK again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing should not be sold","review":"I read the mixed reviews of this device, but felt that my use was over such a short distance and so far within the posted specifications that it would work for me. I was wrong. I tried a variety of placements of both the sender and the receiver and tried several reomtes. They hardly worked at all, when they did transmit the signal I had to hold the remote about an inch from the sending unit. One of the other reviews said that this device should not be sold. I agree,it should not be on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work that well","review":"I have my cable box behind a cabinet door with no window on it. I purchased the extender so I could still operate the cable box. I repositioned the receiver and transmitter several times.Sometimes it works properly and others it does not. Range also seems to be an issue. If I move more than 6 feet away from the receiver it has problems seeing the signal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me.","review":"The system worked well as long as I stayed in the same room.Would not work from back bedroom only 30 ft away with wood walls. I do have a wireless network which may have caused problems. Returned item and got the Wireless RF Remote Control Extenderfrom Next Generation Home Products. This is great works anywhere and responds well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat out didn't work.","review":"Even with the transmitter and receiver less than 8' apart, it didn't work.I tried it with the receiver's built-in IR, with the IR cable that was provided, and even with a more expensive cable that comes with the Slingbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"good service, so-so product","review":"Item was delivered in good time by the dealer. The product works on some devices but not on my Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8300HD cable box. The out put IR signal seems weak. It must be close and delicately aligned to the devices to be reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"The leapfrogs work well. This is the 3rd set I have purchased one going to my father and one for a second TV for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to use it without illumination","review":"1) I can't make it work without keeping transmitter and receiver in line of sight, which mean you can not locate TX/RX in different room. It is main purpose of this product. Right?2) When I didn't press remote controller, the receievr still keep transmit noise signal from what it receive from RF signal.3) And I think it may be weak to against interference. So I turn off the light and it work well. But it is still unaccetable that I have to use it without illumination4) Next, I move this IR set to my friend's appartment, it worked, no matter light on or off.So my suggestion is you may either1)try your friend sample first, to see if it work in your enviroments2) make sure your house haven't too much interference from your lighting equipements"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea - Worked for only a short time","review":"I have used these before...But this version didn't work well.A very short distance being used and it worked for a day and then could never get it to talk again.I would try another brang."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"It picks up the signals very well and quicker than my other remote extender from another company."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work with digital cable box","review":"Unless I am doing something wrong, this won't work with the new digital cable boxes Comcast is requiring. Has anyone had any luck?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give product and customer service zero stars","review":"We received this as a Christmas gift. Thought it would be the perfect solution to keeping DVR & cable box inside a closed cabinet and away from our curious baby. My husband and father-in-law tried for HOURS to get the LED light to come on which signals a connection. After that, they called Terk's customer service, and were told that this product is from 2006 and likely will not work with current remotes, and furthermore is not guaranteed to \\"universally\\" work with all TVs & remotes. The return process is painful and expensive, involving restocking fees, and the buyer is responsible for return shipping costs, even though the product is faulty. Highly do NOT recommend purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Piece of garbage.. Works every other day. Would not recommend. Tried setting up with Sat dish.. 100 feet away with obstructed view.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakling, bouncing original IR off walls is more effective","review":"All I can say, it may look cute, but that's all it's good for. They're some of the weakest IR extenders sold from my view. DO NOT buy this, you'll be sorry. Again, it I wish I could have left the rating off to represent ZERO. The pickup of the receiver is VERY POOR. Read other reviews that light noise was causing problems, this wasn't the case; it simply didn't get the remote's IR signal until you were less than 4feet away from the POS. YES even new batteries in the remote control, and still must be right on top of it. As I said in title, I could perhaps strategically bounce the IR from the remote to get downstairs, but this would drive Dad nuts. I'm returning it and trying Radio Shack or even Wally World, but stay away from these."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"could not get to work..even the help I had could not get to work ..this product will not do what it says it will"},{"rating":"1","title":"All six failed","review":"Purchased three pair of this product.Installed in home that is less than 3000 square feet.All worked initially and intermittently.All failed after a couple months of use.Complete garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I am a really big fan of Jennifer Lopez. This song is not that great. There are remixes of this song by HQ2, Bad Boy and Thunderpuss. The remixes do not cut it. It is badly sung. Don't get me wrong.

But I do prefer her other songs, Waiting for tonight and If you had my love (these songs have better remixes by Hex Hector and Pablo Flores) The only mix that sounds decent is the Radio Edit.
