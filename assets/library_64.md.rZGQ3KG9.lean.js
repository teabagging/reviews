So if you're a woman, no longer a teenager or a 30-something, you will find this book funny (sometimes hilarious) and refreshing.

(Not Ms Williams is not competitive, but she sees it from the light of a person who's happy she can move, much less win.)I'm 53 and getting ready for my first paddle/bike/run (I hope!)While I'm sorry there isn't a simliar guide for paddlers, I'm just as happy I won't have to wriggle in and out of wetsuit. This book was just the guide I was looking for to give me some idea of what my first event will be like. And since I too tend to injure myself a lot, due to back issues, I was happy to see that others are just as willing to risk that as I am... gave me perspective.

The Bob Saget episodes are the best (and the set is still the best set the ever designed), plus the theme song on those episodes sounds a lot better and funnier with words. The Tom Bergeron episode is okay, but I never found him as funny as Saget and I even stopped watching the show on a steady basis. Plus the Bergeron episode on this disc reuses clips from the Saget shows (such as the lights falling off the house after the guy takes the ladder away) and Bergeron just does a joke for these clips that does not add to their funniness.The Saget episodes (which are the 96 and 97 Christmas specials) I would each give a 5/5 too. The Bergeron episode (the 2002 Christmas episode) I would give a 2.5/5 rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great everyday wine glass!","review":"We drink a lot of wine, and like to entertain casually.

The lip is slender, without the annoying ridge usually found in inexpensive glasses. Likewise, there is no seam between the bowl of the glass and the stem, something I particularly appreciate.These glasses are a great price for the quality, and that means you don't have to freak out when you or a guest breaks one from time to time!

The pieces themselves are so small, it's very difficult to distinguish between one piece and another, even for a dinosaur fossil enthusiast; for a person who's just trying to play chess, it's infuriating.

Unlike some strange works produced in 20th century, they are all beautifully written and easily accessible. Among them \\"Valse\\" is pretty remarkable. Boasted as the premier recording ever in the world, this small piece displays some interesting harmonies and manifests the charming skills of the composer. Other works in this selection are no less appreciable. Try it and I bet you will give them the recognition and applause they deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???? These are NOT Darcy's daughters!","review":"I pulled this book off the library shelf because the author's name is so close to Austen. I was a bit skeptical because I knew she could never measure up, but this was even worse than I expected.Darcy and Elizabeth would have never raised their kids to have such a lack of propriety. We all know how proper Darcy was and Elizabeth was so disgusted by her younger sisters, at times, she never would have raised clones.Also, Jane Austen never wrote anything sexual in her books and there was plenty of it in this one, not harlequin romance sexual, but sexual all the same. It just doesn't ring true for a period piece like this one.If you are a true Jane Austen fan, you won't enjoy this book; it just bothers the soul!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed carbon copy of the original","review":"I started reading Mr. Darcy's Daughters with optimism, I could tell Ashton was a seasoned writer who expertly described characters and the feel of London society at that time. Halfway through it I saw a failed attempt to re-do the original storyline of Pride and Prejudice. The author should have been more original in taking on the creation of the Darcy daughters. It became silly and contrived with plots that had no build up to make them believable. Such as the youngest daughter's male cross-dressing and one of the twins running off with an older already married man to Paris and taking one of the sisters along as a french interpreter?I will stick to Linda Berdoll; an author who decided to take an original and daring path of the Pride and Prejudice sequel, instead of trying to mimic Austen. I suggest you skip this one if you're looking to be dazzled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't much care for it....","review":"By the time I reached the middle of the book, I still didn't really care about the characters. I love Jane Austen, and this really is nothing like her writing. When the story starts, you think Leticia and Camilla, the two oldest, will be sort of a \\"Jane and Lizzy\\" team, but you get the feeling the author didn't really know what to do with Leticia, and she keeps becoming more and more unsympathetic, and is really never redeemed as a character. The book has none of the relational tension that makes the Austen books so good. Virtually all the characters are one dimensional, only Camilla is given any sort of decent treatment.I hope there is no sequel ......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and bad","review":"As a huge P&P fan, I really enjoyed this book, but I didn't find Aston entirely true to the characters. I thought the characters she invented were realistic, but she had a hard time maintaining the ones she inherited from Austen. For instance, Aston's portrayals of the Fitzwilliams and the Gardiners didn't seem to quite match the characters in P&P. Also, I was disappointed at the almost total omission of some of the characters - Jane, Kitty, and Mary, as well as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mr. and Mrs. Hurst, and especially Elizabeth and Darcy! I think Jane Austen fans will have fun reading this book, but will be able to pick out some flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"too close to a trashy romance novel","review":"Yes, trashy romance has its place and time--but not when the author is attempting a sequel to Jane Austen's writings! Very contrived mishaps and concerns. Language was forced, and didn't seem of correct period. Just not a fun read. Basicly an extremely bad rewrite of the original Pride and Prejudice, with its intended readers being the sort who might enjoy watching Jerry Springer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing","review":"If you are a fan of Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice, and Mr. Darcy in particular, do not buy Mr. Darcy's Daughters. I had to force myself to finish the book, even while trying to keep an open mind and not expect it to be of the same caliber of Pride and Prejudice. The story is weak, the characters forgettable. If I'd read the reviews here first I wouldn't have bothered with the book. There were many extraneous characters in the novel, love interests develop late and with little or nothing to support them. There are more references to sex than I think is in line with a sequel to a Jane Austen novel. I also found it strange that any children of Mr. Darcy (let alone five of them) would choose to show little regard for how their behavior affected their standing in good London society. At least Mr. and Mrs. Darcy are out of the country for the duration of the novel and are spared the humiliation of making an appearance in such a second-rate piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it ZERO stars","review":"This book is terrible. It trades on the good name of Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice, then completely ignores the P&P story. There's nothing in the book that convinces me that Ms. Aston ever read Pride and Prejudice. I think she has only read a cliff notes version of the story. Here's my criticisms in a nutshell: First - Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are not in the book. Second - Col. Fitzwilliam is an old, lecherous scold. Third - The P&P characters that are in the book are totally unrecognizable, except for their names. Fourth - I didn't believe for one minute that Mr. Darcy's daughters were the product of Mr. Darcy or Elizabeth. Fifth - It was boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even 20 Pages In!!!","review":"I didn't even get to page 20 before I decided this was NO sequel to P&P. Aston has Lizzy and Darcy on a journey where there daughters don't expect them to come back alive! I couldn't take it. Lizzy and Darcy should be home trying to marry off their 5 daughters (mind you, not exactly the way as Mrs. Bennet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Offensive","review":"I was very excited to read this book, and was mortified while reading it. The only reason that I even finshed it was that I was hoping it could somehow improve. I find it insulting that anyone who had read Pride and Predjudice could even entertain the idea that Darcy and Lizzy would be such negligent parents. This book was so distubing that as soon as I finished it I promptly took it out and put it in the dumpster as I coudn't bear the thought of having it in my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable read","review":"I'm not really much of a reader, but i do enjoy movies....

Mediocre.","review":"Just no. No. Don't read this. I picked it up in the middle of summer. It was on the table with all the other summer-read books. I fell prey to the title and to my weakness for Jane Austen.This is no more than a Harlequin/Gothic paperback romance. Stilted, affected prose, shallow situations, obviously drawn characters, no insight, nothing interesting at all. Just awful.By the way, Col. Fitzwilliam is supposed to be this shallow, harsh, ridiculous man...Mr. Fitzwilliam? Did the author even READ Pride & Prejudice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"good consept but disappointing.","review":"When I saw this book the title made me think that Mr Darcy had been afflicted similiarly to the poor Mr. Bennett. A family of daughters and no sons. Not so, as I found. But it would have been more fun.Actually the book is disappointing in all aspects. The author did not try to recreate the dialogue between Elizabeth and Darcy, sending them overseas, but she did tackle Darcys' cousin Fitzwilliam. This energetic character from P % P she turned into a prejudiced, rule bound, critical and unsympathetic grouch. Caroline Bigley, now married, no more than a gossip- no strenght to her. And worst, is Lydia's transformation from the unlucky ... to the wife of a friend of the Prince of England and hostest of the greatest parties (routs) of the London season.NO. This is not amusing or entertaining. I won't give away the punch line of the scandal that is the denoument,(and how they are rescued) but it is far and away the most unrealistic contrivance that I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found it very hard to believe these were Fitzwilliam and Elizabeth Darcy's daughters. The storyline is entertaining, but I could not help but be disappointed that someone would come up with a story of them leaving their five daughters in London for over a year without their supervision. After all that Elizabeth went through with her own family and Darcy with his own sister, it's just unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Darcy's Daughters","review":"I didn't expect this to be on a par with Jane Austen, but I was looking forward to visiting the characters again.It is terrible! The characters that were in Pride & Prejudice are not the people they were - they're wooden and stripped of the good qualities Miss Austen gave them.There is no love, not even affection between the sisters or other family members. Those bonds of love and care that made Miss Austen's story so touching - that made them so powerful - are totally missing here.The characters in this book aren't even likeable! It makes for a very long read - in fact I gave up and tossed it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a movie makeover","review":"After reading the Fitzwilliam Darcy series from Aiden, I had high hopes of continuing my Pride and Prejudice passion. Instead, this was a poorly written remake of Pride and Prejudice with cardboard characters for the five sisters in the time period that is supposed to be the children although it is in the same time that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy first met. Find Aiden, it is a much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing...","review":"I am in love with Jane Austen, so I saw this book and eagerly picked it up. I didn't expect it to be on par with the original P&P;, but just silly fun. It doesn't even amount up to that.My main problem with this book is that it betrays the number on rule of writing: show, don't tell. Austen never said directly who her characters were, she let the dialoge and actions speak. This author tells us directly who each person is, and its quite annoying and shallow.The second problem is that all of the orginal characters lose much in the retelling. Mr. Fitzwilliam was a kind, sensitive gentlemen, now he's fussy. Caroline Bingley is reduced to a petty gossiper. The Gardiners become wealthy and on the top of society. Britain was not at the forefront of social mobility at this time, and its just stupid to have this done.Aston is neither witty, engaging or revealing. The characters are weak, silly and confusing.Avoid this like the plague. Spare yourself and go reread Austen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor imitation","review":"Its a risky thing to write a sequel to a classic novel...the author shouldn't have attempted it. The novel has Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth out of the country while their 5 daughters (what a coincidence?) run amok in London. The fact that the Darcy's have 5 daughters, whose personalities match the 5 original Bennett girls is irritating (2 stupid/silly girls, one pious girl, one pretty girl etc...). Really, since Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy were both appalled at her own family's manners and upbringing, I find it highly unlikely that they would let their unmarried girls loose on London without their supervision. The fact that the author created an elopment scandal as in the original book was lame. Skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beach book","review":"I am an Austen fan and loved P&P so was thrilled to see this book. I bought it without reading a single review. I just finished the book and have to say it reads more like a modern day romance novel. If you don't get your hopes up for quality writing it's a decent little book and a quick read. By the end of the story, however, you're not wishing the book would never end and that you would love to hear about the future of the characters. You're simply satisfied that it's ended. The book feels overly drawn out and the characters become somewhat annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible horrible HORRIBLE","review":"Honestly, do not read this book. It is not just that it offended the Jane Austen fanatic in me. Regardless of whether or not this book is a worthy sequel to 'Pride and Prejudice' (it's not), it's just a poorly written book. The prose is trite, the plot is choppy and unnecessarily elaborate (not to mention predictable) and the characters are painfully unappealing. Aston tries hard to reveal the social and family politics that oppress women of the time, but does it without any of Austen's wit or subtlety, making it distasteful rather than enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain silly","review":"PRIDE & PREJUDICE probably is the novel that created romance novels. As such, it was a curious book for a spinster in the English countryside to have written in the earliest years of the 19th century.Yet its author, Jane Austen, must have been an astute observer, because no book reveals the manners of its characters, and the rhythms of their lifestyle, more effectively.She penned a perfect story of romantic attraction and sexual tension and resolution; why that story seems so perfect cannot be quantified, but it unquestionably is the reason that \\"P & P\\" has remained a classic for two centuries.In comparison, MR. DARCY'S DAUGHTERS, a modern day \\"sequel\\" to \\"P & P\\" written almost 200 years later, just seems silly. A voice such as Miss Austen's, a voice that then was fresh and insightful, merely seems predictable and stilted and derivative when parodied here by the author of DAUGHTERS.Jane Austen no longer is around to defend herself and, really, she deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Originality","review":"After finishing Pride and Prejudice, I was looking for another book and happened upon Mr. Darcy's Daughters, however the book was a disappointment. The daughters' characters were repetitions of the Bennet sisters also, the plot was very similar to the original and lacking any suspense since the fate of all the characters was easily discernable early on in the novel. The attitude and actions of the characters are also extremely overdone and lacking plausibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it","review":"The thing with this book is I really wanted to like and there were moments of brillance but they are few and far between. I had to go back and re-read parts of Pride and Prejudice to ensure that the author really had butchered Mr. Fitzwilliam, who in the original is a great understanding and not judgmental character and the Gardiners.The only character I truly liked was Aletha, the youngest daughter but she barely does anything! The author jumps from character to character, sometimes requiring you to go back to figure out who is still talking. Nothing more irritating in a book. So as much as the idea of the book is but follow through lacks. Aletha is the only decent character and unfortunately, I doubt we will see her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It is impossible to believe that Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet's daughters would have turned out like the five in this book. The author is clearly trying to parallel the five Bennett daughters in the original book, but it doesn't come off. The constant sexual innuendo and references to sexual scandal may have been an attempt to give a modern sensibility to the story, but they succeed only in creating the impression of a drugstore romance novel. We keep hearing that Camilla is clever, but actually get no dialogue to support that; the rendering of Colonel Fitzwilliam is nothing short of character assassination; and the plot developments are fairly preposterous. Pretty much a waste of time, all things considered. Re-read the original instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Austen anyone?","review":"I'm halfway through this book, and, being a die-hard Austen fan, am as shocked as some of the other reviewers with the author's easy handling of characters from P&P;, with no resemblance at all to Austen's original intentions regarding Fitzwilliam (who is but a tiny presence in P&P;, so EA can be forgiven for changing his character), but no such mercies for the handling of Mrs. Gardiner, who occupies a substantial chunk of P&P; (Austen has rounded her off quite well).It's hard to follow Austen, but someone who is touted as a \\"passionate Jane Austen fan who studied with (an) Austen biographer,\\" (from the author's bio. at the back) should have respected her idol's boundaries a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Austenian style, but a bit short on suspense","review":"While I highly commend Miss Aston for her uncanny ability to emulate Jane's language and style, making this modern book read just like one of the beloved classics, and earning the book the 4 stars I've given it, I'd rate the plotline and pacing somewhat lower (like just 3 stars, but averaged with the 5 for tone, there's your 4). The story is rather more predictable than I'd have liked, and while I realize that that's partly done as a nod to the original Pride & Prejudice, I think that more demanding audiences would like a bit more suspense or less predictability (hence the average rating of just 2.5 stars for the book, I imagine). Still, this is a good read and a good buy, particularly for fanatics of Jane's."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful","review":"The book was fun to read and very entertaining... I found myself not wanting the book to end... Well done..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the original","review":"As a big Jane Austen fan, I was thrilled to see this book. However, while the author manages to catch the tone of Austen's style, especially in dialogue, it seems that her goal was to show the seamy side of Regency life. As one of Austen's characters might say, \\"It don't suit.\\" Austen's genius lies in her subtlety, where she shows that life was not as prim and proper as society would have it without being blatant about it. Aston shows none of Austen's humor. Readers wanting a taste of the forbidden in this period would be better off reading Austen's own \\"Mansfield Park.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Aston hates Austen??","review":"After reading this book, all I can say is that Elizabeth Aston clearly has no love for any of the characters in Pride and Prejudice. Col. Fitzwilliam is a lecherous dolt, Elizabeth is self-involved and careless of her daughters, and the rest of the original characters are given short shrift. As for the plot, Aston has taken the original five Darcy girls and turned them into inadequate and inane replicas of the Bennet sisters, complete with all the stereotypes each Bennet girl represented. The only difference is that Aston seems to amplify their faults while glossing over their finer qualities. Overall, I wish I had never read this horrible sacrilege."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can intelligent people raise stupid daughters?","review":"I suppose Mr. Darcy's Daughters would be fine for people who like the genre, but it assumes two very large stretches of imagination in its premise. Is it likely Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy would raise such silly daughters? And how plausible is it that a man as proud as Mr. Darcy would send his five heiress daughters to London during the season without his own oversight?This was a replay of Pride and Prejudice with the girls' temperatments shuffled, but the story is pretty much the same. Adding more modern touches, Aston also included a gay man and an unmarried Darcy daughter getting pregnant, apparently without anyone noticing.Preposterous. I read the whole thing, but became more and more agitated as the story continued. Ms. Aston has done her historical homework, but her story rings false."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read","review":"Jane Austen's books are addicting and I was excited to find a plethora of books available that carry on where she left off. This book was the first Jane Austen sequel I read. I found it disappointing that Elizabeth & Mr. Darcy were not in the book, but only mentioned in passing. I found their daughters to be cardboard (maybe there were too many characters in the story?) and I feel their characters could have been developed further. Also, [spoiler alert] I felt that some of the suspense towards the end of the book (one of the twins disappearing & leaving a note that she had married, but then finding out it was only a \\"joke\\") felt really contrived. When I first found this series, I was excited that the story would be told throughout a number of books, but after reading this one, I've decided to not persue the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, nothing more.","review":"This one was better than Mr. Darcy Takes A Wife. Darcy and Elizabeth have 5 daughters and have left them in the care of Colonel Fitzwilliam and his wife while they go on a diplomatic mission. Predictably, it's about the adventures of said daughters and not about Darcy and Elizabeth. The daughter's personalities are predictable yet again, and similar to the Bennet sisters of Longbourne.While not a suitable sequel to Pride and Prejudice, this one is entertaining. I bought it, and then sold it, so it wasn't worthy of remaining on my bookshelf, but it is certainly worthy of checking out of the library if you want to be entertained for a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elizabeth in Constantinople!","review":"As an Austen fan I have read practically all sequels to P&P. This one has a very imporatant fault from my POV: the author sent Elizabeth and Darcy to Istanbul and forgot them here. Instead we have a bunch of lively girls who are positioned as Mr. Darcy Daughters and have very little manners if at all. It seems that Elizabeth was a very careless mother and Darcy - a very indifferent father.All other personages are transformed and transformed very strangely. For example, Lydia and Gardiners becomes the cream of the ton!The story would be passable as \\"A Daughters of Somebody\\" but as a sequel of P&P it is simply uninteresting because the main heroes are absent and all others are not like themselves at all. I strongly recommend 1) the author to rename the story and sell it as not so bad Regency romance and 2) the Austen fans use their time more profitably and reread \\"Bar Sinister\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this tarted up \\"sequel\\" a miss","review":"As stated by numerous other readers, the characters in this book bear no resemblance whatsoever to those that Jane Austen created in her own novel. Even the characters that appeared in the original Pride and Prejudice seem so completely and utterly changed, the only thing they seem to share at all is a name.From a semi-historical standpoint, Aston does trot out a few colloquialisms and descriptions that seem realistic, however the behavior and actions of the characters themselves are completely anachronistic. It was laughingly sex-fueled and over-done, more of a Harlequin corset-ripper than any homage to Austen's fabulous creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Darcy's Daughters -- NOT","review":"It is difficult to believe Ms. Aston has read Pride and Prejudice for the simple reason that none of the \\"daughters\\" presented in this book could possibly be related to Mr. Darcy. The names are a dead give away: Letitia? (who is purely boring); Camilla ?? Traditionally children were named after relatives. Jane, Elizabeth, Georgiana, Mary, Catherine, Lydia, Charlotte. etc.But then it is impossible to believe that any of these silly, mannerless, oversexed, vulgar young women could have been brought up by the Darcys. Camilla grows a little but her love affairs are not believable. What are we told about Wytton that would make anyone love him?And then \\"Aunt Lydia?\\" What connection has she to the giddy brainless Lydia who runs away with Wickham? And Caroline Bingley?This book has no connection with Jane Austen. It is a much-too-long badly plotted Regency, who's author has used Mr. Darcy's name as a selling point."},{"rating":"1","title":"very sad it did not live up to my expectations","review":"I didn't even have very high expectations. After reading this I thought that people should leave well enough alone. You cannot possible match up to Jane Austen. The book was very disappointing. The characters were annoying, I didn't like how colonel fitzwilliam was portrayed at all. I would have thought he would be more agreeable. The daughters of Darcy and Elizabeth were not very engaging. It is a quick read however. It lacked character development and I don't feel I got to know all the sisters. it read like a regency romance novel. There was not natural wit to the writing. Wow. . .I was pretty harsh. I guess you should read it as a romance novel but not as a sequel to Jane Austen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"If you love Jane Austen, you will hate this book. It is nothing like Jane Austen's writing, with her subtle, witty observations of personalities and moralities. In this book, the dialog is awkward and most of the characters unlikable. I was so angry that I wasted money on this book that I threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even get past page 41.","review":"This archly coy wanna-be was replete with a number of errors that any halfway decent historical novelist should have caught. The Season starts in March, so people are returning to London then, NOT leaving it. And a woman being the victim of a would-be fiance's amnesia is NOT grounds for denying her vouchers to Almack's. People married younger in those days, but for the Darcy twins to say they had 17 year old friends who were already married a year? Mr. Gardiner was Mrs. Bennet's BROTHER, NOT her UNCLE! Nor was he \\"in trade\\", per se; he was a solicitor. Has this woman even READ Pride & Prejudice, or just the Cliff Notes (tm)? And those are just for starters. Badly contrived and far too derivative of what the author thinks the original was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking forward to a good read!","review":"The book arrived on time and in pristine condition. I look forward to a good read and sharing the book with my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride and Prejudice and Pathetic","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever taken to the beach. What a letdown. Instead of a Jane Austen-esque novel filled with good fun and lighthearted humor, this book is full of unlikeable, one-dimensional characters. The very idea that Elizabeth and Darcy would allow their children to roam about London is preposterous in itself. But instead of making this a fun romp, the author took the exact same plot and characters and made them boring and stupid.The best part of this book? The cover art. Or possibly when it ended. Honestly, the author copied Pride and Prejudice, except Pride and Prejudice and Zombies was an infinitely better take on the familiar plot. If you must read it, get it from a library for God's sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't knock it! It was a perfectly good read","review":"I have read a great many pride and prejudice variations, and I seriously feel that this one gets a bad rap because people are not accepting it for what it is. This one is a different story with different characters, by an author who has a knowledge at how to keep a reader engaged. She takes Lizzy and Darcy, puts them in the background and focuses on their daughters. Aston is using Jane Austen's world to make a new story and it is a very entertaining read. Usually when new authors take their P and P adaptations too far away from Lizzy, Darcy, Jane and Bingley, I get bored and lose interest. This is the first P and P novel where those four were not there and I was still interested. Don't knock this novel until you try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be at the bottom of the ocean","review":"I was searching for music pertaining to the actual ship (songs played on board, written about the disaster).

Otherwise the reader would be better off buying \\"the Girlfriends Guide to..\\" series by Vicki Iovine or \\"What to expect the First Year\\"The book rambles on in many different directions and doesn't really offer any REAL useful advice for a new mother of multiples (or any mother for that matter).Better reads for new mothers of multiples would be:1.) \\"Mothering Multiples: Breastfeeding & caring for twins or more\\" by Karen Gromada2.) \\"When you're expecting twins triplets or quads: a Complete resource\\" by Barbara Luke"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a twins book","review":"I was looking for a funny tongue and cheek read about twins that would also provide some good information on having and raising them. However, I was disappointed in the amount of twin specific information in this book. In addition to this, instead of providing a lighthearted perspective for my wife it caused her to get stressful about the prospect of having twins. The book may advise for one to have a sense of humor about having twins, but it certainly didn't seem to provide one.I wouldn't recommend this book as a twins book, nor would I recommend it if you are trying to give your wife a coping read. The authors of this book may consider themselves \\"REAL Experts,\\" but I REALLY wish I hadn't bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marriage venting not advice","review":"The author seems to spend the more time complaining about what her husband doesn't do then giving real advice.

Elizabeth does a great job at putting humor into raising twins and making you feel as though you will survive! The best part is that the author is a mom herself and not a Doctor telling you how you should raise twins.Definately a must have book for raising twins!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, buy it, buy it!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Not only did it give me a hands on account of a REAL mother's perspective but it also gave me great tips and useful ideas. I literally read this book in only a few hours because I couldn't put it down. This book really gave me a peace of mind that everything is doable even with an active toddler; which was a huge relief to me because my son won't even be 2 when my twins are born. The author really makes you feel part of her \\"sorority\\" which is a great feeling when you know no one else who has had twins. I am really glad I stumbled across this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, reassuring, helpful read","review":"After reading many, maybe all, books on parenting twins, I was beginning to wonder where the fun was in the process of twin rearing.

It's a quick read, but that doesn't mean it is light on helpful insight. It's written in a positive style (\\"You *will* survive, things *will* get better\\"). Not sure that we'll be making our own baby food, but at least that's included in the Appendices. Overall a highly recommended book for parents expecting twins (or more!) or those with recently delivered multiples at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Opportunity","review":"This book felt more like a gossip commentary on the woman who wrote this book and her local mom friends than something that others could learn from. This book could have been a real help for me but it missed the mark. The author of this book has infant twins AND and older daughter, as do I. One of many challenges of the last year has been how to give the babies all that they need emotionally and physically while managing the development and emotional state of my older daughter. Practical advice was missing -- things like how do you take them all shopping at the grocery store? While the original message may have been lost in the editing, it seemed like her older daughter was ignored during the babies first year."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointed!","review":"If you have children already and you\`re pregnant with twins, the book won\`t teach you anything.I have a 3 years old girl and expecting two more girls.I knew 90% of information the book has to offer.And to be honest with you, if you\`re mature enough you don\`t need this kind of advice, like \\"don\`t leave children unattended while bathing them\\" it\`s pretty obvious and doesn\`t refer to twins only!Save money for diapers, this book doesn\`t worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertainment for Toddlers","review":"As the father of a toddler with discriminating tastes, itlooks like Blue's Room is a big winner.

While I took away maybe one or two pointers away from the total read, it purely was written with the alcoholic in mind. NOT the family member being affected by the alcoholic. I was greatly disappointed in the content matter of this book. I had expected a more well-rounded source of information, not to just reflective opinion and direction on how to handle your alcoholic.

However...We now have this limp, tepid, jejune, uninspired, deranged, insulting, idiotic, stale, bland, revolting, syphilitic piece of pure and utter filth with the Christian Death name branded on it. I really don't know what to say. Isn't Valor in his 40s? Shouldn't he be trying to act his age, instead of taking on the kind of music most people produce when they're still in high school?

Unfortuntely, the quality of photos ended up being so poor that no amount of photoshop editing could help and I ended up returning the product.It's definitely a cute camera and it feels and handles beautifully, unfortunately, it fails at its main purpose, which is taking at least decent (or at least recognizeable) images.

The writing is sub par and it is clear that this is a second edition work.For example, the author will introduce an acronym and fail to identify what it stands for, or you will find materials that should be restricted to later chapters incorporated into earlier chapters, which creates a scattered organization feel.Her work in Wynar's Introduction to Cataloging and Classification is of significantly higher quality and is more apropos for an introductory level class than this text.All and all, I would not recommend this text fro an introduction to knowledge organization.

It is gripping hard science fiction that takes a hard look at the Fermi Paradox"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on It","review":"IMO, this book is the archetype of what a science fiction book should never be, I mean filled up with pseudoscientific theories that will quickly be obsolete. Paradoxically, all that pseudoscientific lore gives way to a mumbo-jumbo completely unbelievable. Nothing holds out. Already, 15 years after the book was written, many hypothesis are laughable. Pretty amazing because the authors are supposed to be serious scientists.

I contacted the Luigi Bormioli company and they were heappy to replace the broken glasses. When they arrived, however, they were the wrong glasses. I returned them to the company, along with the broken glasses I had received to be sure they sent the correct glasses. Again they happily sent new glasses and even included a few extra in case any broke in shipment again. I would highly recommend these glasses and this company!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb !","review":"I have been a Garth Brooks fan for a few years.

You have previously released cd's from Garth Brooks with a slab on the side of each one stating the words LIMITED SERIES. For anyone who already owns cds of Garth Brooks this whole set is a waste of time you just have duplicates. My advice to Garth Brooks is to say if you are going to release some kind of Box set release what George Strait kind of did by adding music never heard before not the same old story. Garth Brooks what is the limited series?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A true low for an \\"artist\\"","review":"Garth knows no boundries does he?

You can hear all of his early songs (before he became a megastar) and listen to how his style has changed. Thiswas an excellent marketing ploy by his record company- kind of a Stephen King serial novel- put everything in together and people will pay, and, yet, it would not be a good deal if you already have his early stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garth - Be Loyal - Release the new songs on a separate CD!","review":"This collection is great for new Garth fans, but it is a stick in the eye for long-time loyal fans (like me) who already own all 6 releases. Not only did I pay more than new fans, but now I am expected to REPURCHASE the CDs to get the 6 new songs?!? The new songs are not even available as song samples in Amazon.GARTH'S TEAM NEEDS TO RELEASE THE 6 NEW SONGS (AND MAYBE A FEW MORE) ON A SEPARATE CD FOR THE LONG-TIME, LOYAL FANS WHO MADE HIM THE MEGA-STAR HE IS TODAY.Didn't anybody who works for Garth think of this before? I have been quietly waiting for months. This should be a no-brainer. Not to mention a lot more money for Garth's coffers. How about some loyalty on your part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection!","review":"I love this collection. It is almost the same price as buying each of these six albums individually, but when you buy this set, you get a bonus track on each album that was not on the original album releases. Some of the reviewers on here are confused, though. Garth Brooks has released more than one set, and you need to make sure you're ordering the right set. This particular set has all of Garth's first six studio albums, excluding the Christmas album. The reviewers talking about Sevens, Scarecrow, or Double Live are mistaken, and are leaving their reviews on the wrong product description. I am very happy with my purchase, and I would recommend this to anyone, as the albums have an appeal that goes beyond just a fan of country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Garth Brooks, you need to buy this set","review":"Any true Garth fan will want to add this to his or her collection. Where else can you get every song ever recorded Brooks for $30? This box set is sure to be a collectors item. From slow moving ballads to fast paced honkey tonk, these 6 albums define country music for our generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific for a first time buyer","review":"This CD collection is wonderful if you're a big Garth fan but lack sufficient resources to buy his CD's seperately.

Callas, Sutherland and Caballe seem to be an extinguished breed of singers, so both theatres and recording companies have to make do with thinner voices, unable to sing the musical line in sort of a \\"lunar\\" way, and to convey any kind of emotion. Bel canto is not just about high notes and fireworks, it's one of the most expressive music ever written! Gruberova should shy away from Bellini & Donizetti heavier parts and stay with Zerbinetta, Queen of the Night etc. where she's marvellous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Canter performing works by Benjamin Britten and Gerald Finzi","review":"This 1998 recording on Carlton Classics features British oboist Robin Canter, the Medici String Quartet and pianist Simon Nicholls on the following works:Benjamin BrittenSix Metamorphoses after Ovid for oboe solo Op.49Phantasy for oboe and string trio Op.2Temporal Variation for oboe and pianoTwo Insect Pieces for oboe and pianoGerald FinziInterlude in A minor for oboe and string quartet Op.21The Finzi Interlude is rarely recorded and you should definitely snap up this recording by this outstanding oboist Robin Canter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat 'n Easy!","review":"Tired of being generous in preparing a drink for your friends, only to see the jigger overflow onto your fingers holding a regular jigger?

It lasted all of 2 months before the bushing (the bearing for the cutter) in the jar base permanently froze up and would have burned out the motor too if I hadn't switched it off as it immediately began smoking and creating a terrible smell. I tried WD-40 and some other things to un-jam the cutter but this duck was dead. I had maintained it well and kept it clean so it wasn't due to poor maintenance. I wouldn't waste my money on any Back to Basics products after seeing how this one was constructed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Easy","review":"Great for mixing up a protein shake for a quick breakfast.

After that, if it doesn't work or breaks, it's yours to keep FOREVER.Here's what happened: I unpacked it, read the directions, plugged it in, put my fruit and yogurt in side, locked the lid down, and hit the start (pulse) button - nothing happened.

These swords are called wallhangers because they are only designed to by hung on a wall, not swung. The reason is that underneath the handle is a very small piece of metal that connects to the blade itself. (Called the Tang) In a real martial arts sword, the tang is normally a thick piece of metal that is almost the thickness of the sword itself. If you swing a wallhanger too often or too hard it can break at the tang, and fly off and hurt someone.If you want to learn more about how dangerous these wallhangers are do a google search on the words: anatomy of a wallhangerAny sword designed for real martial arts practice- like Iaido, starts at $250 not $15, and should be bought at a reputable Iaido store.

There are very few swords that can be used, among these are Paul Chen's, Cold Steel's and the Last Legend stuff. Only buy this if you intend to put it on your wall because failure is not a possability it is guaranteed if you try to use this blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality - Not Meant For Use","review":"This sword is like the 440 High Carbon Steel that is cheaply made.

These do, indeed, revert to a more classical style of puzzle. I found some real duds - who remembers all those ancient Olympics winners, anyway? And I hate looking up stuff. The big plus is that it's a smaller format than the Sunday puzzles, so the boxes are bigger! I can actually see what I wrote in them!

They do this because most headphones do not have a subwoofer or specialized speakers for different frequencies.By using the SIK adapter, you get pure, uncompressed audio that gives you the full range of the music. I have 2 JL W3 10\\" subwoofers in my car, and the difference between the audio quality and bass response is like light and day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything it needs to be...","review":"Great product if your car has a input jack for mp3 players but not a dedicated Ipod input.

She's a new yorker (displaced from England) in her early 30's & single. The novel begins with her going out with her boyfriend to an expensive meal. She believes he is going to propose to her, when in actuality, he wants to break up. So begins the hijinks that carry on for the rest of this book. Freya moves in with her friend Jack and begins to date men through personals in the back of a magazine. But it's the last place she looks where she finds true love. But is it too late? Read this novel to find out. It's well written, funny, & the characters are well developed.

It's like being with a crazy, funny, charming friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great romantic comedy","review":"I love romantic comedies like Sleepless in Seattle or When Harry Met Sally, and Just Friends was the perfect book for me. Freya's struggles to find the perfect man, when he was really right under her nose the whole time, were hilarious and touching. Her friendship with Cat was endearing, and Cat's own romantic hijinks added a great subplot to the book. I think this the perfect summer beach read, or curl up with a bowl of popcorn and have a girl's night in book."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

It's really hard to sympathize with a character who is so completely self-absorbed, bitter and judgemental.

The girl was a bit of a witch at times and the guy could be a real jerk. I thought she was kind of pushy and demanding. He was kind of shallow. But by the end, I did start to warm to them, but he did still continue to be a jerk. I think it was an ok book to read, but in the end I never fully came to like either one of them. I have read better chicklit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable ...","review":"Although I think \\"Perfect Stranger\\" was much better than this, I think this one wasn't that bad. Yes, it was predictable, and the main characters (Jack and Freya) seemed a little bit childish, but still I enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"I cannot tell you how much I liked this book, it was wonderful. It is set between America and Great Britain and it is well written and fun. Frey is a great heroine. She is funny, entertaining and self-depreciating. I loved the romantic tension between herself and Jake. Can men and women ever really be just friends? That's the all important question! This is a real age turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, with great advice through observations.","review":"Just Friends is one of the best books I have ever read and I think everyone should take the time to read this.

As an Arabic teacher I thought I might be able to use the Arabic edition with my beginner students. However, I found the Arabic version was not well thought out. There doesn't seem to be any attempt to simplify the series model. You are expected to absorb the same amount of vocabulary and grammar as for a European language when that simply isn't realistic for Arabic. The addition of transliteration makes the pages horribly over-crowded and mixing English, Arabic and transliteration in bi-directional instructions is completely confusing. I couldn't follow them as a fluent Arabic speaker, so I doubt a learner would be able to. The whole course shows a lack of understanding of how a learner's needs differ in Arabic from European languages.

I teach a course in which we have to know the wind velocity as part of a computation. There was a five knot wind when we set it up and it immediately began to fold. The horizontal cross members are connected with the flimsiest connection I have ever seen and they were unable to withstand a five knot wind. The top continuously caved in on the upwind side.I tried to call the company and was told someone would get back to me; no one ever has.

What a rip off! My daughter and I used it this week end for our first craft fair and this is what we encountered when we opened the box. The ropes were not long enough to anchor the canopy. The sides did not fit properly. The zippered front and back was ripped along the seam of the zipper. The zipper on the carrying case popped apart. The one side of the canopy was bowed in and definitely not sturdy. The so-called stakes were the diameter of an oversized paperclip. Do NOT waste your money. We were extremely disappointed and very embarrased by our canopy. Thank God it didn't rain or have strong winds. Atleast someone was on our side. I would not suggest this canopy to anyone.

I set it up a few times at a local farmers market and had no problems. The fourth time the framework started to come apart and two roof supports came completely apart. I brought the tent home and set it up with no problem. I tightened all the joints that have screws and noticed that many of the riveted joints had been damaged and were not very secure. Still the tent stood. I tried to set the tent up at yesterday's market and never succeeded before the frame collapsed into a mangled heap of useless metal. I realize that the item I bought is a low cost, low value, cheaply made item but I hoped to use it more before it became useless. I will try to fix it using bolts, washers and nuts in all the joints. I will also put a 2 x 2 on each of the four sides using some type of bracket. If it works, good for me.

The tent (yes I have weights to hold it down) doesn't stand up for anything in wind. The walls are frayed and ripped where the Velcro is that attached them to the tent.

Second set up, one little gust of wind, and it collapsed and bent the ceiling frame. now I have a useless tent.this product might be ok for indoor use, but made with cheap materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadness","review":"Sadness is what the tent has brought us. We thought maybe we'd been setting it up improperly, causing extreme wear and tear (after probably 3 uses), but after seeing all of these other negative reviews, it's clear that this is an inferior product. Please spend your money on something better-made with sturdier materials. The bag ripped the first day we used it, and the metal \\"structure\\" of the canopy was soon to follow, with bars snapping in half where they were screwed together.

The first time I set it up two hours into the festival a gust of wind came along and bent the aluminum frame so badly we had to pack up and go home and the tent was ruined after one use.

It turned out it worked out just fine. The tent would've been heavy for me to haul around if had I not have my husband to help. Setting up the tent was pretty easy. We didn't even use the stakes and ropes came with in the package and it stayed up from Friday afternoon through Sunday afternoon. It rained during the nights, but it didn't fall, granted it wasn't too heavy of rain storms, but still it made me feel better getting this item.

It might be appropriate for a one-time use or an indoors use, but it is extremely light-weight aluminum that bends with a woman's fingers. I decided to keep the canopy because I liked the side walls which are attached with tie-tabs and velcro tabs.

I can tie the side walls to my commercial-weight canopy frame with ease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"So I broke mine the first time I set it up.

The Velcro for the sides ripped off 30 seconds after closing it for the first time. Seems inside the tent were falling apart when we took it out of the package.

The metal frame is weak, but you can get a replaceable frame cheap from walmart or the like that is much better for around $30. The canvas is NOT waterproof, if you didn't know. A light rain and you'd be fine, anything more than that, and you're in trouble. BUT, just use some water proofer you can get for tents and you'll do fine.this tent (and even the big money tents) absolutely need a means other than the provided stakes to keep them from blowing away. I recommend the 60lb bags of sand from Lowes or Home Depot attached to the metal legs.So, this is exactly what I expected, and after a couple of simple (and cheap) modifications, I have a tent I expect to be able to use regularly for at least a couple of years. I do a lot of craft shows, this is pretty simple and easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One time use, that's ALL.","review":"Wow, was I ever disappointed.

Secondly, and more importantly the selves are too tight to fit the majority of the bottles of wine I own - apparently you need to specifically purchase bottles with smaller bases if you want to use this refrigerator (per their customer service). Since that isn't how I purchase my wine, I find that very annoying. Every time I want to pull out a bottle I need to use two hands to yank out the shelf and both the shelf above and bellow come out with it - I then need to make sure none of these fall to the floor.

For some reasons I still think that Whitney should end up in Nicki's arms. Nicki is so much more lovable than Clayton!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Disappointed","review":"First, let me admit that I bought this book solely to read Judith McNaught's story. I only recently stumbled onto her and after reading Whitney My Love and the two associated books, when I read that this story was about Nick Du Ville, I quickly ordered the book.What a total disappointment. Even without knowing that the characters of Nick and Julia Skeffington are characters in the other books, this story doesn't hold water. It reads like an outline. And it could have been a great book in and of itself. Why go to the trouble of creating such a wonderful character as Nick, having him very visible and playing rather large roles in previous books, then dismiss him like this. Better not to have written any further about him at all.In fairness to the other authors whose stories form this compilation, the fact that I was so disgusted with Miracles made me completely uninterested in reading them.

It probably would have saved me much aggravation with other co-workers who I felt \\"socialized\\" too much as well. Over all, this book provides good suggestions to keep in the back of your mind as you are progressing through your working career. Remember that everyone is different and not all of the ideas or suggestions will work for you so keep the ones that do and toss the ones that don't as you work your way up the career ladder :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Divorced Woman: Author of Congratulations on Your Divorce: The Road to Finding Your Happily Ever After","review":"This book is a great resource for women, especially if they are faced with the challenge of getting back into the work force. Many women entering the world of divorce have to face the reality that they now need to support themselves and maybe thier children on their own. They are filled with uncertainty and anxiety. This book offers strategies to be effective at work that are easy to digest and entertaining yet delivers real life solutions to challenges women face. Reading the book makes you feel like you are talking to girlfriends who are telling you the way of the work world; the good-bad and ugly. I loved it and learned a lot from these women, I will continue to reccomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to write a review","review":"I purchased this book after reading the great reviews given here on Amazon. I'm really irratated and annoyed by this book. The writers spend so much time repeating the same information over and over again. They want to make it very clear that they're trying to be \\"Big Sisters.\\" Okay we got it! The writers put too much lame wit and clever humor that it annoys a serious minded person like myself. They write about celebs and brands. We get enough of that through the media. The point in buying and reading a book is to get away for the forced in your face industry people that have appointed themselves as the superior human beings. Kate Hudson has nothing to do with why I purchased this book.Please people save your money and time. I'm confident that most of the reviews written here are not unbiased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but I agree with the other reviewer","review":"It was basically a sugar coated version of \\"Power\\".I wish everyone luck in their new endeavors. What these women say are unfortunately true. What you learn all through school and life is that if you work hard, you get credit. In the real world - it's nothing like that.You're better off reading \\"The 48 Laws of Power\\". It's the truth. NON-sugar-coated but it's blunt and truthful. Hold on weak stomached people.. it's a learning curve no one ever told you about but one that if you should learn early on... will help you in the future for years and years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"great price for a great movie","review":"great price for a great movie...everyone should have a copy!

Tommy Lee Jones plays a Texas Ranger who must protect 5 college cheerleaders from a hitman hired to clean up after a botched assassination. The interaction between Jones and the girls are funny, and Cedric the Entertainer is good as the Priest who was also a former cheerleader himself.The only downside is that there are moments where the cheese facter reeks a little too much. This movie is not neccisarrily intelligent or witty, but as an overall comedy it does itself pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tommy, why?","review":"I am a big fan of Tomomy Lee Jones, so my question to him is: : \\"WhY?\\" Why make this movie, were you bored, needed the work, what?

I know your from Texas Tommy, but as a fellow Texan, once again: Why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Man of the House","review":"I like Tommy Lee Jones, I know the pundits panned the movie as poor, but I find it funny and serious parts. Being a Texas ranger (Jones) and having to protect college cheerleaders from a bad guy and pretending to be their coach is funny, but the girls and Jones come around to understand each other and the girls help save his daughter in the end shows that they are made of the right stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up, everyone! Tommy Lee did!","review":"Okay, it's not Shakespeare. It's not brilliant cinema. And I didn't see it for the cheerleading babes (I don't do cheerleading babes). I do do Tommy Lee Jones (okay, I admit it-- I have a real thing for Tommy Lee Jones). And, while he's primarily a dramatic actor, and has done lots of heavy roles and thriller/adventure stuff-- in which he shines, usually above the material--- I think he's just a hoot and a half in the comedies he's done. I can watch MIB and MIIB over and over. And even if this movie is feather-light, Tommy Lee delivers his deadpan straight lines in such a way that you can't help but getting a kick out of it. The editorial reviews really nailed it: yes, it's predictable, yes it's fluff--- but it's good and fun predictable fluff. If you liked Mr. Jones in the the Men In Black films, you'll like him in this too. He certainly seemed to have fun doing it. No reason for you not to have fun watching it. I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER","review":"Tommy Lee has never been in a worse film. A comedy please I'd laugh harder at Barney.

JONES!","review":"Tommy Lee Jones is one of the best actors out there today. What makes him so great is his dry humor. He can look and act serious even during the funniest moments, making him the funniest character in most of his films. With \\"Man of the House,\\" Mr. Jones brings this talent into a new arena: the cheerleader film.\\"Man of the House\\" would be a drab if not for Jones. The girls are funny at times, as is Cedric the Entertainer.

Also FYI I was amazed (none of the girls had dance or cheerleading previously) - they all did great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Recommended For Anyone Living Under A Rock","review":"A few stars, cheerleaders, comedy and romance seems an inevitable combination for success, right? Uh...no. Man of the House miserably fails to appeal to its target audience.The acting by the cheerleaders is lame. There is room for plot development, but only a shallow attempt is made. What more could go wrong?The story is very slow moving. The background plot of the murder seems irrelevant really. Most of us are watching it for the cute cheerleaders. But instead, we are given stupid girls with no personality. Heck, even sterotypes fail us! We want to laugh at the combination of an uptight ranger and adolescent girls, but Man of the House fails to deliver, yet again.Basically, a no go with me. However, if you live under a rock and are completely oblivious to the world around you, you may find this funny and slightly enjoyable. For the rest of us, stick to the classics like Bring It On."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I love this cd.

Seria un gran exito! Atentamente, Abel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite music from Cuba","review":"I was so impressed by Silvio's music that it inspired me to learn how to play the guitar when I was 17. I could decently play by ear many of this album's songs and impress a few people with those skills. At the time, that was one of the most rewarding achievements of my life, which made me even think for a while that I could make a living as a musician. I decided otherwise, but I still play the guitar sometimes when time allows it, and I have never stopped listening to Silvio's Music. Yes, I do not share his political points of view but Silvio has many personal dimensions, the most relevant being an artist. It may sound crazy and corny, but I have Silvio's music in the same shelf with my Couperin, Telemann and others from the Baroque, even though they belong in another period in history, but there is something about them all, maybe the originality of their work. They all make me feel the same pleasant sensation. I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read, kind of tricky","review":"I had to have this book for my bases of speech class and I enjoyed that it was a short read.

This point of view is a slap in the face to crime victims.I picked up this book - from the library; thank goodness I didn't pay money for it - and was looking forward to Cameron's return to Toussaint, LA, the town where she's set several previous novels. It lacked the intrigue, suspense and plotting of any of her previous work. After the above-referenced disgusting scene, I skipped to the last few pages to discover the villian, who was no surprise.I'd give this zero stars if I could.

Like so many other people have said, they changed quality control somewhere, and these things now suck.First 2012 headset I got didn't work. The speaker was broken. Called the vendor, they sent me a replacement without even asking for me to send the broken 1 back. This says to me that this has become a disposable, crappy item.The second 2012 headset arrived in the mail and the headphone speaker worked, but the mute switch was broken.

I also heard myself, and the static/noise I was producing, which breaks new ground in the annoying department and makes any phone call impossible.Clarity tells the world that any of three Plantronics (they own Clarity, or vice-versa) headsets will work with my phone, and most of their other cordless phones.

The model I was replacing had a volumne control on the cord - but the cord on this model did not have that feature. That ended up being a design change that made the product less usable. I tried all three of the new ones, but in each case, was uable to hear callers on my side above a whisper.

Very dissatisfied with the headset I bought made by Panasonic for my Panasonic KX-TGA930T, I thought I would try this. The Panasonic headset has a stupid hole in the lower section of the slider which weakens the unit. Mine broke there. I bought this one because from the pictures, I could not see a hole. Alas, the entire lower section has only three sides so I guess it won't last very long either. At least the plastic is thicker on this.I am very happy to report that the sound quality on my end and the called party's end are very good. The microphone arm does have a stop to it so you cannot spin it around and break the wires like you can on the Panasonic headset.

The story is constant and interesting. I could go into detail about the plot and characters, but it would serve you better do to the research yourself (plus there are other reviews that describe the story).

Yeah it sounds nice and all that but now it doesn't power up at all. I tried just the batteries-nothing. I tried the power cord-still nothing. I tried taking it back to Target, nothing. Altec Lansing Customer Service wasn't helpful. In the trash it went after I took a baseball bat to it. I need something that works and this did for awhile but it was manufactured horribly and is cheap plastic. I went with JBL and am very satisfied with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfied","review":"I have had several problems with this product. I listen to music while I sleep and if i ever get a text or a call on my cell phone regardless of the cell phone being on silent, the player picks up the frequency of the call and an extremely loud static noise comes from the speakers about five times louder then how the music is playing. The remote hardly works, it has to be almost directly in line with the receiver. The volume control is limited, the intervals at which it is controlled are large so the desired volume affect is difficult to attain if you want it playing extremely quiet. When it is playing loud also a slight buzz is heard. The springs that allow the player to become portable also wear out quickly so the player doesn't stand up after awhile without u holding it. The only reason i would ever recommend this is because it is cheaper then many other players. If you are looking for anything half decent, then this is the wrong one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good produce with one miner defect.","review":"I really enjoy listening to my ipod on this system.

Finally, it didn't play anymore.Returned it to the Apple Store where purchased to find that there was only a 15 day return policy and I missed it by 2 days. So, I tried to contact Altec Lansing. The phone number in the owners book didn't work although I tried for several days. Then I emailed the Altec support email.

They work great for a boost if a few friends and I are watching a movie on a laptop screen, and, for my four and a half hour drive home, I can wedge these into the passenger seat with my ipod and skim past all of the dead radio zones, or those with only country and very fuzzy npr.They're not magical, and they get a little tinny with loud volumes, but they're a hell of a lot better than my laptop speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot.","review":"Sound - okay, nothing to brag about, kind of tinny, but I didn't expect much. The remote wouldn't track forward or back. I was still intrigued, but what broke the deal was when I removed my nano ipod from the dock - it went blank and I had to restore it. A little unsettling. Made me leary of using it again, but I did (positive thinking) and the same thing happened. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice... It's going back and I'll try the Sonic dock/speakers instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, could accomodate my original iPod","review":"I was very pleased with this product simply because it has attachments to fit all iPods.

O'Rourke is known as a conservative yet you won't find him proselytizing here (well, not much and never directly).

The reader will laugh out loud and learn a few things at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give P.J. a Chance","review":"P.J. O'Rourke is a humorist and one of the most eloquent mainstream advocates of Libertarianism around. O'Rourke believes the Jefforsonian axiom that government is best that governs least. In pursuit of that truth, he travels around the world looking for examples that prove his point. All of that, however, is secondary to the fact that he's a damn funny writer who enjoys tweaking liberals, which he does with the very title of this book.

Well, some things are better left unsaid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and eye-opening","review":"PJ O'Rourke is an author whose niche is opening the eyes and minds of those who have OD'd on conventional wisdom.

I loved \\"Evergreen,\\" the comeback CD, but this new one, I'm sad to say, is a turkey--slow, wimpy and boring. It reminds me of the horrid Ian McCulloch solo efforts of the mid-80s. It has been a long, strange trip for Echo and the Bunnymen. Maybe it's time to call it a day. In the meantime, I've still got \\"Heaven Up Here\\" and lots of good memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dunno...","review":"I thought Evergreen was a bit too...mellow, but compared to this, it sounds like Porcupine. EatB mark II has been rather disappointing to me (although I do rather enjoy Candleland and Mysterio). Anyway, while I suppose WAYGTDWYY? has some songs that are decent enough, it's not spectacular. When people compare this and/or Evergreen to Ocean Rain, they seem to forget that OR was hardly a soft-rocking album, what with frenzied numbers like Thorn of Crowns and Silver--and when it wasn't rocking full-out, it had a great dark, brooding vibe to it that WAYGTD decidedly lacks. I mean, come on--we all became B-Men fans because of numbers like Villiers Terrace, Stars are Stars, and Happy Death Men, didn't we? This isn't even close, although it does increase my appreciation of Evergreen. You said I was just a touch away...but I'm not even close...no I'm nowhere near. A good summation of this album, that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"I am a new fan of these guys...wow. I didn't know what to expect.

My friends used to make fun of me because of it(what do they know?). I absolutely love everything up to and including Echo's 1987 self-titled album. Evergreen was ok (love Altamont), but if I'm asked to describe What Are You Going To Do With Your Life?, only 3 words come to mind: BIG 'OLE SNOOZE!!!!!! Forget about Unisom, or any other over-the-counter sleep aid. Just give a listen to this album. I like Rust and Get In The Car, but other than that, ZZzzzzz..............! The other two tracks on the CD single \\"Rust\\" were pretty good. This album was just too mellow. They should have tried balancing it out with a few classic Bunnymen sounds. It's worth buying anyway. I guess you can always use it for medicinal purposes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly un-inspiring stuff","review":"What are you doing with your life, indeed? Not much by the sound of things here. If you liked the syrup-y sounds of Candleland, this is for you.

This album, however, was a total let down. As other's have commented, this is a very mellow album. That, by itself, is not bad. The trouble is the songs and lyrics are very lame and unimaginative.

McCulloch seems to have found some resolution since the fevered days of \\"Thorn of Crowns\\" and \\"Over the Wall.\\" Ironically, my investment in the Bunnymen always had as much to do with Will Sargeant's swirling, swizzle-stick guitar as it did with McCulloch's brandy-rich vocals. On \\"What Are You Going to Do\\" Sargeant's chopping guitar has mellowed considerably; at first listen, his fingerprints seem missing here. However, like the album as a whole, after some careful forensics, you discover that both he and McCulloch are alive and well, having merely moved to a quieter neighborhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"a mature, unified classic","review":"This album is a mature, unified classic which deserves to be ranked with their best work: Ocean Rain, Heaven Up Here etc. But this album has something that those albums don't: An overall theme to the album, a theme that every song on the album contributes to and supports. It is more of a song cycle, and it holds up like a great book of poems or a great book of short stories. Well worth repeated listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"show of strength","review":"Echo continues to amaze with their latest. True fans will embrace for their love of the music that has kept them loyal for years. As a true loyal fan i enjoy the vast majority of the Echo catalog. And you will too.

After there last outing (Evergreen) I assumed that they would return to a more progressive/pop sound. Unfortunately this was not the case.

However there are far too many glitches, and I'm still trying to figure out how a company screws up a timer. I threw out the strap from the get go, and as if I clipped it onto my shorts it would flop off.The screen can be hard to read but not impossible, the \\"bell\\" is not bad but could be louder. Mine worked fine in the beginning but now frequently miss counts rounds,re-sets it self, and freezes! Its a pain when doing heavy bag work since I need to take my gloves of to re-set everything.

Perhaps it's not that bad when I think about it; however, my rating is due to my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Unlike a lot of reviewers giving this a poor rating my timer has actually worked for a few years. Even with that said, I believe it was the last Everlast product I will ever buy. The company has tanked in quality for about ten years, leaving only (some) heavy bags and perhaps medicine balls to hold up to Everlast's former reputation.My biggest issue with this isn't the timer itself, it's the strap and clip that come with it- those are junk and I would suspsect the reason many people have their timers break so quickly. The strap that was included was quite a bit longer than the average boxer/martial artist could use, making it difficult to secure on smaller people. The clip is designed to hook in to this strap, unfortunately the spring behind it is extremely weak which means it's going to bounce off if there is any intensity behind someone's punches.In short, spend your money on a different timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I bought this one because I figured if it broke I'm not out much money, I figured I might get lucky but I didn't. Sure enough the other reviews are correct, it is very cheap and very porely built. The batteries don't fit in well and the cover to them is tough to keep on. It worked for about 8 work outs and then it just went nuts and even by adjusting the batteries it won't work right. Save the 10 bucks and buy something different. This is a terrible product. I can only imagine how many of these end up in the local land fill within a month of purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"It worked great, for a few weeks. Now it just does whatever it wants to do. A piece of junk.

The bell is so low you cannot hear it, and the vibration feature is so weak, you cannot feel it unless you're holding it in your palm. I'll probably try a timer from another manufacturer. I assume that Everlast has different lines of products for people that are in the business of boxing, because what they sell to average consumers is of poor quality, including their corny DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, Easy to use & Loud Enough","review":"I don't know what all the negative reviews are about. I really like this timer. It is so simple to use that I didn't bother reading the instructions on the back of the package. Very straight forward and the sound is loud enough for where I train (outside). And I really like the sound it makes. I have never cared for the shrill sounds that most of them make. Mine works just great, and other than changing the batteries now and then I have never had to do anything to it.

This seemed perfect; although the band was too small for my arm, I could clip it to my shorts. So, I started it up and started punching the bag. After getting tired and not hearing the bell, I wondered what was going on. It had stopped at 1:51. Figuring I must have bumped the button, I tried it again and again it stopped at 1:51. Weirded out, I set it on the ground and started it, and it went past it once and stopped randomly at another point.

It works just fine for my purposes.The timer is simple but does what it's supposed to - time rounds. It hasn't broken even after being dropped a coupled of times. And I haven't had to change the batteries ever.This timer is a big help in my personal bag-training workout because without it I wouldn't know when a round ends. It's probably not loud enough for doing more than personal bag work, but it works great for that.The reason it only gets 4 stars is that due to its small size it's hard to hit the on/off button while wearing gloves, so pausing can be difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad Engineering","review":"As soon as I received my Timer and began checking it out, I realized right away just how poorly this thing was made. The \\"Rest\\" feature, the setting to determine how long you have to rest between rounds, has two options, 30 or 60 seconds. Mine only allows 60 seconds, regardless of which position the setting is actually on.I truly expected much better from Everlast. I've been kickboxing for years and I have many of their products with nothing bad to say about anything else they've put their name on.For someone who does most of his workouts at home on my own heavy and speed bags & jump rope, etc, this timer is all I thought I would need.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"The thing never worked, right out of the package.

I'm beginning a domestic dog tracking project, and needed info on how canine structure affects movement and gaits. I'm pleased with my purchase.

A fascinating premise, it follows the lives of a father and mother and their three teenage children who have been completely sheltered from the outside world. The children, who act like emotionless clones, have been taught all types of weird things (like cats are evil monsters waiting outside their gates to kill them and rip them to shreds) and for reasons not explained, taught the wrong meanings of words. The interest pretty much ends there as the director delves into bizarre sequences made to shock the viewer. Animal cruelty, incest, violence and physical and mental abuse are just a few of the unpleasant aspects thrown at the viewer. If anything positive can be garnered here, it does hold your interest with incredibility and curiosity and the anticipation of what psycho event is going to take place next. Offbeat but not in a good way."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor's New Film","review":"Foreign film afficianados seem to make up the potential viewing audience for this Greek train wreck. A prize winner at the Cannes Film Festival, DOGTOOTH is a slow, meandering portrait of family madness and disillusion. I suppose the director is playing out a familial nightmare as a parallel to fascism and societal control but honestly, that's really stretching the point. DOGTOOTH makes its intentions clear within the first 20 minutes and keeps hammering the same issues over and over again with painful obviousness. I saw the film during its second week in Los Angeles where it had been reduced to single weekend showings on Saturday and Sunday. I sat in an audience of 12 people, all of whom were silent throughout. The hipster contingent couldn't muster a single hand clap or boo, preferring to silently file out and cancel that upcoming excoursion to the Greek Isles. My advice: catch the DVD if you're somewhat interested and ponder asto WHY this thing won any notice whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive to cat lovers","review":"A perfectly good cat was killed for this movie.

The \\"plot\\" (what plot?) seems like a bad idea to start with, and frankly I had no idea what the film was about until I read the *official* review (sure enough, it wasn't about much, basically). The movie should come with an instructions manual, there is a lot of nonsense thrown around in every sentence, until you realize (too late) that most \\"concepts\\" had been somehow defined in the beginning of the movie, and some words have other meanings to the characters, but even so, it is very tiring to watch, and \\"translating\\" the dialogue doesn't make it more fun. Watching the movie is like watching a bunch of disinterested idiots throwing meaningless words at each other in monotonous voices, they don't look human enough to warrant attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"With some further intelligent effort by the director, this could have been a five star film","review":"One of those European arthouse films that has a very interesting idea. I did not find the film boring. However, the director falls in love with the idea a little bit too much. The idea is good but does not carry through the whole film in its current state. Had the director not been totally in love with the idea he would have pushed the screenplay further. Then he would have ended up with at least a four star film.I give the film two stars, because of the interesting idea.

So lets all collectively get out of the trunk and go see more worthwhile faire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sado-masochistic garbage","review":"I am a fan of dark comedies, and usually the darker, the better. Unfortunately, this is neither comedic, nor entertaining. There are some interesting concepts explored, but the entire film is an exercize in the depths of human behavior, both in term of controling others and being controled to the point of losing all self-actualizing potential.I stopped watching it when the teenage boy savagely murders a cat, which the family takes to be a dangerous enemy.The filming was like some poor farmer's homage to Bergman, but it was poorly done. The obtuseness and objectification of the characters gave them no depth. It is a flat, worthless piece of inane garbage, and in no way stimulating to the mind.I was worse than disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Shirt!","review":"Nice shirt.

They asked me to listen to their samples off the CD Baby website. Immediately, their music reminded me of the songbook of Bob James. The comparisons are clear on the track, \\"Jazmine\\" as it sounds much like his \\"Touchdown\\" CD. There are also fusion jazz inspirations from Herbie Hancock on the track titled appropriately, \\"Mr. Herbie\\". The production value is smooth and the arrangements are solid.

This album is most definatly NOT metal of any sort. I have heard comparisons to Iced Earth and Blind Guardian and have no idea what these people are talking about. The first track, \\"Destiny\\" is decent, but from there everything is downhill. This music reminds me of a bad Journey or Kansas, not power metal like Iced Earth. The \\"hard\\" songs sound like cheap 80's hair band riffs with sub-par soft rock lyrics. The ballads are poorly written with no lyrical quality. In short, avoid this album unless you are a hardcore fan of soft rock like Journey, Kansas or Styx. They sound nothing like any metal I have heard, and if you are looking for power metal get Iced Earth's \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" or \\"The Dark Saga\\", not Stratovarius' \\"Destiny\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael J.

Can't vouch for it's sturdiness or how long it'll last under heavy use though.Fit left something to be desired and that's why I knocked it down to 3 stars.

Fortunately it didn't affect the stability unit, but now I have an ugly gap with a screw showing. :(Also, the stickers were a pain to remove. They left little sticky spots all over the item.

Unfortunately, it is just plain cheaply made. I received the item without the hardware, the seller and manufacturer responded quickly, but I had to wait an additional week before I could put it together. Once I got the hardware, the screws and hanger bolts didn't work well together. So much so that one of the hanger bolts got stuck and started turning with the screw. In addition, there were numerous cracks and the stain on the product was very uneven. Light in some places and dark, not subtle changes, but large changes in color. I don't know if it would hold my quilt or not as I never got the chance to finish putting it together without breaking it. But I suspect it would not have held my quilt, perhaps a light blanket but not a heavy quilt."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Piece of Furniture I've Ever Had","review":"Don't buy this unless you have a dremel, wood glue, and a lot of free time! The pieces are supposed to slide together, but were so poorly cut that half of them couldn't even be fit into the proper slots. The other half were often too small. The slots are also cut so that the wood is extremely thin in the places where it will need to bear weight, which means if you try to push the pieces that are a bit to big in, you'll crack them very easily. There's no way it would be able to hold anything over a few pounds once assembled.Because this was a gift and I really did like the look of the piece, I used a small dremel bit to sand down some of the pieces so they would actually fit together. I then filled the numerous large cracks left by the pieces that were too small with a LOT of wood glue, and glued the larger pieces in place as well. It now seems to be fairly sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"pieces missing or wrong parts","review":"I chose this product as a Christmas present for my oldest daughter, when it arrived it was in a small box.When she opened it Christmas day to put it together the screws were the wrong ones, the parts did not fit together at all and a piece was broken on it. When I contacted the company all they wanted to do was send correct screws. She can't do anything with broken pieces that don't fit together. I am still waiting for an answer on if they are taking the old one back and sending a new one with correct pieces that match, that was a week and a half ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise!","review":"Bought this CD due to presence of Jeff Lynne on the track, \\"Blue Beyond the Grey\\", and while that song is a highlight, the title track and \\"For Good\\" are every bit as strong. Although there are a few up tempo tracks on the CD, the disc is better appreciated in a more reflective mood. Overall, a tremendous effort that, unfortunately, is destined to remain undiscovered in the US, except for a few Jeff Lynne fans, \\"Still Crazy\\" fans or people willing to take a chance on a thoughtful singer/songrwriters underappreciated effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Organizer For A Writer","review":"I have a variety of products from Anne Taintor.

Being a bisexual many who is also a youth worker, I grab anything that shows this sort of promise. I was not disappointed with Rainbow Boys. Sanchez has woven a believable, unflinchingly honest tale of three very different high school boys who discover just how similar they really are. It was wonderful to read a story that was sexuality positive while leaving sex to the imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"rainbow boys got rained all over","review":"picked up the book because of the photographer who did the cover and ended up reading it.i don't regret it but i don't recommend it either. mr. sanchez's first novel ( written 12 years ago )treated the subject like an abc family after school special to be watched by junior high schoolers in the1980's.times have changed so much that the book can not sustain the reality of the facts and the mental level ofnowadays teens' issues.mr.sanchez really generalized, stereotyped and [ i am sure ] fantasized his writing through this book somuch that his prose just collapsed. his book was so expected and contrived that it left me empty thinking.maybe mr. sanchez's , who i believe wrote the Rainbow Boys' Nelson's flaming character based on himself,newest books are better written and updated to any level of any matter the man decided to put histhoughts to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Inspring","review":"Alex Sanchez truly knows how to write a book about the struggles of gays in todays social world and offers a heart felt story about coming out, finding love, and struggling with the possibilities of STD's when having an affair with another person."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Mentioned Coming-Out Gay Novel","review":"Even after years since reading Rainbow Boys, it is difficult to avoid recommending this book when one is asked to recommend a good gay novel on teenagers facing the issue of coming out and coming of age. Until now I am still curious to see how Jason and Kyle would look like, if they were ever going to make it to a play or a tv movie. Among all the gay themed book on a low profile gay meeting a closet-case jock, this book stands out as one of the most popular ones. One day soon, I shall find myself some time to read again this delightful book. Only wish that there is no Nelson in the series - the irritating sore-spot-in-the-book that just fills in the gaps before we get back to reading on Jason and Kyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast read, interesting story - your kids should read this!","review":"Very engaging book, fast read, maybe a half day - good for a beach afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching story - a little heavy on teen self-help","review":"You will enjoy this book. I read it in one delightful sitting on a rainy evening. The characters came to life, aroused me at times, made me almost cry a couple times as I thought of some of my own really awful experiences coming out in high school, but brought me right back to the triumphs of surviving high school and those experiences.This reviewer only gives the book 4 stars because the author tries SO hard at times to make the book self-help for teens when it could have just been an absolutely wonderful on its own. Do not let this deter you from reading it or recommending it to any teenager - it is great and informative, and the last few pages offer resources for teens. Maybe I should've just given it 5 stars and let it go, but the self-help angle takes away from the integrity and flow of the story from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written - Believable!","review":"In my quest to read and make available in local schools the literature of diversity I purchased and read this book. Being a middle school teacher I read get to read a lot of adolescent literature and this is notable, not only for it's realistic treatment of the topic - love between teenage boys - but also quality of prose. Never trite and it doesn't attempt too hard to use the lingo of the generation - it reads real. The three primary characters are representative of kids i work with daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book EVER!!!!!!","review":"I think the book was the bomb. The book was the bomb because of the of the way the book is put out. I am gay so really liked the book. The book is really like me and my friends. Jason, Nelson, and Kyle. All of the boys play a good part in the book. When I read the book I think that this is really going on witch it is that is why I like it. I thats all thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For GLBTs and their Allies","review":"This book caught my eye at my local library. I love reading books about GLBTs and am a huge gay rights activist. Each chapter rotates about the three guys. Nelson, the activist who is out to everyone; Kyle, a genius who is only out to Nelson; and Jason, the closeted jock. The book deals with coming out, alcoholism, internet predators, HIV, and much more. Also, if you enjoyed this book check out the sequels Rainbow High and Rainbow Road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endearing Characters, Well-Styled Writing","review":"A very well-written and engaging book. Each of the three teenage boy protagonists are diverse, well-developed and most of all, believable. Sanchez is careful not to carry any stereotypes to extremes which helps to endear each of the boys to the reader. The plotline is interesting and moves quickly.A drawback is the fact that Sanchez tried to work in every major issue facing gay teens today, which, to some degree, showed he had an agenda when writing the text. Nonetheless, a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll feel like \\"coming out\\" again and again...","review":"I extremely enjoyed this brilliant work. Being only fourteen, I could relate to all of the things the characters were going through. This book examines the struggles of the modern gay teen, the pressures from parents they experience, and the wonderful feelings of knowing that they're not alone in this world. I highly suggest this book to anyone regardless of their age, and to pick up a copy of the second book, \\"Rainbow High\\" as well. Alex Sanchez truly deserves to be named the modern Shakespeare!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I was more than peasantly surprised with this read. A good light read with a little more bite and good character development and understanding. Definitely worth a few hours of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stand-out in the Genre","review":"I first heard about this novel, after reading the novel \\"boy meets boy.\\" While \\"Boy Meets Boy\\" will probably be my favorite book in the genre, \\"Rainbow Boys\\" will definatly a close second.The Book centers around 3 boys who are seniors in their local high school and happen to be gay. Nelson and Kyle have been best friends for years. Nelson has a crush on Kyle, but Kyle has his eye on Jason the star athlet in school. And one day when Jason shows up at a local Gay Teen Support group (regularly attending by Kyle and Nelson) none of them really know how much their lives are really going to change.This novel is a realistic view on being gay in highschool and the problems they face: rejection, bashing, first loves, crushes, HIV scars, and age discrimination.For a debut novel, this book is really good. My only complaint in that the character of Nelson really should have taken a backseat to teh storyline between the two other boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"For what it is, it's not bad at all.","review":"As a coming of age story written for a young readership, \\"Rainbow Boys\\" achieved everything it tried to do. It was definitely educational in a way that managed to avoid too much preachiness, and it didn't really shortchange any of the issues it addressed. (The danger of contracting HIV, for instance.) For a more mature reader, it was good, but not excellent. The plot was solid, but there were some distractingly cringeworthy moments of dialogue and description. (I winced over 'A trickle of saliva glistened...' during what should have been a very sweet moment. Yuck.) But I do think that the shifting point of view worked well, which surprised me. Definitely worth a read if you're interested in the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainbow Boys","review":"I loved the book. It could really help young boys who are sturggling with their sexuality. The story line keeps you involved and the context of the story is very appropriate. The book is page turner because it moves at a fast pace and the story line is interesting, your always wondering whats going to happen next. Not only is the context of what is going on with the boys helpful to young adults, but also the family dynamics presented in this book can also have many children relating to these boys struggles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing-up and Coming-out","review":"This is an encouraging story of how two boys find themselves and convey their feelings for one another. I read the book in two days only b/c I was too busy working to actually read. I then passed the book on to half of my college's LGBT club. It was a great story super fast read and very enjoyable. He captures a lot of the feelings of struggling queer youth. Yes it's another coming of age story about growing up and coming out but hey sometimes they're fun reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous gay YA book","review":"*Rainbow Boys* is such a good book and a rare one on gay themes. The book focuses on three gay teens: Kyle, Jason and Nelson. Among them, they faced a variety of issues, such as coming out, HIV, romance, homophobia and other related issues. However, Sanchez doesn't stop there. He addresses other issues that other people face as well, such as domestic violence.Between them, a friendship blossoms and they soon learn to lean on each other for support. And support, they all need it in any form. So, Sanchez introduces PFLAG, Gay-Straight Alliance and moral support from friends and loved ones. Little by little, with support, the trio soon bond and face tough problems together. With friends behind them, they soon learn that nothing shall stand in their way.Sanchez is a gifted writer. He uses words so accurately that I was on my own memory trips throughout this book. I'm definitely reading his other books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood and History Collide","review":"Great movie that shows how the Native Americans were treated and is based somewhat on history itself. There was an Indian named Massai, and a Mr. Wettle, along with Seiber. It is not a history movie, but more of a movie based on the degredation of the Native Americans and one Indians war with them and himself. The ending is one of compromise, but in reality, this was never to be for most of the Apaches.Burt Lancaster is at his ever popular, ripped body, and makes you believe that he could do all that the true Native American Massai did do.For some reason this movie has just struck me as one I like to watch when I get tired of everyone else complaining that they have it so hard in life today. Especially some minority groups who did not have it so, or still are, as the Native American."},{"rating":"1","title":"different region","review":"This dvd was not intended for this region and will not play. This movie was meant for another geographical market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rubbish!","review":"This movie is so filled with historical errors that it is nearly impossible to list them all. Granted, Hollywood takes \\"literary license\\" but this is beyond pale. From the beginning scenes of \\"chief\\" Geronimo riding up carrying a peace pipe (Geronimo was never a chief and the Chiricahua Apache never used smoking pipes)to the end scenes of Massai going off to live a peaceful life. In fact, there was a Chiricahua named Massai who did escape from the prison train but but the rest of the movie is pure 100% unadultrated BS. And in the end, the real Massai was tracked down and killed after he broke out of the Mescalero reservation and his body burned to bone and ashes. For a true account read INDEH by Eve Ball. In Chapter 10 Massai's daughter, Alberta Begay, recounts her father's life and death.

I was able to fit it into the trunk of my 07 camry, but it took several attempts, and I'm still not quite sure how to do fit it on the first time now. But it does fold and fit.

As much as he loves Diego, the toy didn't entertain him past 8 button pushes. He's an imaginitive boy and plays pretend, but this did not spark his imagination or creative play. He's gotten way more entertainment from the box it came in (he pretends it's a cage for his little people animal)than the toy itself.This toy has been tossed in the toy chest since it's arrival day and hasn't left since. It's position has slowly moved down to the bottom of the box; I occassionally dig through the toys and move it to the top in hopes that he'll play with it again.

The first cut, \\"A Night in Canaan\\" starts with Ofra singing a capella accompanied by a few wistful notes on the keyboards, which erupts into a powerfully orchestrated chorus at each interval. A true delight to the senses. Each song truly boasts stunning arrangements and instrumentation with Ofra's voice figuring among the most powerful and sweetly sentimental of all the instruments. The last two songs end the album on a rather mellow tone but still leave you wanting more and more.

In parts pure western swing as in the opening number \\"Roly Poly\\" and sometimes downright \\"barroom sleazy\\" enough to make even Tom Waits crack a smile (see track 2 I'll Never Get Out Of This World Alive with a vocal reminiscent of Rodney Crowell circa the \\"Heartworn Highways\\" period)this is a pure gem.As for Nora Jones taking lead vocal on their cover of \\"Elvis's\\" \\"Love Me\\" (as well as a couple of others) its as much shivers down the back time as the 1st time i saw her on Jools Hollands \\"Later\\" doing \\"Cold Cold Heart\\"! The overall feel of this album though puts me in mind to watch \\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou'\\" again and conjures up Alison Krauss. Ok i'll cut this short as i'm listening to it again while i type and track 4's just started,nice....PS They also do an excellent cover of \\"Gram Parsons\\" \\"Streets Of Baltimore\\" and the closer \\"Lou Reed\\" just glows with affectionate humour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they bother?","review":"This must have been fun to record but it feels to me like they were just having a lark w/country music. As a result, it's competently performed, but bland in a sort of Country Lite kind of way. When famous musicians cross genres, it's more rewarding when they at least bring us something new, or dive in w/both feet and give us the texture of the new genre--I was looking forward to something more. Instead, it's like hearing a good country cover band in a Las Vegas lounge (nothing wrong w/that, but at least in Vegas the music is free).There are many better country or folk or bluegrass albums on the market right now that are more rewarding than this. Start with, say, \\"You Don't Know Me - Songs of Cindy Walker,\\" just released by Willie Nelson, a better example of how to do a tribute album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chilley Willies!","review":"This CD was recommended with Norah Jones' new CD by Amazon so I took the advice and purchased it!

I suppose she wants a grammy for this too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norah should stick with her roots","review":"I mistakingly bought this album thinking it was going to be more of the piano playing, sultry Norah Jones that we all grew to love. I was wrong. I know Norah jones loves country music and better yet loves to sing it. But she should stick to her roots. I dislike country music even with Norah singing it, except the country she does on her albums with her handsome band. And now she is going to be putting out another Little Willies album. You could be sure I won't be buying it.Just when I was waiting for another Norah Jones album to come out. What a dissappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album but Where are the bonus tracks?","review":"On iTunes this album comes with two excellent bonus tracks!

There's Nora doing a few cuts as lead and sounding great as usual. The other cuts on the CD are great country tunes, some funny, some sad with a tight band keeping it interesting. Definately worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Little Willies is one of my favorite CDs of 2006","review":"I really enjoyed listening to this self titled CD from The Little Willies. I love Norah's easy listening vocals on most of these tracks. Roll On, Love Me and Night Life are my favorites These tracks really showcase Norah's talent as a piano player and singer. Best of All Possible Worlds is an enjoyable song to tap your feet too. Other standout tracks on this album are Roly Poly and Gotta Get Drunk and Lou Reed. These tracks sound good, and they are very funny. Easy as Rain and No Place To Fall are very sweet heartfelt tracks. Streets of Baltimore is a great story song about a couple moving to a new city trying to start a new life. I enjoyed Richard Jullian's vocals on the track very much. Tennesee Stud is the track that best features all the musicians in the band. They play and compliment each other so well on this song. The Little Willies is one of my favorite CDs of 2006."},{"rating":"2","title":"friendly little cd","review":"I heard several tracks of this cd in a local store and I was immediately drawn to it. The musicality is quirky and lively. Overall, the feeling is like an initmate recording; just the musicians and a couple of odd friends, surrounded by an evening's smattering of empty beer bottles. The songs are not the typical over worked stuff you hear on the radio. It's very down home. In fact the lack of \\"studio polish\\" makes it much more interesting and homey. It's probably not for everyone, but I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"get a grip!","review":"I listened to this as I was driving to Modesto and it made the trip as good as it could be. I fear some of the reviewers here were expecting the old 'I'm so lonesome I could cry' sort of reading of these songs. Instead you get people having fun playing some songs they know, while (generally) respecting the source material. The feel I got is of a very congenial party in somebody's living room -- not album of the year, but a damn nice visit with Norah and some very talented friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like county/swing/honkytonk/bluesy/alternative...","review":"....than you will probably like this one.

I am a Norah Jones fan, and heard about this band because of her, so thought I'd give it a try. I have not been disappointed. Norah Jones takes a step away from her solo career just long enough to create some incredibly fun bluegrass/country classic music. I am definitely not a country music fan, but this has a different sound that I can get on board for. Personally, I prefer their second album, \\"For the Good Times,\\" but considering the price tag is below $10 for the mp3 version of this album it is definitely worth a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"See review for Little Willies, For the Good TImes","review":"See review for Little Willies, For the Good Times.

None of the covers are as good as the originals. In particularly, the Willies are a poor second to the beauty of Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris on \\"Streets of Baltimore\\". But for a generation unfamiliar with such classics as \\"Tennessee Stud\\" or \\"Gotta get Drunk\\", well, it's a nice introduction to the classics.Buy it... but get the originals, especially Gram Parsons, a truly under appreciated genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A big fan of Norah and country music I was excited by the potential of this album but it is a waste of time.

You'd think that this would be great. Think again. This is just another lame contemporary group soaking up the fame of Jones and using songs like Gotta Get Drunk as bait for fans of classic country. I can imagine this group playing at the \\"Friends\\" coffee shop. Good for the starbucks' crowd, bad for anyone who actually wants something whole and real to listen to. I compare this to elevator music: safe, pleasant, and boring.The worst part is that they cover several old country songs, famous for being the lonesome soul of those who sang them. Now they are processed, upbeat, weak and completly without emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAITH & LIFE","review":"THIS STORY WAS DIFFERENT THAN I HAD EXPECTED, BUT IT SHOWS HOW EACH CHARACTER DEVELOPS HIS OR HER PART & HOW THE CONSPIRACY OF MURDER WAS SOLVED AND THE VILLIAN WAS BROUGHT TO JUSTICE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising film ruined by Bettany's dead energy","review":"I enjoyed the book by Barry Unsworth titled, \\"Morality Play.\\" Although slight, it has a lot of atmosphere, fine writing and period detail. The main problem with the movie is in the casting. Willem Dafore is fine as the Player's leader, even though I would have preferred a British actor in the role. The rest of the cast add nothing to their underwritten parts. A charismatic lead might have compensated, but Paul Bettany is so utterly colorless that he drags the movie down until it is impossible for it to recover.

It's Scooby Doo meets CSI in the FOURTEENTH century! A traveling band of actors decides to investigate a murder???

The production design and costumes were well done - outside of that, give me a break. No attempt was made to make the dialogue sound even remotely accurate for the times, and the pacing was tediously slow. Not a good flick overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"O.K> I will admit that the film was slow to start. But the beginning was not boring just oddly paced with some Luc Bessonesque (The Messenger) flashbacks and a soundtrack that was almost nonexistant. However, brilliant and tortured Paul Bettany rivaled his \\"Beautiful Mind\\" performance, Willem Dafoe was incredible even if I couldnt place his accent and Vincent Cassel put forth his creepiest performance since \\"The Brotherhood of th Wolf\\" The Riveting perrormances and engaging plot saved this gem in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reckoning, The Crucible","review":"I am not a movie critic and I do not like many movies that come out of the Hollywood, but I must say that The Reckoning is really an outstanding movie! It describes the life of the common people in the medieval England. Morality and Justice is the bottom line in it.The actors, the director and other staff had done the great job. However, The Reckoning is not the movie for everyone because the plot is rather complicated and it is performed more like a play than the movie. But if you like history and a good dramatic movie - The Reckoning is for you!For those who would like to see similar movies I would recommend to see the Luther (the story of a spiritual leader, German monk Martin Luther who translated the Holy Bible into the German language)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"This is an engaging film, beautifully told with a powerful story. Although it is set in the dreary Middle Ages, the cinematography and lighting creates a crisp and almost magical atmosphere. Every aspect of this film works -- good writing, good acting.

I will remember this film for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine 35mm lens for the Contax G series","review":"The only reason why I am not awarding this fine optic five stars, since it is out-performed wide open at f2 by the Leica M 35mm f2 Aspheric Summicron, with regards to contrast and resolution. However, when this lens is stopped down to f4 or f5.6, it is just as capable a performer as its more expensive competition. Optically speaking, this lens resembles most closely the Canadian and late German versions of the 35mm f2 Summicron, so I would not hesitate using it wide open at f2 if I had to. Indeed, I have seen a Popular Photography test report of this lens that shows it is still a fine performer at f2, improving at f2.8, and especially, f4. When I want to bring one lens with my Contax G2, then the 35mm f2.0 Planar usually is my first choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transparent and disappointing","review":"As a long-time reader of this series, I was disappointed with this latest effort. The Romanov connection seemed pretty predictable. I didn't understand why their first question wasn't 'How did an unassuming pastry chef amass an estate of over 2 million dollars?' And without the pre-trial investigation we usually get from Nina and Paul, all of our encounters with the trial witnesses were pretty superficial. While I like that Nina is a smart, independent, strong woman, it disappoints me that she's too rigid to allow an equally smart, independent, strong male in her life. I haven't seen much character growth for Nina during the life of this series, and I really didn't need to see her reject Paul one more time. Get those 2 together, for crying out loud, or let it go. Personally, I think the O'Shaughnessy's should consider dropping Nina and giving Paul his own series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!!","review":"I loved the Nina O'Reilly series but, was disappointed with this book. Nina comes across as so weak and as a doormat. Allowing Paul to force her into wearing his ring while she decides on his proposal and then not calling him on humiliating her set her up as a doormat. She wears her ring to court to question his ex-lover and then finds out from a mutual friend, Ginger, that he slept with his ex but, she doesn't confront him, pretending that nothing has happened while continuing to wear his ring. It amazed me that two women wrote this book. Who would put up with that? The fact that she later goes dancing with him and allows him his \\"we're adults and I thought you'd understand\\" line floored me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stay in Nevada, Nina","review":"Nina Reilly books are always good, this is no exception, but I like them when she is at \\"home\\" in Nevada.

Nina Reilly has relocated to the Monterey Peninsula and joined a large law firm. Her first client appears guilty of graverobbing and murder. Nina does her usual best to defend him while working with the firm's top, and aging, lawyer during the trial.It does take patience to go through the first half, but is necessary in order to gather the important information in the case before we're lead to deeper levels including family relationships and the Russian Romanov dynasty. Even so, this isn't really \\"deep reading\\", but is vastly entertaining while somewhat instructional. There's enough going on in Nina's private life and her realationship with Paul Waggener to satisfy those wanting a eomantic subplot without overly annoying those engrossed in the mystery puzzle presented. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mess","review":"This story takes a long time to get to the point with a sputtering payoff. I found it difficult to be sympathetic to any of these characters because they are all so pathetic. An admitted grave robber is not sympathetic. Nina can't decide between her job, sex life of son. Willing to break any laws to get her client off. Really kind of sleazy look into the mind of defense attorneys.

With the STR system you can get the location narrowed down to a one square mile area.This lack of STRs was surprising to me because I recently purchased a Wisconsin Atlas by Delorme that had STRs in it & it was very useful.This was a major mistake/oversight on the part of Delorme & I am returning my copy to the map store tommorrow.

The text has obviously been cheaply scanned into the computer and converted into an ebook.. and they didn't even scan it from a clean copy of the book! There are little distracting marks all over the pages! When highlighting, the curser often skips lines because the lines aren't quite straight. The spacing between the lines is also highly inconsistent, with often two lines smushed together and then the next two an inch apart.And it costs $9.99!

Here's one: He spoke of the \\"language of music\\", but there is a lower-level discussion to be had; *Why* do we associate low, deep sounds with power, foreboding and fear? *Why* do high, piercing sounds denote energy, movement and alarm?

But I thought Pinker wrote persuasively, coherently and best of all lucidly. His metaphors were apt and useful, and his use of language great. I found the book to be much better than The Language Instinct because of the ease of reading - true, it might be one-sided, in that Pinker was putting forward his best argument for the evolutionary model, but that is to be expected in a book (rather than a peer-reviewed paper).

He is arrogant enough to declare himself an authority; but I remember the real authority Leo Buscaglia saying \\"I met many PhD's.

This is the first book that makes these advances accessible, this is accomplished with unusual agility and humor.It is just a shame that the evolutionary underpinnings of the book seem to attract wacky criticism. My only criticism of the book is that Steven Pinker spends too much time trying to assuage the anticipated attackers, instead of concentrating on the fascinating evidence at hand.This book will become a classic!

You might be annoyed if you start to feel that he's trying to juggle too many conceptual balls at once. The danger is that his charm may make you overlook the vacuousness of his evolutionary pronouncements. Does he really think each of the many \\"algorithms\\" he says are needed for our intelligence and consciousness fortituously arrived miraculously as needed? Doesn't he understand the biological and molecular complexity required for even the \\"simplest\\" algorithms to be programmed into matter? And the difficulties involved not only in the absence of these programs, but in the many failed attempts that must have preceded? His \\"just-so\\" evolutionary scenarios and \\"explanations\\", vague as can be, are no substitute for science, and are totally useless.Perhaps he will reconsider after reading Behe's \\"Darwin's Black Box\\" ... but that would take a more open mind. One can only hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on!","review":"The reason big brains are presumably a good evolutionary bet is that they really do provide genuine flexibility in dealing with a changing world (changing in large part due to our big brains I should add).

The chapter on the 'mind's eye' is difficult to understand and I will return to it many times to grasp some of the many insights it contains. The chapter on 'good ideas' is very useful and informative. This is a book I will return to many times.

Well, not here. The segment about vision is quite interesting, but most of the text focuses on software. I was also disappointed with his style: by often mixing robust models with shallow speculations, I soon couldn't distinguish the two. Maybe the book is more impressive for those who haven't read Richard Dawkins or Robert Wright."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is in error, and not worth the price","review":"It is rare for a book of such ambition to be exposed as mistaken, and in the very moment of its publication, but clearly Terrence Deacon (The Symbolic Species) has a much clearer understanding of how the mind works. I enjoyed Pinker's first book (The Language Instinct), but this time around he bit off much more than he could chew. I believe Deacon has exposed Chomsky, Minsky and Pinker as terribly mistaken people. In particular, Deacon's detailed and comprehensive refutation of Chomsky's LAD seems unanswerable to me -- Deacon points out that there is no way that evolution could have produced any generalized LAD, and Chomsky has always refused to discuss the topic. Throughout this book, Pinker makes fun of people with \\"antiquated ideas,\\" and seems not to realize that his own dumb idea of \\"the brain as a computer\\" is now getting to be about fifty years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"cop-out on consciousness","review":"Pinker's book argues for combining the computational theory of mind with the brain as an evolutionary adaptation. He shows how perception, intelligence, emotions, and culture, can be explained as computational modules evolved by humans to solve problems of hunter-gatherer life. His \\"hothead\\" theory on the origin of emotions was new to me and interesting. However, Pinker cops out by exempting consciousness from his analysis of the mind; he suggests that the human mind will never be able to understand its own consciousness. This makes no sense in terms of his own analysis. It struck me that Pinker's cop-out on consciousness parallels the cop-out of Chomsky on language as an evolutionary adaptation, which Pinker complained about at the beginning of \\"The Language Instinct\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, motivating","review":"An excellent walk through cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. It gives a new perspective on many questions of the culture and of our way of thinking - for a non expert in the area (as I am), but I can imagine that it is for an expert even more interesting.

I believe Matt Ridley wrote something to that effect in his book \\"Genome\\" when referencing Steven Pinker's \\"How the Mind Works\\" and \\"The Language Instinct\\". No doubt that \\"How the Mind Works\\" is a book which describes exactly that, how various parts of the human brain work, but much more interestingly it also delves deep into the evolution of the human species and how natural selection might have shaped how our physical minds and our cognitive skills developed. And, Steven Pinker is indeed a science writer who is able to write about his area of expertise and make it accessible, interesting and even funny at times. Though, I do think some of his pop culture references might easily become a bit dated and a few of them are obscure enough to escape recognition by a fairly broad cross section of readers. In the end, a very informative book and well worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"good cognitive science, very fuzzy biology","review":"How the Mind Works shows what happens when a solid scholar in one field becomes enamored of another. Pinker is a wonderful writer and very effective when explaining language; but his understanding and feel for evolutionary biology are truly shallow, and his resorts to adaptation are usually simplistic that they read like a college term paper. So the book is very much a mixed bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychology finally on the right track","review":"This is a review from a visiting UFO, and we are pleased to find that the science of the mind on your planet has finally understood that your species mind has evolved!

I think Eastern people and Western people have a lot they can learn from each other, and in the shrinking world of tomorrow, we'll have no choice but to coexist harmoniously. Books like Mura's only sow seeds of resentment and racism. A search for identity is one thing, but this guy has a few axes to grind.Plus, he isn't a very articulate writer.

Re-read The Icewind Dale trilogy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I dont understand all the excitment over this series and this author. Most of the story is very contrived. So many stupid things happen ( A female scoops up a massive barbarian under her arm???)that it is hard to take anything written in a serioues way. There is a dwarf named DAGNABBIT? A sword named Twinkle? Another named Icingdeath? Does it drown you in icing?The plot has holes you can drive a truck through and the writing is 4th grade level.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring piece Salvatore ever created","review":"Starting with the Dark Elf Trilogy this drow's adventures really kept me good company for years. My all time favorite work of the author is the Dark Elf Trilogy and I read all the other adventures of Drizzt. Thousand Orc series however , have been sending alarm signals that Drizzt and Co. have finally come to an end. What was most interesting about Drizzt in the beginning was his inner reflection and diary-like musings. Unfortunately it grew old and boring and he became a whining self rightous character. The plot is more like a cheap soap opera: There is no plot at all. You can tell that many pages and dialogues and Drizzt's self reflection moments are just there to fill the pages.It is time for bob Salvatore to pull the plug on this guy and create something else. This book is written mainly due to financial concerns of the author.I agree with the previous posters recommendations. Storyline and characters need to mature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember when Salvatore Used to be Good?","review":"RA Salvatore used to have the most intriguing novels out there.

The cover on all three books are absolutely amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent middle adventure for this series...","review":"After waiting with much anticipation for this book, I was not disappointed. Salvatore creates an intriguing deviation and his unique blend of battle action and saga will have you turning page after page. Salvatore's writing style can, at times, be a cold slap in the face and maybe even frustrating for some readers. But over all this trilogy is definatly positioning itself as his best work yet. Highly entertaining and recommended. Bring on \\"The Two Swords\\" !!!Justice Delivered"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sequel to 1000 Orcs","review":"This isn't a simple hack and slash book, this is Drizzt, torn by guilt and separation from friends he thinks may not even be alive, coming to philosophical grips with the idea he may be alone. He returns to being the Hunter, as he was in the excellent dark elf trilogy (Exile, Sojourn, Homeland). Obould also emerges as a powerful nemesis of the remaining group of friends. Frankly I love the battle scenes and the resurgence of the Hunter. 1000 Orcs was great, because all the crew was together for the first time in many books, but this book was better. I can't wait for #3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only read if your dead set on reading the whole trilogy","review":"Ever read a book that you thought was interesting enough to warrant reading the sequel? Then you read the sequel and it's one of the most pointless books you've ever read? That more or less is what The Lone Drow is like. Thousand Orcs was good enough to warrant me to read the sequel. But for some reason I just did not like this book at all. For some reason I just didn't find the writing style all that captivating, and the characters were just sort of dull to me. There are exceptions to this, I like the characters of Obould and Drizzt (when he wasn't whining that is). Overall the book isn't all that enjoyable, only read it if your intent on reading the whole trilogy. Otherwise if you want to read a Salvatore book I recommend Promise of the Witch King or the vastly superior book (in this trilogy anyway) The Two Swords."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Salvatore has some great works but this is definitely his worst book ever. The whole trilogy is pointless, it is just a series of repetitive boring battles in which Drizzt & friends will clearly not die.

It goes NOWHERE. It means NOTHING."},{"rating":"2","title":"An expertly crafted action/adventure fantasy tale","review":"Book One of R.A. Salvatore's \\"The Hunter's Blade\\" trilogy, The Lone Drow is the story of Drizzi Do'Urden who is the bane of the orc hordes still ravaging the North. Cut off, alone, convinced that everything he ever valued has been destroyed and all that's left is to kill until there are no enemies left, the reader is carried along on an expertly crafted action/adventure fantasy tale that is replete with memorable characters, dire situations, vividly drawn backgrounds, and horrific battles. But the novice reader should be forewarned! Reading The Lone Drow will send you to seek out all of R. A. Salvatore's earlier books -- and leave you looking urgently toward the next installment of this thrilling fantasy series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"I'm really surprised to see all the positive reviews for this book. I am a big fan of the Drizzt series but this one is disappointing. What little bit of story advancement was covered could have filled a comic book. Everything else was all filler. It was one confrontation description after another. Never getting to the story telling. Salvatore must have signed a three book contract and needed to fill some pages. The constant woe-is-me musings of Drizzt grew old quickly. I understand he is upset about the apparent death of his friends, but page after page every other chapter is cheap writing. The book is slow and a far cry from what is expected from a usually fine author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm","review":"When this new trilogy first debuted I was quite excited and made sure to get a hot little copy of The Thousand Orcs into my hands the day it was released. I admit, it wasn't Salvatore's best but it was an entertaining read and interesting enough to motivate me to continue reading the series. The Lone Drow however is nothing more then a hack and slash book and a challenge to see how many readers can endure a 300-page description of a fight sequence. Rather then taking any time to truly do any justice to the characters he's created, Salvatore instead spends most of the time trying to mangle one long action sequence into an actual plot. This book is definently not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"370 pages of filler","review":"I've been a fan of Salvatore for years now. The Ice, wind and Dale Trilogy and The Dark Elf Trilogy (Which is my all time favorite work by Salvatore) are great. His new Forgotten Realm trilogy should be forgotten it's self. Especially the Lone Drow. There's is no plot at all. Just one Battle scene after another. Its grow tiresome and absurd very quickly. No matter how many enemies Drizzt or his buddies fight they wont die or get hurt. There is no character development at all. The dialog between characters so childish sounding. I know Salvatore never has had deep plot-lines for his books but this book takes the cake for being poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Gem for Salvatore","review":"Reminiscent of Salvatore's Legacy of the Drow, The Lone Drow centers on the dwarves' desperate fight against orcs, frost giants, and now trolls. Characters from previous books, notably Pikel Bouldershoulder and Thibbledorf Pwent, shine in this novel. New characters like Shoudra, Nanfoodle, Tarathiel, and Innovindil also make an impact. The Companions of the Hall grow as well. Regis takes up the responsibility of being Steward of Mithral Hall, and does so brilliantly. Drizzt begins to overcome his sorrow over the Ellifain incident. At some points, I too felt like bursting into tears, particularly at what happens to Pikel, Shoudra, and Tarathiel. Other moments, particularly at the ending, I wanted to stand up and cheer. Now if only Salvatore will get to work and write The Two Swords, I'm dying to know what will happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lone Drow","review":"This book bring back the Hunter side of Drizit do'urden.

This book is only recommended for 14 year old fanboys who judge a book's quality by the numbers of magic items carried by the heroes. By itself it is entertaining, but for the well read reader you'd have to wonder why you spent the time reading this when there are so many better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lone Drow","review":"I have not received it yet.

Salvatore's work in this series seems to be losing a bit of steam, but it is a fine read and a good product of the genre.The story is not too complicated, but there are highs and lows. Reading the other reviews will likely reveal too much about the story and take away from your enjoyment of the story.

Kody's voice was the highlight of the band and Weasel has brought the Weasel-esque guitar sound to the forefront and the vocals to the background. This RUINED the original unique sound that made the Lillingtons so great. This CD is average at best.

The flow of the songs from one track to another is incredible.Unlike The Wall, the tempo of this CD is much more low-key, making it a great CD to relax while listening to it.

Okay, it's not easy listening but that is its main appeal. It's got stunning lyrics (What else can you expect from Waters) and the music fits perfectly. There is very little of the clasic Floyd sound but another virtue of this band is their ability to evolute.I am deeply moved by all the songs, being my faves the opening cut, Your Possible Pasts, One of The Few, The Gunner's Dream, The Fletcher Memorial Home, the title track and Two Suns In The Sunset, an incredible song. Not Now John is the fast-paced track on the cd, and it's fantastic, with Gilmour's solo, one of his best.The Final Cut is the kind of album Dave would never be able to do, and it's a million times better than Momentary Lapse of Reason. After Roger left, the band lost a lot.5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd fanatic from Fla","review":"On almost every Pink FLoyd poll I have seen, this album takes in the most votes for being the worst album Pink Floyd ever produced. Don't believe them! This album packs a powerful punch, displaying Rogers' clear antipathy towards war, probably stemming from the his father's death due to war. The music on the album ranges from the slow, teary eyed \\"The Gunner's Dream\\" to fast the fast paced \\"Not Now John\\". It takes a serious subject and turns it into something you can put in your stereo and jam out to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"I have to admit that I was prepared not to like The Final Cut -- particularly after the way it was downplayed by the critics and the record company (\\"every one else is just green?\\"). But after giving it several listens, the Lp grows on you. Dave provides a little \\"musical\\" backdrop which gives this work a little musical quality. Roger mopes and whines but mostly jabs \\"Maggie\\" and the warmongers right where it hurts most. And, Not Now John is a rockin classic -- although the only true rocker on the Lp. Get it and don't let the downbeat drag you down like a stone. It's a helluva lot better than Roger solo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on what type of fan you are....","review":"If you listen to Pink Floyd for Roger Waters' cynical lyrical commentary, then this album is for you. It features some of his highest poetry showcasing the futility of war and frustrations of society's more disgruntled members. However if you are more interested in playing air guitar to Have a Cigar, than you likely find this album to be a complete drag. Musically, it's rather bland and pasted together with none of the intricate radiance heard best on Wish You Were Here, probably due to the details of Waters' expulsion Wright and intolerance of influence from Gilmour or Mason on this work. I also agree that this was the first Waters solo album in everything but name. This album is not, in my opinion, Pink Floyd but a side factor of the band's existance and thus not as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Masterpiece","review":"There could be no more perfect way for Pink Floyd to retire. Roger and the boys truly saved their very best for last. \\"The Final Cut\\" was given five stars by Rolling Stone magazine. That shocked me, because RS does not generally give five stars.

You will indubitably find drama here, blooming like a lotus flower, spreading like a pool of blood, erupting over the hills like Napoleons army.The fact that this album is poorly rated is because ignorant people listen to it. It stands apart from Pink Floyds other works, and to me, is much better than Pink Floyds other works. It is a honed Wall, a sharpened Dark Side of the Moon, a chapel, an alter to mankind itself and what we have to lose.Do not listen to this album and compare it to any Pink Floyd you have ever listened to before, you will be doing both the band and yourself a gargantuan injustice.Doug"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Maybe the human race is run?\\"","review":"The first time you hear this your like what?

This album is not even comparable to The Dark Side Of The Moon. The lyrical content is not so abstract. To many this album speaks more truth than any book or publication.This magnificent album should not even be compared to other Pink Floyd albums.

The band isn't even existing at this point - Roger kicked out Rick Wright after The Wall, and Roger, David and Nick recorded this album in separate studios. Thats not a band, its a charade. And there are WAAAAYYYY too many orchestral parts, and the saxophones don't do it justice either. Its evident that Roger was an ego maniac and wanted the Pink Floyd name to himself. The lyrics are very self-indulgent and the music itself is a lot like stuff that was recorded for The Wall, but not used. Its VERY evident on \\"The Hero's Return\\". If you can't hear it, then your obviously not listening and in complete denial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment","review":"This album has got to be one of the worst Floyd albums out there.

As a Pink Floyd album, it gets a one star rating at best. It isn't really until the last three songs that it even feels vaguely like \\"Pink Floyd\\" (and that's \\"The Wall\\" era Floyd, at that), or that there's much musicality at all in Roger's poetic lament. There was a time that I enjoyed this album, when I appreciated everything Floyd in the '80's. But in retrospect, I think it's an outrage that this was released under the name \\"Pink Floyd,\\" and Gilmour and Mason need to be blamed as well for allowing Waters to take so much control. At least they remedied the situation with two fine Floyd releases sans Waters, and a great Gilmour solo release in 1984."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad album","review":"Warning do not buy this album, only the first song is good.

After I listen to the entire Cd I crushed and threw it inot the garbage. I like Pink Floyd but this album [stinks], if you like bands like The Pansy Division or The Culture club and Richard Wrights solo album Wet Dream , you're going to love this CD but if you like Pink Floyd and any other good music, you'll want to destroy it.

The Wall - Pink Floyds best and a true masterpiece in every sense2. Wish You Were Here - Great, very much like DSOTM, only better3. Dark Side of the Moon - Technically a masterpiece, but The Wall and WYWH have more replay value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but certainly better...","review":"Than alot of stuff out there. This album is unofficially the 3 album of the Wall. It goes alot deeper into Roger Waters talking about the loss of his father and wondering why he died when there are still wars.

I also like \\"the Fletcher Memorial Home\\".If you get a chance, seek out the videos, they definately add to the whole thing.On the Re-master, it's cool they added \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\", but it doesn't seem to fit into the rest of the album musically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't mind the naysayers, this is classic","review":"I'll never understand how so many Floyd fans give such paltry reviews to this album.

Pink Floyd taught me so much more about WW2 on that trip than any of the teachers did. It's an astonishingly heart-felt and sensitive recording.There are plenty of good reviews already posted about the Final Cut - but I just had to add that in my opinion David Gilmour's guitar solos on this record are some of the best he ever recorded with Waters-era Pink Floyd.

This is a Roger Waters album with some small contributions from David Gilmour and Nick Mason. Waters kicked Wright right out of the band for substance abuse. Anyway, this album sounds like a bunch of cold leftovers from the Wall with more elaborate orchestration. The Final Cut is more classically oriented than the wall but there are no killer guitar tracks, though \\"Not now John\\" or whatever it's called is decent. Face it, this is sterilized Pink Floyd and kind of stale as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Best Floyd album, however better than anything post Roger Waters","review":"First off, I side with Roger Waters on the whole Waters/Gilmour issue. Roger Waters continues to sell out where ever he goes and Gilmour doesn't have the guts to go out under his own name. Post Waters Pink Floyd albums were widely reported to be written by members outstide the band. That being said, this album is much more about the lyrics than a collection of 'songs'. It is obvious that Gilmour and Waters hate one another, and Waters simply is doing it his way. I love the lyrics for When the Tigers Broke Free, Southhampton Dock and Final Cut. If you listen to this album several times and let them sink in, you will find yourself loving this album. If you listen once and set aside, you will think it is a piece of garbage. Do yourself a favor and try it. The Final Cut destroys all the post Waters albums. I don't care what Grafton Tanner thinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not now John!","review":"The follow-up to \\"The Wall\\", \\"The Final Cut\\" is, when considered with its predecessor, a musical let-down. It's also without Pink Floyd's keyboardest, Wright, who was kicked out of the band at this time.I've seen the limited video EP that accompanied this album and putting pictures to the music doesn't add to it.I am a Pink Floyd fan (Meddle is my favourite album; so I guess I prefer their earlier stuff)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly disappointed.","review":"I remember that when I bought this album, I thought:\\"Well, maybe it's not as bad as everyone says.\\"How wrong I was.I also bought it because I'm a Pink Floyd fanatic and I manage to find the best in everything they do.Oh, but not this.This album is not worthy of the name Pink Floyd. It isn't even worthy of being mentioned in the Pink Floyd discography.I managed to get over Roger's so called \\"magnum opus\\" The Wall.Hell, I even managed to like it.But this, not this.I don't understand how could anyone manage to get over crap like The Final Cut, ecpecially Pink Floyd fans, who should really know better!David Gilmour: \\"I said to Roger, if these songs weren't good enough for The Wall, why are they good enough now? We had the most awful time of my life. Roger had got Rick out, Nick wasn't around much and now he was starting on me.A most unpleasant and humiliating experience.\\"I rest my case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roger Waters nearly murdered Floyd","review":"Why Roger why? Why did you try to destroy the Pink FLoyd name with this pile of garbage? This album is an atrocity to not only the Pink Floyd name but music. It hurts my feeling that something like this can be released. Its a slap to the face of Pink Floyd fans and I'm glad they released the Division Bell to bring back dignity to the name. Not Now John and Fletcher's Memorial Home are an insult to classics such as Dogs, Shine On You Crazy Diamonds, and Comfortably Numb.Roger Waters... I'm glad you went solo cuz your stuff is pretty much garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUSICALLY, IT'S HORRIBLE","review":"Granted Roger has some great ideas and fantastic lyrics througout Floyd's career, but I can do without this depressing, grating, sonic misadventure. I totally enjoy most that is Floyd, but this one is the worst. As uneven as \\"Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" is, at least there are musical parts on that one which is pleasing to listen to. Not so on \\"The Final Cut\\". I have friends who love this album, but it is beyond me as to why. If you liked \\"Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\\" then by all means, indulge in \\"Cut\\". I'll stick with the true Floyd albums. Funky Dung this ain't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waters got absolutely mad / is was the final cut","review":"The process ends on this album, what began with Animals. Waters wanted to be the greatest artist in the word = Gilmour and Wright were totally destroyed. I'm sorry, but the music can't be interesting for me! (The songs are the rests from the Wall)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone else miss Syd?","review":"I miss the Floyd as they used to be;an introspective, experimental, phycadelic group who were not afraid to venture slightly beyond the realms of normal human understanding and experience. I just can't feel that much sympathy for Waters here, and the lyrics, while beautiful and poetic at times, do not convey subtle or layered messages, as his lyrics used to. Personally, I'd much rather listen to \\"Take up Thy Stethascope and Walk\\", which is an insanely dark song compared to this material. It seems like pretty much the only tradgity Waters has to go on is the death of his father when he was three months old. While that is certainly tragic, hey, my friend lost her dad when she was 11, which I think would be alot harder. Finally, I have a guestion to ask. After hearing this album for the first time, did anyone here say to themeselves \\"God Syd, I wish you were here\\".?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE FINAL CUT FOR ORIGINAL PINK FLOYD","review":"I think that the final cut is too overrated. It is not that great. It has 3 alright songs: The Fletcher Memorial Home, Southampton Dock and The Final Cut. The Fletcher Memorial Home appeared on Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, it was the only song that came of the final cut. In other words the final cut is not reccomended, I bought it because I collect all Pink Floyd CDs.It is attrochious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, Run, Run, Run","review":"You better Run Like Hell from this album because its the worst thing ever produced on tape besides Metallica's St Anger. I can't believe the record company allowed this piece of crap to come out. The songs lack melody and the music is a great way to cure insomnia.To the people who gave this album two stars or more (esp. the four and five star ones), whats wrong with you? You guys are Pink Floyd Sheep. I can't believe you don't know what is terrible music... you guys are no better than a Staind fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The EMPTY TEAT","review":"I own everything by Pink Floyd, so I am ultimately qualified to report that this album sucks harder than a starving calf with a stopped-up mama....music by which to commit suicide. I recently played it again after it had been gathering dust for at least 20 years in my collection, and was amazed to find that I liked it even LESS now, than I did upon it's release day, and that hardly seems possible! Prior to this monsterous turd, about the only thing Pink Floyd had ever done that I found fairly unlistenable were some of the non-live portions of Ummagumma. In comparison to the Final Cut, that was Grammy-worthy toonage. EGADS!(P.S. ~ Don't kid yerselves. If you are Honest, you'll fess up that The Wall was almost as cringe inducing as this, it's red headed stepchild. Roger should have been taken out back and flogged unmercifully for foisting these 2 bombs into the hallowed Pink Floyd discography....Hey! It's not too late, is it?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on Roger, hang it up already!!","review":"Quit depressing everyone with your boring music man! Just put a lid on it and walk away from the mic forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"right group, wrong album","review":"The CD came quickly and looked like new all wrapped up, but instead of \\"The Final Cut\\" it was \\"Amused to Death\\", which would not have been so bad if I didn't already have that CD. I will not deal with them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album!","review":"For a long time I discarded this album as a 'copy cat' of The Wall. It is to the extent to which it represents a distinct style in the band's evolution.But once you are ready to listen to the album for what it is, I just loved it! Every song is a gem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest Floyd Album","review":"While there are a few scattered good songs on this album, it has too little involvement by other members of the band. While I agree that Roger Waters was clearly the stronger lyricist (vs Gilmour), the band performs the best when all members are involved in the writing. In addition, I think the musical quality is better when Gilmour writes solo as opposed to Waters. Waters never got over the death of his father in WWII, and this album simply describes his feelings and the war itself. He puts emotion into it, but the writing quality itself is weak. He focuses too much on himself and not the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable for the sake of being miserable","review":"I don't need music to be happy and peppy and light to enjoy it but after such a wonderful run at meshing high-brow and low-brow over the years, the Pink Floyd ship ran aground on the shoals of dull, joyless, blubbering melancholy with this one. Thanks, Roger! It seems that Waters took the success of The Wall as the green-light to cull away the musicality and scope of that album and focus strictly on depressed self-examination but there's not much to love about this work apart from Gilmour's guitar.This Pink Floyd album also has the distinction of being the only Floyd album in their discography that I literally tossed out as I felt no need to revisit it in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"the end","review":"The Final Cut suffers a bit from not enough musical ideas, and trying to make the lyrics the MAIN appeal of the album over everything else. Clearly this was an approach not everyone can appreciate, including me. The lyrics are nice, and some of the vocal melodies are good enough, but this album is definitely lacking compared to EVERY other Pink Floyd album created before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Final Cut...Cut if off your list of must-have Floyd CDs.","review":"It simply is not very good. Sure, Roger Waters has a way of communicating every detail of his apparently very traumatic childhood, but it makes the CD way too dramatic, very overboard. What's even more disappointing is that the music isn't all that great either.Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE Floyd fan, since I was about 9 years old (now in my 30s). But this CD simply does not live up to prior Floyd greats such as Dark Side, Meddle, Animals, Wish..., Atom Heart Mother. It is, however, a perfect compliment to The Wall (which I really liked at first, but now NEVER listen to--probably because it was too commercially successful, played too much).In any event, I gave this 2 stars because the last few songs are decent: Two Suns, Fletcher Memorial, are probably the best in the bunch. Sadly, though, not worth plunking down your hard earned cash. There is better Floyd to be had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak departure for Waters.","review":"This was one of the first Pink Floyd albums I purchased, and it remais today one of my least favorites. It lacks the experimentation of the early albums and the orchestrations 70's albums. Many consider it an extension of the Wall, but I think of it as a series of lesser outtakes from the recording of that landmark album. Where the Wall was cohesive and flowed along relatively well, this album has a neurotic, depressvie vibe to it that makes it hard to penetrate. I know many Floyd fans out there will cringe, but I prefer A Momentary Lapse or Reason and the Division Bell to the Final Cut. Mind you, those post-Waters albums are not great either, by any means (not compared to their 70's classics), but at least I can sit through them. Water's relentless rants make it difficult to listen to the whole of The Final Cut, with the exception of \\"Keeps your fithy hands....\\" and \\"Two suns...\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Lyrics, Bad Everything Else","review":"This is Floyd's worst album. Waters' lyrics are great but the music (instrumentation) is lacking. Anyone who thinks this is their best dont like music, they only like lyrics. Pass on this and just read a book. By the way Rogerless Floyd is better than this, and its a good thing too because if they would have ended when this came out the would have went out with a stinker. Any and every other Floyd album is much much better musically, this is lyrical masterpiece but a musical joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely underappreciated...","review":"First of all, I wouldn't go as far as to say that the added track is \\"unecessary\\" as it was originally supposed to be on this album anyways, and the subject of the song fits quite well with the theme of the album. Personally, whenever I heard the end of the song, in my mind I expected \\"The Hero's Return\\" to begin.I gave the new remaster 4 stars of 5, because they REALLY should have included \\"The Hero's Return Part 2\\" ... Those of you who have heard that bit would probably agree with me on that.Positives though, I have never heard this album sounds as crystal clear... the entire album doesn't sound even HALF as muddy as it used to. I didn't know HOW they could've made it better until I actually HEARD it. There were background vocals and sound effects I only BARELY heard before. Roger's whispering on parts sounded more like singing. It's just a beautiful remaster altogether and gave me a new appreciation for this project."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End of Legacy","review":"The Final Cut was infact the last of the \\"Real\\" Pink Floyd. Though many conisder it Roger Water's solo album, one will find it reminisant of such faithful ballads as \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Mother\\". The album consists of 12 tracks with such relation to one and other, as you might find on THE WALL. The entire album is seen through the eyes of a pathetic and self-loathing war boy, and clings to you with eerie detail not unlike ANIMALS. Though, at times, you may find yourself wanting to tell Roger to \\"shut up\\", at other times you are torn back with remarkable faith to find yourself looking at this album as a musical and poetic masterpiece.The album creative and sad. It does not lack glue or any other substance that would relate each track to itself. The album is a sad masterpiece and cries in the name of peace and distinct sorrow for the story one man, of whom, the story is now being told."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree..a 4 1/2 star album","review":"Alternatively lauded and reviled, this was a bitter pill of an album back in 1983 when it appeared...the final convulsion of a band tearing itself to pieces. I didn't like it much, apart from the raunchy \\"Not now John.\\" Well, years later , it still a'int perfect, but this is the Floyd album I listen to in its entirety....I love many of the other albums, and dip from track to track, but this really completes the Waters' triptych that include the 2-disc \\"The Wall.\\" \\"The Final Cut\\" is a timeless aural experience, and deserves reconsideration by those who have dismissed it. David Gilmour's guitar work is extraordinary,even more so when you consider both his hands were around Roger Waters' throat at the time. Buy this and listen again...and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"an album so divisive...","review":"This album, mainly outtakes from the Wall, was hatched together in a time when the group itself was crumbling apart. The individual players could barely talk to each other, let alone play music together. What they (specifically Waters) managed to produce was a timeless album that captures the essence of what is Pink Floyd; biting lyrics and flowing music that almost takes the listener away on a journey to post-war England. I've read in previous reviews of the sadness that surrounds this album; but what Floyd album doesn't. Their albums have always been about the accentuation of emotions. This album has great songs from start to finish. While I do agree that this album isn't for everyone, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a rock opus, in which the players anger towards each other play out on the stage. This album is Pink Floyd, more so than any other album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Cut","review":"This is the best Pink album. Mr Roger Waters is doing a very great job here. The song two sun in the sunset is the best.So a meesage to the new Pink Floyd(without Roger Waters): Dont destroy the Pink Floyd name with a new album...............Roger Waters is Pink Floyd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He is the best"},{"rating":"2","title":"best floyd album","review":"this is a great album, many people think this album is not a \\"pink floyd\\" album, just because it isnt like dsotm,wywh,and animals. this album is much like the wall. it is a different sound. it does not sound like it is a floyd album, but if you listen to the early stuff, then listen to, oh say wywh, you might say, they dont sound the same, music wise. just like this album sounds different from that favored floyd sound. the best songs on this album are the post war dream, your possible pasts, the hero's return, the gunner's dream, paranoid eyes, the fletcher memorial home, the final cut, not now jhon, and two suns in the sunset. that is just about every song on the album! . but if you are a new floyd fan do not buy this album. you probably will not like it. so if your new get either the darkside of the moon, wish you were here, animals, the wall, or the division bell. get some of those, then get the final cut. then you will be totally in love with pink floyd"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wall was great, but . . .","review":"The Wall was great, but this greater. Enough said, now listen to it again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Pink Floyd..it's ROGER WATERS only!!!!!","review":"I'm an avid fan of Pink Floyd, but I was extremely disappointed with this album. I wish I could give it zero stars. A few previous reviews have already mentioned this but it bears repeating: This is a ROGER WATERS album, not a Pink Floyd album! When this album was recorded, Rick Wright was booted from the band and Waters reached his megalomaniacal peak in 'artisitic control' over their music. While Gilmour and Nick Mason were still around, this was essentially a Roger Waters album with lackluster music and contrived songwriting. Need further proof? Check Waters dismal work since leaving PF after this album...nuff said!!!. Hell, even Gilmour admitted that he wished they didn't release this bomb. Save your money for either their old stuff or Momentary Lapse of Reason and thereafter...you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waters got absolutely mad.","review":"This rest-Wall album showed, what a guy Waters is: he's megalomanic, egoistic, musically absolutely poor at this time.

Gone were Richard Wright's keyboards that helped mark that true Pink Floyd sound through albums prior.The lyrical brilliance of Roger and guitar of Gilmour still remained however this alone is not enough to carry this album. I do not enjoy sitting through this album to hear the lyrics if the music does not back them up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Floyd - 'The Final Cut' (Columbia)","review":"Review no. 246. Band's 12th proper album, also the Gilmour, Waters, Wright and Mason line-up sawnsong release. Long awaited follow-up for 'The Wall'. Personally, I never cared much for this Floyd effort because I've always felt it was Pink Floyd in name only - certainly not spirit, vibe or musically. Even though the playing on this record is so-so, the only songs I sort of liked were \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" and the radio-friendly (over-played, at the time) \\"Not Now, John\\". Rest assure, the band's two CD reissues several years later 'Momentary Lapse Of Reason' ('87) and especially 'The Division Bell' ('94) are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love floyd but...","review":"The music is to me, to far and few between. It's like listening to poetry with a little bit of background music. I can get in to it if I try but it's a real effort, almost laborious. Nothing about this cd draws me in like every other Floyd album out there. The lyrics are great but personally I need the floyd magic in the music as well. There just simply is no musical adventure to me. Dry and too plain for such magnificent musicians. I know many will dissagree but that's ok. This is my viewpoint as I know others view this as a masterpiece. I give it 2 stars although I actually will not listen to this cd anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite Floyd, but amazing still","review":"This was the last Roger Waters-controlled Pink Floyd album, and it's a great end for him. The lyrics are the best Pink Floyd lyrics since Animals, but musically, it's quite a bit like The Wall. Some of the songs travel far from The Wall, still, and are very different from other Floyd material. The lyrics are truly sad, but incredibly powerful, and we get to see what Waters thinks of war, and his father's death. It's a great anti-war album, and not many albums reach the meaning behind this one. Waters has great vocals, too, and his voice works perfectly for the sometimes angry, sometimes sad, and sometimes wise lyrics. It isn't as many Pink Floyd, but still great. Very different, and very brilliant. After this, Pink Floyd began to deteriate. After Waters, Floyd was no more... This is the last great P.F album, IMHO...Recommended, but not as a very first for early Floyd fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Anti-War Albums out there...","review":"This is probably one of the best statements on war out there. It is a tribute to Roger Waters' dad who was lost during the battle of Anzio. It is also a statement on the Falklands War. I'd have to say that the song that sticks in my mind is the Gunner's Dream. It makes you wonder if we did in fact learn anything from World War II.The videos from this album are the best though. They really clarify things. Too bad they aren't officially released on anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wise, insiteful and reflective","review":"Not an album that immediatly appeals to the ear. Much of the sound is sudden and raw. Intially it is hard to reconcile the raw sound with the softly spoken lyrics. But its addictive, an album that you grow to love the more you listen. Reflecting on the post war dream and how the post modern world has failed to deliver. The lyrics are intelligent and show glimmers of a very dry English wit. Top tracks \\"The Final Cut\\", \\"Southampton Dock\\". Buy it and listern to it until it makes perfect sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect pre-qual to the Wall.

I remember listening to this when I was 14 and feeling so sad. This album is really just a continuation of the The Wall. I thought it was normal Pink Floyd having been exposed to The Wall first when I was a kid. Then, I heard what made Pink Floyd famous...Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, Meddle.The music in the Final Cut is soulless. I don't know, there is nothing there that makes you want to come back to listen to it again. It's just so bland and blahh. My first thought when I listened to this was that this album would serve better those who are trying to commit suicide because this music will definitely put you \\"in the mood\\" to slit your wrists.5 stars if you love being depressed otherwise this is a 1 for all other normal people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent lyrics, boring voice","review":"The last \\"real\\" pink floyd album, but i think that you get very tired if you want repeated listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only CUT from this should have been Roger","review":"It seems that Roger Waters's only goal with thisalbum was to alienate all of the Pink Floyd fans,knowing that the group with him was done. It isobvious that his attempt failed. With the release ofMomentary Lapse of Reason, The Division Bell, DelicateSound of Thunder and Pulse it shows that Pink Floyd can survivewithout Roger Waters and after hearing what Roger Watershas done on his own it shows that HE is not surviving very well without Floyd. This album is for the most part a Waters effort and a disgrace to the Pink Floyd name. DO NOT waste your moneyon this GARBAGE even to complete your Floyd catalog.I can see why David Gilmour had his name removed from theproduction credits. It is very very clear that Gilmour wasthe true heart and soul of the real Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can this get the same rating as Momentary Lapse of Reason?","review":"I loved this album as a schoolkid when it first came out, and having just listened to it again I'm glad to find that I love it just as much today. There's something so visceral, lyrically haunting and timelessly RIGHT about it, never mind the fact that it's depressing.But it seems the depressing aspect was terribly off-putting to many reviewers. This makes no sense. Some of the world's finest art is depressing. And if ever a Pink Floyd album could be called art, this is it. Raw, yet coherent. Angry, yet sublime. A Momentary Lapse of Reason is a shambling, shallow thing, offering just a faint echo of Pink Floyd in their heyday. How it can get the same rating as The Final Cut is totally beyond me.And let's not forget the incredible production standards.

Wes Craven and Eddie Murphy team up for a story of a Caribbean vampire who comes to New York to search for his 'queen.' It had the potential to be a good movie, either as a horror movie or as a parody of vampire movies. The problem is they tried to do both, a comedy and a horror story, and neither carried off very well. Murphy does do an excellent job as Maximillian (the lead role), and it might be one of his better performances. The other characters he played (a preacher and an Italian thug) were substandard. While Murphy's performance was great, the rest of the cast was wooden. Kadeem Hardison and John Witherspoon are the comic relief in the film. They are over the top and the movie just isn't horrific enough to need comic relief.

But this isn't a how-to book, well, maybe it is, but it is funny and brilliant and great just to read.I've built many robots, which would fall into the book's early chapters in terms of complexity of autonomous behavior. I bought this to learn about methods for advanced autonomous behavior. And this book delivers on that goal, but it is also so much more! The first chapter is so concise and lovely, it is almost poetic. The humor and creativity remind me of Stanislaw Lem. The rich, elegant, density and brevity remind me of The Old Man and the sea. This book covers the workings of autonomous robotics for the novice to the advanced roboticist, but it is also sophisticated literature for anyone.

The 4 wheels on the Fuzion Scooter are plastic and don't go very fast but fast enough to wish it came with a hand brake. Actually, it feels very safe, I just don't like having to jump off it to stop. I am an original skateboard girl from the early 60's and the Fuzion is a lot like a skateboard except it has a handle. It won't do sharp turns or corners like the Razors, but that 's not what I need it for. . I highly recommend it for older people that may miss their old skateboard days.

This third instrallment is only loosely connected to the previous two, in that it features many of the same settings and a few minor characters, but you could easily read it on its own. I'm reading through the series in order because that's how I'm wired, but you don't need to.A wizard is born the eighth son of an eighth son, and such a birth is at hand as a wizard nearing his end travels to the mountain village of Bad Ass to hand over his staff to the newborn lad. Only too late do they realize that he has just ordained the Disc's first ever female wizard.....This was good.

I often think of Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg and marvel at their antics, and unique personalities. Long before J.K.Rowling was Terry Pratchett. All of the other books written about DiscWorld are equally intertaining, and I find myself saying over and over \\"Oh No! He didn't!\\"...as I laugh and laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Pratchett's best","review":"I've been reading the Discworld series in order, so naturally I read Equal Rites third. (I think. It's third, right?) I think it was a good book in general, but compared to Pratchett's other wonderful books, it fell very short of its mark. There was very little humor in the book, and I didn't feel that any of the characters were realistic or appealing in any way. Granny Weatherwax is possibly the most unappealing character I've come across in Discworld so far. But for hardcore Pratchett fans, read this book anyway, because frankly, you have to. You've got to read them all. :) But if you're new to Pratchett, stear clear of Equal Rites. It's rather boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rite On","review":"This is the first Discworld book that I happened to read even though I own about 12 of them. I didn't realize it was out of order until the last page but even then I didn't really care. The story of Esk and her struggle to be a wizard is filled with great subtle humor and puns throughout. Pratchett has given life to a world filled with magic and witches and wizards that compares with those of Terry Brooks. I would agree with other reviews which claim the ending came a little quickly. The story is without a solid ending but being the first book in the series that I have read, that may come later. The journey through the book is well worth the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun as always!!!

I think I will read it a second time soon :o) and easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the weakest in the series.","review":"For some reason, it has a lot of interesting concepts, and characters I enjoy (the first mention of Granny Weatherwax), but to be honest, this is one of my least favorite Discworld books.Some of the elements never get used again, which, for the ones I liked, I found disappointing. And it does explain Borrowing for the first time as well, but other than that, most of it (besides Granny and UU) don't get brought up after this book. And while it tackles the ideas of sexism on both sides rather well, it doesn't seem to have the kick other books do.To spoil the rest of the series: Esk, for all her hard work, NEVER gets mentioned AGAIN. In any of the books. So if you skip this book, to be honest, you won't miss out on anything. I would have preferred it much better if anything in this book had made a difference in some of the others. At least after The Light Fantastic, Twoflower shows up again later..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"One of the better books of all time! It was a gift from a friend.

Next to Good Omens, it is one of his best books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Discworld novel","review":"'Equal Rite's is the third in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series following 'The Light Fantastic'. However this is not a sequel to the previous stories, but is instead a self contained story with new characters. Like the previous two novels it is a lot of fun, but again with a somewhat lightweight plot. 'Equal Rites' is not as episodic as 'The Light Fantastic' which is a definite improvement, but although the story starts strong it fizzles out by the ending. The plot is a vehicle for Pratchett to create some funny situations and to make sly comments on contemporary gender relations. I have read reviews that state that Pratchett still hadn't hit his stride yet with 'Equal Rites'. This sounds right to me -the book is good enough to read the next in the series but probably not to read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I bought these to supplement ones that I have lost in the 40 years since I got them as a wedding present.

I didnt see the video of Calling You, Be A Man, and the Fiesta song. I did see the concerts, though. Its over three hours long, it seems. It was Aqua fan overkill.

This album really showcases how damn good these musicians are. The 1st track, \\"Wasted Days\\" is a damn killer way to open up things. It really sets the mood throughout the rest of the album. Every track on this album is consistently good. I find myself either nodding along, shoulder groovin, skankin, or singing off key to the lyrics. Incredible musicans and Vic's voice is buttah.

This just crept up on me one day while i was listening to samples of the \\"Velvet Tinmine\\" collection so I decided to give it a listen too and was immediately hooked by the first track in its 30 second preview so impulse buyign set in off the bat, but it was a good idea.

The book is light on text, but the pictures more than make up for this shortcoming. Mr. Ethell, who unfortunately died in a crash of a P-38 in 1997, was a foremost authority of military aircraft and amassed an amazing collection of color photographs from WWII. Just a small fraction of these are displayed in this wonderful book. If you are a fan of WWII military aircraft, this book is a must for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Aware","review":"While this book may appear to be well-written at first glance, one would do well to read the May 1989 (vol.55, #2) review of it in The Journal of Southern History. The reviewer points out evidence of plagiarism, and the journal notes that the publisher withdrew the book from publication. Though it doesn't say the book was pulled for plagiarism, it is reasonable to assume so. The lesson here is to always check scholarly journals for reviews of scholarly books before trusting their content. Trust the pros."},{"rating":"2","title":"not his best, but we're talking about a genius","review":"Hal Hartley is way ahead of his time. This is not his best film, but it's definitely worth watching. I first saw an excerpt in a sociology/religion class which hooked me: advice on love and commitment in a bathroom. This film takes chances, and some of them aren't that entertaining, but overall it's not as bad as elsewhere reviewed on this site."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not about Parker Posey--it's about film and language","review":"I find it amusing that people have been lured to watch this film by indy queen Parker Posey. As all Hal Hartley films tend to be, dialogue and narrative is negated and transformed by repetition and by intentional \\"non-acting\\". I mean, do people really think all the actors are acting this poorly? By having the actors not act, the ideas cannot be discolored by subjective interpretation. The film strips away traditional storytelling by repeating it in three forms. The narrative disappears in repeating it. In the three vignettes, nuances in each and differences between them are what is of primary interest. The actors are tools for Hartley's obsession with love, desire, and identity. This film is a poem. It is difficult to evaluate Hartley's films without considering the entire body of work. It may not be Hartley's most successful effort, but it is an interesting experiment nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flirt Flop","review":"I got this movie because Parker Posey was in it, but to my dismay it was only for about 10 seconds. I was also unaware that this was by the same guy who made that AWFUL movie, Henry Fool. What can I say? This movie was the pits. The concept was good, but Mr. Hartley is not skilled enough as a filmmaker to execute it. Recommendation: don't bother. A waste of time as well as a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hal Hartley-no thanks","review":"I dont feel like wasting my time writing a review here, but I want to warn you to skip films from someone who can make even the bubbliest of people, Parker Posey, dull.

I was so looking forward to reading this book and recommended it to my book club.It started off great - a 40ish single woman who encounters Mary, Mother of Jesus in her living room, wearing a trench coat and running shoes. Doesn't this sound good? But then it proceeds to a run-on account of various shrines/sightings. There is no interaction to speak of between the two.There are so many better books out there!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for history buffs","review":"Unless you are an avid reader of ancient and/or religious history you will probably find this book rambling and boring. If you were expecting an insight into Mary's life, whether fact or fiction, this is not the book for you. The author's previous stories were excellent, but this was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a novel","review":"This book was a mildly entertaining novel until shortly into the book the tone changed. Suddenly, I knew I was no longer reading a novel. For the most part, the chapters labeled 'history' are dry with an occasional interesting tidbit. The later 'novel' chapters don't offer much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our Lady of the Lost and Found","review":"I was excited about the premise of having Mother Mary appear in someone's home and seek refuse for a week. What a wonderful idea.I began the book with enthusiasm, and for a few chapters enjoyed reading it. However, often things were presented in a shopping list style. It was not simply \\"this had occurred\\", but \\"this had happened, and this had happened, and this had happened\\". After a while I felt like I was listening to a teenager talk about her life, not a grown women.The most alluring parts of the book for me, were the telling of how Mother Mary had an infulence in the world and the miracles that had come about in her name. The rest was like someone just introducing these events and letting us know how excited she was to have her in her home. She wasn't able bring across how someone might feel having had such a miracle occur in her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a letdown","review":"I have to agree with all the other reviewers who found so much promise in the premise and in the first few chapters of this book. About 1/4 of the way through it, I really loved it and even recommended it to others. The idea of Mary visiting an ordinary woman seemed so mystical and warm at the same time. But halfway through it I've started to skim pages; at the third \\"History\\" chapter, I groaned out loud. The two separate stories in this book - a visit from Mary and an exploration into philosophy and theology - weren't blended well enough for me to continue to feel excited about this book. I'll do my best to finish it, but I'm already disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity","review":"This book is an example of a simple tale told simply--but one that has great impact. Schoemperlen portrays the Virgin Mary as an ordinary woman, living an ordinary life in a way that is extraordinary. She tells the story without embellishment or any miraculous events, yet makes the point that such is the stuff of saints. It is a book that can be life-changing; one need not be of heroic proportions to be a hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"This is such a dissappointing novel. The author/title character is just plain boring! Her interactions with Mary are boring. This material could have been made so much more interesting.

I was captivated by thebeginning, thinking that this gal writes very well. I read it to bea tongue-in-cheek novel that would be fun. After the first fewchapters, I changed my mind. The rest was painful but I readit to the end. The further I got, the more I skipped.The middle was a philosophy treatise by an amateur who tookHeisenberg's name in vain a great many times. Linking it to herown philosophical rantings.The \\"histories\\" have no place in a novel.The last part of the book, according to one of the reviewers,should have been titled, \\"My Boring Life Story With a Visit FromMary.\\" It's clear why she never found a love of her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost turned me into an atheist","review":"Proof positive that an interesting idea can make a mundane, tedious book. The real miracle here? That I finished it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start, but...","review":"it surely did not hold up. I really enjoyed the beginning of this book. The author's use of humor and and her descriptive ability really pulled me in. But not long into the book it got quite historical and factual, which I found interesting at first, but too repetetive with the frequent references to the Mary sightings. For me, that is what caused the book to lose its appeal. Occassionally I am interested in reading about Mary visitations, miracles, etc., but it wasn't what I picked up this book for, which was purely pleasure reading and escapism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I got this book wanting something more from it!! I thought this would be a great book after reading \\"Looking for Mary\\" by Beverly Donofrio which I LOVED! But Our Lady of the Lost & Found does not come close to Beverly's book. The writing style is somewhat redundant to the point of frustration. I found my self skipping over sentences and sometimes pages to reach her point. My problem may be that it is a novel and I did know that going into reading it. The parts of the book that I found enjoyable were the bits and pieces of history that were obviously very researched and told nicely. But the over-all story was drab and uninspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"The premise is interesting, and it could have been the means for exploring (and providing fictional answers to) many interesting questions. However, I could not finish this book. The protagonist is a terribly boring, solitary person, and in the first 150 pages, the holy houseguest doesn't do anything interesting enough to keep me reading. The snippets of Marian history are interesting, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I have to agree with most of the negative reviews here. This book was frustrating to deal with; more of a chore than an interesting read. I did not like the way the non-fiction was interspersed throughout the story. It interrupted the flow of the novel and the development of the plot, of which there was shockingly little. The character of Mary was not well-developed in the context of her visit. Instead, the author chose to focus almost exclusively on historical apparitions rather than the one that she herself had the opportunity to create. And while I realize Mary has appeared in numerous incarnations, the apparitions seemed to bear little relationship to the Mary who appeared in the main character's living room.Disconnected and underdeveloped. I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely little book","review":"I have enjoyed immensely this novel. It is certainly not a typical \\"beach read\\" where one just gets lost in the characters or action because there isn't truly much character or plot development. The strength of this \\"novel\\" is that all the action is the change that takes place within the mind of the narrator and how she changes during and after her week with the Blessed Mother. I was intrigued by the influence of Mary on how the nameless narrator views her life as a single woman writer. The questions she asks herself regarding her place in the world and how the most influential woman in history quietly and graciously affects the way she thinks about herself is quite powerful. Again, not a traditional novel but if you would like a book with real \\"meat\\" about faith and friendship, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Held my interest...mostly","review":"I enjoyed this book and will be passing it on to a few friends. I am not particularly religious, however,I do believe in miracles and the power of faith. I found the \\"religious history\\" sections to be interesting and insightful. I was never quite sure where the story would lead - so it held my interest until the very end. My only wish is that there had been more interaction with the narrator/main character and the Virgin Mary - possibly with some \\"answers\\" to the mystery of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MARY ...","review":"I grew up in a very religious household, with pictures of Jesus, Mary and various saints in constant attendance. But they weren't 'real' or relatable to my life. But THIS Mary is a flesh and blood woman who, in this fictional version, is ever so much more believable -- and worthy of note in history -- than the holy cards of my youth. It's exquisitely done, and very rewarding. This is another example of having to buy another copy of a book I treasured because I'd given away my own copy in a fervor of enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot, but involves some weird things","review":"The story is interesting, a doll that comes to life, but the way she was brought to life is a bit disturbing.

Then her fathers friends Drew gives Casey a doll named Eve(Tayra). She trys to stir up some magic but it turns wrong and instead of her mom comiing back heres eve.

Its a great movie so buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed, I cried, I watched it again and again!","review":"Life-Size is one of those rare movies that has a little bit of something for everybody. From halarious scenes (When Eve breaks a nail and sks if she'll be thrown away) to touching scenes (When Eve becomes the friend Casey needs), you will love Life-Size. Casey is a 14 year old girl who's mother recently passed away and father is often not around. Using a magic spell book, she tries to bring her mom back to life, but when her Eve doll gets brought to life, Casey has to fix it. Casey basicaly keeps to herself and tries to push everyone else away from her. When Casey is finally able to open up to Eve and her father, your sure to have a smile on your face! Lindsay Lohan (Parent Trap) and supermodel Tyra Banks give excellent performances. This is only Lindsay's second movie, but I can't wait to see what she'll do in the future. This price is great. My only gripe is that the only special features are audio options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and funny!","review":"I loved Life-Size! It's one of my favorite movies! A great performance by Lindsay Lohan. There were only a couple things I don't like, like when the girl trips in the middle of the road, she just sits there and covers her face instead of getting up and running.

Even in the end, the true problem of the little girl (not having her mother) had not been solved. Tyra Banks was an annoying skank who says such things as \\"I'm anatomically correct\\" to a man and then slaps him for propositioning her. The whole movie is fake feel-good-touchy-feely disney crap.

'Life Size' is more edgy! It has occult situations, single parent family, scantily-cad super models, and middle aged adults dancing really badly. This movie also embraces cultural awareness by showing that black Barbie dolls can be all the rage in the middle of the suburbs.All sarcasm aside, it is okay for a children's movie to have intelligence.

Yet, like the live albums of any groups today, this album does suffer slightly due to the sounds of the crowd. On a normal CD by Biosphere, such as Substrata, the music goies on and on uninterupted, yet on this live album, the listener is frequetly jolted out of their relaxed state by a lone-loud cheer in the crowd. And just the racket between tracks is enough to take the cd down another star. But, it's still a great album, and H-I-A is incredible. So, if you're a fan, I would recommend this to you.

He is a competent historian, and offers well-researched treatises on historical events and how they really happened. Unfortunately, the second half of each chapter, in which he attempts to get creative and speculate on what could have been, are where Steve Tally shows real weaknesses as a writer. Most of his \\"what-if\\" scenarios are not very creative at all, and fail to challenge your perceptions of the forces of history, which happens to be what he's trying to achieve. Notable exceptions are the chapter speculating on what would have happened to Bill Gates if the hadn't made an early business deal with IBM, and what would have become of Dan Quayle if Bush had dropped him from the presidential ticket."},{"rating":"2","title":"More thoughtful than most alternative histories","review":"\\"Almost America\\" is one of those books which may be overlooked and that would be a shame. Unlike many books in this area which assume that the reader is already familiar with \\"what really happened,\\" the background is given by Tally which makes it easier to appreciate how things could have turned out differently. It's the kind of book which encourages one not just to read the book itself, but to dig deeper.

Don't bother with any other books on the subject. Original editions of this work, in good shape, sell for a couple of hundred dollars, if you can even find them!Not only does Embury describe the principles of a mixed drink, and the equipment that is useful in its preparation, but he also describes each base ingredient, each mixer and how to mix to get the best result. He also provides recipes for six basic cocktails and the practical possibilities in making your own.There is also a chapter concerning \\"The Use and Abuse of Liquor\\", so you could argue that this is even a moral work.TFAoMD is educational, entertaining, practical and an essential addition to the library of the serious mixologist. Moreover, it is beautifully written. What more could you ask for...?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for those serious about learning to mix drinks","review":"If you just want a book with lots of recipe lists, this isn't your book, though it has plenty of those. If you want to know why certain types of drinks work and how to create your own, this book is indispensable. The man is genius, and his commentary about certain drinks is absolutely refreshing.I first came across this book (1952 without illustrations) in my dad's library. I've purchased and used many other bartending books and guides and always keep coming back to Mr. Embury. He never disappoints and his personal versions of cocktails always please.If everyone who served cocktails had a copy of this book, the notion of a cocktail party being simply \\"beer and wine\\" would be a thing of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious Proofreading","review":"This reprint of the Art of Mixing Drinks is without a doubt the most poorly proofread book I have ever purchased.

Kubelik does this music wonderfully, but he has dry engineering by DG (drat!), and perhaps not the world's best orchestra. From the first notes of this disc, you'd have to listen hard to not think that SWF SO isn't world class (although clearly their work can be uneven; their Janacek Sinfonietta on the same label reveals many orchestral weaknesses). The Water Sprite is gripping. The Noonday Witch, a personal favorite, is quite well done--I prefer it to Kubelik. The Wood Dove is fine, but not up to the level of the Sprite and the Witch. Zinman gives a rousing performance of In Nature's Realm. The sound is great! If you don't know this music, try this disc. You'll get hooked and wonder why such great music is practically ignored...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Lorber's Best","review":"I first heard this album as a teen. My oldest brother introduced me to the wonderful world of jazz fusion and I have been hooked ever since. This record in my opinion is probably one of the best jazz fusion albums ever made. If you want to know what Kenny G sounded like before he sold out; you need to get this record. These guys are so talented that its hard to believe that they couldn't sustain this type of music throughout their careers. It's too bad you can't purchase it at a reasonable price. But if you have the extra money buy it; you won't be disappointed. This is definitely a classic.rlf"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two great highlights in this package for me!","review":"Came across this by browsing through my little brother's record collection. Now the song that jumps out of this collection for me is \`Think back & remember', which was a BIG tune, on the rare groove scene, back in the 90's. This is one of the few vocal songs on this project, and it still sounds fresh. So I explored the rest, by putting this onto my mini disc player. The other song that I grew to love was' Magic lady', which is a vibrant instrumental cut, which I love to death. The remaining songs are OK, nothing more really."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Jeff Lorber's greatest","review":"Since I have had this CD in the mail, I can't stop playing it. This really is the best stuff I have heard in a long time. Great CD, and if you take a look at the heads on the CD, you will see Kenny G., who doesn't yet know what future had in store for him. The smooth riffs of Jeff's compositions can be easily recognized, but this time they are played by a real bass player. That is probably why the funk vibe is more human, and why this album is better than some of the new \\"smooth jazz\\" albums, that Jeff created. While some cuts are produced int the ways of those times (and somewhat slower than we are used to now), this album still remains one of the brightest highlights of jazzrock in the 20th century. When you can get your hands on this one, for a reasonable price: get it! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"The product never seemed to work for us.

Even indoors it takes multiple tries to get a flame going; outdoors in the cold (40 degrees F) forget it - wouldn't light at all.

Early stuff with Stan Kenton that goes all the way back to 1945 when she joined the Kenton orchestra as a replacement for Anita O'Day. There are 24 tracks on this compilation that was reissued in 2000, and they range in feel from swing to bluesy/brassy ballads that have a strong Kenton flavor. You can hear the young Christy maturing as a vocalist in the five years that are covered by these recordings. Most of the cuts are good to terrific. I especially liked \\"Willow, Weep for Me\\", \\"Please be Kind' and \\"He's Funny that Way\\". I'm less a fan of the numbers with heavy horn input, but that's Kenton, and most admirers like it brassy.June Christy was a wonderful performer and this early album was the launch of her career and reputation.

These songs aren't the original versions, but do showcase his best tunes. There is no filler here - every song shows the greatness of his songwriting. \\"Weekend In New England\\" is actually one of his lesser songs once you hear \\"Laughter and the Tears\\" and the updated (from 1973 to 1983) version of the charming \\"Woman On Your Arm.\\" Some of these tunes were covered by others, but the intimacy of Randy's own recordings have a much greater emotional punch even though he sounds a little rushed here. This collection is a pared down version of a rarer compilation called Uptown-Uptempo Woman, and unfortunately fails to include anything from his great first album, but he has so many great songs to pick from.

Absolute return."},{"rating":"1","title":"For $30, I thought I knew what I was getting","review":"I bought this today as an alternative to more expensive polarizers. I figured, yeah, it's not going to perform as well, but it should be good enough. I was wrong.The problems start before you even put this on your lens. That is, if you can get it on your lens. The threading sucks, and even at its tightest, mine never screws on flush with the lens barrel and always feels loose.The threading on the outside is short, too. I prefer to put my polarizers under my UV filters to protect them, but this one won't hold it. Similarly, I can't even put my Canon lens cap over the polarizer if it's on the outside because the threading is too short to hold the clamps.Now on to performance. What performance? Done.I feel dirty for even letting myself buy such a cheap filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommend","review":"At first I think it's a good deal when I got it from BestBuy.

Even in such a case this filter fails to meet expectations. The build quality is abysmal, while I was attaching the filter to my lens the glass just fell off! I put the filter back together, but after a little use it falls right off again.For the effectiveness: it will give you a bad flare if you have a light source in the frame or right out of its border. The polarizing effect is not that bad (given that you have low expectation to start with).IMHO, it is not worth the price paid, however small; you are better off using a UV filter for protection and post processing for the sky color etc.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The first table was not symetrically set on the base, screws were stripped and top had a crack.

I wouldnt say this is a great album but it is very very good with ground breaking compositions for its time.

The illustrations are stark and monochromatic, and personally I feel that they were too dark for young children who are usually stimulated by vivid and bold colors. I liked the text though which I felt could be used to engage young listeners' interest and perhaps integrated with other interactive activities to tie in with the subject matter.

I admit to not being anxious to read this book since I figured it would be so far inferior to the original, but the author turned the story line in a way that exceeded my low expectations. That said, I still have to say it was better than the last Godfather movie. In that film, I was rooting for someone to kill off the godfather's daughter. As I recall, the killer was someone hired by the Actors Guild.There is nothing more to say about this book. It's only too bad that the Puzo family didn't respect their predecessor's advice and left the book alone. The original still sells, so they are making enough in royalties. Like the third movie sequel, just pretend that it never happened and enjoy the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just pulp fiction...","review":"Mildly entertaining...

To give some examples, canon plotlines from the movies are abandoned and/or changed for no reason, characters behave 100% different to what they were portrayed, and to be honest, the story is just downright ridiculous.No self-respecting Godfather fan should read this garbage, and if you ask me, Mark Winegardner should \\"sleep with the fishes\\" for this insult to the Corleones. Avoid this trash at all costs if you consider yourself a true Godfather fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book to pass on","review":"Having read all of Puzo's works, I was eager to read the Godfather Returns. I was not expecting it to be a replica of Puzo's writings, as the authors have different styles and are writing years apart. But some things are better left alone. Winegardner does the story no justice. His writing is extremely poor and jumps around to much. It is as if he has no understanding of the original. This is probably the worst book I ever read.

Numerous times I found myself skimming, trying to get to something interesting.* Gave up halfway through.All in all, pointless. Winegardner gives it a good try, but he doesn't have the feel for the mob or the people that Puzo had.

Don't like it at all. I've tried to finish it a couple of times, but I can't. I just don't like it. This is not (in my opinion) true to the characters Mario Puzo developed. Puzo developed strong charctacters (Vito, Mike, Sonny - even Fredo). These characters had strengths, weaknesses, morals (in their own twisted ways) - and had their own emotional baggage - who doesn't. This baggage made them more real; more interesting. Winegardner took these characters and redeveloped them so that the weaknesses controlled the characters - as opposed to the characters struggling to control their weaknesses. This book and the subsequent one take these characters and de-evolve them into wrecked shells of what they were. This de-evolution happens so quickly, I can't follow it and it just doesn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"so much potential wasted","review":"I'm a huge fan of The Godfather series. This book did nothing to move the story along. It was nice to see a writer try to advance the characters along, but it was very shallow.

Also, Michael is not as main a character as he should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should sleep with the fish","review":"I can't believe this was a NY Times best seller. The writing is of abysmal quality, the story line is too confusing, the characters are completely destroyed. Why did anyone allow this guy to destroy the superbly styled characters created by Puzo?

I read at least twenty books each year, always finish no matter how bad, but I am at page 450 and simply cannot go on. No central storyline at all.

I was ready for The Godfather Returns. I realize that this is not a Puzzo novel, but at the very least Winegardener should have tried to follow the original flow of the characters. What a disappointment, this book is boring, the stories all over the place, hard to follow, have to read pages over and over trying to understand what he is trying to say, it is just a total mess. If this assignment was given to a 6th grade kid, he would have done better. I can only hope that Hollywood does not decide to turn this into a movie, it would be a bomb. I am surprised that the Puzzo family allowed this book to be published; they should have thrown away the manuscript and commissioned a different writer. Too bad the minimum rating I can give is one star, if I could I would give it no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Winegardner You're No Mario Puzo","review":"While I admire the initiative to undertake a sequel to a classic that will probably never be equaled, the author, in my opinion, develops only one new character of any interest--Francesca and fails to build a complete story. I have read every Puzo novel from the Fortunate Pilgrim to the Sicilian and La Familia. Puzo never failed to build characters you can almost touch and stories that keep you up way beyond your bedtime. Winegardner failed to do either. He appeared to be building a cast of characters to carry on the legacy, but failed to deliver a story that made you want to turn the page. The only reason I stayed with it until the end, was to try to find a redeeming quality. Unfortunately, there is none."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?!?!","review":"Does anyone even know what the hell is happening in this book? Nothing, just a bunch of crap.

This book does neither!I read quite a lot, and I very rarely give up on a book. But this one is just an overblown, poorly written, colossal bore. I got about half way through it and decided that I could think of much better ways to waste my time. The characters are hard to follow and keep straight, and even if you do manage that you really don't care about any of them anyway.

Weingarten does not have the Sicilian head to follow a great novel like the Godfather. The book is boring. After the first few chapters, which cover events after the treachery by Tessio, it drags. Who cares about Sonny's girl finding out what happened to her father? We already know how Kay feels about Michael. The head to head battle between Michael and Geraci doesn't begin until well past the middle of the book. Godfather fans will be greatly dissappointed with this feeble attempt to cash in on Mario Puzo's legendary book. Unlike the original, which I have read at least 20 times, this book is going to the community pile with the rest of the books I will never read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like this one","review":"I loved The Godfather, and looked forward to reading this one. I soon discovered that this author comes no where near the classic. The writing is just not as good, and it didn't seem to follow the story as I know it.

The story is truly awful. The author changes GF 'history'. Characters do things that won't be believed by any Godfather fan. If you've read the original Godfather, and watched the movies more times than you can remember, you'll have a hard time finishing this book. I pre-ordered this book way in advance, looking forward to it since I'm one of the biggest Godfather fans around. It took me only a few chapters of this book to shake my head in disbelief at what I was reading. I finished it hoping it would get better as it went along, but if anything the story gets worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORROW IT","review":"I eagerly looked forward to this book, and when I finally read it, I was very disappointed. Obviously it was not Mario Puzo's literary style, but even understanding that, it was dull and boring. Had nothing to grab your attention so that you would want to stay up all night and finish it. It was recycled ideas from the original Puzo book, with nothing to make it it's own. There were no characters I really wanted to see live and do well, and Geraci as an enemy of Michael Corleone's was a farce. If anyone wants to read it, borrow it from the library or a friend, as its not worth the money to own it as part of your home library."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's with the bad reviews??","review":"Did some of these people read the same book I did? Does Mark have some jealous competion out there? Is another Family unhappy about his revelations? Sounds like a genuine mob-action conspiracy to me! This was a great book, I couldn't put it down. It has a large list of well-drawn characters, most are of the wise-guy hit-man stripe, but there are a number of women too: family members, molls, etc. The dialogue is just what you'd expect, it has a genuine tough-guy reality to it, not to mention the gory 'business-related' activities. The 'twist' at the end leaves the possibility of a sequel---Mark, please consider this! I'm expecting a movie as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"No not good","review":"The writing is very juvenile. It is at times incoherent and lacks any sort of story line. it has promise which is not kept"},{"rating":"1","title":"DId not care for this book","review":"I felt this book was a big disappointment. It was not well researched and was poorly written. the previous characters Michael Corleone and Tom Hagen were totally out of character and the new lead character's background was based on inconsistency. The book kept alluding to inaccurate accounts - specifically that he \\"made his bones\\" under a different caporegime which is contrary to the entire premise. The author's use of parentheses to indicate past events was annoying. Mario Puzo would be spinning in his grave to have his name attached. Of course this is just my opinion but I was very disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Mistakes...","review":"I haven't finished the book yet, but within the first 100 pages I have noticed a whole slew of mistakes: like, did the author never actually see the movies or know basic TV and medicinal history? Here are the four top ones I've noticed:1. One of the characters in 1955 mentions watching the Untouchables on TV: that show premiered in 1959.2. The author mentions viagra - in 1955.3. Michael tells a story about his father, and says that Vito's mother was murdered, stabbed to death: hello? She was shotgunned in G2.4. The author states that during the Michael/baptismal killing spree Kay and the kids were at her parents' home in New Hampshire: the killings happened the day she was at the baptism with Michael, and within a day or two she was trying to console Connie on Long Island about Carlo's supposed death. One fast trip in dem old cars!I can't wait to see what the author blows in the rest of the book. Sheesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor and useless book","review":"I hope the Puzzo family was paid a nice fee to allow this book to be written. I hope it was a huge fee, as this book is a joke. True Godfather fans would have paid the family to stop publication of this book.I started the book with an open mind, especially since I was given this as a gift. As I read the characters became strange, and completely out of synch with the Puzzo books and the movie. For example, why the obsession with mafia bosses who double as pilots?

I'm a die-hard Puzo fan, a Copolla fan, a Godfather fan, but couldn't even finish this book. Puzo was a master storyteller -- he told interesting stories about fascinating, captivating people. Winegardner is trying too hard to be a NOVELIST, trying to impress with clever devices and novelistic crap. (I had to re-read passages over and over just to figure out what the hell was happening. And usually, not much happened at all, except for whining and despair and angst. Zzzz.) He ruined Fredo as a character. He made Michael a paper cut-out. Clemenza didn't sound like Clemenza -- but some Soprano wannabe. Hagen is a snooze. Sonny's kids. . . what a bore.He should have just told a story.

Could have been a great book with just a chapter or two about Clemenza, Frank Pantengli, how Fredo unknowingly set up Michael.... anything! All we got was countless boring pages about nieces, cousins, wives and crap! The book gives you absolutely no additional information about the Corleones. I could now sit through insurance seminars for days and days with a big smile on my face. When people say, \\"how can you stand it?\\" I'd reply, \\"'cause I spent four days reading the Godfather Returns!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Winegardner sleeps with the fishes","review":"This is how ridiculous this book is -- Fredo is gay. Yep. No joke. That is the big hook. There is absolutely no suggestion of such a preposterous twist in any of the films (not even in the \\"king of makes no sense\\" - Godfather III). But, Windegardner, perhaps simply to shame the franchise - or perhaps just because he is catering to morons that looovvvee reality t.v. -- decides to add in the preposterous.Needless to say -- I would recommend watching Godfather III before reading this book. At least with Godfather III, we can at least blame, in part, a studio that refused to pay Duvall.

Only 100 pages into the book, I feel as though I have been robbed. The characters that Winegardner fabricated were bland at best. Winegardner relies on telling the reader how smart or scary a character or situation is rather than letting the scene or dialogue speak for itself.

I only hope that this sterco doesn't kill my love for Puzo's novel or the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE BOOK","review":"That's $8.50 I'll never see again!After 100 painful pages I dropped this abortion of a book like it was on fire, which, by the way, would have helped the book very much.I picked it up because I thoroughly enjoy Puzo and the Godfather (original one) was an elegantly simple story. No, I wasn't expecting Winegardner to have the same style of prose as Puzo and in this I wasn't dissapointed. Mario must be turning over in his grave.Whereas Puzo's words just flow Winegardner's come in at a painful rate. The characters are obscure and impossible to get a feel for. They have more names and nicknames than The Lord of the Rings (another vastly overrated book).I advise my fellow readers not to buy this absolutely horrible book. However, if you must then give me a call. I have one I'm dying to get rid of."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed.","review":"I picked this up because I loved Puzo's work and wanted to see how another author would handle the characters he was given. He failed. He failed in a big way. There are some characters that are iconic in the literary world and this book seems as if it was an attempt at revisionist history. It just flopped for me.

It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst","review":"I have to say, after reading the original trilogy and viewing the films, this book was a most disappointing read for me.

I was a little hesitant after reading some of these reviews but didn't find any of the items mentioned in these reviews to be too problematic.I'm a Godfather junky and was looking for more. This book delivered. Winegardner does a great job of fleshing out the characters and really made me understand the characters in much clearer terms. (I liked it enough that I'm going to get his Godfather's Revenge.)It's not Puzo, and unfortunately it will never be. But I found it a good read and would encourage anyone who is on the fence to read it. As long as your not overly sensitive to what I consider mild interpretation differences you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a reference book!","review":"I found this book and thought I would browse thru it. But when I picked it up I found it so fascinating that I read it from cover to cover. If you like political history, as I all my life have, this book is a treasure trove. One literally gets a political history of the the USA in 800 well-written pages, from Washington's time to the present.

In all seriousness, it has become one of my very favorite books on American history. A marvelous retelling of the Also-Rans of History. And a very fair one too. The author happens to be a fairly Southern conservative Judge. Nothing wrong with that, of course, though not what I am politically. Yet he is extremely judicious (pun intended) and objective in his analyses of the candidates. For a southern conservative to say the positive things he said about Hubert Humphrey, for example, shows that he does not have an ideological axe to grind! Again, I just cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is fascinating - and the type of book that is most fun, I think, not to be read at one sitting, but just referred to, now and again, constantly, at 10 pages or so at a time, whenever the mood hits. Terrific job - and my HIGHEST recommendation!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for WWII warplane enthusiasts","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer - the quality of the photographs of gun stations and aircraft interiors (in modern day color!) is rare and truly gives the reader a different perspective. While not presenting exhaustive histories of the different airplanes featured - it is more a \\"coffee table\\" book than a technical reference - they authors have presented an enjoyable overview of the history, characteristics of the planes, fleshed out with personal anecdotes of the gunners who served. Many rare archival documents and photographs are also featured.

One thing to watch is build-up. It can be hard to wash out. It is easier now than it was, maybe shampoos are better now. I also use a clarifier by Suave 2 or 3 times a week to take care of it.

Also Mr. Kessler's interviews are reported in such a \\"jumpy\\" manner, one is never sure who is speaking at any given time.

Kessler focuses primarily on the lives of five people and then throws in some other stories to give the book some length. The content of the book is very scattered. Many times I was left wondering where this guy was going. I personally know that some of Kessler's information is factual, which was a delight to see in print, but some of it I strongly questioned (as have many Palm Beachers). He could have uncovered some great stories if only he had done a little more research. It was worth a few laughs anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"The disappointing \\"Season\\"","review":"Upon picking up this book, I thought I would learn about the interesting and extravagant lives of the rich and famous of Palm Beach. Kessler gets you interested in the characters, but I could do with out the jumping chapters. What struck me most about the book is Kessler's continual coverage of the prejudice against Jews in Palm Beach society. Although mention of this subject is important, I did not appreciate it being shoved down the reader's throat. Kessler uses the book as his soapbox for this subject. If kessler wanted to write about bigotry in Palm Beach, he should have given the book a more explicit title, letting the reader know that Prejudice against Jews is this books main objective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting read but not earthshattering","review":"I initially picked up this book because I thought that life in Palm Beach would make for an interesting story. I was wrong. Dead wrong. Instead I find tales of deceit and lies interwoven to form a web of snobbery, elitism, and low self-esteem. Yes, low self-esteem. For if one really reads betwen the lines and asses the information in Kessler's book, one will find that the people are lacking inmany ways that money cannot fix. Overll the book was interesting. However, I feel that Kessler indeed got bogged down with too much namedropping and with too many vague and uninteresting characters. The story could have flowed a bit better and perhaps would have been more interesting had he gone more indepth about the bigotry that currently inhabits Palm Beach. Still, this was not Kessler's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Palm Beach Insider","review":"Kessler didn't have a friggin' clue what he was talking about -- and I'm IN the book! There's errors a-plenty: A real Palm Beacher wouldn't be caught dead at Ta-Boo; almost everybody in the book except for Donald Trump (and me) lives in West Palm Beach, NOT Palm Beach; the \\"anti-Semitic\\" club of which Kessler writes was, in fact, founded by Jules Bache, a Jew; and the earlier reviewer is right in that an honest-to-god Palm Beacher would never, ever talk to an author. His suck-up to Donald Trump (of whom I happen to be quite fond, in spite of what somebody called his \\"terminal vulgarity\\" ) got him a free ride on the Trump jet and a membership at the Mar-a-Lago Club, where Kessler and his DAR wife are nonentities.

And is Joyce Milton herself qualified to make this judgment? Of course not. While this discourse is passed off as well-researched, one look at the notes and citations shows a limited selection of sources with a clear intention--to topple Chaplin whom Milton simply does not like. It seems as if the thesis of this book was in place well before the \\"research\\" began. Such is the tone of personal invective Milton fobs off as insight. I would never claim that Charlie Chaplin was a saint; no one can reasonably make that assertion about anyone. Unfortunately, Joyce Milton shows how imperfect a writer can be. Sadly for her, she picks up where Kitty Kelly leaves off. Shameful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Did I say trash?Want to know Charlie?

The comedian was hardly a perfect man, and there are things about him even a long-time fan might find bothersome, but much of this biography is trashy and filled with unsubstantiated ugly rumors. David Robinson's CHAPLIN: HIS LIFE AND ART, published twenty years ago, remains the best way to learn about Mr. Chaplin's complex life and work, while Glenn Mitchell's CHAPLIN ENCYCLOPEDIA I have found very helpful. This book is best ignored and forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truely biased Bio. an epic waste of time and money.","review":"I was at first rather impressed by the epic size of the book thinking it must contain something new about the comedian. Well, I was wrong. It was long, tedious and nasty. Granted, Chaplin was not perfect, but the author's preoccupation with his imperfections borders on sickening.

When the lump of coal is award for \\"Most Mean-Spirited Biography,\\" this will win, hands down. I don't know why Joyce wrote it. It's as though she has some old score to settle, or just hates Chaplin. Whatever her problem is, I strongly recommend you avoid this. There are so many other good books out there about Chaplin, starting with the bio by David Robinson. I have more than 100 books on Chaplin. Happy to say, Joyce Milton's is not among them. By the way, I recently had a novel published, \\"Shadow and Substance: My Time with Charlie Chaplin.\\" One of the basic questions I focus on is, \\"How do you judge an artist: by the work he creates or by the way he lived his life?\\" Joyce obviously took the low road.Shadow and Substance: My Time with Charlie Chaplin (A Novel)"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Completists Only","review":"While she does trod some new ground here, Joyce Milton's biography is recommended only for those who have already viewed the original movies, and read David Robinson's definitive biography, CHAPLIN, Charles Maland's CHAPLIN AND AMERICAN CULTURE, Walter Kerr's THE SILENT CLOWNS, and seen Brownlow and Gill's documentary, THE UNKNOWN CHAPLIN. Joyce's emphasis is on Chaplin's politics and relations with women. While these subjects are worthy of study, they are limiting in scope and do not provide a well-rounded portrait worthy of the artist and the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy of her subject","review":"The less said of this book the better.

I've read this book again and again over the years and each time I gain insight into the story of the Compton Family. The Comptons survived the Civil War only to fall victim to their own personal tragedies. This is the story of Caddy as told by her three brothers. Each brother tells his story of his sister in his own words and style. Faulkner's writing is rich in the unique cadance of Southern stories. Faulkner allows his characters to speak in their own voices even when the voice is one of despair or desperation. This isn't an easy novel to read.

You just shouldn't need to have a college professor explaining a book to you to be able to enjoy it. Most people reviews I've read say the first chapter is the hardest.

Admittedly, I had not tackled the gentleman's work before 'The Sound and The Fury,' but, having struggled with this book and having attempted 'As I Lay Dying,' I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that I wasted my money buying the books, that Mr Faulkner's English and writing abilities were dreadful, and that the author's story-lines are incomprehensible. It appears that Faulkner's stories are almost all placed in The South of the United States. I love The South. I fear that William Faulkner and his works, especially this one, have got The South a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book is awful. It is akin to abstract art, in that it is really not art at all.If you like reading random run-on sentences spewed out on paper, this book is for you. If, however, you enjoy books that actually have discernible plots, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to read but quite satisfying","review":"This is a brilliant book, full of rich symbolism and imagery. It is not, however, the easiest to read, but once you get the hang of Faulkner's brilliant style, THE SOUND AND THE FURY flows beautifully and brilliantly through the downfall of a definitively dysfunctional Southern family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Amazing book, can be very confusing and alittle graphic. Will defiantly require multiple reads to fully understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go with the flow","review":"I knew nothing about this book when I started to read it so was a little confused for the first few pages. Then I simply trusted that Faulkner was as good as everyone claimed and stopped worrying about whether I understood it and just let it flow. Then, with each subsequent chapter it made more and more sense. So when I finished it, I went back and re-read the first chapter, so I'd get another layer of understanding from it. I love a book that is a challenge and that really pushes the boundaries of the reading experience. Fabulous - don't worry about what it means the first time, just read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-bear-able","review":"I am an aficionado of classic literature, but the talents of Faulkner remain a complete mystery to me.

It was about a kingdom of people who were so afraid of looking foolish that they went along with whatever they were told.

Beware...apparently you have to ask for a corrected text copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess I'm Just Not a Literary Afficionado","review":"I enjoy good books, and usually even the great works of the masters. This novel was one of the most difficult reads I've ever undertaken. I am not accustomed to waiting through 3/4 of the book to get the most basic clue about what is going on. This is literature but it is certainly not entertainment. Perhaps if I had read Cliff's Notes on this book before hand I might have been better prepared. Faulkner is praised for his experimentation with perspective in this book, and that is fine, but for me it was hard work to slog through it. The first section, told from the perspective of Benjy, a severely retarded man, was the most difficult. A second read would, I am sure, bring it all together for me but I'm not willing to invest any more into this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good book. . . to help you go to sleep","review":"In my opinion this book is horrible. every word in the book left me utterly confused. I have read other reviews here and I see that many people who have read the book say that \\"it's a good book but I needed the cliff notes\\". Well, if it really is a great book it should hace captivated you as the reader and let the words flow instead of reading a section and than have to consult your cliff notes. If you want to read a GOOD Faulkner book, I suggest as I Lay Dying. That book is truely a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"vastly overated","review":"Not as difficult to read as I had expected from all the hype. The problem is that once you understand the complicated way of writing,you realise how little has actually been said.

A case of the Emperor's new clothes I'm afraid, ... just being difficult to understand doesn't make it good ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sound and the Frustration","review":"This is not a book for the casual reader interested in familiarizing himself/herself with the classics. If you enjoy a book that has a narrative that you can understand, then this book is probably not for you.I suppose if you want to really study Faulkner so that you can get in on all of his inside jokes and hidden symbolism, then this book is for you. (The rest of us have jobs and lives outside of the University.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"even teenagers can respect this classic","review":"i am 17 year old, and i do have a greater appriciation for symbolic novels than most of my peers, but any high-school student should have the wit to comprehend this book, with the help of cliff notes. i admit i couldn't have survived the first chapter if i didn't have the notes, but with the combination of the two, as i stuck with the book and watched the story unravel, i was awed. the strength of dilsey, the sympathy felt for caddy and her innocence, the whole book's bold symbolism makes it a classic. ADVISE: try to stick with it, the reading only gets easier, use the cliff notes, and for what it's worth i had more trouble with the second chapter than the first. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it and couldn't even finish it.","review":"It was probably the most confusing book I have ever tried to read. I wondered if it really was that confusing or was I just dense, so I looked up some reviews. It is, by all accounts, very confusing with the jumps in time. I don't mind stretching my brain a little to read a book, it doesn't have to be just pure entertainment, but trying to follow the characters and the jumping back and forth in time and place was just more work than it was worth. I gave up after the first part. I know it is supposed to be one of the best books ever written which is why I chose to read it in the first place, but I'm not willing to work that hard to figure out what the author is trying to say. I'm not a college professor, just a reasonably bright guy who likes to get some enjoyment as well as a learning experience from reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most phenomenal novels ever written","review":"It actually took me 3 tries before I was able to get through this incredible novel. A number of years ago I read the first chapter and was bowled over by it. But I found it quite difficult getting past the first few pages of the second chapter. I tried again last year, starting the book from chapter one and having the same reaction to chapter two.I had given up completely when a friend of mine, who had taken a college course in Faulkner (who, by the way, is my favorite 20th Century author), told me to try it again but to relax when reading it and just let the text \\"wash over\\" me.So I decided to give it a third try. But this time I decided NOT to re-read the first chapter again but to start reading from chapter two. My trick (and my friend's suggestion) worked. I was so rapt with the book that I actually finished reading the book in 3 days.It was truly one of the greatest literary experiences I have ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faulkner Won't suffer from bad customer reviews but...","review":"What does it say about literacy, culture and USA citizen's reading acuity that \\"The Sound and The Fury\\" is garnering one and two star reviews? I find that shocking, dismaying, alarming, you name the emotion, as long as it is negative, and I have it. A sinking sensation about us, our education. This is a work of genius. I've read this book maybe 10 times and it always elevates my writing. Reviewers who denigrate Faulkner seem honest. That is what is terrifying, clarifying, sad, scary, you name the emotion-- as long it isn't a good one--and you get my gist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"Well... Mr. Faulker created here a work of fiction that will stand for all time. For me, the really remarkable portion of this work is the stream of consciousness depiction done from the perspective of Benjy, the man-child. Pulsing with life and swirling with poetry, this portion held me in rapt fascination. Indeed, once we left this perspective, perhaps two-thirds of the way through the book, it was for me a great letdown, and I made my way through the remainder only with effort. However, it's worth the price of admission to revel in this large portion of the work. Faulkner is typically dark in his perspective and savage in his sensibilities, but he is never boring, a brilliant author, all the more so for his achievments from such a sparse and economical line of language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book--but be careful what version you buy","review":"Sound and Fury is a great book, but you should be cautious what version you buy. This one has the Appendix/Cast of Characters that the author added later. Other versions (like the Vintage International) don't include it. For those who have trouble understanding the book, that last Appendix helps quite a bit. Also, this version (The Modern Library College) is not the most attractive. Look at the cover! If such things don't bother you, this is the book for you. But you could find other versions that might be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"Is it fair to write a review after reading only 150 pages? Well, I wanted to like this book. I gave it a shot, but 150 pages in, I couldn't take it anymore and abandoned it on the subway. It's utterly unintelligible. I got the basic gist, but I had no clue about the characters' motivations, their interactions, and I didn't like the fact that in the first 10 pages the author deluges us with something like a dozen characters, none of which I could tell apart, none of which I could understand and none of which I could care about. A great book should be at least a little accessible. The author might have something great to say, but if he can't say it in English, I don't see the point. It's like the Emperor's New Clothes. Everyone says it's a great book, but I'll bet a lot of those who do are only saying it because they're afraid to admit that Faulkner's too smart for them. Life is too short to read lousy books. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure genius","review":"This book revolutionized the way I looked at writing. The idea of writing some of the chapters from the point of view of a person who cannot even speak and who is about on the brain level of a baby is absolutely brilliant to me, as is the fact that Caddy's voice is never clearly known; instead, only her brothers, Benjy, Quentin, and Jason lead the narrations, opening up the forum for so many possibilities of who Caddy really is and what the nature of her sexuality is as it moves from her to her daughter Quentin. The idea of Benjy, running up and down the fence screaming for Caddy, will be with me for the rest of my life and will creep in every time I try to write a page of my own. The title is one of the most perfect I've ever encountered, taken, of course, from Shakespeare: \\"Life is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly one of the best books ever written","review":"A masterpiece of writing, Faulkner's book is also extremely demanding. It took me about three weeks to get through it all, and I had to often reread sections and finally consult booknotes to further explain text. The novel contains infinite rewards, as it is a true character study, the finest of its genre, which deals completely with the history of a family. The first section alone is possibly the greatest, and most demanding, piece of literature ever written, unlike anything else ever written before. The novel as a whole tries to answer a fundamental question: the meaning of life. Is life, as Shakespeare said, merely a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing, or does it truly have meaning? Like all things in life, you must find the answer for yourself. Brilliant in scope and form, it is unlike any other piece of writing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebrate Faulkner Centennial with \\"The Sound and the Fury\\"","review":"Although this year marks the 100th anniversary of William Faulkner's birth, his work remains fresh and startling. The Sound and the Fury, unquestionably the hardest Faulkner to read, is worth the extra effort. Dealing with family relations, the decay of the Southern aristocracy, and above all the triumph of man over his situation, the Sound and the Fury sweeps the reader through the Faulkner landscape into the vortex of human emotion and language. A must read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"I write this review realizing that this book is considered a classic, and people much more intelligent than I consider this book brilliant. But I didn't enjoy reading it. The whole \`stream-of-consciousness' style of writing is very hard to follow (especially coming first person from a mentally handicapped individual). I finished the book only because I hate not finishing books.On a positive note, the last two sections of the book are readable. In fact, the book actually gets somewhat interesting with these two chapters. I can identify with the reviewer who wrote that he felt Jason was his hero in the story. Though Jason was a rotten individual, it was a relief to be able to read something understandable. Now that I know \`classics' can be this bad, I am not as excited to read them as I was before encountering this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I am sorry to say that I could not make any sense out of this book.

I truly do enjoy challenges but i couldn't understand what the heck was going on through most of the first half of the book.I do understand the purpose of Faulkner writing in so many different dialects/styles however it was painful to read. I finally had to set the book aside and read a synopsis of the book to really understand what the heck was going on and even after reading that, I seriously questioned how one could possibly pick up on those nuances from reading the book.This book is impossibly difficult to read and frankly, for what the actual plot ended up being, really not worth it.

All you Faulker fans out there are going to pounce on me, call me an uneducated whosie-whatsit who can't appreciate the genius of Faulker, etc, etc. Here's the thing: the story isn't what I dislike, it's Faulker's writing style that kills me. Every time I read Faulkner I enjoy the story but hate the process of chipping through the layers of Faulkerese to get to it. Honestly, the only reason I'm even rating this is so that Amazon will stop putting him in 'My Recommendations'.To those of you who enjoy him, I salute you.

He wrote his heart out in this book. He always considered it his best work.Difficult reading? This is Faulkner, not Hemmingway. The prose is totally unique, and very typical of his work.

Don't get caught up in the sentance construction. Let if flow and you'll get it.Part three is the reward for wading through part one and two. Jason Compson.

There are some parts of the Quentin section that I will never understand, that Faulkner himself might never understand (he could have been hitting the bottle a little too hard the night he wrote it).

I struggled through the whole thing because it is supposedly a classic. The stream of consciousness style of the the first (and also the second) chapters is certainly painful to read. But even beyond that, the book starts nowhere, ends absolutely nowhere, and has little of interest in between. The characters are not interesting. They don't do anything interesting. Their thoughts, the main feature of the book, are not interesting.

Other Pimsleur products (such as their intro to Albanian) are quite useful. But this product: (1) includes no written material whatsoever -- not even an introduction to the alphabet; and (2) repeats the same phrases endlessly (\\"Do you speak Russian?\\" \\"No, I don't speak Russian.\\") This results in the CDs covering very little material.Much better are the \\"Learn Russian in Your Car\\" series, or best of all, if you actually want to study basic grammar -- \\"Teach Yourself Russian.\\" The latter has kept me busy through 6 months of Russian classes. It comes with a very useful book showing full transcripts of all conversations, along with grammar lessons and practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-Off","review":"This product is okay, if you want to know how to say \\"I don't understand Russian\\" or a few numbers (they don't even give you 1-10 - they skip 1, 6,7, and 10!

The lessons really pound in a few concepts per module, so when you're done your skills won't be broad, but they will be reasonably deep. The other nice thing about this is it's strictly audio, none of this \\"turn to your books\\" stuff, which makes it perfect for a commuter.

Ben Pleasants has a reputation for being a widely published journalist; maybe that's the problem? His Visceral Bukowski is more of an odd collection of unconnected articles than anything else. It is as if Pleasants has raked the obscure to try and pull up something worth telling, but all he could find was tabloid filler. For this reader, Pleasants' Visceral Bukowski is just another one of \\"them\\" - that, for whatever reason, was written to fuel the myth. The more I read of these things the more I become convinced that the only one to truly get below the myth and bring us an honest look at Bukowski was Cherkovski.

However, 3 years down the line it suddenly went \\"click\\" during a call and loud static in the background moved in.I'm recylcing the phone as it can't be used.Also, you can't remove the housing without cracking it or worse. It is very repair unfriendly. I would have liked to check if a wire had gotten loose, but it became pointless to do this because the phone's retro beauty would have been damaged in the process.The problem was the phone itself and not its wall connection.So I'm giving it 2 stars. A land phone that's not mistreated should last for years and years.

If you look at the various sites on lattes, etc., they say that 150 to 160 degrees is the norm. One solution is to get the milk going with the little milk/steam lever in normal position, but then, during the milk cycle, move the lever over to \\"steam only\\" and insert the bottom of the steam delivery nozzle into the cup. This forces the steam into the milk (like a normal espresso machine process) and moves the needle on the thermometer quickly to 150.The downside of this is the inconvenience and cleanup.

In fact, we had regular visits by our neighbors, just for the coffee.But please be warned that these machines do not last and will require major repairs after the warranty has lapsed. Both my machine and that of my neighbors have stopped working, displaying \\"error 8\\" and refusing to do anything other than take up space on the kitchen counter. I realize that things aren't made like they used to be, but for $3,000+ I expect a heck of a lot more than one year's worth of light use.

Getting none of those degrees taught me to write. You learn to write from imitating good writing. If you want to be a writer, then read good writing of the type you'd like to write. I've found a few of technique books to be useful: The First Five Pages, Technique in Fiction, and Self-Editing for Fiction writers. Reading while writing helps a great deal.

This cd really set the stage for teb with hits such as \\"Jumper\\" and \\"How's it gonna be\\" but the best songs aren't the one's on the radio but the one's that capture you and take u away into a dream-world that u have never been to.

(\\"London\\") And of course they have girl troubles (\\"Motorcycle Drive-by\\"). All of the songs are crafted and truthful about how life truly is, the harsh and the good. Reality is the meal of the day, and it is served gourmet style here. With rowdy guitars, and anti-socal lyrics, this is one that diserves all the credit it can get. From the massive volume of \\"Graduate\\" to the quiet angst of \\"Motorcycle Drive-by\\" this album is excillent.

There are the soft and slow songs like \\"How's It Going To Be\\" \\"The Background\\", and \\"God of Wine\\". Mid-tempo numbers such as \\"Narcolepsy\\", \\"Burning Man\\", \\"I Want You\\" and the awesome opener \\"Losing A Whole Year\\". And there are the rockers, \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\" \\"Graduate\\", \\"Jumper\\", and \\"London\\" are among them. \\"Motorcycle Drive By\\" is a heartwrenching song that starts out slow and just explodes after the second stanza. \\"Thanks A Lot\\" and \\"Good For You\\" are similiar.

This CD has been on the charts since March 1997, and continues to hold steady around the middle of the Top 100. Over five songs have been released for airplay, and are consistently some of the most requested and most played on the radio, a true testamant to the CD and to the band. Third Eye Blind has taken subjects like drug use, suicide, and relationships and done for them what so many other people have not, made them mainstream ideas that we can all come to terms with easier, at the same time blending them with very catchy rhythms and lyrics. This CD is truly a unique entry into the over-populated alternative genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Them a Chance!","review":"When I first got this CD I thought that I would be just another sucky CD with a catchy song here and there, but many songs were decent! They could have put some better songs in the end- but that is besides the point- they are awesome. The only ofensive lyrics I can think off are parts from Semi-Charmed life. So to all of you 3EB Haters out there, just calm down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the sun is always in my eyes","review":"Ok..this along with U2's achtung baby are probably the best albums I have. I haven't listened to blue yet but I'm dying to get my hands on it. The singles are nowhere near the best songs on the album -motorcycle drive by is one of the most brilliant songs I've heard. Buy the album. (while you're at it buy achtung baby too)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrics are creative but instrumentation is unoriginal","review":"Third Eye Blind's debut CD deals with numerous heavy topics, atypical of those of a punk/rock band, such as taking cocaine, attempting suicide, weighing the pros and cons of high school graduation under pressure as a decent student or valedictorian, etc. The lyrics are inventive and don't \\"talk down,\\" as it were, to the listener; they seem to convey the true depth of emotion found in the songs' bizarre subjects. Harmonies are scarce, but aren't required for these topics. The instrumentation on the album mainly consists of electric guitar and drums (also scarce). The band doesn't seem to sway from this formula and, as a result, produces some instrumentation that is utterly not memorable. There are always exceptions for every rule, however, and both \\"Jumper\\" and \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\" feature some fine instrumentation. All in all, this is a strong debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have two words for you that tell about this CD:","review":"THE BOMB. This is one of those albums that you don't have to have a CD of to listen to it. Because all of the songs are good, and you don't have to skip to any particular one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I thought this cd was great fresh out of the celophane about 7 or 8 years ago, and even today, every road trip includes this album. It's beautifully irreverent, and tell-it-like-it-is but not IN your face. This is definitely an album to have. The second album Blue has one or two really good songs, and what seemed like a lot of filler. I didn't even bother with the third cd after hearing the second. But the first album is awesome. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall","review":"A good album overall. A few of the songs are a little shouty, but there are far more hits than misses here. Jumper, Burning Man and I Want You are excellent and most of the others are good. I don't regret purchasing it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cd","review":"This is one of the best cd's i own. i love every song on it, and Stephan Jenkins is SUCH an incredible singer. he has such a great voice, and such good range. last year i dropped this cd and broke it, and i was devastated, so i got another one as soon as possible. it's really an awesome cd and i can't wait to get their new one when it comes out this week."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Third Eye Blind Fans: Hold your heads up high...\\"","review":"14 of the best songs that I've ever experienced. GET THIS CD! And when the new album, \\"BLUE\\" comes out on Nov. 23rd, GET IT TOO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover","review":"This album has only a couple of good tracks on it that save it from a one star rating. Most of the songs feel like they have no emotion to them. Still there are a lot worse musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not great","review":"Although there are a few good songs like \\"London\\" and \\"How's It Gonna Be\\", most were not that strong. Most songs were weak on lyrics and music, but it did contain \\"Semi-charmed Life\\" in its entirity, which is never played on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"great at first","review":"This CD is great the first few times you listen to it, but after a while, it just gets really boring. The songs are over predictable and get old real fast. Borrow this CD from a friend but don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insidious piece of work that should have been suppressed.","review":"As an avid music fan and first amendment enthusiast, I try my best to be understanding of styles of music that I am unaccustomed to. However, Third Eye Blind is desperately trying to push the envelope here; how many insufferable lyrics must we listen to before we crack? How many generic songs, all blending together until there is only \\"How's It Gonna Be When I Graduate And Get A Semi-Charmed Life\\", must we tolerate, clogging our airwaves? Where, may I ask, are the bands with musical innovation? Where is the poetry? Does anyone really still like the song after they know the words to Semi-Charmed Life? I was embarrassed for Stephen Jenkins. Boys, put your past away, and get nice office jobs. There is nothing that can save this record aside from the ever-cleansing flame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call me dumb, I bought this album","review":"Semi-charmed Life is a good song. I'll admit that. It wasgood enough for me to go out and buy it. And the rest of the CDreally, really, was nausietingly bad. There should be a support group. \\"We bought this album because we liked Semi-charmed life.\\" Stay away. There are better things, like Nirvana, NIN, Rage Against the Machine, Alice in Chains, KoRn, Smashing Pumpkins, or Pearl Jam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Nonsense","review":"There is nothing Semi-Charming about it. The band that started the 98-99 bad music era. 'Jumper' makes me want to commit suicide. Just some more lame High School popular music. However, if you are a \\"DoAnythingToBePopularAndCool\\" kind of person then buy this album immediatly along with a complete wardrobe by Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap, and Eddie Bower. But for those who like beautiful vocals, melodies, and moods, stay the hell away from this album and have faith for better music in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"How come this CD has a four and a half star rating???","review":"It should have a NO star rating, it is complete SH*T! Why would a band like this become mainstream and popular? What can I say, the masses are usually morons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...no","review":"I really have no problems with this kind of music. For the MTV loving masses out there this must sound pretty damn good. and if they choose to waste money on it well hooray for them. However, i see no reason to subject innocent radio listeners to this garbage nonstop. That sort of thing is unjustified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are so many people losing faith in alt. rock music?","review":"Bands like this are to blame. Everyone and their mother liked \\"Semi-charmed life,\\" but the fact that America demands to hear songs like \\"Jumper\\" and \\"Graduate\\" on the radio really disturbs me. The true test of a song's strength is how well it holds up after repeat listenings, and nobody's songs get annoying faster than TEB's. THERE IS NO DEPTH, INNOVATION, OR TALENT HERE -- just shallow, obvious, radio-ready hits. TEB gives American music a bad name. I didn't buy the album, but I've heard over half of it on the radio/MTV -- enough to know not to waste my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this cd for semicharmed life and jumper but afterlistening to the whole cd i cant believe i wasted 14 bucks on thispiece of plastic junk. this cd s**ks. they have no idea what music is and i hope that anyone that appreciates music doesnt buy this but if you are one of those people who does something cause other people do take a trip to abercrombie and get yourself this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a phrase: Formula Band","review":"This band sounds just like all the others in the same vein: Matchbox 20, Semisonic, Fuel, Goo Goo Dolls, Sister Hazel, and even Oasis. Unfortunately, all have become the darlings of commercial, self-proclaimed \\"alternative\\" (if there is any definition for the moniker now) radio stations all over the country, and lack any truly distinctive sound. Every song sounds the same. I ended up returning this CD to the store. It almost ended up like the Matchbox 20 CD I bought - smashed to bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"It can't get any worse than this!","review":"I went out and bought this cd and found $15 of my money totally wasted. What this cd needs is musicality and not someone who can't sing and desperately needs singing lessons screaming in my ear. Since the music (I shouldn't say music I should say trash) disapointed me I read the lyrics thinking maybe I would find some meaning. The lyrics were totally average and dull. I am not one to complain but this is the worse cd I have ever heard in my entire life!!! As a fellow musician I see this as a disgrace to the industry. In my opinion, either save your money or buy a good rock cd like Bush, Sublime, or Matchbox 20."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP THE ABUSE!!!","review":"This album made my ears bleed. I'd like to chop off the lead singer's head and display it on a stick in my backyard.I think I'd gain more friends that way than making a banal, bland, redundant album like third eye blind.To keep the future generation out of harms way, I hope to god that they never make another album. May god have pity on their souls."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this no stars.","review":"This is by far the biggest waste of money ever. Third Eye Blind is another sell-out in the long list of the late 90's. They arn't uninqe at all. They play with no edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-around Awesome Album","review":"I love this cd. The songs may not have as much meaning as some fans would like to beleive but it is nonetheless a very fun way to spend an hour. Each song offers a different emotion ranging from wonder (Hows it Gonna be) to lust (I Want You) to lonelieness (Motorcycle Drive By). It is unfair to compare this band or album to other bands such as Matchbox20, as the lyrics of 3eb are far more soulful and less formulaeic than those of Matchbox20. Also, people associate this album with the downfall of rock music; I however choose to disagree. This album is simply a display of where alternative music and rock are heading. Its what the people want. Whats wrong with that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep the trash to yourself","review":"There are a many gems on this CD, and while I think that with enough play, they will become repetitve, I respect the fact that others like it. If you don't like it, tell me, but don't call me a drone or just another teen stuck in the rut of popularity. I like this CD because the songs are good, not because my friend told me to like it. Get a life trash talkers, voice your opinion on the CD, not its listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite, but a definite keeper","review":"Everyone knows the big singles, but personally I consider Narcolepsy to be the best song on this album. There aren't any stretches of several bad songs in a row and it has a good mix of fast and slow songs. If you're real conservative you may find some of the lyrics slightly offensive, but not any worse than you'd expect from a rock album. All in all, this is one of the better CD's that I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"This totally earns its 5 stars!","review":"This is possibly the best cd I have ever heard! Its music is awesome, its lyrics are great. This is a cd that is definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums this decade","review":"Tremendous album with a solid, edgy-rock backbeat and intelligent lyrics. A must have for any classic rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"every song was written well","review":"this cd is one of my all time favorites. every single song is a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best!","review":"I don't know how many times I've played this cd, but suffice to say, its a lot. Definitely one of my faves, and its good cos I like ALL the songs on it, not just some. So if you like Jumper, How's it gonna be and all the rest of them, you should REALLY buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album in the history of man kind","review":"This cd, without a doubt, is the best one out there. Most albums have a few good songs, but this one...all 14 of 'em are excellent. My favorite song is Thanks A Lot. Definately the best way to spend your money is on any Third Eye Blind cd, especially this one. Not a damn thing I dislike on it either. It's a good 'en!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album rocks!","review":"This is the best album of all time. I also love their newest one, but out of the two, I would have to say that this one is my favorite. The last 4 songs are the highlight of the whole album. Especially the song \\"I Want You\\". It's got a deep, soulful kind of sound that just put's life into perspective. \\"the village churchyard/there are bones weeping in their graves/a silver lining of clouds shines on people Jesus couldn't save/you wanna know how deeply my soul goes/deeper than bones/deeper than bones...\\" and \\"there will be no regrets when the worms come\\".Other highlights are: The Background Motorcycle Drive By God of Wine Losing a Whole Year Jumper Burning Man...actually, they're all great People say not to buy it because you'll get bored of it: they're stupid. Just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Delight....","review":"My favorite pop-rock/alternative album of the 90's. Every single song is so dam* good even the last hidden track...The album had at least 5 songs that were released on radio and ended up on top 10 charts...The funny thing is that the rest of the tracks that weren't released are the best tracks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 90's Greatest","review":"A lot of cds that feature the same pop/rock music as 3eb, usually don't interest me and are soon forgotten about when something better comes along. This cd is one of the extremely rare ones that doesn't get old, and when every track is worth something. My favorites songs are the last four tracks, even though the whole cd is amazing. Do yourself a favor if you don't have it and pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Get One Thing Straight!","review":"People, you must be on crack if you don't like \\"The Backround\\". It is THE most beautiful song ever recorded. Not the best, but most beautiful. Every song is good EXCEPT for \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\" \\"How's It Going To Be\\", \\"Burning Man\\"<---what kind of title is that...and the lyrics \\"cause i live my life/like a burning man\\"...what in God's name is a burning man?..., and finally \\"London\\". The rest can stay on there. Most of you are too obsessed with the radio played ones...GET OVER IT.I have to admit, 3eb is one of the best albums i have heard in a while, but Smashing Pumpkins still rock. \\"I Want You\\" is beautiful. \\"Jumper\\" is awesome. \\"Good For You\\" kicks. Those are the songs that matter. Not that other crap. Get off of it!If you like ballads, you'll like #'s 4,7,9,11,12,13,and 14. But i suggets you get Nirvana's \\"nevermind\\" instead. And all the SP albums. Then maybe you'll be able to appreciate these guys a little more.-Jeremy M."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best cd i have ever heard!!!!","review":"This was the first CD i got on my birthday, but i had been listening to my friends on the bus, this is the best CD EVER!! I have never found an albulm with as many awesome songs, they are my favorite band in the world. I always listen to it the whole way through, it's amazing!! I suggest this CD to anyone or thing!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best CD ever!!!","review":"Every track is better than the one before it. The songs they did not release are just as good, and in some cases, better than, the ones they did. My favorite tracks are \\"Jumper\\" and \\"Motorcycle Drive By\\". This is an amazing album. Buy it as soon as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!","review":"This CD is the best that I have ever heard. My tastes usually run in R&B and rap but after hearing Semi-Charmed Life and How's It Gonna Be, I had to hear more! I like almost every track and all my family and friends have fallen in love with the CD as well. It was well worth the money I paid for it and would definitely have paid more if I had to to be able to listen to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Eye Blind is up there but i've heard better","review":"This cd is ok, about 5 really cool songs a decent amount. Jumper, semi-charmed life and losing a whole year especially. Buy it if u have money to lose and just want the cd. If you can't choose between it and another--then u should think about it cause it's not THAT great. It's definitely COOL though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better . . .","review":"Some songs on here are great, but overall all of them pretty much sound the same. You may think that you like their songs but don't get this cd. You'll be really dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"hell yeah!","review":"This cd rules! It's hardcore rap all the way! If you are an oldschool hip hop fan you have got to own this cd. Stephen Jenkins is the greatest rapper i have ever heard. If you love rap then you will love Third Eye Blind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to be What they aren't","review":"Ok, first off, when I first got this CD, I have to admit that I loved it. But then it sunk in: these guys are more suited to the sounds of the wretchedly Backstreet Boy sounding \\"I want you\\", than anything else. Try as they might, they're attempts at rock just didn't work. They try to add thought provoking issues and lyrics, where I really don't believe they have any. Honestly, I think they belong more in the pop genre than rock, and could probably make something more of themselves. But, through it all, I have to admit that the instrumental sense of the music is more than there, and they deserve some credit for that. Also, you may as well take the musical tastes of me into account, which include deftones, slipknot, and KoRn, so, of course I am going to discount these guys as rockers. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh!","review":"Granted, this album does have three radio hits. Of Semi-Charmed Life, How's It Going To Be, & Jumper, SCL is the only one that hasn't gotten on my nerves. The rest of the album is really not that good. I used to like 3EB, and I once considered this album to be very good. I then discovered other great bands, such as Radiohead, the Beatles, & U2. If you listen to pop stations on the radio, I am sure you will like this album (although, I believe some songs will be played more than other). Do yourselves a favor, though: check out Radiohead's The Bends."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad album","review":"I only bought this album because of the song \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\". Other than that, all the other songs except for \\"London\\" are all bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF WAX!!!! TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!! NO-STARS!!!","review":"This album is so wack I bought this album hoping for high expectations but I didn't get any. After listening to this album I felt so depressed and I wanted to commit suicide. THIS ALBUM IS DEPRESSING AND STUPID!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It all went wrong...","review":"This could have been a great album. They could have simply released it to moderate radio airplay. But nooooo, we have to be subjected to 2 years of constant 3eb. Then we buy the album, and realize we are already sick as hell of the first six songs, and all the rest are horrible to start with. What a tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phew...for a minute there, I lost myself.","review":"You see, the major difference between this band and lets say...Radiohead is that Third Eye Blind are currently doing things that other people have been doing for years, and radiohead, well no one really understands what they are doing because no one has ever done it before...ever!Its just something that i find quite interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of the same....","review":"You know, it's pretty sad when you are listening to a CD, and your dad yells \\"What is that? It's horrible!\\" but instead of defending it you find yourself agreeing with him! That's exactly what happened to me with this CD. It is incredibly boring, the singer has absolutely no emotion in his singing (isn't emotional connection an essential part of any music?), and by the 4th or 5th song you find yourself wondering if the CD has started over again, because the songs all sound the same. I really like music and try to listen to all different types, but this is one of the few CD's I would have to say I hate. In fact, I gave it away to a friend and I don't miss it one bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"Can I graduate? No you may not. This album receives failing grades from start to finish. It is filled with childish, thoughtless, weak pop songs. Disgraceful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply wretched","review":"You'll wish you were two ears deaf if you ever find yourself listening to this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. Just, No.","review":"Relies on the basic late 90's alternative rock/pop formula, nothing new, nothing exciting. If you're a yuppie who buys what everyone else does, and listens to what everyone else does, which you probably are, then this is for you!If you have any respect for quality music, run away."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd is pretty bad","review":"hit after hit on this record, i told myself, \\"get this cd, it sounds pretty good!\\" This cd is by far the worst cd I own, and I have alot of bad cds (ex: eagle eye cherry). BAD BAD BAD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could have given this a ZERO.","review":"Someone got me this because there are some (not many) bands on the radio that I like. Nickelback is one, but these guys ARE NOTHING LIKE NICKELBACK! Just a horrible band in my opinion, that will be working at a Buger King in a few years probably. No doubt there are college kids with deaf ears buying this, but if you like harder more energized rock, try Nirvana, Fuel, Nickelback, or even Creed, instead of these guys. Big time ZERO on this band...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrically and musically tight sounding CD.","review":"Allright I confess to it, like thousands of teenagers before me I went to the nearest music store to pick up Third Eye Blind off the rack as soon as I heard the catchy, song-of-the-summer hit \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\". And as always, I had the faintest hope deep down that this CD may actually live up to expectations and not disappoint me with being yet another one-hit wonder. But as I drove home listening to \\"Losing A Whole Year\\", the opening track, I found myself bobbing along to the beat and wanting to hear the next track. Well long story short, in a decade of ubiquitous one-hit wonders and fear of sounding original, Third Eye Blind's debut album is a great addition to anybodys CD arsenal. From the opening guitar riff in \\"Losing A Whole Year\\" to the mellow and lyrically tight \\"God of Wine\\" there is something in this CD for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album perfect for listeners who like music that moves you","review":"This album is one of a kind, with lyrics coming from real life, that moves everyone who takes the time to really listen to what they sing, and with music that never becomes predictable or boring-the beat doesn't just go on, but changes all the time. With very talented musicians they change the rythm and chords in a way I don't think I've heard too many times before. Their music is awsome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs, great band, great everything!","review":"WHOO! a truly great CD, i was a tad leery to buy it at first since i knew that Semi-Charmed Life was about drugs, but now i'm really glad i did! it's wonderful! i recommend it tremendously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Eye Blind... AWESOME!","review":"I bought this CD a few years ago. The usual for me is that I buy a CD and play it out soooo bad that i don't ever want to touch it again! But not with this CD. I have played it SO much ever since day 1 and i still love it. Every song, AWESOME. Vocals, AWESOME, guitars, AWESOME, drums, AWESOME. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'd Be Surprised","review":"I had credit with a used CD place, so I bought it used as a good friend of mine highly reccomended it. I admit, I was skeptical as I despise most anything that get's played more than 15 times a day, but if you look past the overplayed released songs, you'll find a lot of great ones that I really like to rock out to. I sing along in the car ALL THE TIME and though my friends sometimes make fun of me, I got them addicted too. \\"Good for You\\", \\"Narcolepsy\\", and \\"Loosing A Year\\" are some of my favorite songs. I suggest checking this CD out, you'd be surprised at how good it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything an album should be","review":"This cd is everything an album should be and much more. Some of the most amazing music anyone could put on a cd. Losing a whole year is incredible. Graduate is a great song to blast in the car. Songs like The Background, Motorcycle Drive-by and God of Wine are some of the greatest songs of our time. Every song on this cd is a pleasure listening to, no matter how many times you hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing short of Awesome","review":"This CD is just plain great. Every song is awesome. It's one of those albums that you can listen to every song on, and not skip anything. The best tracks on this album in my opinion are 'Jumper' and 'Graduate.' The bottom line is, buy this album. It's a great way for Third Eye Blind to debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"They should win an award for this album","review":"WOW!! Usually when I buy a CD for one song it's the only good one, seems the rest of the songs suck. Not even close with Third Eye Blind! I liked Semi-Charmed Life and that was why I bought it and I was happy to find I liked the entire CD. Seems with these guys they only get better and better. This CD should really get 6 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not ground-breaking, but still fun","review":"This CD is a lot of fun to listen to. Third Eye Blind for the most part is making music that is just fun. They aren't great writers or musicians, but if you just want to put on a CD for a party, or while cleaning your house, or just chilling, this one is good. I disagree with some who said all the songs sound the same. \\"Graduate\\" \\"London\\" and \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\" are fun meaningless rockers while \\"Background\\" \\"Motorcycle Drive-by\\" and \\"God of Wine\\" are thoughtful, edgy ballads of a sort. There's a good range here, so don't expect the rest of the album to sound like what's been played on the radio. P.S. In concert they were pretty bad. They didn't sound nearly as good (probably because their album was well-mixed and produced) and they didn't seem to enjoy themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love it! I did!","review":"Third Eye Blind is a really dope band. I have been to one of their concerts and let me tell you they sound even beter in real life. A few of my favorite songs on this album are \\"Jumper\\" and \\"Semi-charmed life\\". This a great buy and a long time of good listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album with 9-10 hit songs and extreme musical talent","review":"I have never been so impressed with a debut album. The musical talent is immense with Hargreaves on drums and Cadogan on guitar. The songs range from highly energetic with Graduate or London to pensive, beautiful ballads like Motorcycle Driveby and God of Wine. Notice I did not even mentiont he two radio songs? All have hooky melodies and a richness and texture that is unbelivable from bass, guitars and drums. A great live band. Expect much more in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"One of the prize CDs in my collection. Get the singles as well if you can find them they each have an unreleased song, the two singles released so far are \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\" and \\"How's It Gonna Be?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweetness","review":"This has got to be the best music ever. I have an extremely eclectic music collection but this is my favorite CD. \\"How's It Going To Be\\" \\"Thanks A Lot\\" \\"Burning Man\\" \\"Motorcycle Drive By\\" and especially \\"God Of Wine\\" are the absolute best songs on here. This is great each song is distinct and entrancing. 3EB is a great band with great music all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb. Best CD of the past few years.","review":"Aside from all the popular songs on this CD, the ones you don't hear on radio are just as good if not better. My favorite is \\"I Want You\\". Terrific melodies and lyrics. I have their song book also and love playing along the CD. If you don't have this CD, trade in any four CDs for it and you'd never regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album never comes out of my car cd player!","review":"I too, have had this album since it came out. I really liked their radio songs. But I was blown away by the other songs on the album, primarily \\"Motorcycle Driveby,\\" \\"Background\\" and \\"Losing a Whole Year.\\" The lyrics on these songs are so fantastic--it's impossible for me to NOT sing along. I highly recommend this album to anyone who is looking for an album you can play through from start to finish, and for anyone who really appreciates the lyrical content of music. 3eb is not my favorite group but this truly is one of my all-time favorite albums. Blue was mediocre but I am really looking forward to their new release in May."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a great cd, no matter how many times you listen","review":"Third Eye Blind would have to be one of the best albums ever. No matter how many times a day you listen to it it never gets old. I didnt even start listening to it until a few months ago, but i wish i had started sooner. Once the first sone \\"losing a whole year\\" kicks in you are almost sucked in with great hook after great hook. Not only is the sound great but the lyrics are amazing. It makes you wonder how a human brain can think of all of these thoughts. They make you think and smile and cry. My favorite song would have to be \\"The Background\\". Stephans voice captures exactly what he is feeling. Other greats are \\"motorcycle drive by\\" \\"god of wine\\" \\"i want you\\" \\"narcolepsy\\" and i could go on forever with this list. Just make sure to get this cd if you dont already ahve it. It will always be the best cd ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget about Jumper and Semi-Charmed Life","review":"Initially I thought that Third Eye Blind was yet another post-grunge, disposable KROQ \\"modern rock\\" band. In a way they are, but that's mostly because radio stations replay their top 40 hits ad nauseum. However, it's the tracks that DON'T get played on the radio that make this a great album. I Want You, The Background, Motorcycle Drive By, and God of Wine are stunning tracks of lyrical intensity and heartfelt emotion.

In the Sixties, there were Herman's Hermits and the Dave Clark Five; in the Seventies, Grand Funk Railroad and Manfred Mann's Earth Band; the Eighties had Flock of Seagulls and Men at Work; Third Eye Blind is right at the top of that wretched pile for this decade.

This kind of Matchbox20/GooGooDolls/FMLiteAlternative/easymacmusic is not what the airwaves need (we can only hope that things change...)Compare this record to microwaveable macaroni.

So I heard more songs and they were okay. Then I heard London and I thought that song was very good also. So I am telling you that there are some good songs on this CD.

I've never heard alternative rock guitar any heavier! Every song is heavy eccept for \\"I Want You,\\" which is pretty cool and mysterious just the same. \\"The Backround\\" was once my favorite song of all time.

The research and the constant cow comaparisons got old very quickly. The relationship that Jane was in lasted what, 5 minutes, and we are supposed to believe it destroyed her whole life?

It's easy to read and has a lot to say about relationships. Should be required reading for both men and women."},{"rating":"2","title":"i wish i had read this book earlier","review":"Having just suffered the pangs of a breakup this past week and having this book on my \\" must read\\" list for 2 months now- I wish I had read it earlier- I might have cried less and used less tissues. This was a cute book- interesting theory about men, and bovine behaviour- and it offered some insight about the opposite sex. However-I did find some style problems with this book- apparent at the begining and less noticible as the novel went on. What stylistics quirks, ( for example, ending some chapters with a sentence in parenthesis, and lots of quotes from various psychological/anthropological experts) annoyed me at first, became almost charming as I continued to read. A valiant wonderful first novel. I hope to read her again, should she decide to publish again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly answers the question \\"How do I get over him?\\"","review":"I had a traumatic breakup in the middle of last year. A lot of Zigman's observations are similar to mine. I agree that somehow people have to get over it and basically do \\"whatever it takes\\". She took up cow studies. I took up kickboxing and golf. But that's where the similarities end. She didn't reflect sufficiently on the essence of really getting over him. That last chapter when she says it's over when she says it over should have been explored further. Zigman could have got more mileage out of that and made Jane Goddall more thoughtful and introspective. Nonetheless it was quite a fair first attempt. I hope her next work about dating Big Bird will actually hit the nail on the head."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderfully funny look at a fact of life","review":"The other reviews astound me. Stop taking this book so seriously. It is not a handbook on dealing with a breakup, it is a VERY funny look at one woman's way of coping with her relationship. I laughed out loud many times, and nodded in agreement at most of what Zigman writes. This is such a treasure of a book. I have not just been dumped, but this book brings back memories of when I had. I think everyone that has ever been in a relationship can see aspects of themselves throughout. I can not wait until she writes again. I really enjoyed reading every page of this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"While Ms. Zigman writes a snappy text in her first book, the content itself was nothing we have not read before. Men are pigs (or bulls) who leave women when the novelty wears off. The Cow theory is merely designed to make the whole premise seem new, but the whole book deals with no new territory.I found the book hard to recommend and hope Ms. Zigman's next book does not waste her witty writing on mediocre content like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book! Bad ending","review":"I thought that Animal Husbandry was a very good book. Especially, the little similarities between bulls, man and other members of the animal kingdom. I had a hard time putting down, unitl I reached the last chapter...Though insightful, thoughtful, witty, and frightfully similar to my own life, I felt the book only had one flaw...the ending. Unless Laura wanted the story to come \\"full circle\\", where the characters ended up almost exactly where they all started. Maybe being an American I wanted a happy ending.(?) Pulling for Jane to finally find happiness, even if it was in an unusual place (Eddie). But for the last chapter to start out with \\"Well what did happen to everyone...\\" was a bit of a let down. But entertaining and hunorous all the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"from the phrase \\"old cow-new cow\\" the reader can infer all that will be said on the subject by the author. these are not exactly new concepts. i kept waiting for some enlightened, original twist to come along. and waiting. and waiting. just read the back cover of the book and you've pretty much got the jist of it. perhaps this could have been excused if the plot were interesting or the dialogue snappy or the characters likable. i wasn't expecting to be astounded by a profound and enlightening modern classic and i realize this probably wasn't the author's aim. but i was expecting to be entertained in a brigid jones's diary kind of way. this book did not even accomplish that."},{"rating":"1","title":"unoriginal and only mildly amusing","review":"One of those books you can read fast on a plane trip, skipping a page here and there, and not miss anything important.

It feels very familiar and it doesn't offer any new concept or view. It doesn't add anything new to this category of fiction. It takes easy and cheap shots at men and relationships. While, there are moments of fun and humor, it just doesn't string together with enough force. I am a fan of Laura Zigman's \\"Dating Big Bird\\" and was excited about this book.

It is a funny, cleverly written book depicting dating life in the 90's. No, it doesn't paint the nicest picture of men, but its all in fun! Beginning each chapter with \\"scientific\\" animal data and later incorporating this into the upcoming chapter(s) had me in stitches. And, if you stick with the book, the end doesn't quite turn out how you would think. Enjoy the book, don't read into it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One trick pony","review":"If you've been unlucky in love (and who hasn't), you'll probably find a book like Animal Husbandry a good cure for the blues. A book LIKE Animal Husbandry, but NOT Animal Husbandry itself. This book was a one trick pony. The author states her initial premise early on, but then never develops it or the characters. I kept waiting for her to flesh out her old cow/new cow theory, but instead she kept repeating the same joke page after page, chapter after chapter. I wanted to laugh, but the book just wasn't funny. I wanted to cry, but I just didn't care about the characters. The strength of this book was supposed to be its witty commentary and snappy dialogue, but I found the whole thing trite and predictable. So obviously based on the author's real life that it was painful to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book on cow behavior might be more interesting","review":"While some of the facts about cow behavior and how it \\"might\\" relate to humans and their relationships had some interest, there just wasn't much after that.

Second, if he's cheating on someone else with you , it's most likely that he'll cheat on you with someone else. Maybe I'm a cynic, but that seems pretty obvious - to Jane it's this major revelation.The obviousness and unbelievablity of the characters and situation crowded out most of the successful aspects of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"This book really didn't work for me on any level. I tried to find it funny, but didn't. I tried to feel sympathy for the narrator, but couldn't.

I found the book mostly repetitive, unbelievable and unfunny."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"After reading the \\"Brigid Jones' Diary\\" I found myself browsing in the New Fiction section of my local bookstore for something similar. I was assured that \\"Animal Husbandry\\" would be what I was looking for, and let me assure you now, it certainly was not. The main character, Jane, is an insipid, weak, paranoid and shallow person, whose hardly traumatic break-up plunges her into the depths of self-absorption the like of which I have not seen since Sylvia Plath. The \\"old-cow, new-cow\\" theory is trite and unoriginal and is really just an excuse for truly examining the intricacies of intimacy. Not to mention the Jane Goodall scenario is completely implausible. This is a book that a fourth grader might appreciate for its low humor; however, any woman who's ever been seriously involved in a relationship will have little to no patience for the simplistic categorizations of romance Laura Zigman has created."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH!","review":"Animal Husbandry may very well be one of the worst books I have ever read! I had to literally force myself to finish this book. The constant scientific theories were utterly BORING! I have read many of the books in this genre (Bridget Jones, Girls Guide, etc.) and I expected this one to be just as good. It was not even close. The characters are boring & there is not any great character development. The writing style was poor & makes me wonder how this book was even published. The ending was extremely unfulfilling & I could care less what happened to the \\"heroine\\" of the story. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! It is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I applaud the effort","review":"It reminded me of an essay and was way too repetitive.It made me uncomfortable how willing she was to wallow in her misery when the guy obviously wasn't worth it.

I just don't see how moping and obsessing for a year while referring to yourself as a cow helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"get a life","review":"Yes, most of us can probably relate to Jane's dilemma of getting dumped after a short but intense affair. It is a challenge, however, to sympathize with someone who whines about it for the next 300 pages. Her theories are hardly new, and her character is hardly likable. In fact Jane is a person with no thoughts, other than those devoted to figuring out why her loser \\"boyfriend\\" dumped her. She has no family history, virtually no friends and no interests, other than drinking, smoking and complaining about men. The dialogue is laughably bad and I found myself digging very hard to find Ms. Zigman's acclaimed wit.It's difficult to believe that a book with such a flimsy \\"plot\\" and virtually no character development could be published. Did Ms. Zigman's editors actually read this junk?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The bitterness and the cynicism.. rivaling even Eliot","review":"Stan Rice's sardonic bitterness rivals even that of Eliot's 1922 masterpiece, \\"The Wasteland.\\" This expansive volume of his work includes numerous examples of the extreme exhaustion and weariness of life that echoes throughout Rice's work. Poems like \\"Poem on Crawling into Bed: Bitterness\\" are exemplary of Rice's style, his bitter cynicism and his often-times harsh sarcasm. Also common to Rice's work is a rich imagery of animals, gods, and angels. But he uses these with a twist, and an often cynical one at that. He uses these images in an effort to understand the nature of humanity: where we've come from, where we are, and what we've done wrong. Rice's masterful use of language, metaphor, imagery, and unexpected rhyme make his work a pleasure to read, and his themes are universal ones that demand to be dealt with. Rice attacks these issues head-on with a harsh and bitter sense of consciousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great record, but disappointed in the \\"digital remastering\\"","review":"This CD was remastered from a vinyl master, not the original tapes.

The pencil appeared to be one with a hard lead because the indentations on the pages were deep. These markings acted as disruptions in the content and ruined its reading for me.

I grew up near the Adler family in Boulder, CO and witnessed the emotional damage inflicted on children by the authors of this book. By choosing the role of observers rather than parents, the Adler's coddled and encouraged socially destructive behavior in their daughter and her friends. Instead of intervening when children did the nasty things that children often do (as any responsible parent would), they took notes while allowing cruel behavior to escalate. Thus, the behavior they observed was distorted, if not fabricated, by their parental absenteeism. More disturbing, they subjected unknowing children to unnecessary manipulation and trauma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total [poop]","review":"These \\"researchers\\" used the most unethical and unscientific methods to obtain their results.

This action thriller had beautifully poignant moments that I actually teared up at one point.I can't wait to curl up with more novels from this author.Not to give anything away but the ending was terrific!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly writtten.","review":"This book is completely a work of fiction. The characters are poorly constructed; there seems to be large gaps while reading. The author use of proper pronouns makes you believe you are reading a Dick & Jane 1st grade reader. I do not recommend this selection, unless you what to throw your money away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Skrowaczewski's Bruckner is magnificent. His control of color is wonderful. Check out the glorius, radiant sound of the strings in the slow movement and how the woodwinds weave lyrically through them. Contrast this with the rugged energy and power of the scherzo. His tempos are well chosen too. Not too fast (rarely a problem in Bruckner!) but also not too slow. Just about the best Bruckner 7 you can get at any price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree","review":"I must agree with all hands here. In fact, the reviews (and ... price)convinced me to try this cd. I know the conductor from his Mercury lps from the '60s and more recent, excellent Shostakovich 10th, but I didn't expect such a generous, warm,beautifully played Bruckner 7th as this. I place this with my favorites: van Beinem/Amsterdam (Dutton), Furtwaengler/Berlin (1949 Dahlem recording), Jochum/Dresden (the recent EMI box), and the excellent Tinter recording on Naxos.Someone new to Bruckner now has the ability to collect the most popular symphonies in recordings that cost far less than comparable lp sets of bygone years -- and without the side breaks. Now that is progress!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, it's worth waiting for a box set","review":"I really like this show, the animation, the kickass theme song, and it's not as weird as Teen Titans was.

I find myself critiquing the changes that TV people felt they had to make in order to bring the Legion to the small screen, and it makes it hard to actually enjoy the good parts. Why does Brainiac need to be a robot/cyborg/whatever?The full season might be worth getting - unless you want to send TW a message - but stay away from the scams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you Time Warner","review":"This DVD is probably the reason why we have LSH toys at McDonalds this month.....It's a shame that they didn't take this opportunity to release the entire first season of the show.I'll be doing my best to wait for THAT set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for full season set","review":"I agree with the others. I'm waiting for full season sets. I know they will be released at some point. Warner Bros. did this exact same thing for Justice League Unlimited. Not falling for it this time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is SO Cynical","review":"The only reason Time-Warner continues to put out this one disc/three-four episodes nonsense is to snare small children, who will needle their parents into making the impulse buy. The adult fans of these shows already know to wait for the inevitable box sets. This is aimed squarely at kids, who don't have the ability to discern what a bad deal it truly is. Shame on you, Time-Warner."},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously , do NOT buy this item. support full season sets","review":"I agree with some of the other writers here. If you buy this dvd you are supporting Warner Bro's and their consistant greedy bonehead decisions to constantly release these 3-4 episode per dvd items. It's ridiculous and a RIP OFF!! YOu can get the entire seasons of the Batman for no more that 15 bucks right after the season ends..but this cartoon you get only 4 episides for the same price and its also WB. Greedy.

True fans..I know you agree...represent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Does Warner Keep Doing This?","review":"I hate that Warner keeps doing these one disc/3 or 4 episode releases for their cartoon series first and waiting years to do full season releases.

Warner, for the love of all that is holy, put out a Season set of 13 episodes on 2 discs please. Just like you (eventually) did for Teen Titans and The Batman. This 4 episodes on a disc for 10 bucks is lame.But not as lame as 4 10 minute Krypto episodes for 10 bucks.

The days of getting 2 or 4 episode per purchase died back with the VHS, except with animation. The reason is simple, parents will pay to keep their children happy. So Kids WB knows that offering this in volume will make them more money then offering it as a full season set. Similar volume sets were offered with Justice League,Batman and Superman the animated series. Later they offered those series as box sets. A true fan of the series can risk it and wait and see if the season set will be offered in 2 years but if its not they might find that the volume sets are out of print by then.I think that all animation should be offered in season sets and not piece mealed out in volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will be returning this item","review":"I will be returning this item to the vendor.

Any repeats are worthwhile in this helpful book, however, that ranges from the simple but classic library in the last home of legendary decorator Nancy Lancaster to the stark utilitarian dressing room/closet in the New York loft of designer Bruce Bierman. Work by interior designers Bunny Williams, Christian Badin, David Anthony Easton, Tom Fleming, Mariette Himes Gomez and Mario Buatta are shown along with architects Hugh Newell Jacobsen, Peter Pennoyer, and John Tackett, among many others.

I guess they really identify with the jealousy he feels toward the cat and the fear he feels when he's lost. They squealed with joy about the ending. From an educational standpoint, I like the book for the map on the last page--good for early map reading skills.

This brand is SOOOOO comfortable, I just couldn't resist the price since they had it in stock for my size for the low price. When I received them.. they are alot more narrow in the foot bed than my first pair, and I wear a wide. They look wider in the picture.. not that they are tight, just that they hug the foot so they aren't a \\"big\\" shoe like my first pair. They also are VERY strappy (the straps are thinner than they appear in the photo) .. I mention this because I am sure they will leave interesting marks on my feet after a summer in the sun.. if this bothers you take this into consideration. My first pair have a sunburst pattern that has left a mark on the top of my foot that is still there a year later. If you get them for a major discount, it is definitely worth it for the comfort, but I would not have paid full price, or even 50% off for this style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough but Slow","review":"I have many yoga DVDs. This one has a ton of options and is, therefore, worth the price. The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that it does not flow as quickly as some of my more favorite tapes (my fave being Rodney Yee, Colleen Saidman, and S. Deason). It is rather slow with little breaks between the poses (probably so the poses can be spliced into other routines). However, the stretches and poses are deep and long enough to really feel good during, after the routine, and for the rest of the day or night. Although not in my top ten list, I would definitely recommend. I've been practicing yoga for 3 or 4 years, am in my 50's, and consider myself intermediate at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"Anyone who says that Yoga isn't a tough workout, clearly has never done it.

But if you also look at the full answer description you'll find that the answer truly was \\"c\\". This will be very confusing as the answer key and answer explanation page are two different things. Always double check or you'll end up more confused then when you started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another review book.","review":"This is a horrible review item...many of the problem types (especially math) were not ever tested on the ASVAB. Never did I answer a question about \\"Which gears will be rotating in the same direction\\" yet every practice test contains 2-4 questions of this type. The real ASVAB is much more difficult, and this book prepares you for an average score at best.Another example is the section on assembling objects. It tells you the types of questions the ASVAB tests you on, and then gives you completly different types of problems.I'm giving this book two stars (instead of one) because the CD-Rom was nice to use, but really didn't ask good questions. Another reason for two stars instead of one is that I took the CAT-ASVAB, and who knows, maybe the paper and pencil version of the test is similar to practice tests in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Plantain!!","review":"I was really excited to find plantain flour.

The tone is very clear and has great resonation.It includes a seat strap, some wire cleaners, a hand rest and two bocals.Anyone who is interested in learning bassoon or continuing to play should get this one.

Written very conservatively, the book slowly climaxes with a series of haunting revelations. It is ultimately a gripping and enlightening book. It was very influential to me when I was figuring out how our nation really operates. The CIA and United States are not the good guys. They never have been. McGehee's book is a strong antidote to the fairy tale nationalism that American children have been steeped in.What McGehee went through just to publish his book is worth its own book. The CIA went to great lengths to try to prevent the publication of his book, and he receives their harassment to this very day.Ralph is a great man who is doing his part to stop the killing of the innocents.

If you buy them, be prepared to exercise your patience to the max. They provide too many screws which are similarly sized with no clear direction as to their use. Even when you do figure out which ones to use where, they don't go in correctly (especially in the ring around the light)! The fan has to be one of the poorest I have installed from an engineering perspective. Once they are installed, they perform decently - they are quiet. However, had I known what a pain it was to do the installation, I would have purchased another brand altogether. For the price paid for these fans, I would say they are not worth it. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good till it breaks","review":"I've had mine for 2 years when the receiver stopped working.

One was installed hardwired with no wall switch to over-ride the controls. Unfortunately, as others have written, the remote does not always work. This has made turning the fan OFF very difficult. It once took me almost an hour to turn the fan off (pressing the off button once every 5 minutes). Both of my fans have experienced this problem. It's completely random.

I am not terribly knowledgable about this era in history, so I found the background, timeline, and cast of characters to be extremely useful (and entertaining).My only, very minor, gripe about the book (and what keeps me from giving it 5 stars) is that it needed more maps. I had to use an atlas to gain a better understanding of the text. While not bad in itself, trying to reconcile the ancient names with the modern ones was distracting, and trying to pick through a detailed map took too much time. I was most of the way through chapter VI before I came to the one map of routes through the Alps that was included - references to this one as well as more maps would have also been useful.However, I still HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice read for, military, history and non-history buffs","review":"Prevas educates the reader with his first-hand approach to Hannibal's journey across the Alps. Prevas, who traced Hannibal's route on foot, takes the reader to where Hannibal and his troops slept and examines how the military genius used skill, geography and luck. Great color photos, maps and summary of historical figures of Hannibal's time. A history written with the quality similiar to Stephen Ambrose. A great read for those who love history and/or the military."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Pimsleur","review":"I'm sure there's lots of good information in this course, but it is set forth in an extremely difficult to use manner.

The songs on \\"Hardware\\" are over all strong, especially \\"Easy rocker\\", \\"She's got everything\\" and \\"Rock city\\" that is similar to AC/DC's \\"Overdose\\". The vocals are in fact also very Bon Scott-like. At this time Krokus had a more raw sound, but became more polished a few years later. This album should be a real treat to any fan of traditional heavy metal á la Accept, Saxon, Iron Maiden among others."},{"rating":"2","title":"12","review":"Absolutely a great work of art!!

This is NOT \\"12 Angry Men\\". Not anywhere near it. The makers of this movie missed the main point!

Yes it is like 12 angry men (one of my favorite films) but 12 goes off in a direction and much deeper than previously explored in the former. I also think this film has a greater reach in its humanity and is far more existential. Acting, directing, and writing were flawless. Drama with a bit of psycho drama.

It is not for the weak of heart; it has both graphic sexual and violent content, however they are presented in an artful (if not at all times tasteful) way. Although the plot may be difficult to follow if you're not devoted to the story, it is well worth it if you have the patience to overcome the somewhat obscure vocabulary used in the book; however, I feel that Calder's lyrical form of narration and description, founded upon his obscure but far-reaching vocabulary are one of the book's most endearing qualities. Anyone who wants a good challange, who enjoys sci-fi or who likes books which take unexpected twists and turns, finally concluding in an unforseen ending will enjoy this book immensly."},{"rating":"2","title":"sex and death linked in cyberThailand, futuristic clubland","review":"These books are a obssesive read, once in you have to finish. Calder's world sucks you in, just as the Meta girls, boys and things suck life out of each other. Don't try to conciously keep details in mind, rather let them swirl and mingle until you can smell a Doll or see a Elohim out of the corner of your eyes.

This book has everything -- from raw sex filled with Freudian imagery to unadulterated tales of conspiracy and murder. But when push comes to shove, it is a beautiful tale of true love. True love in a STRANGE, STRANGE world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the original","review":"My mom got this for me for Christmas not long after it came out. We both figured that since the first one was alot of fun, the second should be just as good. I was wrong. The gameplay is nothing like the first. Instead of finding Heart Containers to build up your life and buying new equipment, Adventure of Link is more like an RPG. You have to kill enemies to get experience points, and you can learn spells. The game itself also is a bit more difficult. You have 3 lives and once you loose them, that's the end. You can continue just like before, but you restart at Hyrule palace, and Hyrule has become alot larger.Overall, the game mechanics really are not that great, but if you are into building your character more, then give this game a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I love these lamps.

As far as the person who can't fit these into their dishwasher, I have no idea what kind of dishwasher they have but I have never had that problem.

I guess since Rusty to the Rescue is no longer availible, this tape is good to get. Meanwhile, the new story, Gordon and the Gremlin has to be one of the worst Thomas stories of all time. It is about Gordon, who is supposedly being haunted by a Gremlin. But the gremlin turns out to be Sir Topham Hatt's mother's dog.

Yet within a day of using the new stuff, the inside of my mouth was entirely covered in canker sores. I even got one on my lips, a first. It took a few days for all of them to go away, but this is obviously not the same toothpaste as before.If a company changes a formula on something like this, that should be made clear.

In 1938, a year before the outbreak of World War II, the manager for a wealthy German Jewish family sets up an account at a Swiss bank under an assumed name (a so-called Treuhand account) so that if the Nazis invade Switzerland, they would not be able to confiscate the assets of Jewish account holders. Both the family patriarch and the manager perish during the war and by the dawn of the 21st Century, the account has grown to over $[...] Million in value and the heirs to the fortune have never been told of the account's existence.This sounds like the setup for a dull work that would be of interest only to accountants.

Tomasky described this book as a hatchet job. State of a Union is far from a negative attack on the former First Couple, and actually paints a more sympathetic portrait of the Clintons than their most fawning sycophants usually do. State of a Union is little more than fluff but gives a good overview of a complex and nuanced political partnership.

I say the doctored view is of Hillary, because Bill is a bit player in this book. According to Oppenheimer Hillary was the puppet master all along, keeping Bill in the marriage and adhering to the \\"Plan\\", a phrase he uses as practically equivalent to the \\"Final Solution\\". With no real insight into either Clinton, with no evidence except second-hand stories from women also involved with Bill and campaign workers, Oppenheimer concludes that there is no real love in the Clinton marriage, only a power arrangement. As if because two people sharing real world goals precludes love and warmth.

But I now feel compelled to adjust that harsh opinion in light of the most recent unprincipled attacks on her. Like many politicians, and many people, there are things in Clinton's past that are a bit unseemly when seen in the full light of day. But all judgements are relative, and the vitriol of too many people on the (far) right seem far worse than anything she has done, and she has to her credit accomplishments far greater than the author of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rupert Murdoch Hit Job","review":"The book is full of National Enquirer type gossip. All unsubstantiated or substantiated through questionable sources. People will be talking about the alleged ethnic slur but a close look at the story shows the whole thing was orchestrated by the usual Murdoch network as a hit job on Mrs Clinton to derail her campaign. First it appeared on Drudge Report, then Murdoch owned NY Post and then Murdoch owned FOX \\"news\\"(we distort, you decide). I can't help but wonder how much Rupert Murdoch paid the Frays to refresh their memory after 26 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit Her With Your Worst Shot","review":"How could anyone publish such an unnecessary book? If this is Mr. Oppenheimer's best weapon to try to bring down Hillary and stifle her bid for the US Senate, he has failed and miserably so. His approach is cunning yet his execution falls flat.

What if you don't want to become a lady like they were in the 1900's. What if you don't want to become 'beautiful' like they said, with the big ugly dresses and dancing and knitting and so on.

The writing style is pretty archaic and veers toward the preachy quite often and never struck me as charming or whimsical.The content is also questionable and best and harmful at most. Some of the anecdotes are painfully out of date, such as the girl arguing with her mother about hemlines on homemade dresses and such. As a child, I found it difficult to relate the old-world moral lessons to the world in which I was living. So much for being practical.This book includes gems of wisdom including exhortations to not be too friendly with boys and laugh too much at their jokes or they will never want to marry you. Also, all proper godly girls will like the exact same things and if you're not very feminine, well sorry! God only likes girly girls and godly men won't want you. While striving to be a godly woman is an excellent thing, find out about godliness from the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling Account of the Shameful Truth","review":"This compelling story is made all the more so because it is so clearly an authentic, first hand account.

Kathy could have quit at any time. She surely wasn't personally benefitting from the fight. The courage and commitment she demonstrated is inspiring.Anyone who faces a similar situation and cannot look the other way should read this account and learn from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have Got to be kidding!","review":"I am outraged that anyone would publish such an apparent conglomeration of trash. Even at it's worst, in this politial climate, no government agency would allow the claims made by this so called author to happen. Sure there is a grain of truth, but that is followed by a thousand pounds of manure. Furthemore, dispite all the recommendations made and all the investgations, not one government report confirmed that any of the tageting was racially motivated. The author failed to mention that many of the people doing the job that she attacked are minorities. I don't think after all these years of struggle they like being refered to as working in \\"Fort Negros\\". I think that she is just looking to make a quick buck from a very sensitive topic.

A rambling on collection of qoutes and supposed evidence taken out of context. Seems to be a troubled individual, jumping on a band wagon all the way from Atlanta to Chicago. If what this author says is true, she needs to learn how to write a book on a subject such as this, including opposing views and verifiable sources. You don't kill the flock to get to the wolves! I can't believe a publishing company actually spent the money on this, was there even an editor to do spell check? I'm glad I borrowed a copy instead of buying one.

So there is evidence of Grapow aiming to reach the same heights. Although multidimensional and full of fresh ideas\\" Kaleidoscope\\" leaves the same impression of an average album just like the Seventh Sign did five years before.

The version I read was an English paperback published in 1963 that I found on the \\"read and return rack\\" at the Eugene library. I had never heard of the author but liked the look of the nearly 50 year old paperback with its price in shillings and pence.Julian Symons creates the classic upper class murder with limited suspects.

His novel gives an insider's look at how espionage, infighting between scientists and bureaucrats and power politics can affect our space program.Readers who revel in technology will be satisfied by the authenticity of the science, but Reid never lets technology override the human factors that drive our Astronauts and NASA in their quest to conquer the frontier of Space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traveller's must have!","review":"If you wish to travel around the globe without worrying about what you'll unconsciously show with your body language, get that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Thumbs up!\\"(U.S.)","review":"Very helpful, amusing,well-organized, and no unnecessary information.

When it says \\"You . . . [think or do something grossly out of character for the reader] it creates (in this reader, at least) a distracting cognitive dissonance.The blurb on the front cover calls the book \\"blindingly funny,\\" a great overstatement. There are a few laughs, perhaps the choicest of which is 'you' leaving a Coney Island trout under the top sergeant's pillow (clearly an unwise thing, which I would never have done)All in all, a great disappointment.watziznaym@gmail.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark fantasy","review":"As a huge fan of military novels, I picked this one for a pack of summer vacation reading.What a disappointment! Clearly the author knows nothing factual about the military beyond what he must have picked up at campus protest meetings.How can a story set in the eighties portray army personnel who have been drafted (draft ended in the early 70's)?This sounds like the wet dream fantasy of a fevered flag-burner.I give it a one star rating because clearly there will be those who share this anti-American view but even then a point should be subtracted for defaming the name of the glorious Buffalo Soldiers of the Civil War (or maybe the author is too dumb to know of the first all black enlisted unit)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny but wildly out of touch with reality","review":"Others have reviewed the comedic style of the author and compared it to Catch-22, et alia. That's fine: It's an okay style, sometimes amusing, sometimes distracting.But the book couldn't decide what it wanted to be. O'Connor seems to have waffled on whether he was writing a realistic book about the military's dark underbelly, or writing a Douglas Adams-esque preposterous farce. Ultimately, it's a book written set in amongst the military by someone with zero apparent military experience, who skimped on research.Still, even if those who know the military will be distracted by the implausibility of important plot elements...if you ACCEPT the fantasy in the same way that one might accept the premise of a swords-and-sorcery novel, THEN it becomes a funny read. It's all a matter of suspension of disbelief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sgt. Bilko of the 21st Century","review":"Quite a story. I have always felt fiction is based on fact. The story takes place in peace time at a Army base in Germany. Saying that it seems as though it is the mean streets in any big city with the drugs and what takes place. If this actually happens which I am prone to beleive we are in a heap of trouble. Drugs have been a part of Army life since Vietnam but it seems that some high powered groups could be running most of the action. All in all I did enjoy the story and the ending was quite appropriate with plenty of explanation to the past and what happened. It is worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"To be honest, this wasn't a book I would have read on my own, but, as O'Connor was a guest to a college fiction class, I read Buffalo Soldiers regardless.The book was meant for the male half of our species, to be sure, as there is absolutely no endearing value whatsoever to a female like myself. Being that it is written in the second person, an unusual choice but an effective one, it puts the reader into the life of the lead character, Ray Elwood, immediately. Unfortunately, I was very uncomfortable in that role, to say the least. I was not alone in that, either, as many of my fellow students also reported that they did not enjoy the book, and would never have read it except for the grade.Does it evoke emotion? Definitely. Even though I came to hate Elwood, that very feeling convinced me that this was a gifted writer. I do hope that O'Connor continues in what appears to be his chosen field. But would I recommend this book to others? Not a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars...","review":"\\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" by Robert O'Connor (Vintage Books; 324 pages) peaked my interest with the title and eye catching book cover. However the story did not hold my attention at all. I think that I could have enjoyed it better had it not been written in second person.I would consider reading this author's next book, but as for this book about drugs and the military...I say scan before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting story, non-fiction in some aspects","review":"When I picked up this book I had a good idea what I was getting, and for the most part I was right. Its fiction, but revolves around the concept of armies and how they aren't all glamorous. While I didn't expect facts and dates being that the book is fiction I felt the story did try to make it seem like this could be real.. and I wasn't really a fan of that.The story itself is a solid writing and if fictional war concepts are your thing, this book is for you. I did notice a couple other reviewers saying the content was inaccurate, and not a good read for a solider, but being that its fiction i'm not 100% sure how that is even relevant. In this case I say read the synopsis, other reviews here on Amazon and decide if its the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redeeming?","review":"From the title Buffalo Soldiers, I thought there would be some brave individuals, independent perhaps for the army but none the less brave. Instead, I found no characters with integrity, a sense of responsibility or even a smidgen of patriotism. I slogged on, expecting change but it never came with the book ending, the print anyway with no real resolution. The writing , descriptions and action was fine but without characters or a plot, this was very forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Buffalo Soldiers\\"----uh, NOT","review":"This is a nice piece of quasi fiction about race relations in American Military Service. The real Buffalo Soldiers were soldiers who were recruited to scout and fight the Native Americans in the years following the civil war. They were predominately of African or Afican-Native American descent. This book plays with that old fact and gives it a new meaning in a more modern military context. Being overseas with a bunch of folks from all sections and cultures of America puts a whole new perspective on your worldview. Read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not my army","review":"Just for the record, the US Army of 1989 was nothing like what was depicted in this book and the movie of the same title. For the reviewer who wrote \\"Many will find this depiction of peacetime Army life to be deeply offensive and unpatriotic, but it's hard to know just how far from reality it is.\\", take it from someone who was there, it's very, very far from reality. The army of the 80s was an all-volunteer highly professional, highly trained force that gave us the spectacular 100-hour victory in Desert Storm. The army depicted in this book may have existed in some alternate universe somewhere, but not on this planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"You are there\\" narrative approach doesn't work for me.","review":"I was totally put off by the narrative conceit of this novel - the author writing about \\"you\\"(as in: You are reading a book, you are walking down the street, you are selling drugs inGermany, you are an idiot!) There were some interesting story elements, but the style effectivelydisconnected me from it.I wouldn't recommend this until a really good editor has had at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I'd passed","review":"For me, two stars means I wish I hadn't read it.I found Elwood's story uneventful and lacking a measure of believability. The author seems to know little about the military, fighting, drug trafficking, or anything else being discussed. The most important skill missing however is the storytelling.That characters aren't developed and nothing really happens through most of book. Just when the action picks up it's glossed over so quickly that when the book ends it has just added to the frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"I found this book insulting to our servicemen and terribly depressing.

As a matter of fact, it's a lot more fun than most of the books written by those fine authors.Combat is superbly described and takes a front seat but not at the expense of character development. Quintus, the main character, is very likable and you will find yourself cheering him on. Lindani is also incredibly likable and is perhaps my favorite ancient warrior to ever appear in the pages of a novel.I have read hundreds of novels, and Sand of the Arena is firmly planted in my top 10 favorites. Mr. Duffy did his research and produced a first-rate novel with many accurate facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time","review":"For some reason, my previous review of this novel was removed from the site. I regard this as extremely strange, since unlike some of the rave reviewers below, I have taken the time to read this book to the end! (Site manager please take note.)To put it briefly, \\"Sand of the Arena\\" is disappointing. The characters are too often unidimensional mouthpieces that spout exposition instead of plausible dialog. Nor do believable characters pause to review the political landscape for each other. Yes, the book is full of action. But other writers, such as Pressfield and Renault, describe action much, much better.There are other books out there that better deserve readers' time and money, such as Gene Wolfe's excellent \\"Latro\\" series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although this book is fast paced it is somewhere between Kill Bill, Gladiator and some cheap action novel with erotic elements: I was intrigued at first because I am really a fan of ancient Rome, but further I read more disappointed I became.For instance let's just mention the parts of the plot where the main character builds for him something like a modern gym, and in this way achieves advantage over his adversaries. How realistic is that? Or the part where he meets a martial arts master, on a trip from Orient to Great Britain, and he teaches him special moves, how to use internal energy, etc.I don't know, it's just too nave for me, and I'm simply not sure for which audience this book was intended to start with.If you're interested in similar thematics try reading Nicastro's Isle of stone, or excellent books about Roman legions from Dando-Collins, but not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless entertainment","review":"Totally unbelievable.

Unlike a lot of historical fiction, this book is chock full of action. The plot is not cluttered up with political observations nor are the main characters solving mysteries or rescuing damsels in distress. The main characters are quite literally fighting for supremacy and in so doing send each other down roads neither thought they would ever travel. The writing style very much matches the clarity of plot with descriptions that unmistakably convey the emotions and drama taking place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"I got this for my nephew who will only wear this type of jacket and he loves it.

Blasted thing's plastic clip (one of two) broke when putting it on the basket hoop.

In 1978 I first heard this while browsing for vinyl at the local college record store. Parker and the Rumour were playing, introducing me to what we called \\"new wave\\" at the time. Trouser Press used to debate whether Elvis Costello or Graham Parker was the best band of this new era of rock and roll, giving the edge to Parker because of the back-up band! History may have chosen differently, but this is an album that can still bring a tingle to your spine! If you have not heard it, you owe it to yourself to give it a listen. If you like it, then you need to find a copy of \\"Live--Alone in America\\" to hear the most stripped down, soulful version of someone who completely \\"gets it\\" even if his talent is not singing, but interpreting."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Album From An Unheralded Song Writer","review":"It is amazing that of all the names that emerged from the New Wave era that Graham Parker's name hasn't figured more prominently in North America. \\"Squeezing Out Sparks\\" combines great tunes with intelligent and thought provoking lyrics that covers a variety of subjects. The UFO craze of the 1970's and the future X-Files are covered in \\"Waiting For The UFO's\\". Teenage angst and hormones are addressed in \\"Local Girls\\" and \\"Saturday Night Is Dead\\". The album is in fact an amazing analysis of the human condition in \\"Nobody Hurts You\\", \\"You Can't Be Too Strong\\", \\"Passion Is No Ordinary Word\\", and \\"Don't Get Excited\\". All told, this is an album that never bores.

I had put up a metal shed and the connection to the steel beams wouldn't tighten down. After all my hard work, I was depressed to see it dripping. Bought two different sizes of these babies and tried them out. It can be a little difficult to get them started, but it worked well enough for me to add enough pressure to seal the rubber gasket on the other side (roof isn't sturdy enough for walking). Can't speak for regular bolts, but they worked great on the #12 screws."},{"rating":"1","title":"noisey and underwhleming","review":"norma jean seem to live souly on break neck, off key rythyms. they also have a knack for show casing choppy time changes and blasting out tuneless riffage and meadnering screams.

OGTA could have easily been a 5-star album if it wasn't so overly saturated and crushed in the mix. The music is solid, albeit a bit repetitive, but that's really their shtick after all. More importantly, it's as aggressive as rabid dog leaping for your throat. Unfortunately, said dog is chained by the aforementioned problems.

Every song is dripping with chainsaw guitars, furious vocals, pounding drums and deep hidden meaning. If you thing \\"Norma Jean\\" ended after Josh left... I feel sorry for you. Not only does Cory rip, but his voice does a lot of different things. For instance, he can sing, growl, yell, scream (in several octaves) and seems to have every bit the range and talent of Josh. (In fact, this album shows a LOT more maturity than Josh Scogin's new \\"Chariot\\" release, although that is quite tasty as well.)If you like extreme music with a good message, buy this, listen, and be blown away by some seriously heavy mathcore."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the rhythm?","review":"This cd should come with a warning label saying \\"not for fans of previous norma jean album\\".

It was chaotic all the way through, had some post-rock influences, terrific musicianship, and just ruled. So what happened here? When did Norma Jean become a standard metalcore band? I can understand that when a key member leaves, it's hard to replace him or her, but man, they sacrificed a lot.I'll be honest, there are some good songs on here, such as the maniacal \\"Bayonetwork\\" and \\"Murderotica.\\" But, what ruins the album is the use of whiny singing. It sounds like they want to be more mainstream with this album. It's a lot more polished, there's big anthemic choruses with whiny singing, and it just feels weird. It's a dissapointment to be sure.I hope that they can return to the chaos that was their debut. If not, I might as well give up on Norma Jean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they settle with this singer?","review":"Norma Jeans first album Bless the Martyr and Kiss the Child was one of the most amazing cd's that i have ever heard.I knew after the old singer josh left that their was no way that o god the after math would even come close to the first cd.This cd tends to have a diffrent feel to it.It doesnt seem as ear catching as the first one.I Found that it seems like they went for more mathcore with odd time and trying to make the songs as weird and crazy as they could.Very big dissapointment from Norma Jean.The Cd should be more titled, O God let me get a refund for this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"this band on cd is terrible and live they are even worse. they are a typical talentless band. don't waste your time with this cd or any others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars.

Eventually local Saami people were oppressed by the growth of the aggressive Soviet mining and military economy.

Sam Rockwell also has a small role as the younger McGavin who opened up a portal of hell when he was a college student and released a deadly spirit priest.

They have the rare ability to reach deep into the vault and come out with an album you didn't even know you were missing. Case in point - their reissue of NWOBHM band Nightwing's 1985 live album A Night of Mystery: Alive! Alive! With a sound closer to AOR than heavy metal (they had more in common with Asia than Iron Maiden), Nightwing, which featured future GTR vocalist Max Bacon, was one of the more overlooked bands of the British hard rock scene in the early 1980's. This short (only 8 songs) live album highlights the best songs of the band's catalogue, plus a cover of You Keep Me Hanging On. The 2002 Zoom Club reissue doesn't add any bonus tracks, but the album has been digitally remastered for the best sound quality possible.

Amazon obviously was mislead in the same way as I, in that NOW they (EMI) calls it The Ronettes \\"featuring Veronica\\"! Presenting The Fabulous Ronettes was Spectors 64 release, redone in 1967 by arrangement with Philles Records for the 1st time in STEREO and a magnificent job it was! I had the original LP. Stereo is on the picture here too. Hope they will get this straight; don't be mislead to buy based on the cover! They are not yet even listing the titles as they do on all CD's.

We have tried to use it on a number of occasions. More than half the time, the romanized pronunciation is way off. And frequentlyly the entire word is wrong. On occasion, Koreans don't even know what the word is written in Han-Gul or romanized. I think a person coming to Korea should have a book like this, but it should be one that helps native english speakers better in pronunciation. Also, the words themselves should be accurate. Sometimes the word written is the OPPOSITE of what you're trying to say. For example, the word given for a definiton for the word 'delicious' was actually an equivilent to their word for strange. You can imagine what kind of problems that would make in a restaurant or a person's home. So be careful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL BOOK!","review":"Worthless!

Sometimes their opening act was this adorable African American singer fronting a band she called Roach and the White Boys! She was supposedly one of the O'Neal brothers' girlfriends, and she not only had a similar Bus Boys sense of humour but boy could she sing! We went practically every other weekend for a year to see them play all over Southern California - in places like West L.A., Santa Monica, Hollywood, Anaheim, San Diego! Crazy, man! Funny, theatrical, and GREAT musicians. The lead guitarist, Victor, could really seriously play! And as my sister noted, he was really cute! This is a great album by a band I really miss. Bring back the Bus Boys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen by CJ","review":"I use this CD for my students and my daughter and they love it!

And the funny thing: Even some of the examples are wrongly formatted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors in the recipes","review":"This book can be a useful reference when cooking for your dosha, and some of the recipes are pretty good. There are however several recipes with rather extreme errors - not enough liquid or too much, for example - so that it can be frustrating to cook from this book. Whenever I try a recipe I have a pencil handy so if something is wrong with the recipe I can make a note of it so that I either know how to correct it next time or stay away from that recipe. These recipes can not have been properly tested before the book was published. I would advise less experienced cooks to stay away from the book because the number of errors in recipes will make it very frustrating to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for westerners!","review":"Great recipe's for the westerner who has not yet ventured into the traditional creations of India.

Others in the household watch standard television (DirecTV with no HD programming, yet). The television has a beautiful picture for DVDs.

No problems with it, at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theater viewing in the comfort of your home!","review":"This tv is great! It puts out great theater sound all on it's own. Great size for PIP viewing. HD quality makes you feel like you are on the sidelines. Highly recommend.

After clearly creating a \\"sound\\" for themselves they moved into a totally different country rock area.Hunter's \\"Angel of 8th Ave\\" and Ralphs' \\"Whisky Women\\" are two of the best tracks on the album. In fact, Ralphs is in top form here contributing four excellent songs. Ignored upon release, this is one of the band's most interesting offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Uneventful","review":"The idea behind this novel is great: three worlds which are somehow linked together by dreams and each dreamer is a unique personality (and race). But I found the beginning of Mystic Warrior to be almost unbearable. The story progresses slower than a snail. The only reason you keep reading is because the chapters are so small (about 5 pages) that you find it an incredibly easy read. But it takes nearly 200 pages before the story really beings to progress to anything interesting. Honestly, I just recommend saving your money and buying another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plotting and world-building, but overwritten","review":"I've enjoyed many of the books I've read where Tracy Hickman has collaborated with Margaret Weis. So I was really eager to read the first book in the Bronze Canticles when it first came out in hardcover. When I finally got to reading it, even though I really liked the world, I found his writing style to be way too clunky and overwritten.A couple examples of what I mean. He says, \\"Bertika's hair was a brown nimbus...\\" which I find to be a bit too odd of a description. When describing a window, he finishes by talking about the world \\"beyond its glazing.\\" This is just in the first few pages. Personally, I find that kind of writing difficult to wade through, and a little pretentious, as if the authors are trying to show just how many words they know.I'll be looking forward to other things Tracy Hickman and his wife are involved in, but I just can't recommend this book due to the difficult to slog through writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good!","review":"this book was pretty good i only hated the parts when galen complaned about him not being insane from what i read i think he s lol well anyway i loved the book and i think anyone who is into magical tales and a great drawn fantasy world should bye this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Having read several of the series Tracy Hickman co-created with Margaret Weiss, I expected much of this new series.My expectations were not met. The writing style is bland and forced. The world is interesting enough, but the concept of several worlds linked together has already been done in a previous series of Weis and Hickman (the deathgate novels). A series that was way better and more entertaining.I disliked all the characters and was bored by the dream sequences. For some reason it was quite annoying that Galen spoke in first person.The ending was predictable yet slightly better than the rest of the book.I would expect this work from a fumbling beginning author not a great like Tracy Hickman. He should simply stick to working with Weis, cause their co-authored books rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great fantasy action adventure story with no action or adventure....","review":"So the Hickmans have written some of my favorite stores over the years but I think they approached this knowing they wanted a \\"$ Trilogy $\\" so they had to stretch this one out a little too much. Not to mention my favorite storyline killer: the unlikely hero thrown into the heroic situation, which he doesn't want. Don't they all..... Why can't the main character just have the inner drive to get the bad guys and right the world's wrongs?Discussing this with my friends who have also read it we all agreed: it was a disappointment.That said, I went out and picked up the second in this series in paperback last week in hopes that this series does get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better","review":"Having read the Dragonlance series, I told myself that the second half of the book would hold more promise as a way to get through the slow first half, which I believed was perhaps necessary as groundwork.The gnome world was, in my opinion, unnecessary. The switching of worlds was at times rather tedious to read, especially the gnome world, which I skipped over almost entirely at the second half of the book, without missing much.The ending was rather ridiculous. Sure, it's fantasy, but then there should also be some rationalisation in fantasy too. Certain things at the finale occurred without a clear explanation, although the reader can link the events together and explain what causes what. However, why certain things are that way aren't explained at all.In short, I felt short-changed and there was a feeling of relief after finishing the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Computer dictionary's are difficult to keep current","review":"Because of the popularity of the Internet, computer's have become very popular. The technology has leap-frogged several times during the past year.This book has a lot of dated terms that do not apply to today's environment. An example is: Hayes Compatible Modem. The Hayes Company and the Hayes brand are now defunct.XML is not mentioned as a computer term. Other new terms are not mentioned either.This subject changes too much to have a good guide in paper form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Date","review":"I bought this hoping to be able to get simplified explanatios of high-tech terms for use in my writing. What a waste! It doesn't have definitions for some of the newest Internet and computer terms, and the definitions it does have are way too complicated for the average human. I keep looking up words, hoping for the best. Invariably, I am disappointed. Try Microsoft's Computer Dictionary - it's easier to understand and more complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying...","review":"As a general computer dictionary I would rate this as 3/5 stars. Although, all-in-all, this is suppose to be an up to date terminology reference for Internet terms as well...not really up to date in that department unfortunately either. As for a programmers reference...look elsewhere! For example, there is a definition for CORBA; but no definition for COM or COM+! Not very well thought out...look to another book for a more complete vocabulary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I can't count the number of computer terms and abbreviations I've looked for in this book -- looked for in vain, that is. The one that inspired me to go online and complain publicly was ICC. There is no ICC (International Color Consortium) reference! Unbelievable that this basic abbreviation has been left out of a dictionary of computer and internet terms. Save your money and use online resources for definitions and explanations."},{"rating":"2","title":"a solid worth while source book","review":"This is the latest in the Barron's Business Guide on Computer and Internet terms. It is up to date has has over 3200 key terms made easier to understand by diagram, pictures or examples (as in programming). There are some terms not covered for some reason such as the types of networks, only a generic reference that if you were looking up networks you would know anyway. I hope they correct this over-sight and add more network terms but otherwise a very useful and helpful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"MCSE (Microsoft Certified SOFTWARE Engineer)!?","review":"That is just one example of the many errors in this book.

And Lorie has the advantage over Brittany Spears and freinds, of actually being able to sing/carry a tune!

Unfortunately, French kids I know all seem to idolize her, and I can't help it (let's hope they'll soon grow out of it), but I didn't think she had crossed the ocean !! The lyrics are very poor (a five year old would do better at it), and so is the music. The drums and synthetisers are most irritating and there's no originality at all in the songs. And she's a very bad singer, she sounds like a whining ten year old singing under the shower. I wouldn't recommand this even to your kids.Not to say that all current french pop music is bad, but PLEASE don't even give Lorie a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repititious Blur","review":"I accidentally came across this book while browsing through the history section. As a history student it looked interesting. I got about twenty pages into the book when I just gave up. The reader is bombarded with seemingly useless, repititious facts and the cast of characters/survivers becomes one large blur. Not to mention that the story itself becomes lost in the midst of the author attempting to connect everyone and everything in London during this time. Overall, I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome skiing, as usual!","review":"As usual, from the ski movie master Warren Miller, a great skiing movie, with lots of incredible scenes and acrobatics.

I do not know how the Sangean will age yet, but the reception is a major disappointment. To be clear about it, it is only used to listen to an NPR FM station in a major city. No AM stations, no obscure radio station, no out of the way towns or remote locations. No mater where I walk, reception is consistently not good, and significantly worse than what I had with the Sony radio (which was not perfect either, but definitely reasonable). For lack of motivation to purchase another Sony radio and after not finding a better option my conclusion is that the only solution is to listen to the \\"radio\\" via podcasts or other forms of digitally downloaded content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"No complaints about this little machine. I haven't used it much, but the sound has been clear. I've used the supplied headphones on other devices and they seemed pretty clear. I found the 90-minute auto-off to be a double edged sword, listening to sports or NPR on the weekend: saves the battery, but might cut out at a crucial play.Another thing you might not think of: it's easier to find a white device than a black one when you've tossed it into a laptop or gym bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Radio","review":"Elegant look, good reception. Preset buttons small and hard to use. Auto turn off when earphone is removed is a nice touch. Lost it and replaced it with lower tech Sony SRF-M37V: bigger buttons and cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A neat concept but with too many short comings","review":"My Sangean DT-180V started out as a good miniature radio. It has good reception and is fairly sturdy and attractive. The on/off button and volume switches are the only controls that work as designed. The band selector and station scroll buttons work as designed most of the time.The station preset buttons seldom worked properly. The erratic preset button behavior got worse over time.I had to press harder and harder to get them to respond. When I pressed a button, it very often selected a station programmed for a button otherthan the one I pressed. Eventually I got used to it, I would just keep trying again to get the intended station.The other problem is that the labels for the buttons on the front of the radio wore off very quickly.(Luckily I had memorized their functions).I finally got fed up with the radio and stopped using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I have a 1996 Buick skylark and it shows in detail how to build the car, piece by piece.Brian"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good camera for a child","review":"I bought this camera for my 7 year old and was really disapppoined with it. It was really light plastic and seemed like it could get broken quickly. The piece that holds the batteries in the bottom comes completely off and was rather hard to replace after loading them, also it could be easily lost. You also need to manually advance the film after each picture and the winder is not at the top of the camera so that is also hard to do. I would not recommend this camera for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"A messy instrument","review":"I was very disappointed with this instrument I bought for my 4 year old.

Based in great deal upon her personal experience, she tells how she and her husband set their objectives for retirement living, and then systematically went about selecting a continuing-care community. There's a lot to take into consideration in making one's selection and Hunt takes you through the process expertly. Although she is overwhelmingly in favor of this type of retirement living, she also is not hesitant to inject negative opinions where merited and, generally, her opinions are right on target. There's little ground that the author doesn't cover and she gives a very useful guide -- including check-lists -- for conducting your own search for the best community. Very helpful and useful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Old Standard","review":"I have had this same style of watch since 1991! I wore as a civilian and in the military. I like the fact that it has military time on the face and that the hands glow slightly in the dark so you can still tell the time without turning on a light. It is virtually indestructable even in wet conditions. The nylon strap is easy to clean and the back allows for easy battery replacement. The reason I am buying a new watch was that after daily use for over ten years, the second hand literally fell off and would not allow the other hands to move.

Oh my, what a find! I didnt see it on the US book stores yet at that time, which was surprising. The first thing I would say that is that you have to allow a little bit as far as the style is concerned because it is a translation. Once past that, you are in for an adventure. The characters stick around in your mind for a long time and the twist in the tale absolutely blindsides you. At least, I never saw it coming.

The publisher touted the upcoming movie release, of which I believe never saw a theater. The story is sophomoric and fantastical. The author creates an unrealistic plot and employs very stereotypic and two-dimensional characters to to pull of the story. No matter how good the actors are, they can't defeat the writer's ineptitude as much as they can thwart their enemies. I appreciate Dr. Manfedi's qualifications as a historian, but that does not make him a good story teller. My suggestion--rent the DVD instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"the only reason i gave it a one star is because that is the lowest amazon offers. seriously this book was horrible.

Their style of singing Irish songs with a hugs orchestra that sometimes drowns out their singing just leaves me cold. Their style just isn't the authentic bouncy fun Irish style with Irish instruments.This particular album tries. It really does. But the courting set with \\"Courtin in the Kitchen\\" and \\"I'll Tell Me Ma\\" falls short of an authentic Irish rendition. The Clancy Brothers do these types of songs so much better.Maybe if they'd try to do their concerts with less full dress style, I'd like it better.

Ronan is the most spectacular, he is so emotional, I just love to listen to him. Of course we can't not love Finbar's \\"Forty Shades of Green\\". AND THEN THERES ANTHONY....He just improves with each concert.The voices TOGETHER on any given song is just the most SPINE-TINGLING, MIND-BLOWING. THE TRIO CAN KEEP YOUR SENSES REELING FOR HOURS. I just wish I could write such flowing reviews as others before me, but this is the best I can do without just being too gushy. LOVE YOU GUYS, KEEP IT FLOWING. YOUR #1 FAN, JOAN WAY"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud , a real dud !","review":"This is the latest but not at all what we have come to expect from The Irish Tenors ! It is poorly mixed & balanced with what is an unbelievably poor arrangement of \\"Danny Boy\\" ! This can not have been produced with their careers in mind . This one will be resold immediately or given away. Very poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellis Island: The Irish Tenors","review":"This is the best album yet! All three tenors are in fine voice, and the orchestral arrangements show Frank McNamara's expert touch. Highlights are \\"Macushla\\" and \\"The Croppy Boy\\" by Anthony Kearns -- whose voice continues to improve. He can raise goosebumps when he hits notes like high C and high B flat. It's unbelievable how the clarity and sweetness of his voice adds to a song. Finbar Wright is superb In \\"Slievenamon\\" and \\"The Old Bog Road\\" to both of which the mature quality of his voice and his mellow sound is eminently suited. Ronan Tynan's rendition of \\"The Green Fields of France\\" is enough to make everyone go out and end war for ever. The Gaelic medley is wonderful -- the blending of their voices is better than ever and the climactic \\"God Bless America\\" is the icing on the cake. Buy this CD; you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful - wonderful","review":"The Irish Tenors sound better than ever--something I had not thought possible. If I could give this 6 or 7 stars, I would. This is a must have for all Irish Tenor fans. The selection of songs are simply great and the Tenors' renditions are outstanding. Now all I have to do is wait for the video of the concert itself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!!!!","review":"This is by far the best of The Irish Tenors CD's. The song selections run the gambit from lighthearted fare like \\"Courtin' in the Kitchen\\" to haunting melodies such as \\"Machusla\\". The vocal artistry of Finbar Wright, Anthony Kearns and Ronan Tynan is showcased thoughout this CD. This is not a live CD recording as were their Dublin and Belfast CD's. However, having had the privilege of attending the Ellis Island Video taping, I can say that this CD definitely invokes the same feelings and emotions in the listener as if they were there.A definite must have for any fan of this fabulous group."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best movie books ever","review":"This book is so wonderful, I can't recommend it highly enough. It's making me fall in love with movies all over again. The writing is lucid and intelligent, and Harvey is such a great viewer of films that he makes scenes spring right out of the page. I'm renting lots of movies I've never seen based on his writing about them, and re-watching old favorites with a whole new understanding. If you love movies, buy this book. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable!","review":"Truly one of the most fascinating and enjoyable books on film history. However, there was one disappointment - mainly Harvey's chapter on the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers movies. It struck me as an essay on 1930s musicals and he does not give much credit to Ginger Rogers' contribution to the dance team."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Start","review":"A very good book. The only critical thing I would say is that it lacks boat building terms and does not use WoodenBoat magazine as one of its many fine references. I saw the book advertised in the WoodenBoat catalog and assumed it would help in my new boat building project. I am still looking for a resource. It still has 2000 other terms. Not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your own best customer?","review":"You suck for writing your own \\"customer\\" reviews (three of them no less). I bought your book anyway though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture is misleading","review":"I was disappointed to find only one band in the package. The picture and title \\"cords\\" (plural) led me to believe that all three were included. Had I known, I would not have ordered this product. There were others with a lower price that included a workout guide. This one comes with nothing extra."},{"rating":"1","title":"perpetuates racial grievances","review":"The artwork in this book is very appealing. The seemingly simple illustrations convey expression and mood. Remarkable.But...Jackie Robinson was black.Jackie Robinson was black.Jackie Robinson was black...And don't you forget it!That seems to be the message of this book. Was Jackie nothing more than a black man? Should that be my main takeaway from this book? Jackie was black, really? No other accomplishment gets nearly the emphasis in this book as his skin color. How aggravating -- do we have to just bludgeon that fact home again and again? What a waste of an illustrator's talent - this book could have been so much more.Some non-standard English grammar (\\"I ain't never\\"...\\" \\"my dad and me...\\"). Great illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"While I did receive a Websters New World Thesarus it does not look like the picture used to advertise the product. My expectation was that it would be the leather bound June 1999 version--it was not the item I ordered. In fact, I was sent a blue hardcover to add to my home library. If I had wanted that I would have purchased locally. As it is I have a product that I didn't order, tabs that are falling off, and an eyesore on my shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thesaurus, easy to use","review":"I prefer the old style that had two sections to reference. Well, I may be a bit biased because I also love the smell of an old book. But aside from that, this thesaurus is complete, very extensive, and easy to use. A powerful tool for any writer from scientific to fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual Wedding Gift","review":"This was given as a wedding gift with the Webster's Dictionary. It is a reliable resource for two students setting up housekeeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Updated and complete thesaurus","review":"I replaced my old Roget's Thesaurus with this one and am very pleased with its clarity, organization, and completeness. The typeface is very easy to read and it is printed on high-quality paper. I like to consult a thesaurus often in my writing and I've been satisfied by the word offerings each time I've used this thesaurus. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great source.","review":"Everyone in the family has used the New World Thesaurus at one time or another since our purchase. It's easy to use and complete. Anyone with kids in school or adults who have to develop content in their jobs will find this book a valuable resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...But Just","review":"I bought three thesauri at the same time. I do quite a bit of technical writing and I needed multiple sources to draw from.I ordered this title, along with Roget's 21st Century Thesaurus and Roget's International Thesaurus.The first synonym I needed was for \\"coordinate,\\" as in \\"to coordinate...\\" Roget's 21st Century gave me 23 words and phrases, Websters gave only seven, and Roget's eight. I've found similar disparities among the volumes for numerous other words.Roget's 21st Century is a terrific little book, inexpensive, small, and easily stays beside my PC. The others, well, I wish I'd saved my money. But they'll come in handy at some point, I'm sure.This volume is good but will be relegated to the bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great variety of literary works","review":"My favorite in this book is Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen's work here is terrific, and the plot is filled with twists on love and fate. Heart of Darkness was somewhat difficult to understand, but the theme is meaningful nonethelsss. Portrait of the Young Artist is okay, but not too interesting to me. The stream of consciousness techique is pretty effective however. Dorian Gray was my least favorite in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"1:87 scale- so buyer beware","review":"No specifications on actual size unless I am mistaken but I knew it was tiny because of shipping weight.

Not as good as debut album.","review":"After the success of their debut album, \\"Adults Only,\\" teh gang at Club 69 got a bit overly ambitious and put out an overly produced CD that was decent but not universally appealing.They bring back some of our favorite vocalists from teh first album but teh songs are pretty disposable. It's nice to have playing in the background but nothing that really stands out.I suggest you buy the debut, \\"Adults Only.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"a deceiving title on package","review":"The 5 cd set entitled Basic Modern Greek of this language course is included in the 8 cd set entitled conversational Greek.

This is time lost that i will never be able to recoup.Frustrated with"},{"rating":"1","title":"194 pages of drivel before any instructions.","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this book. It was recommend by a co-worker, so I bought it. There are 194 pages of anecdotes about why its a good idea to use the exercises in the book before one gets to the first exercise. This sort of thing is usually covered in the introduction, or maybe the first chapter, but not the first 15! Does anyone really need that much convincing *after* buying the book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live makes the difference","review":"I am a huge fan of a capella music and I am in a group myself. Out of all the Rockapella CD's, this is still my favorite by far. First of all, it is the best buy you will find if you are interested in Rockapella. There are 22 songs on this CD as opposed to a meager 12-14 on the others. But besides the economic aspect, I simply believe this CD has the best quality music that I've heard from their recorded music. Some of the same songs are on their other CD's but when I listen to the other CD's, I just don't get the same feeling. Maybe I just prefer hearing Rockapella \\"sing their guts out\\" as Barry Carl would put it... but I think their studio recordings are overblended and saccharine sweet. So if you want what I feel is the true sound of great modern a capella music, buy this CD first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where In the World...","review":"...has the musical talent gone? The five men of Rockapella have talent in overflow. In a society where shameless displays of special effects, fanfare, hoopla, and digital alterations qualify as \\"music,\\" it is refreshing to hear true vocal talent. I have seen Rockapella live several times, and this CD captures a taste of that amazing experience - their onstage banter, their repoire with the audience, and so much more. It is a perfect blend of brilliant originals (People Change, Keep On Smilin') and covers of songs we all know and love (Pretty Woman, Stand By Me), with that unique Rockapella twist - and of course, their signature song, Where In the World Is Carmen Sandiego? Scott's soaring high tenor, Elliott's oh-so-smooth baritone, Barry's booming bass, Kevin's sweet, tender tenor, and Jeff's showstopping vocal percussion meld into the ultimate sound. Just five guys, singing their hearts out. True talent, true music."},{"rating":"2","title":"To their Credit","review":"In response to the \\"music fan\\" from Lansing MI, I have to say that his mistake is honestly to Rockapella's Credit. Their voices blend and work so well together that he mistook them for playing instruments! However, do you honestly think that a group that called themselves a blend of Rock and A Capella in their name could honestly use instruments??????? On to my opinion of this CD. I'm a fan. I'm about to attend my third concert. Rockapella is unbelievable in concert. The energy that comes in anticipation of a concert and after seeing them is one of the best highs I've ever experienced. And this CD helps me go back to it. However, I do wish they'd take \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" off the program. I'm so sick of it, and there's nothing spectacular about their version. Other than that, my favorites are \\"Moments Of You,\\" \\"People Change\\" and their cover of Squeeze's \\"Tempted.\\" Buy this CD, Folks. It's definitely worth it. Then go see them live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to them?","review":"Ya, I know...you saw them years ago on Spike Lee's Acapella TV special and were wowed by their version of Zombie Jamoree. I was, too! When I saw that a DVD and soundtrack CD of one of their concerts was available I was thrilled and ordered both. The CD arrived very quickly and I rushed to put it on. I was shortly bored and wishing it would get through so that I could put on a real a capella group like The Persuasions or the Golden Gate Quartet or the Belmonts. Gone was the excitement and vitality of their earlier music and they did not even sing a capella anymore! They now incororate instruments and sound like bubblegum rock. I rushed to my computer and canceled my DVD order and looked for my old soundtrack of the Spike Lee program. Not all changes are for the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Keane - What planet have you been on?","review":"Skip this insulting piece of garbage. I almost couldn't believe what I was reading! At one point Keane seems to imply that Havel's five years as a political prisoner, was nothing more than a planned political move to further his career. Mr. Keane definitely is not a historian, or for that matter, a good writer. What a pity that the book has even received so much publicity. A pure unadulterated insult to one of the greatest figures of our time. Shame on you Keane. Attacking this courageous leader for smoking and drinking habits. I wonder if Keane might have looked for a beer and cigarette after 5 years in a communist prison. Lastly, he criticizes Havel as a writer. Wow, this guy has some really big stones! He writes a piece of junk and in it criticizes one of the most creative and courageous voices of our time. This website only lets you rate from 1 star up, otherwise I would have given it no stars. A waste of time and paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impact, and You...","review":"Warren Miller has long been one of my faviorite photographer's and nairators. Impact has his usual amounts of humor, and catchy lines. However, Think i have been spoiled by his previous movie Journey. Journey is the best of the warren miller movies to date in my opinion. The music in impact was fairly bland. Very Worth buying and adding to your collection by all means. However i'd buy journey first.

Some chapters, I watch several more times.This movie has three things against it. First, I was very disappointed with the number of product placements in this movie. It takes alot away from the whole movie. Second, it has too much of the same stuff that can be seen in any recently released WM movie. Same people doing the same exact things. Third, the sound track was way below par.I'm still a Warren Miller fan and the movie does have some good ski footage. But, I don't think the WM bunch went out of their way to make this a good ski movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant country album","review":"For the first time I've heard Jamie O'Neal in one of \\"A Prairie Home Companion\\" radio shows.

If you want a variety of music and styling this is the cd for youTop pics; Tryin to find Atlantis, Devil on the left, Brave, When did you know and Naive.The only downside to this cd in my opinion is the fact that she has a few filler songs that are lighthearted fun songs that celebrate her friends and family ( Girlfriends and I love my life). These songs also would mostly appeal to females ( being a male these are my least favorites)Overall this is a great cd and Jamie O'Neal is one of the best female country vocalists out there today"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Jamie O'Neal is a seasoned storyteller on her second CD Brave - happy, sad, hope, want and joy - she hits the emotions all perfectly like she has lived each and every song. It includes two songs about mothers and daughters, \\"Somebody's Hero\\" is a touching story of a daughter taking care of her mother after the mother raised her so well and \\"I Love My Life\\" is about Jamie's personal bliss. I really relate to \\"Ready When It Comes\\" and \\"Trying to Find Atlantis\\", and always sing along with \\"Girlfriends\\". Jamie's voice is awesome and I'm glad she's back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Group of Fun Songs","review":"This album is a collection of songs that are simply fun to listen to, especially \\"Trying to Find Atlantis\\" \\"Naive\\" \\"Girlfriends\\" and \\"I Love My Life.\\" The album does come accross as somewhat formulaic and not very original, which prevents it from getting 5 stars.

It switches from cookie monster to elmo, with both characters saying cute phrases. Also Oscar pops in once in a while with a playfully sarcastic remark. The issue here is that no giggling is involved in this \\"Giggle\\" vacuum. For that, it loses a star. But great toy all around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it!","review":"Both my boys (15 mths and 4yrs old) love Elmo/Cookie Monster and this toy! I originally bought it when my 4 yr old was 2 yrs old, bec Matthew was always getting into my vacuum attachments, wanted to help me vacuum, and had an obsession w/ Elmo. So, the idea was to get him one of his own so he could \\"help\\" mommy vacuum. We've had the toy vacuum for over 2 years now,I have yet to change the batteries and both boys have rammed it into walls, doors, furniture, and anything else you can think of and it still runs like the day we got it.

It is so hard for my 1 and a 1/2 year old to push around. It is even hard for me to push when I am playing with her. It only gets one star from me for the cuteness factor and for the fact that it has an off switch.

Unfortunately, once I listened to it all the way through, I put it at the very bottom of one of my CD stacks, hoping to never see it again, except to show people how genius can turn into the mundane. The album has nothing; no punch, no drive. I can't say that I didn't like anything on the album, because I did kind of like one saxophone solo. When Mick first came on the scene as a teenager, he was full of Freddie King and Albert King and was possibly/probably one of the best white blues guitarists in the world! Actually, he still had it in 1979 on his \\"Mick Taylor\\" album (listen to Slow Blues). But over 20 years of being a session musician, and doing some gigs with Bob Dylan (yeeeech!), he just doesn't have it anymore. Buy the CD if you want to, if only to satisfy your curiosity.

Even the guitar playing is marginal. And I like Mick Taylor. At least pre-1975 Mick. I had a lot of hope for this CD, but was very dissappointed upon first hearing it (and with subsequent listenings). The worst part are the vocals. Horrible. Why Mick insists on doing the vocals is beyond me. Friends should give him some honest feedback on that. On the larger side, maybe Mick really does need some help with production or some good old Keithian riffological guidance to bring out his best?

And I'm very picky...","review":"The only reason why I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is the price...I'm don't like spending $20 on a product but I have to say that this was worth it. My hair is relaxed and of fine texture, meaning that blow drying can easily dry it out and make it frizzy. This product addresses those issues:1. It is very lightweight so it doesn't weigh the hair down2. My hair was sleek and smooth after blow drying without fly-aways and minimal shedding/breakage3. Yes, it smells good too.For a polisher, I used a few drops of IC Hair Polisher ($5)to give a nice lightweight sheen to my hair before flat-ironing. I think buying every styling product in Mizani's line is a bit overkill (and expensive) but the styling serum really works. It was a worthwhile purchase...and I will ration it as much as possible to delay paying another $20 for it.(-:"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poker+Cufflings","review":"It was one of the best love gift this past Chrismas.

The tour rolled through in early November, the snow flew soon afterward. This collection of movies represent some of the last true Warren Miller movies. The current films using his name have nothing to do with Mr. Miller. Much like Walt Disney, Warren Miller's name has become a brand. This collection of movies will help you understand why. The movies are well produced, feature contemporary artists in the soundtrack, and add words to the popular lexicon, like Freeride. Best of all, they also feature Warren Miller's vision, style and humor. These movies are still a great way to kick off ski season."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent volume!","review":"Elsie Singmaster, \\"Gettysburg's Poet Laureate,\\" has long been neglected, her books forgotten and out-of-print.This volume remedies this injustice and brings her work back into the public eye.

It was as if the author had written a three hundred page list of mindnumbing facts, and then tried to sell them as a true literary work.

It lasted about 14 months, before it made horrible noises from the beater bar constantly hitting against the cheap plastic housing it is contained in. Plastic, is sometimes fine, but this is the cheapest type of plastic known to man, ABS, terrible, it scratches easily, and moving parts that are assembled in recesses in the plastic soon wear themselves out of their positions.

The brush on the bottom easily clogged with hair and was not easy to remove. I frequently had to turn the thing upside down, cut hair away and empty the plastic compartments just to get the thing to work properly. Finally, the belt broke last month.

Yes it has a warranty but can you really live without a vacuum while it is being repaired? Save your money, this is no better than the $100.00 vacuums I have owned. I agree it doesn't lose suction, because it can't lose something it doesn't have. It is also made of plastic, which breaks over time. Do yourself a favor, do the research and don't believe the hype.

For me, the mini turbine head was the best thing about the vacuum. It worked very well at picking up pet hair. I called Dyson and they said that the warranty did not cover the turbine head.

If I took it a repair shop and had to leave it, I would have to spend traveling a total of 400 miles just to have a switch replaced.I found a place out of state that had the switch and they sold it to me.

The suction is superb and no belt breaks like the others!Rated it 4 stars because I don't like the way our wand works--having to undo the whole power cord just to use it, but oh, well...I still like the vacuum.I said I didn't want another bagless, but this is so easy to detach and empty. I generally carry it out to the large garbage container outside, as it can be dusty emptying it in the 13-gallon trash can indoors.All in all, it's wonderful and I highly recommend Dyson to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great vacuum...","review":"The Dyson DC14 Cyclone Animal Upright vacuum is the best vacuum I have ever used. You see what it is picking up and when you need to empty the collection chamber. I like the semi sterile way of emptying the contents of the collection chamber as well. With the push of a button the bottom falls out. A quick and light flick of the wrist and it closes. It is truly a revolution in vacuum design.The few things I don't care for about the vacuum are the horrendous noise it makes when you go over an uplifted section of carpet and on rugs. Nor does it pick up very well when vacuuming over aggressively treaded rugs. Those are the only negatives that I can think of.To sum it up, it's a great vacuum with very minor issues.

From day one, it has picked up more stuff from our carpet and floors than we've ever experienced with other technology machines. Remarkable. It continues to peform this well after 2 years of regular use. Just today, I vacuumed the house about a week after my wife did and managed to fill the canister with \\"junk\\".

Now keep in mind I was using the low reach tool and vacuuming under a bed and tv stand, but still considering we have been in our house for just at a year, and we have wood floors which dont show any dirt, I was amazed.We compared this to our old Eureka 4885BT Whirlwind and it really was no comparison.The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5, is plain and simple cost.

Emptying the canister is very easy! It works well on furnature with the attachment. Using the attachments is not easy, but it works. I like that the cord is long enough that I can plug it in in a central part of the house and do the whole house.

On the second run through the house, we never needed to empty it a single time. Talk about suction!! Even our high traffic areas are fluffy again!Better yet, it was easier to push than my old vacuum. The center of gravity on the Dyson is lower than your average upright, so it's not constantly tipping over the way my old one did.

In fact, we had to make several passes along the carpet area just to pick up dog hair, plus there wasn't much of anything else in the canister, which made us suspicious that it wasn't picking up dander or dirt. We then passed over the same area with our Bissell, and it was ten times better than the Dyson.3. Attachments were awkward and very cumbersome. Again, our Bissell won out because they are built into the machine.Overall, we were incredibly disappointed, especially because of the high price and after all the hype it receives on commercials and in the stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too heavy and hard to maneuver. Awful and frustrating!","review":"I am using my daughter's Dyson slim style vacuum cleaner and it's just awfully hard to move around. It's very heavy and has jerky motions and i just hate it. Very frustrating!To get into corners, it takes a while to pull out the hose attachment, which is awkward to use as well, and then the vacuum has to be in upright position, so one can not move it easily. This is the weirdest contraption I've ever used and the most difficult , when it comes to household appliances!I'm definitely getting my daughter a new easier-to-use canister vacuum cleaner from Sears for a Christmas present. Mr. Dyson most likely has help( maids), so he has no idea of what it's like to actually operate the thing in his own house!!! Do not buy one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clutch Issue with DC14 Dyson","review":"I've only owned this $500 vacuum for 2 years and now the clutch has gone out on it. I talked to a vacuum repair specialist and he informed me that oh yes this is a common problem with this vacuum. He added insult to injury when he said it will cost around $200 to fix it. If this is a common problem then Dyson should provide extended warranty for this issue or they should quit selling a very flawed product. I for one will never own another Dyson product in my life and I'll will post as many reviews as I can to warn other potential buyers. Dyson, I very unhappy with your products!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful but Expensive","review":"This does beat the other vacuums that I have owned in the past.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK! It does not live up to its advertised ability to pick up animal hair on any surface and on hardwood floors it just blows the hair in the air and around the room more. The attachments are a joke -- they won't stay on when you try to use them. Getting the wand out to use the attachments is easy -- getting it back in correctly can take much of an afternoon.I wish I could get my money back so I could buy a real vacuum cleaner!Do not be fooled -- pass on this vacuum cleaner. It does not do what it is advertised to do on animal hair or any other material."},{"rating":"1","title":"My dog does a better job","review":"The front of the vacuum is to high to clean under the cupboard overhang on the kitchen floor. And you just can't whip out the hose to get into that little space, you have to completely dismantle the vacuum. And the suction isn't the greatest. I ended up returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucks","review":"We bought it today and it's going back tomorrow. For $550.00 we want a $550.00 vacuum. It has no power and it is build cheap. The wand is pain. It will be hard to replace the belt when we need to and the beater bar rattles (slips) if you look the wrong way. They are correct in their ads though. You never loose suction. Well, you need to have suction first in order to loose it. We buy a miele"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dyson Hype?","review":"The dysons are definitly heavily marketed. And since we have a cat that sheds way too much we decided to get this vaccum. It is a bit pricier than other vacuums but we bought it anyway. It works well but I dont know if it works any better than any other vaccum. The wand tool is a bit of a pain to use at times.Overall it is a good vacuum but I am still unsure if it is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I went into Sears to get the Kenmore, which consumer reports said was the best. An saleman told me it was great and that only one other was better: the dyson. I had seen the awesome reviews on amazon and did not understand why CR would differ. To make a long story short, the dyson is a disappointment. No doubt, it has tremendous power. I sometimes saw it almost pulling the tiles off the floor. We can see it pulling up a lot of stuff. But then I realized, it is just pulling off carpet. At times, I would have to move the vacuum over visibile debris several times for it to come up. It made me wonder what it is not getting. It was even worse on floors. No doubt, the power is there. But it is not effective. When using attachments, the performance was solid. In short, for this kind of money, I expect better. I just found out I can return it, and I'm going to the store now."},{"rating":"1","title":"An honest review....really","review":"It's all about the marketing people...really. I've had this vacuum for a few years now. When people hear from the ads that it doesn't lose suction, they think \\"awesome!\\" Well great suction is great for floors and carpets, but what good is it when it makes the hand tools nearly impossible to maneuver? I mean really, you have to really strain yourself to use the hand tools. Awful design on the hose (not flexible enough to reach without pulling the whole vacuume along or tipping over). If I had to do it over again, I may have paid $150 for this vacuum but definitely not $500. Just like a lot of products out there now, the spiffy marketing campaign about the suction and cutesy design are what makes for the high sticker price, not the machine itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dyson Animal Vac","review":"I have had an Oreck upright for years and this beats it hands down! I have a cat that sheds everywhere and this machine works amazingly well. The instructions for assemble are easy to follow and it takes no time at all to get the vacuum running. The attachments work great and the overall power of the machine makes it worth the money. It is an upright and a canister all in one. I like that it has a lifetime Hepa filter, it is lightweight, easy to clean and no messy bags to fumble with. I highly recommend if you are a pet owner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This vacuum is not what it is advertised to be. The first two weeks it worked great although it is heavy to push around and then it was impossible to push either forward or backward. I called Dyson and they had me remove two rubber strips from the bottom and it seems to work a little better now but I would never buy another one. The wand is a nightmare with hardly any suction at all and the accessories keep falling off if you bump anything even slightly... So not worth all the money for the name Dyson...My phantom that I have had for 13 years is a much better vacuum and still working great so I will go back to using that....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing is believing","review":"hype hype blah blah... whatever. I just moved into a place with carpet after a few years of hard floor so I needed an upright. I have a little Oreck canister but that won't work on carpet. The last tenant has long curly brown hair. after vacuuming three times and repeatedly filling up the dirt bucket on the Dyson with her hair, carpet fuzz and old crud that her vac never picked up I'm pretty sold on this thing. I got it at Costco for $469 with the turbo head and floor tool. My only gripe is hair and some carpet fuzz wrapped around the beater bar and I had to pull it off, but that probably would have happened with anything else considering how much of it there was in the carpet. expensive but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vacuum I've Ever Owned!","review":"Bought this with a 20% off coupon at Bed, Bath and Beyond.

I highly recommend this model for others who are in a situation similar to mine.It's great. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dyson Animal","review":"I got one of these as I have a lot of pets, love purple and needed a new vacuum. I was skeptical about the claims but once I got it home and together I was amazed. I laughingly tell people I \\"could\\" be a vacuum cleaner salesperson. It works great, is easy to use and to empty. I also like the Zorb for refreshing the rugs. I was so thrilled I got another one (a cheaper version) for the upstairs. I don't use the beater much, but the basic vacuum and attachments are actually fun to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you don't need attachments","review":"The only (BIG) problem for me with the Animal is that it will NOT fit under beds and sofas and dressers and the attachments do not move at all well over the carpet. And it is so strong that it shuts off or eats bath rugs...So, while it may be the best cleaner FOR WHAT IS OUT IN THE OPEN it gets an F from me for cleaning under furniture. So really my room is not clean at all, when all the dust mites and dust remain under my bed. It still has all the problems of a clumsy upright with a bunch of attachments that rarely get used because it is such a hassle to stop everything and \\"attach\\" the attachments. UGH - still dusty in Virginia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Idea","review":"I used my friend's Dyson in my house last weekend and was APPALLED to see the grime in which I was living. GROSS! I myself have a Hoover Windtunnel that I really like(d), but now I am determined to buy a Dyson when my Windtunnel dies and I can afford one. Anyway, I wanted to comment on the people who say the Dyson is heavy; compared with my Hoover, this thing is a FEATHER, people. I really liked my Hoover EXCEPT for its weight, which was the only problem I ever had with it. The Dyson, in comparison, is so light, I wondered if it was even DOING anything, at least until I looked at the can thing and saw enough cat hair to build myself a whole litter of kittens. Try it! You can usually test them at electronics' stores... the weight is negligible, people... trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Ad Campaign, Doesn't Deliver","review":"Dyson's got a great advertising campaign. I bought the Dyson Animal DC14. It does have great suction and only clogged once in the 5 years I owned it...but it doesn't work on hardwood or tile floors (even with the special attachment) and I was disappointed to find that the animal hair attachment is not really self powered and didn't work very well. The beater bar had to be cleaned every time I used it and while it seemed to pick up dust from the carpet, it would not pick up anything else so I'd end up having to pick up bits of dirt, etc. that it would leave behind. I finally got rid of it when it started making a deafening noise that couldn't be fixed.It was so expensive! I honestly tried to work with it but it never really was a good vacuum. I would never buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's worth the price!","review":"I have had my Dyson for six months now and will never own anything else.

Well worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Term Disappointment","review":"An overpriced disappointment. A year into this machine and the cheap plastic construction and noise is starting to tell. I can not vacuum the house without the brush housing howling. This started with it as new and is not getting better. I am through with it and am going to the Hoover Wind Tunnel Ultra. There is a reason Consumer Reports puts this vacuum at 12 or 13 on the list.

Spike lee has had some good movies but this is his worst. I would have got more entertainment calling a phone sex operator instead of looking at this.

This film, which centers around the events of a young woman's passion to become an actress. (Played very well by the attractive Theresa Randle), Girl 6, becomes frustrated and broken, she takes a job as a phone sex operator. The job becomes her center-point as it sets a tone of dark strange obsession for her life. Interesting premise, the film is overlong, uneven and there is a lack of passion throughout its length.

Unfortunately it makes both of them unlikable and hard to sympathize with. The ease with which Vera's identity is stolen and her credit destroyed is terrifying, but it's also frightening to think that this book could be used as an instruction manual for any wannabe identity thief. Shute is terrific at writing out Vera's innermost thoughts, but she does so in a way that no one should ever be exposed, but perhaps that was her intention. The ending was disappointing to say the least. As the reader I wanted more anger from Vera. Perhaps the biggest flaw in the book is that Shute chose a poor character to be the protagonist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"I think the book had a pretty good subject for a story but the writing isn't interesting at all. The writing is just boring and bland. It's not really much of a story. The book offers some identity theft ideas on creating fake id's, obtaining credit information, and using it. The author tells the story without moral conscience. At no time does the main character ever seems to feel any guilt about stealing. There's no sympathy showed for the identity theft victim. Also, the book never shows the possible punishment for identity theft. In alot of ways it's very morally irresponsible.I borrowed this book for free from the library.

She has no passion, no trills, no high notes that are deep and rich. Her best is in the Russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding Mozart.Her broadcast from the Met Live of the I Puritani was alright, but scooping, avoidance of repetitions, running through passages like a locomotive, and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world..scooping again, and a tight awful sounding high note. The same tentativenes is also here on this CD.She should know this. Her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses, not the voice, which is forgiven everything.Too bad; she could be a lovely Tatyana some day.Also too, the Traviata is not that great; Anna Moffo , Renee Fleming, M.

Without Davies' incredibe wit & sarcasm, we never would've seen the birth of many other great goofball rock/power pop bands that came much later.

It is fun, it is heartbreaking, it is memorable, it is nostalgiac, it rocks, it soothes, it is very specific, it is universal. It is art of the highest order.Only one thing to add. This album gets unfairly lumped with other story-saga-opera albums the Kinks did around the same time. Some Kinks fans don't like those albums very much, for understandable reasons--the songs at times seemed secondary to the rather forced storylines Ray Davies was trying to complete.So, if you didn't like Preservation, and you didn't like Soap Opera, and you didn't like Schoolboys in Disgrace, and if you didn't (unbelievably) like Arthur or Lola vs. the Powerman, forget it-- you will still like this, indeed if you're a Kinks fan, you will love it.

This was the beginning of the end of The Kinks as far as I'm concerned. I saw them many times in concert in the '70s, primarily to hear their Reprise/Pye material live.

If you want to make a button hole, you have to buy a separate attachment which will cost around $40 at a good fabric store. Also, I was told by a professional seamstress that this machine is not designed for sewing denim. I tried sewing denim with a denim needle and I broke three needles. Also, I would recommend buying a small screwdriver - one this will fit in your palm because if you have to change out the needle, the screwdriver has to fit in the area to the right of the needle to take it out so it must be small enough. Also, you cannot pull your fabric in different directions in order to make decorative circular sewing patterns. You can only go forward and backwards. Like I said, this is for the beginner and it's very basic. I'll probably end up getting a higher-end model in the future once my skills improve. I would recommend this machine to a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a TERRIBLE machine","review":"This is by far the worst machine I've ever had the misfortune to buy.

The machine has good markings showing thread-line and adjustment setting dials on the machine. A cover of some sort would have been useful.

This is the first I have ever bought. So far I love it! It is small and lightweight, but heavy enough that it stays where it is put. My only problem is the instruction book. I had to keep flipping back and forth from the instructions to the diagram of the parts of the machine. Maybe just my inexperience. The English and Spanish instructions on the same pages made it take longer, I would have preferred to have all English in one section and the Spanish in another section. However, that does not take away from my enjoyment of the sewing machine itself. I have a friend who is a very experienced seamstress and she is impressed with the features for the price. I look forward to learning how to sew on my Brother sewing machine. As far as the pink - Yuck!, but I didn't choose it to fit my \\"decor\\"!

I took the nailer out of the box, slipped my hand under the \\"leather\\" pouch to try it on and, viola, the pouch ripped creating a large hole. I threw the pouch right in the trash!

Fortunately, these works were \\"reprinted\\" in the excellent AD&D Core Rules CD-ROM. This one includes everything you need to know to design and play a Ranger - chapters include requirements, level advancement, spell use, weapons and armor, tracking, animal empathy, natural lore, strongholds, followes, kits (such as the Explorer, Falconer, and Giant Killer), proficiencies, new spells and magic items, equipment, role-playing, religion, forgatherings, and more!

Being a reader of historical narratives I expected more about the actual crusades than the events leading up to and surrounding them.

The shiny silver material used for his automail arm has begun flaking off and his boot straps and hair tie came off quite easily, I have managed for the most part to restore him with the liberal application of super-glue and since that he has held up much better!

I decided on this one based on my research and I am glad I did. I make my husband fruit and juice smoothies almost every day after work and with this machine it is a fast, easy job. Ice and frozen fruit are blended into the drink very quickly.It is a little loud but it is worth the noise to have 500 watts of power. I also like the fact the base is heavy cast metal, the pitcher is thick, solid glass with a tight fitting lid and the blade is stainless. I like the easy to use control knob and the fact it has 2, yes just 2 speeds. I find most machines with 12 to 20 little buttons are fairly useless and all those speeds rarely used, they also take up more counter space because the bases have to be bigger for all the buttons.The fact that the Hamilton Beach comes in 6 colors is just icing on the cake and the Moroccan Red is gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Simple Design","review":"Nice, retro design- really great colors (I opted for the apple green).

It has some nice design features (good heavy base to prevent tipping, measuring cup built into the cap). However, I experienced the same problems that others here have -- the blender doesn't do well with anything thick like milkshakes. It just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly, forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart. While it worked OK for a while, the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Blender","review":"I have had this for a month and the rubber blades have sheared off.

This is the worst blender I have ever used. It sprays whatever I am blending all over the place every time I use it. The only way to keep it from doing this is to fill it only 1/4 full which completely defeats the purpose of having a blender with a large jar. It never crushes ice completely and the plastic piece on the top leaks even when it is screwed in as tightly as possible. I dread needing to use the blender for my recipes. The only positive aspect of this blender is that the base is sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, very poor performance, wonder how these others are happy with it...","review":"I bought this blender because I liked its retro design, and I thought it would function well. Well, every single time I've tried to use it has been a disaster. Even for very simple tasks, like blending soft avocado, the blender has not worked. The blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything... It's horrible.

This Kindle edition is quite obviously not properly formatted for the Kindle. Lines break in odd places, every time a word is italicized it bleeds into the word that follows (no spacing), chapter headings appear without proper spacing around them so the chapters blend into one another, page numbers crop up in the middle of paragraphs.

It seems to be written to pat the author's clients and contacts on the back, and to promote her business more than provide deep insight. Reading it felt more like a primer for \\"want to be\\" entreprenuers. It certainly didn't deliver on the promise of the subtitle \\"inside secrets for growing a billion dollar business.\\" Really? This is how you build a billion dollar business? The repetitive references, and lack of depth strucj me as \\"baby steps\\" at best.

Unlike the horrible American remake, it's not driven primarily by star power, and it's not dumbed down or otherwise changed to otherwise appeal to us Americans. Any of us -- dancers or not -- should be able to relate to the movie themes of longing, hope, and fulfillment; we can relate to feeling trapped, to doing the right things for the wrong reasons (and vice versa), to worrying about how others perceive us, and to overcoming challenges when we finally figure what we've gotta do and why :).That may all sound a bit philosophical and boring, but don't be deceived. This movie has slapstick, funny lines, at least one crazy wig, a wacky bathroom scene not involving a congressman or illicit behavior, and much more. So do rent or buy this movie; you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Purchase of \\"Shall We Dance\\"","review":"Movie is wonderful. The characters are lovable. A definite Friday night movie with a significant other."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Shall We Dansu?\\"-great story and cast!","review":"This has to be the best Japanese movie I've ever seen and my all time favorite! It's the story of a 40 something year-old salaryman who, after seemingly attaining all his goals in life, a wife and child, a company position with a bright future and a new house, begins to ponder if there's more to life than just the \\"9 to 5\\" grind and mortgage payments. During his train rides home from work, he notices a beautiful young woman standing in front of the window of a dance school. What happens after that might seem obvious, but me believe it's not...Even if you don't understand one word of Japanese, the subtitled version, like the touching story are so well written, that you'll want to watch it over and over again. I hope the rumors of this movie coming out in U.S. theatres are true because it's sure to be a hit, until then i'll be waiting for this one on DVD! Aoki-san Gambatte!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They can't remake this awsome classic!!","review":"This movie left us with such good feelings. It was well written, flowed gracefully. Great dialogue, dancing and laughter.I have seen the new version with Richard Gere. While it is a good movie, it's not this movie. Some of the dialogue they used was directly from the original and did not flow quite the same way. (i.e., the detective telling his assistant why the rude couple was disqualified \\" Its a british sport, after all\\" sounded forced and did not quite fit. All in all the original version gets my vote for the better movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC...PERIOD!","review":"THIS FILM MAKES YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORD PASSION, AND I DON'T MEAN AS IN, HOT AND HEAVY. MORE LIKE PASSIONATE IN A SUBTLE INNOCCENT WAY. EVERYONE IN THIS WELL ACTED FILM GAINS SOMETHING AS IN LEARNING WHAT TRUE DEVOTION IS! IT'S FUNNY, YET TOTALLY SINCERE. IT'S A LOVE STORY, YET IT IS NOT. IT'S SUBTLE, YET TO THE POINT. A MOVIE ABOUT DISCOVERY AND BELIEVING IN YOURSELF...AND TO ME...THAT'S WHAT TRUE PASSION IS! THIS MOVIE WARMS THE HEART. BRAVO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Crafted and Universal","review":"As an American preparing to watch this Japanese movie, I expected be taken to an exotic land, populated by characters having unfamiliar sensibilities, and hoped to be charmed by novel points of view and customs, even if I didn't \\"get\\" the humor. Instead, I was blown away by how much of myself I saw in the characters, and by the thrill of reexperiencing trials, values, and adventures so artfully created on the screen. The Japanese context seemed to amplify and liberate expression. I find it hard to imagine Mr. Tanaka's or Mr. Aoki's outbursts in an American dance studio, but their emotional eloquence in the movie stood for feelings of inadequacy and joy that get to the essence of their journey (and mine). I discovered ballroom dance in mid-life, and this movie was right-on, from the internal struggles to the technicalities of teaching and learning and performing ballroom dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shall we sit this dance out - I've two left feet.","review":"I had heard that this was really worthwhile DVD to see. I was disappointed. I felt that the acting was wooden & the film didn't move along - it had a tendency to get bogged down. Also the stars seemed to be self-conscious when dancing. I had seen \\"Shall We Dance\\" with Richard Gere & Jennifer Lopez before I saw the Japanese version & felt that it had big shoes to fill. I wasn't wrong. Richard Gere's \\"Shall We Dance\\"? is streets ahead with an immensely watchable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guy's film","review":"Truly a film to watch from beginning to end, not one to leave your seat during.

Finally a film a man can watch alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as being there!","review":"Can't visit Japan? This movie is the next best thing. I laughed hysterically. What brought me back a second time, however, was the chance to reexperience the bittersweetness understood by anyone who has ever lived in Tokyo. Shall We Dance? elegantly portrays the uniquely Japanese angst of a Tokyo salary man and his struggle to rediscover joy and meaning within the existential nightmare of modern Japan. Why live it when you can watch it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A World Lesson","review":"So often foreign films acquired for the US consumer were what at one time was called, \\"avant garde,\\" which often meant weird, with hidden depths, exploratory and thoughtful, however not particularly pleasing or ensemblematic.Shall We Dance- the Japanese original- has depth in unique character projections that extend beyond that which is customary. Not only do the actors play off the ensemble, intermingling, but from that of themselves. Once having seen the \\"Office Walk,\\" you won't forget the worker lost in his World, a part of and yet apart from. And then, the night alone practice session on the train platform where the main character who was apart from has become a part of. . . .Shall We Dance is a well executed ensemble of that which is before and behind the camera. It is representative of international cinema where: Nothing happens--and everything is going on.However, the American remake with Richard Gere never gets out of the barn even with the doors open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shall We Dance?","review":"My Husband and I have been discovering foreign movies lately and this movie was a charming and heartwarming story that I thought about for days afterwards. The wide range of people types -- the fat student with the diabetes and the quirky guy with the wig, the prima donna dancer, the older satisfied-with-her-life dancer, the unhappy plump dancer that Mr. S dances with in the end, even the wife and daughter -- all can be identified as real people you have met in your life. Each person was touched by another and I liked watching each character and the learning that was taking place in their individual lives. I was touched and fascinated by this wonderful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie great, DVD is not","review":"Note, I am NOT referring to the American REMAKE starring Richard Gere. I am referring to this American DVD release of the Japanese film.I give this Japanese movie 5 stars. However, I give this particular product one star. This American DVD release cut almost 20 minutes from the full Japanese version! Also, the voiceover narration at the beginning of the film is altered! I understand why the studios might think that the film in its entirety might not \\"sit well\\" with American audiences, but I honestly don't think that would've changed people's opinion of this classic film.Perhaps, most of you do not mind, but that is a great travesty to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shall We Dance?","review":"Delightful from head to heel, this sweet-natured comedy examines the liberation of a buttoned-down salaryman in a society where flamboyant self-expression is a kind of unspoken taboo, especially for the respectable middle classes. Yakusho plays the role of flowering hoofer with hilarious awkwardness and genuine joy, while real-life ballerina Kusakari is luscious as the sexy partner who mentors him for a dance competition. Much of the film's humor arrives in the person of Tomio (Naoto Takenaka), Shohei's co-worker by day and an outlandishly attired rumba specialist by night. For sheer, exhilarating feel-good fun, \\"Dance\\" is a hard act to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smiles all around","review":"This is one of the happiest movies around.

I rented it here in Japanese the first time and while it was great, it was helpful to have subtitles to catch some nuances I'd missed. I can vouch for the subtitles being well done, which is often not the case for American movies subtitled in Japanese... I urge anyone who hasn't seen it to buy it to share with friends and family.

One becomes deeply involved in what becomes of these characters; they each have endearing strengths and very human weaknesses.One need not have an interest in ballroom dancing to be captivated by this film. It left me feeling silly and happy, and I found myself pondering the film in subsequent days. It is a tender, sweet story and an admirable, first-rate production. After the first few moments, the subtitles are not even a consideration or distraction.A \\"must see.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is The Original Version Of The Movie","review":"This one of my most favorite movies of all-time (not the only one).

So I went to the bookstore yesterday looking for a reference manual and picked up this one. I was eager to see the descriptions for embedding video, the new testing capabilities (drag and drop, matching, etc.) But I couldn't find anything.Perhaps I missed something. But the book seemed more like a Flash 5.5 manual than an MX manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased The Complete Reference: Dreamweaver 4 and was extremely happy with the book, but perhaps that's because I was new to Dreamweaver and it fulfilled most of my learning needs. So, when I purchased The Complete Reference: Flash MX, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, those expectations were never realized. Using this book I didn't see much difference between Flash 5 and Flash MX, just a rehash of the old. I was anxious to learn about skins and it was barely mentioned with no instructions on how to alter. Still in the trial period before purchasing Flash MX, I regret my purchase as it now just sits on my shelf, unopened, and I feel that I should have waited until I ordered Flash MX and purchased the book that comes with the program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flash 5 or MX?","review":"I'm sorry for the author, but i see not much about Flash MX in this book and a lot about Flash 5. Just a fiew pages about components and a superficial tractation on actionscript. The rest of the book is a good book about Flash animation, but not suitable to learn applications development in Flash(that is supposed to be one of the Flash MX main goals)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for advance user.","review":"I am so disappointed that this book worth nothing for advance user. I don't think that this book has covered all the features of Flash MX. I expect this The Complete Reference book could save me time and money to learn Flash MX however this book failed its promises. I DON'T like this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst I've seen in a long time","review":"This has no examples of Action Script that are useful. I continually pick it up and give it another chance, but time and time again I find frustration. I am very dissapointed in this book.

The vendor knows the game will sell because: 1) Quake has an enormous name share in the gaming market, and 2) there haven't been any great PS2 games released lately. I hope Sony and software companies stop taking advantage of the PS2 consumers by releasing medicocore games. Quake had so much potential for PS2, but the almighty dollar blinded EA, and they chose to sacrafice quality in exchange for a quick profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This game is the worst in its genre. After the 2nd quake, which was also bad, came something even worse quake 3 arena. After playing the pc, then renting the game for ps2 i realized that both were bad. Terrible controls, you can't win on normal diffuculty since the guys kill you easily, and the arenas are small and are terrible-looking graphics. Don't buy this game, it is a waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game SUCKS","review":"I love Quake so when I heard about this one I was so glad so I bought it and brought it home and guess what it sucked it wasnt like Quake 2 or anything It pissed me off If you are a quake fan dont buy this one Its a real disapointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quake 3: Revolution is not worth the money.","review":"I would suggest renting this game before buying it. Yes, the graphics are good. Not the best I've seen but good. The part that this game goes down hill is game play. Your opponents just run around in the same pattern over and over. The controls aren't that in-depth. Just a basic zoom and I do mean basic the same for every gun, run, and strafe are about all these controls go into. Multiplayer on this game just don't compare to other games in this such category. I don't know if I would even spend the money to rent but if you think about getting this game it would be the way to go before buying. It was a nice first try for EA but not good enough. If you want a good first Person game get Time splitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quake III Revolution for PS2","review":"This game is excellent if u like games like doom and timesplitters. I find this game slightly better than timesplitters, but it is very slow. The controls are very easy, but aiming up and down can be a pain if you are in that kind of situation. I guess i gave it four stars because it is the best game of its kind by far,for its slow speed i took one off. I can probably finish 2 eggs and orange juice while it is loading the level. I love the gameplay because they actually went a little past a few drops of blood spilling out, unlike most games. Don't buy this game unless you have friends to play multiplayer with, because it can get boring playing the same thing over and over just to beat the vadrigar. THAT'S ALL !!happy gaming!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Playstation butchers another one!","review":"Ok lets be honest, Playstation has already bought out Dreamcast in their babyish attempt to get rid of competition. You're going to see Sonic the Hedgehog on PS2 soon. But one thing that itches me is that they butchered Quake 3. Its a mere shadow of its former self now that PS2 got its grubby and greedy little hands on it. The graphics are one thing thats merely good. Dreamcast version was BETTER, because it had more availabilities. Now that the moneyhogs at Sony got their wish of getting rid of competition (the Dreamcast whooped it big time), you will begin to see Sega-based titles appear on the PS2. Maybe we'll see Mario on the Playstation 2 in a few years. Who knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quake 3: Revolution","review":"I think this game is great. It has great graphics, the gameplay is faster than Timesplitters, and their are more arenas around 30. The game also contains 12 high powered waepons and well over 30 characters to choose from. It has single player and team mmodes. The advance control setting is the easiest to learn you can pick it up in less than 10 minutes. This is a great game if you have a multitap and want to shoot it out with three friends on the weekend, the entire game including the single player mode is like a big multiplayer mode they set you in an area and kill as many people you can or capture the flag there is no real mission except raise your players attributes. The only thing that take away from the game are the EXTREMELY long load times ,but it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it first","review":"I read such glowing reviews of this game that I went out and bought it without giving it a test drive. This has to be without a doubt the most boring game that I have ever played. The graphics are below average and the game speed is so fast that you basically run around hoping to gather two frags before dying and starting over. I normally am a big Activision fan, but I feel like this genre is not really where their game designing strength lies. Many people apparently enjoy this game, but I would think twice before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"very fun","review":"I didn't find the controlls to be clumsy. I happen to like movement/straife on the left and look on the right analog. Many people I know however, don't. Other than that, the game is an excellent challenge when put on the easiest level. Make sure you have your memory card, which they don't seem to be able to stock anywhere in Louisville, Kentucky. I love the graphics, moveability, weapons, and enemies. Drawback: it is set-up only as a deathmatch type game, as opposed to the doom challenge of getting through the levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beet juice extract is high quality and reasonably priced","review":"Sonne's Whole Beet Plant Juice tastes good, improves my health, and is reasonably priced.

A piece of flexible, clear plastic, and elastic band and a clear plastic stick.The instructions came with it and were short and easy to understand.After a little practice and with some preparation, such as curling with hot rollers and spraying the hair with hairspray, the Twistii is very successful for creating a quick and easy updo style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I had a Twistee.

Only 4 stars because it isn't the sturdiest, but for the price it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whacked wheel","review":"Ordered this to take on vacation at the beach tried it inside of house, not impressed. On carpet or wood floors the front wheel has a mind of it's own, can only go straight and once the wheel starts to turn you can't control it. I took it outside to see if any difference, on pavement it handled a whole lot better. My dogs both seem to love it I just don't know if it is going to work well going from outside to inside or if it's going to be more hassle than what it's worth. It did arrive within just 3 days which was very fast. Putting it together was simple, although I was missing a front faceplate I did get a rain cover for it that wasn't mentioned? Just wished they could do something about the front tire. I'd probably go with a 4 wheeled on if I could do over."},{"rating":"1","title":"This may not work for cats","review":"I ordered this but found I could not use it for my cats and ended up giving it to a friend for her two dogs. The problem is that there are gaps between the top and the bottom of the stroller that makes it very easy for kitty to get his head out of. Once a cat gets their head out, the rest of the body follows. It was my intent to use this to walk my cat outside but with other animals and cars I can't take a chance with any gaps where kitty could wiggle out. The wheels are great, the material seems good, it all seems well made but it's a dog stroller not a cat stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just for the spoiled","review":"Wow, finally was able to take our two spoiled cats, \\"zoi\\" and \\"tigger\\" out on their maiden stroller ride.

The reason is that the only listing of saints is the Table of Contents, which follows a strictly chronological pattern. There is no index in the back (only a table chronologically listing saints by the year of their death). Thus, if you want information on St. Frances Xavier Cabrini, for example, you'd better know the date of her memorial or else you'll have to go through the entire table of contents, before you spot her name with the other December saints."},{"rating":"1","title":"religious","review":"A starting point in studying the lives of the saints but lacks a lot of depth that the full set has."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD rom available.","review":"I understand there is a CD rom available which contains four volumes.

With music as her weapon otep obliterates the norm of knowledge. Finding grounds between the mind of Manson and the voice of Corpsegrinder and with the help of Joey Jordison (drums) on a few tracks. This album is basically a blend of nu metal, strange atmospheric sounds together with a suicidal voice of this world.

Although this album isn't filled with great tracks like blood pigs we get a similar formula album (ie: songs broken up with vocal tracks) with a bunch of neat songs with good lyrics. Two of my favorites are Warhead and Nein. I really like the lyric on Suicide Trees : \\"I wasn't there, I'm not involved, I'm innocent, It's not my fault\\".

The song structures and progressions are arranged in a really weird way. I thought this sounds like a poetry reading with some heavy riffs thrown in over the words.

They had more depth and relevance than Otep could ever dream of.Don't buy this album.

The heavy bag end is awesome. The tubing is burley enough to support not only a 100lb. bag, but 220 lb. me at the same time and not flex one bit. The bag bottom tie-downs are in a good location, not too far forward or backward of the bag's top center. The speed bag end works well with a 10x7 on the supplied swivel, otherwise if you prefer smaller or bigger pick up a new swivel for smoother action. Lastly, GET SOME WIGHT! as in four 25lb. plates, times three. The stand has three weight studs to provide more stability when getting out your aggressions. I recommend 25lb plates because if you have a decently wide stance or want to do some angle work, 35 and 40lb. plates make a much smaller footprint to maneuver in. All in all, I feel good about the deal I got on this thing for the durability alone. That's what I wanted, that's what I got. Oh, the paint job is nice too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This mouse is great except for one minor detail... every now and then it just jumps accross my screen.

There is then a second or so of lag after you move the mouse again before the cursor moves again. This makes the mouse UNUSABLE for games! It also makes it very frustrating to do any fine work with CAD or graphics.The sort of lag I am talking about is typical of cordless mice, where, as your would it expect, it has to conserve as much battery power as possible. But this is a not a cordless mouse! It seems that logitech used the same parts from their cordless mouse in this corded one and the results are terrible. To make matters worse sometimes the mouse doesn't want to wake up at all without physically picking it up and shaking it violently. At other times it appears to sleep, then wake randomly on its own. In some apps the mouse cursor vanishes off screen entirely when the mouse decides to sleep, then reappears on the other side of the screen. Like I said, its unusable for games."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst mouse ever","review":"The mouse jumps up and down on the screen like it is a live mouse. Never ever buy this model any more.

I'm totally sold and would never go back to the old roller ball type. Just ordered this mouse (I love to get something for nothing) with the current FAR deal. Mouse is well constructed. Plug N Play. While the mouse is USB it can be used via the normal PS/2 mouse port with the provided adapter. Software included allows you total control over your pointing device and its function. While installing the mouse software it claimed that the mouse operates at 800 dpi if used on a USB port (slightly less when using the PS/2 port). Mouse ergonomics are good for my hands (X-large). It even loooks good especially with the Sony system I installed it on. Works fantastic in Win XP Home.

What I mean is this: attempting to move the mouse quick from one side of the screen to the other will result in the optical sensor failing and the cursor simply getting confused instead of making the trip across the screen. Gamers (especially the FPS variety) will find this an extreme detriment to their gaming ability.

I also happen to be lucky enough to have one at work and all 3 of mine plus the 4th have always performed perfectly. No need to install the software at all on a Mac, and mor than accurate enough. As a gamer and a graphic designer I've had no problems with speed or accuracy, the buttons are responsive and natural and the wheel works great.It's not \\"ergonomic\\" but I've found it more comfortable than my old MS Optical which was, and more reliable too.

It eliminates the need for the mouse pad and for taking out the little ball and cleaning it. You really can run it off of every surface.

It simply is a standard 3 button scrolling optical mouse (with the scroll wheel as the third button). It does everything you expect the way you expect. Just plug it in, and use it. Whether you use the Mouseware software to configure it or not, you still get precise control over the cursor.It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of some mice (with the extra thumb button, or cordless recharging station), but if you want a simple accurate mouse for a very reasonable price, it's hard to top this one. The only downside is that its tracking accuracy severely goes down on reflective materials (including shiny magazine covers), so if you use this with a laptop, be sure to keep an inexpensive fabric mousepad (don't use one with the smooth reflective finish) with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balless Wonder","review":"My old ball mouse started acting weird, so I thought I'd upgrade.

The equations in the book does not match up with the equations used in the FE Supplied Reference book provided by NCEES during the FE exam so it's frustrating to study two sets of equations (with different units) for the same material. It'sinconvenient and time consuming.2.) Each chapter has a tiny review section that supplies equations and a few examples (if examples are provided) then users can try the practice problems at the end. The problem is that the review is VERY basic and hardly skims the surface of the subject matter therefore it is not enough for a thorough review of the subject. This means, I have to grab out my old textbooks and look up each topic and review from them if I still own the textbook.3.)

Although the acting and writing are well done, the story drones on, without any mention at all of perhaps the most interesting twist of all in the tale: the US Supreme Court holding a virtually unprecedented special session to hear oral arguments in a habeas corpus petition on behalf of the spies whose attorney (an Army colonel, no less!)claimed they should be tried in a regular court room, not by a secret military commission. THe case is Ex Parte Quirin, and is a case anyone interested in military commissions or WW 2 should read. The Supreme Court denied their petition and they were executed.

Can't remember...The rest is very mediocre; given the fact the woman's voice is no longer the one of the '60's/'70's and '80's is no excuse...Feels like all this material has been thrown in too fast to have an Aretha Franklin release on the market.Better job next time, 'Ree!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Attempt at a Paula Abdul dance sound doesn't work here","review":"Aretha Franklin has always made quality music.

There's too much of attempt of her trying to go for that Paula Abdul dance sound on most of the uptempo numbers. Only Everyday People stands out because it's funky. But the other songs like Mary Goes Round, and the lame title song the members of Surface did, come off flat. Aretha sounds out of place on them and it would sound best if Paula or Janet Jackson did the songs. Doctor's Orders with Luther Vandross doesn't grab me.

Also in \\"Pro\\" season and playoff mode, the game has a function that will automatically allow the team you are playing to catch up with you. So if you have a five-run lead, the next five guys you pitch to, no matter who they are, will hit solo home runs. Kind of defeats the purpose of competition, doesn't it?

I may have been wrong about that, but definitely not wrong about the 'sister' part. Their self-title debut album is full of songs that give contrasting emotions that make me want to dance one minute and resort to self-mutilation the next. And when one song can do that, you know it's gold. (Just like the gold lame pants the 'sister' lead singer wore on the SNL performance.) And if their own songs weren't genius enough, Scissor Sisters had the audacity to cover Pink Floyd's \\"Comfortably Numb\\" - the result sounding like screeching cats stuck in a garbage disposal. I look forward to their next album, if there is enough skin surface left for me to abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER-RATED, OVER-HYPED","review":"My best friend called me the other day raving about this disc and insisted that I go out and buy a copy. \\"It's FABULOUS!\\" he squealed.

I had heard their cover of Comfortably Numb in a nightclub and thought it was just \\"OK\\" ( I'm not a fan of disco-fied covers of old rock songs...they tell me the artist in question doesn't have a lot to offer, especially considering this is their first CD .) What I really liked is the song \\"It Can't Come Quickly Enough\\" which is on the Party Monster soundtrack. Moody, melodic, and just groovy enough. THAT'S what I was expecting this album to sound like. Was I ever wrong. Most of it sounds like something you'd hear on AM radio circa 1972 - in and of itself not such a bad thing, but here I JUST DON'T GET IT. Besides \\"It Can't Come Quickly Enough\\" and the Elton John-ish \\"Take Your Mama\\", the remainder of the album is just too light weight for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMERICA THE BEST COUTRY IN THE WORLD?","review":"....

Who is that? Oh, man, this is Scissor Sisters? At first, I was irritated by their take on Comfortably Numb, being that it is hard for me to listen to a mix of Elton John meets Communards at a Village People concert - but there are a lot of gems on this album.Return to Oz has been on my \\"A-List\\" for weeks now. I simply love the song. I think the lead singer reminds me more of T.Rex than Elton John, and their music certainly has a \\"Take me back to the glam rock days\\" feel to it.

Scissor Sisters are a lot of fun. Though to be truthful, I doubt I would've given them a listen without seeing sexy lead singer Jake Shears strut his stuff on SNL. (Hey, I have my shallow moments) Yeah, they bring to mind the Bee Gees, but so what? The momentum starts to sag about 3 quarters through, so I'm only giving it 4 stars, but this is an impressive debut. Will be interesting to see what they come with for their next outing. For Pink Floyd fans, I have only one thing to say to you: GET OVER IT! And for the rest of the detractors: Is it true people who hate disco CAN'T DANCE??? Not recommended for people who just want to sit and listen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"4+ stars ! Will it last? I hope ! EXCELLENT!","review":"Been seeing the name 'Scissor Sisters' around now for a while. Initially I didn't read and dismissed it as a 'gay' plot to sell some crappy music. Well I installed iTunes this morning and downloaded the album and was more than pleasantly surprised. This work is great MUSIC that isn't heard much these days, musicians jamming and working up a sweat to give me a healthy, happy and good-time experience. I LOVE IT! Will it last, hopefully.

Now I wish that I had. It's about time that rock bands embrace straight-up disco and pop. Screw the whole post punk disco revival. This is much better. The Scissor Sisters can actually write hooks. It's actually fun to listen to this band! More groups should do this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very refreshing","review":"This sounds kind of like music of the past and of today combined, a very nice combination if I may add. I will agree with an earlier reviewer, sometimes the singer sounds very much like Elton John, other times he doesn't.

I instantly fell in love with the song, so I thought I'd take a chance with the CD. I wasn't disappointed. Lots of good songs here. My favorite cuts are Take Your Mama, Lovers in the Backseat, Music Is The Victim, & It Can't Come Quickly Enough. The only thing wrong with the CD is the cover of Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb. Horrible!! There is just no excuse for it, so I always skip it.Otherwise, it's a lot of fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"did they sell out?","review":"so i thought scissor sisters' REAL debut was way better. this is like some record exec took control of the band and said \\"okay what youre doing is great... but could you add a guitarist, bassist, and drummer, and kind of not sound like yourselves?\\" i somehow got ahold of a bootlegged copy of scissor sisters' original debut, which was pretty much electro-disco-funk, and was PERFECT. missing here are some really great songs like \\"electrobix\\", \\"step aside for the man\\", and \\"someone to touch (how many times)\\", a few of my favorite songs EVER. so i still love them, theyre way great and im happy that they are becoming popstars in the uk, but i wish they were more like they used to be. sob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything old is new again","review":"A friend introduced me to two songs from this group and I got hooked and ordered a few CDs.

Nothing special. I thought they were trying to sound too much like the Bee Gees. Although I like the Bee Gees, their copycat falsettos rubbed me the wrong way.And then they played their second song, and once I heard the lyrics, I cringed: they took a classic Pink Floyd song, \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" and disco-fied it (they even had the Bee Gee's Stayin' Alive \\"ah ah ah\\"'s in there, what the heck?). I like disco music, but that song is NOT meant to be a disco song.If they had done a decent cover of it, I may not be as disturbed as I am now.

Smith's word pictures are in vivid color - multidimensional - and accurate.

In this book I find the plot somewhat artificial; Wilbur Smith is out of his homeground.

The music is beautiful! Usually I hate soundtracks that just play music, no lyrics at all. This soundtrack is different because whenever I listen to it, I visulize the scenes in my mind. My favorite song on the CD is \\"Rose\\" because my fave scene is when Jack and Rose are on the bow of the ship together and they kiss. The music is beautiful and it reminds me of that scene. James Horner is a great composer and James Cameron did a great job directing the movie. \\"Titanic\\" is my favorite movie of all time and my favorite CDs are Back to Titanic, Titanic and My Name is JOE by Joe.

IMO, the only listenable music is after the ship sinks. The vocals are quite good, but I don't think that should've give it the Oscar. They probably thought since Titanic had won practically everything else, why not give it Best Score, too. Something that might have saved it, however, would be the lack of a synthesized choir. It is a good thing that Dion's song only appeared once, though. All in all, this score (I repeat SCORE for those of you who only bought the CD for that gravy train song.) is pretty much uninteresting. If you buy any James Horner CD, make sure it's WILLOW. It's kinda hard to find, but can be purchased at AMAZON for a very inexpensive price.

It just means so much that I can't even explain it. Mr. Horner is cosidered one of the most high people in the world to me. You can tell that Mr.Horner really puts his whole heart and soul into what he writes, and thats what makes it so special to me. I could just listen to the Titanic soundtracks for the rest of my life and never get tired of them.

How could SHE win over the GOO GOO DOLLS and Iris, which is without a doubt a million times better and actually TALKS about love, instead of babbling about how a person's heart is protecting another person (I know it's really sopposed to be romantic, and I understand the \\"Sweet, deep, thought-provoking lines.

Many will not agree but when you listen to it closely, the rhythm, words or no words, touch deep within the heart. These can even bring tears to your eyes. When I first saw the movie, I didn't think of it much but sad, now that it's been a few years since I saw it, I can relate to the movie, not with the experiences but with the music that was made for it. It really makes a connection. This has been so far, the best soundtrack I have ever heard, and the movie, is my all time favorite. I really hope that once, when you get a chance to listen to the item played, you can hear their meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent soundtrack!! One of my favorites!","review":"With this soundtrack James Horner has established himself among one of the best composers. James creates a grandness to the Titanic in Track 3 and he conveys the emotions of the movie beautifuly. I would say that this is James's best soundtrack.

From the musical expression of the Titanic's promises and purpose . . . to the fear and terror that emulates the ship's demise and the people (most importantly) along with it. But, not to despair for too long . . . Horner's ability to show hope after hopelessness is just as powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Titanic is DEEP","review":"This was quite possibly the first time in history that music matched a movie with perfection. The music is sad, haunting and deep. James Horner knows music! Some parts of the soundtrack are boring. Other parts are really uplifting. This soundtrack brings so many emotions. If you haven't seen the movie then you CAN'T relate to the soundtrack. See the movie in order to appreciate this soundtrack. This soundtrack has to given it's props for the complexity.

There is nothing to keep me interested, a bunch of over-produced and lifeless songs, including a horrible Celine Dion track that is a cure for insomnia (and a full stomach).

When I finally got home and put it in my CD player, I fell asleep the second the music started. It also began to annoy me. It's pretty much the same song over and over again. Even the song \\"My heart will go on\\" began to annoy me. That was all anyone heard on the radio for like 4 months.

Crap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might well be the most overrated score ever written","review":"First of all, James Horner is talented; VERY talented, that is.But Titanic is so horribly overrated that it makes you cringe. Yes, the title song is something special; wait, it WAS something special before it was played to death in the media. James Horner uses My Heart Will Go On as the main theme of the score and that's about the only theme there is. Listen, James, when a score is this long, one theme is just not enough. At some points, the score lacks musical tension, like in An Ocean Of Memories.Also, what bothers me like hell, is the overuse of sythesized sounds. A movie that big (or at least made big) screams for a deep orchestral sound. I am a defender of the opinion that a sythesized choir always sounds terrible, no matter how good it was mixed; and Horner uses it quite often in this score.So, whatever thousands of thirteen year old girls tell you, this score isn't worth all the fuss. And definitely not worth the Academy Award."},{"rating":"1","title":"no please stop it!!","review":"this soundtrack is no good.celine's song \\"my heart will go on\\" was overplayed on mtv,vh1,and radio.it's went on and on and very shuted up.the other songs are just orchesta junk.don't invest your money it this cd,it's no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated because of one hit single","review":"With the exception of \\"My heart will go on\\" by Celine Dion, Horner's soundtrack is not a masterpiece but a bunch of stinking skunks who are masked by a field of sweet smelling flowers.For a soundtrack score it is not riveting and really lacks any emotional connection to the film. Overall it is just really overrated and the hit single got played so much that the masses just fell into a typical zombie trance and went marching to the store to buy it. This was after they kept returning to the theater to see a fictional tale of love built around a tragic, awful event.It didn't stop them though; they could not get enough of seeing all those depictions of people freezing to death in the water. Overall a below average soundtrack that road the coat tails of a hit single that was shoved down our throats for an entire year."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassment to other Oscar winners","review":"A caveat first: not all the music on here is atrocious, and Horner has done plenty of other decent composing -- though I still find him overrated as a two-time Oscar winner. But this award represents the triumph of emotive pandering over substance and originality. Overwrought and cliche, sometimes even when real instruments are featured, this music does not pass the test of time.Orchestral samples were still in their infancy when used in the actual soundtrack. Perhaps Horner was trying to be original in using them or showcase the technology of the time, but to today's listener they sound cheesy and cliche. Perhaps Cameron shares much of the blame for the poor music decisions.It's been a while since I saw the film, but the 30-second previews from Amazon were enough to convince me not to buy this soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, for its' instrumentals.","review":"Personally, I could care less if I ever hear \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" again. However, the instrumentals on this cd are wonderful. They may not be Bach or Beethoven, but they are pretty, and a pleasure to listen to. Buy this cd for the instrumental music, not for the movie or Celine Dion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy if you want a shiny coaster you can check your hair in.","review":"Granted I'm not a big fan of the film. But the music is downright bad. I can't believe that James Horner won the Oscar for this uninspired glorified elevator music. And that he won over both John Williams and Philip Glass is almost lunacy. Even though I didn't think much of the movie I still have to admit that some of the visuals were pretty epic. This music my use the same computers but it never matches the impressive visuals. It could have been better if REAL INSTRUMENTS were used. This soundtrack sounds like some sort of limp techno classical. I won't comment on the Celine Dion song because it would be biased to base my hatred of that song on the failure of the entire CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music if you want to go to sleep","review":"This cd is the same tune over and over, and it sucks.

The Titanic soundtrack is a big dissapointment. Those weird native flutes and Celine Dion make a perfect combination for more than enough torture. Personally, Titanic gets way too mush recognition already. It might've been a good movie if people didn't go completely nuts over it! Leo DiCaprio, get a new job. As for the soundtrack, you're better off spending your money on something else. Maybe a good CD or something worth listening to. Sorry Kate! I have to give Titanic 2 thumbs down. WAY DOWN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a lousy cd","review":"no one in their right mind should buy this cd. please go and use your money more wisely!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough.","review":"The party seen in steerage with \\"Galic Storm\\" playing the Irish \\"diddly-d\\" music where Rose and Jack Danced togheter was one of the musical hightlights of the movie, yet was not included on the soundtrack. When I hear some of the songs that replaced it, I cant help but wonder who made that decision. I had to buy Gaelic Storm's CD to hear the song. I was pleasently suprised as the entire CD was fantastic, so this soundtrack [being] so bad, turned me onto another good one. I guess thats why it got at least 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horner is a good composer, but he bombed Titanic!","review":"Although I am a big fan of Horner, this is one of the few scores he has written that I was absolutely dissapointed in. It sounds SO electronic, and has no trace of the orchestral sound the Horner is famous for. Even the voice choir often heard is enough to drive you crazy, and if you ask me, it would have sounded excellent had Horner used an actual orchestra and voice choir. This is merely my opinion, but Horner strayed way to far from his excellent orchestra style he used in \\"The Rocketeer\\" and \\"Willow.\\" Don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE THE RMS TITANIC","review":"I LOVE THE TITANIC SO MUCH I WATCH THE MOVIE 1000 TIMES I THINK IT IS A VERRY SAD MOVIE I AM SHRER THE FRIST OFFICER MUREY THINKS IT IS SAD TOO I FELL VERRY UPSET BECAUSE IT SANK I LOVE TITANICCCCCCCCCCCC"},{"rating":"2","title":"love is all you need","review":"I loved learning and seeing about Titanic.

I've seen the movie 11 times, including the 5 times that I saw it in 2 weeks. James Cameron, LEONARDO DiCAPRIO and Kate Winslet demonstrate exactly how a motion picture should be made. The movie, soundtrack and book score a ten out of ten, a 25 out of 25, 100%, (whatever you want to call it) in my book and will reamain there for as long as I can think ahead to in my life.

It not only gives the reader a foundation upon which to become more entranced, it also carries with it the memories of those who are not alive today to tell us of the great ship. The pain staking detail upon which Cameron based his ideal movie has become a magical time machine of-sorts, recreating not just fact, but also feeling, thus creating the perfect motion picture...This Book is a must!!!

Celine Dions song my heart will go on is absolutley beautiful. My choir sings this song. A wonderful cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Titanic is great","review":"This CD consists of variations of the same piece. My favorite were \\"Southampton\\" and \\"Rose\\". \\"Southampton\\" is such a glorious piece; it gives a sense of pride. \\"Rose\\" is a beautiful piece that captured the romance in the film. But the others like \\"Distant Memories\\" and \\"An Ocean of Memories\\" pretty much sounded the same. As well as \\"Never an Absolution\\" and \\"A Hymn to the Sea\\". There are way too many similar songs but this is CD is worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD but only 1 good song on it!!","review":"My Heart Will Go On is the a great and sad song because I can recall the scenes from the Movie. I love the song but I would only recomend the CD to Titanic and Leo lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT IS A GREAT CD!!!","review":"I realy liked this CD. Who cares if only one of the songs had any singing, the songs that did not have singing in them were still so buttiful!

But still if you fell in love with \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" has much as I did you'll love this CD:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the music and see the Titanic","review":"I purchased the soundtrack prior to watching the movie. Even so, I found that I could picture scenes, actions and emotions of the various characters aboard the real Titanic all those years ago. That alone made the CD worth the money and time spent. I liked \\"Rose\\" and \\"Southampton\\" but I felt chills going down my spine while listening \\"Hymn to Sea\\" which, in my opinion, is a fitting finale that encompasses the whole tragedy of the Titanic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audiophiles, take note...","review":"In addition to this being an excellent film score in its own right (aside from the Celine Dion number ;-), it has a superb sound quality with wide dynamic range. This CD makes for an excellent test of speaker and/or headphone quality, as the macrodynamic volume changes are frequent and often. Particularly track #7, \\"Hard to Starboard\\" is just stunning through Sennheiser HD-580 headphones. Recommended both as a great film score, and for its great sound quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"James Horner is a musical genius","review":"I am a big fan of James Horner, and I think this cd is the one that really got me into his music. If you like orchestrated scores with emotion, action, beauty, and just sheer talent as far as music composing goes, then you may want to consider listening to this cd. The more I listen to it the more I love it! When I listen to it, scenes from both the movie and my imagination pop into my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sheer masterpiece","review":"I'd have to say that out of all of Titanic's Oscar-winning catergories, the music would probably have to be my favorite. It expresses all of the performed emotions in the film rather splendidly.My one and only complaint would have to be that the selected music on the cd can feel sparse at times. But I still highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind Control must be involved","review":"How is this so popular? It's not bad but I'm just amazed by the popularity."},{"rating":"2","title":"the greatest soundtrack ever!!!!!!!","review":"I absolutely love this cd. The only one that is better is the Back To Titanic soundtrack. I highly recommend this cd. I litterally cannot say enough about it to do it justice. The music, is beautiful and haunting, while at other times fast and envigorating. The song Southamton and Take Her Out To Sea, really captures the hope and expectation and energy of those scenes. James Horner is a musical genius because with this he has really captured exactly what the soundtrack should sound like."},{"rating":"2","title":"HORNER'S BEST","review":"Ask anyone and they'll tell you---TITANIC has some of the most beautifully written music ever. No wonder James Horner's score won award after award. Simply put, the music is heart-wrenching, emotional, passionate, and breathtaking all at the same time. Just close your eyes and visualize yourself back in time --- in an innocent, more naive period of time. It's hard to select a favorite, but I'm quite sure you'll agree that \\"Rose\\" is one of the most amazing pieces of music ever composed. Also included is Celine Dion singing that all-too-familiar epic ballad, \\"My Heart Will Go On\\". Pick up this astonishing soundtrack to a spectacular film."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Horner is superb...","review":"This album is James Horner's most wonderful work of art, a masterpiece. For movie fans out there, this soundtrack is a must have. For Titanic fans especially, they're going to enjoy this one very much. It's beautiful, melodic style captures the movie's most poignant moments, with bitter-sweet sounds of the ulean pipe, pennywhistle, and other irish instruments. This soundtrack is a must own for fans of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"arch","review":"i do not know what is worse, the movie or the music. don't buy it please, unless, well, never mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE STOP CELINE & SISSEL FROM SINGING!","review":"ALRIGHT. THE MOVIE STUNKBECAUSE- BAD SCRIPT- MISPORTRAYALS OF REAL PEOPLE WHO DIED LIKE HEROS- MORONIC LOVE STORY- BAD SCRIPT- LEO AND KATE- CAMERON- AND ALL THE CRAP! The soundtrack was 4 stars when I first listened to it... then it got on my nerves with \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" and other no brainer songs...my favorite song of the whole sountrack was \\"TAKE HER TO SEA MR. MURDOCH\\" because it is a fresh new song, not the same melodies used over and OVER again. Also because I thought that WAS THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE DURING THAT SONG. (ENGINE ROOM PART COUNTS ALSO!) THIS is why I gave it a 2 star rating. There's NO way i'm going to buy into that crap BACK TO TITANIC, with the quality from the first I wouldn't expect number two (produced in weeks so they could make more money off of us) to be ANY BETTER!

The overall schmaltziness of the orchestration is enough to make anyone over the age of 30 blow chunks. And that boney Canadian wheezes like three cats in a gunny-sack. If you really want to be reminded that you dropped $7.50 to sit through three mind-numbing hours of paper-thin plot, Shatneresque acting, and an ending that the Titantic lookouts surely would've seen coming, then this CD is for you. But, personally, the whole thing left me cold. Oh yeah,.....the damn boat sinks!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Opposing viewpoint in a big way","review":"Well, in the face of all these 10s Ijust have to chime in with a dissenting opinion. Frankly, I thinkthe soundtrack is pure unadulteratedcrap. Bad writing, bad synthesizervoices, but what else is new fromHorner? But this is a typical reaction when people fall in love witha film. Happened with Somewhere InTime, happened with Out Of Africa, only the big difference is that thosefilms had good scores by John Barry.But, who am I to argue with the numberone selling album in the country?!Just goes to show you. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for hardcore admirers of the movie","review":"This soundtrack is a good example of why a soundtrack can not always just be put on an audio-only medium. These melodies are OK as a dramatic sound illustration of the things happening on the big screen. But just listening to these illustrations becomes pure boredom.The classical stuff sounds like some half-done mixture between a bad plagiate of Vince DiCola and a string rehearsal. But the worst thing is that Karl Jenkins'ish choir (but with less fantasy) ruining every single track.It's like one long melody, anyway. And not even with a great deal of variation in the theme! A single-CD would have been clearly enough (then we might have been saved from the standard 'diva' ballad from Céline Dion as well, oh what wishful thinking)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not to good","review":"This soundtrack doesn't have anything interesting in it.

He's quite a chameleon -- on Soul Years he outbowies David, on King Of The Hypocrites (a complex piece with disturbing undertones) -- he outdylans Bob and on Love Shines he outmccartneys Paul. Jack Talking is a smooth funky ditty evocative of the Bee Gees, This Little Town is a Kinks-like number with folksy harmonica, On Fire has a lush, guitar-driven wall of sound, while Fashion Bomb boasts a mixture of dance style rhythms with glam-rock overtones and Party Town reminds one of the underrated Tourists, particularly in the juxtaposition of lugubrious lyrics with the orchestral fullness of the backing. A delightful listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the one in the pic...","review":"Hey! this one is not the one in the pic! don\`t buy it if you want exactly the one pictured there! this one has the flat part parallel to the rest of the screwdriver..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"I recently reread this book.It was a wonderful book, very interesting.

As long as I am spraying my airbrush it works, but as soon as it shuts off, havoc wreaks.The moisture trap is like....disintegrating.

How do I know... I read this great assembly of Paterno in and out of his coaching shoes.

Paterno's life is inspiring, dammit. He is no ordinary joe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paterno in 3-D","review":"This is no breezy read for Nittany Lion fans to dip into during lulls in tailgating. Rather, O'Brien's book on Paterno is a prodigious work of research, richly detailed, exhaustively documented, and persuavive in its ultimate, but not surprising, conclusion. Though the author refers to his subject as \\"Joe\\" throughout the book, he's no starstruck fan. He comes by his points honestly, much like the coach's father, Angelo Paterno, would have urged: \\"Think, think harder.\\" O'Brien has produced an insightful, three-dimensional portrait of Paterno, perhaps the most complete chronicle of the coach's life ever written. Along the way, he establishes himself as a credible and dispassionate observer. There are plenty of books on Joe Paterno and Penn State football. Most are highly polished works of campus public relations. \\"No Ordinary Joe\\" stands out from the crowd as perhaps the most insightful, most balanced, and ultimately, most satisfying of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Pa","review":"It certainly is a good overview of his life.

It fits any and every need.As it's primary function, timekeeping has been precise. The stopwatch function is nice, but after you get past the novelty, it probably won't be used much.A thing to note is that the date function does not auto-adjust for months with <31 days.

I got this 1999 when it came out, played it6 a few times and all but forgot it until I rediscovered it in my collection.This is not a sunny, chipper take on Chamber Pop. Albemarle Sound mines a soft, slightly down beat take on the genre. The stings and horns are ready for the hearing. But they are mixed into extremely gentle, sometimes weepy-eyed tracks about love and loss. Listen to \\"Here Comes The Rain,\\" which slyly mixes a drippy sentimentality with instrumental craft.Personally, I find this album a bit of a downer. If there is really such a thing as sunshine pop, this is that for a stormy, claustrophobic day behind closed doors and looking out wet foggy windows. Given a choice I would shoot for the upbeat jazzy sound of a band like Swandive, but that is a sheer matter of taste.If you like the more vulnerable side of this music, you won't go wrong with Ladybug Transistor"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely amazing!!!","review":"Bound to be the best CD of 1999.

The supposedly upper-crust [for their small town] characters talk like dock-whallopers, yet can't speak the truth to each other about the simplest irritants or issues. Well, down South, you know, you're supposed to sugar-coat home truths. The style which consistently withholds all except vague references to how one cousin betrayed the main character are clearly meant to keep the reader turning pages trying to find out what happened. The problem with all this is soon I didn't care. Contrary to literary belief in other climes, I don't believe families in the South are all so whacked and messed-up, and I'm not even from the South. Nor was this family interesting to me, rather--sorry to say--just tedious. The author can write a decent English sentence.

My decade old tape of ABWH has a FAR better, multi-page insert, including all of the lyrics. I understand that at this price I should be happy with the CD sounding good and being in good shape upon arrival, but it would be nice to get a decent booklet (or ANY booklet) with the CD.

Unfortunately, they do not succeed. Bill Bruford, perhaps progressive-rock's finest drummer chose to play the Simmons Electronic Drums on this recording and as a result, his playing sounds dated and void of personality. The normally impressive Tony Levin covers for the absent Chris Squire and sounds gimmicky and is clearly the odd-man out. Wakeman does a decent job, as does Anderson although the compositions and lyrics are not particularly strong. Steve Howe was going through a phase of attempting to sound relevant and contemporary, only to lose(temporarily) that which made him unique.

Tony Levin fills in on Bass, playing his chapman stick and electric upright bass. Some hardcore YES fans won't enjoy his contribution but as a bass Player myself, I can find much to enjoy regarding Levin's tracks. I enjoy all the songs here. especially \\"Fist of Fire\\" and \\"Brother Of Mine\\". There is a song on here called \\"Teakbois\\" which has this latin/carribean feel and then transitions into a celtic song. I think that is quite unique coming from YES.

I am a huge classic YES fan, and when I popped this cd in it immediatley made me cringe. Where there once was intricate rhythm and tempo changes and all around creativity, this album has 80's dance beats and boring melodies.Unless you are into cheesy pop music, this is probably not something you want to add to your library.The YES Re(Union) album is way, way more like the older sound that I appreciate. Evidently ABWH band came up with some material and Chris Squire and co. contributed some content...add a few years to trim the fat and Re(Union) ends up with minimal ABWH and a bunch of Chris Squire led Yes music with Jon Anderson rerecording lyrics over it.I would NOT recommend this album...see Re(Union) for the same era yet much better music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Yes, and just as good","review":"An astonishing piece of work.

I find it to be a really good record. The best songs are \\"Brother Of Mine,\\" \\"Birthright,\\" \\"Quartet,\\" and \\"Order Of The Universe\\" (although, I enjoy the edited version that I made of that song better. The 3-min intro is just too long!) The most obnoxious part of the record comes in the form of Rick Wakeman's keyboard sound. It's very dated and he often vascilates between a flurry of notes or playing one chord as a rhythm.

It's like that disliked relative that shows up at a family reunion he hasn't been invited to- what do you do with him? Here is a couple of very fine songs, that fit well in the Yes universe- The Order Of The Universe is just a good tune. My personal favorite is Long Lost Brother Of Mine, but for sentimental reasons- when I heard this track, I was in a new city, about 1300 miles from friends and family, and I was really missing a close friend, hence the song 'spoke' to me.

Audiobook could be better","review":"Have bought the audio version for educational fun during driving times.Note my comments here are only about audiobook:- Vocal variety is WEAK. Jeffrey Jones did not sell the ideas to his own heart, so he reads the text with good and clear pronunciation, but personal passion is not there and trust to him has not appeared.Ideas are very nice, but because of the above - it is very easy to loose attention especially during driving. I had to rewind a bit back this cassette several times because of that.- Tom Hopkins has worse pronunciation (for me, as for non-native speaker), but he is adorable in terms of voice, which is key for audiobook.- Again: the book should be great, as judged by other reviews, and i would probably buy in hardcover.

Instead, \\"you can accomplish just as much by convincing a prospect that your service is 'positively good.'\\" (p.182)I enjoyed reading this book and found the many stories relevant and revealing.

It's positioned as a sales and marketing book, but it's also a very good book about customer service. If you're in consulting and need to figure out how to get new and retain current clients, I highly recommend this book. Good tips all the way around.This book is great to read on your own, but I bought several copies for my team to read and discuss together. The conversations that were spiked from its content was business changing for us. This is also a book that you don't want to read just once. I took notes, dog-eared pages and I keep coming back to it to review old concepts and how they've evolved. Some of the elements are a tad outdated, but for the most part, it was extremely helpful. In management? Read this book. In customer service? Read this book. In sales or marketing? Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positioning..","review":"Although I haven't finished reading the book yet, I highly recommend it to anyone in business.

On reviewing it more closely, my office book club realized these one-page chapters provided the necessary messages they needed. Primary thrust is understanding the value of customer service and defining how that works. Very well written, Mr. Beckwith provides substantial examples of the ideal customer service profile and activity. What takes some getting-used-to is a writing style with which we are not accustomed in business books. Enjoy it and treat it as a primer to keep handy close to your workspace.

This book is a quick read and a good way to make sure you remember the customer and not focus all your energies marketing toward either your competition or your bottom line.On a personal note, after interfacing directly with Mr. Beckwith, the author, the book loses much of its appeal. He appears to be another of those do as I say, not as I do type experts. His approach to business with my company in no way reflected the approach he outlines in his book. He will no doubt sell many books, but his saleability on the speaking circuit will be short unless he begins living by the rules he outlines.Impressed by the book, not by the author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unassuming charming book, I loved it!","review":"I started reading it and couldn't put it down.

It has many cool features like built in 300 name phonebook, ability to associate pictures with phone book entries, and of course the camera itself. However, there is a problem. We have two phones and they both have the same problem. No matter who we call, they complan that we are \\"yelling\\" at them. Our voices are loud and distorted on the receiving end. We notice the same thing when we talk to each other. We can find no way to turn the mike sensitivity down. Holding it far from our mouth - like at our waste - doesn't improve things much and of course then we can't hear what the other end is saying. Turning down the volume doesn't help either. Only thing that helps is to talk in a whisper or switch to speaker phone mode.

I discovered that the phone gains its hearing-abilities after you erase the recorded voice dial and re-record it.* You can not add your wife work phone and mobile phone to the voice dialing. It has to be only one entry.* Horrible speaker* Un-acceptable voice quality.* The headset volume is very inconveniently loud.

I read it in sixth grade and re-read it only a couple of months ago. The writing style is a little simplistic and the background not as full as I would like, yet it still stands as a classic. It is the re-working of one branch of the Mabinogion - equate it with the Bullfinch of Welsh mythology. It tells the story of the demigod children of Llyr, making the magic of myth seem plausible. Let me warn you, however, Celts apparently have a well-developed sense of melancholy and there are no happy endings to any of their tales. There are tragic moments and brutal events but there are also poignant passages. The subject of Celtic mythology is much more popular today than in 1981, but few have related it with the spirit of Ms. Walton's work. It was her introduction in this volume to which I credit my abiding interest to this day.

It covers the basic of the basic, bread and butter type stuff. I guess it's very good as an intro to funk keyboards. In other words, if these phrases sound foreign to you, then you definitely need to get these bases covered. But beyond that, the book doesn't offer too much.Bottom line: Can the book inject a good amount of funk into a stiff classical player? Yes, and it will cure his bad knee too.

It seemed that things were very rushed to wrap up the Shadow War and the conflict with EarthGov, but as I understand it this was going to be the final season before it was unexpectedly extended for an additional season.This season follows the excellent season 3 and only falls a little short because of the rushed pace. There are some great (and frustrating) character developments that has the B5 command staff and the various Ambassadors split up a lot of the time performing various missions. There are also a lot of well thought out ship-to-ship battles that work to show how much thought went into making this series believable.Highly recommended for fans of the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb series, but poor quality DVD","review":"Babylon 5 is my favorite Sci.

Extremely irritating that a company would do such a substandard job in a DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor DVD Quality","review":"I have purchased all 4 seasons that were available. Every one of them have discs that are faulty. They \\"freeze\\" or skip scenes. Those scenes will not play. Pretty poor.I have even tried these on other DVD players...same results.Oh yes, and ever try to get someone to acknowledge this problem and correct it? Not happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vast Dissapointment","review":"it isnt what you expect of the details,it has too much techinical errors,it was far least than i expected,such a hugedissapointment for me as a long time fan of babylon,star gateand many other sci-fi's the DVD resolutions are good but it isnt enough the quality and the scripts arent as they used to be.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still looks good even after all this time.","review":"Still looks good even after all this time. It was great to revisit this old friend! I promptly went out and bought the rest of the five seasons of the series. I was afraid that the effects would look cheesy compared to today's modern effects, but not bad at all. It feels like re-reading Lord of the Rings after years away, you can't wait until you get to see your favorite scenes over again. Good fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon has a bunch of defective ones.","review":"It took them four tries to get me one that wasn't completely destroyed inside. I never opened them to see what actually happened but it sounded like a box of gravel when you shook it lightly. They finally were able to get me a good one though, so I'm happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DD 5.1 audio, especially with a subwoofer!","review":"Wow, the sound blew me away! I could feel the jet engines rumbling. Ok ok, I know that you can't hear engines rumble in space, I liked it anyway. The voices are very clear and understandable. There is only one audio track though, no DTS or stereo track.The video was not nearly as good. As other reviewers have reported, there are some problems. I would still call it above average for a TV show. The video quality was better than my cable signal. It's in widescreen, of course (1:78:1). Although the extras aren't as good as the previous seasons of B5, they are still much better than many other TV shows. There's an easter egg, like the previous seasons.It's hard to stop watching. The episodes flow into each other and the tension increases throughout the season. There are several references to prior seasons. I don't recommend this DVD if you haven't seen the first three seasons, you won't get the full effect. Excellent DVD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love an album that gets better after every listen","review":"What can I say it grew on me very fast and is now a favorite. I can't wait for them to come out with another album !"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made me laugh and cry...highly recommend.","review":"I felt like I was soo close to Sharlie, her feelings and thoughts became real to me. I rooted for her, cried, and laughed. I can't wait to read another book by Sally Mandel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touching story, but....","review":"This is a touching story, and well written. However, although Sharli was ill, I felt her character wasn't strong enough in mind. With her life basically being taken away from her, I would expect her to be more headstrong and independent in having the best kind of life she could. She seemed easily pushed down into the direction her parents would put her in. When she has a chance to really live, she barely fights for it. Good story, and believable... however, I would have liked to find a stronger character in mind to more actively go after what she wanted, or needed. In addition, I felt her parents were unreasonably hard, and almost unloving. I had to force myself to finish this book, and then was very disappointed when I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only read this if you want to re-read a few times..","review":"This book was boring, and poorly setup....It consists of too much stupid diction, and the tone fails it in many places.If you have to read this for a class, or are considering a form of suicide, then turn to this book.."},{"rating":"2","title":"foundation storytelling","review":"Many of the superlatives already suggested by other reviewers, I also share. This series of plays is central to an understanding of how the western tradtion of storytelling developed and also the philosophical ideas behind justice. That being said, they also tell a great yarn.'Pain both ways and who's to tell the right?' is a question many modern storytellers (such as Mike Moore et al) have decided upon - the answer is 'me!'. Aeschylus, on the other hand, examines this kind of question without shying away but pursuing, through honest portrayal of character and suffering, those dark gray half-seen spaces which manipulate us willingly and against our will - the compteting interests within the notion of 'soul'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Readable, but not the best","review":"Robert Fagles is an excellent translator generally, and if you have never read the Greek classics before, I would recommend this one. He puts more emotion and excitement into the plays than most of his contemporaries do.However, even though I love Fagles and was quite impressed by his Homer translations, his Aeschylus is probably not the best out there. If you are looking to truly study Aeschylus rather than just read it for pleasure, I would recommend, instead, the Lattimore translation. It is far harder to get into initially, but more rewarding, as the translation is more literal yet still superb. Do not be afraid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good source for all the essential stretches.","review":"This book has all the essential stretches for the entire body. Complete head to toe stretches. It also sorts out the stretches accourding to neck, legs, wrists, arms, etc. Not only does it sort those out for you, but it gives a list of stretches for those who sit, stand, and all other sorts of diffent activities. One downfall, believes in evolution. The author did not need to include her opinions that we used to come from apes that swing on trees. This view damages a man's identity. Ok exact quote, \\"Because human beings no longer hang from trees as we did when we were evolving from primates,....\\" Get rid of that evolution phylosophy. It has never been proven, and why some man wants to believe we were once some ape is beyond this person, or better yet, that we evolved from a rock that was rained on for billions of years; and somehow this rock came to life. Bunch of garbage if you ask me. Other than that, it is good for what it was designed for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!","review":"This is the new treasure on my bookshelf. I am most impressed with the illustrations of this new technique, and with the photos that acompany the clear and consise text. Obviously written by a quilter for other quilters, the directions guide you through color choice to completion. The tips and personal glimpses that are sprinkled throughout paint a word picture of this talented author. This book will be used frequently!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What a Lunchbox!!","review":"This is the first item I have bought through Amazon.com. They are very professional in their ordering and shipping process.My Monkees lunchbox/VCR tape/puzzle are a treasured possession in my home now.

I've already put the Monkee puzzle together. I've always wanted their lunchbox and NOW I have it. YAY! I've watched the tape at least 3 times already. Maybe more.

Its widely known that he chose this particular episode as his \\"fave\\" because Mike doesn't appear in it for more than 3 minutes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monkee Memories are timeless","review":"Just this four shows brought back a lot of memories of my youth.It was priceless to see the old ceral commercials that were smartly installed in the shows. I would like to see more of dvds with special shows because the box sets can be rather costly and it was nice to see the favorite shows of the funny four.I was able to see the Monkees on their 20th anniversary tour and if you would have told me when I was young I would have ever seen them in person I would not have believed it. That makes seeing these shows even more precious to my memories because I loved these guys so much I had all their records and as an adult have converted my collection to include all of their cds. I will eventually be able to add more of their dvds to my collections when I can. This is a nice sneak peak into my past loves lives. Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Monkees","review":"It's difficult to tell when you're ordering this video, but there are four episodes of the original Monkees tv show. I had recently seen a made-for-tv movie about the monkees, so my husband surprised me by getting this for me for my birthday. I've thoroughly enjoyed it!

His representation of Seattle along with his interestingly unique songs (songs ranging from 1989 - 2000) makes this CD a must. The best tracks are 1,5,7,12,14 (best) and 18. An interesting track is 15 (Do Your Thing). This sad song is a tribute to Ken Griffey Jr. from Kid Sensation speaking or the Northwest.

In November I mailed it to a jeweller through my Amazon warranty and it was returned with a card saying \\"watch may be wound to increase power supply.\\" In other words, this automatic watch isn't automatic. I contacted Seiko and have now sent it to them for evaluation. They told me Amazon is not an authorized retailer of Seiko watches. I'm a fan of Seiko and have an old watch (#SWZ054) that works on a battery.

Application data, from the USDA, would also be of assistance to many purchasers.As it stands, currently, this listing is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufficient Information","review":"I agree with the former two reviews appearing here. In all fairness, the ad format does not allow room for exhaustive technical information. With that in mind, it would have been wise of the seller to at least include a means of technical assistance for pre-purchase contact.... I could not find anything on the page that would allow me to make an informed decision about purchasing this item. Information revealing species type, application rate, and expected coverage area would have been helpful, not to mention a guarantee for live delivery... The \\"number of units left\\" information is NOT sufficient evidence for me to justify a $50.00 expenditure."},{"rating":"1","title":"No technical data!!!","review":"I can't use a product that does not give me technical data such as application rate and the benefits of the particular nematode being offered in this product.

The watch, however, gains over one minute per day, rendering it unusable as a reliable timepiece. My ancient 25-year-old Seiko is accurate to within a few seconds after 6 months -- I only reset it when the time changes in spring and autumn.Seiko has clearly lowered their standards and I won't buy another Seiko again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Never been a big gold watch fan, but I bought this several years ago on a whim and it's just gorgeous. It always gets comments from people. I can't speak to its accuracy because I have lots of watches and swap them out continually so this has only been worn a few dozen times over the years. But when I first got it I put it on my desk in front of me and just stared at it. The face is perfect. Next to black it looks astounding, like literally breathtaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power reserve is inadequate","review":"Though a fair preformer, the power reserve on the Seiko 5 7S23 movement is subpar, making the watch almost useless. Without the ability to wind from the stem (all 7S23's) the watch must be, \\"swirled\\" prior to any off wrist time exceeding a few hours. Accuracy was within spec, however waking up to a dead watch at least once a week has pushed me back to my $19 Casio.

I have other cordless phones in the house and she immediately notices if I use any other one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this one!","review":"I bought this phone on the strength of the good reviews here. Sorry, folks, it has a few problems, starting with the fact that it uses so much juice that the battery cannot make it through a 15 minute phone call. It doesn't give very much warning before it dies either. It needs to be charged all night, EVERY night, and still cannot manage to make it through the day.In addition, the caller ID sometimes registers the previous call instead of the current one. The same thing happens with the redial.I have some saved messages that I don't necessarily want to hear every time, but I get a ring back if I don't listen to every message.

However, the quality is very poor and it has some design flaws. The range is horrible - I was unable to walk outside without the phone cutting out for two or three seconds, and I could not walk to my mailbox without losing my call. Also, the phone does not rest well on its cradle which makes it nearly impossible to mount on the wall bracket. My first 1932 had to be returned within a week because it fell off of it's wall mount and the antenna broke (the antenna was in the down position and it still broke). All in all I was very dissapointed with this phone and with V-Tech customer service. I ordered this phone directly from V-Tech's web site and had many, many problems working with them. The great features aren't worth the faults of this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this one","review":"This phone had every feature I was looking for-dual keypad, speakerphone, etc. Unfortunately, any time I walk to the back of the house or upstairs,it cuts out and reads \\"channel searching\\", then finds a new channel. This happens alot. I do not have a big house. As soon as I walk away from the base it starts in. It is so annoying and it happens about every 1 1/2 minutes until I go back into the room with the base. I live in residential area of a small city so there isn't a lot of interference from surrounding buildings. It just shouldn't channel surf this much. I'm dumping it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No \\"buzzing\\" - even next to my computer!","review":"I tried phone after phone in my home office. They all buzzed and zapped near the computer. This one works with no interference! I love it! The features, as the spec sheet and Amazon reviewers have noted, are tremendous.

This is a great buy - you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 sec. disconnection gaps","review":"I bought this product and right after installing it, on my first call I noticed there were gaps on the audio.

Kennedy stands for to him. I have not personally read the book, however I lived through Kennedy's presidency and times, I watched like so many of us.Thirteen year old boys are difficult to please when it comes to reading. There are wonderful fantasy books, dragon books, wizard books. History is a whole different genre. Apparently this particular grandson wants what's real and wants to understand the world around him.

You may be wondering how much I weigh - 150 lbs. What I discovered with this piece of equipment is that it is not meant to be used. If you want something expensive to hang your close on then this is the right thing but if you truly want to get an excellent cardiac workout then I would recommend a gym quality elliptical.
