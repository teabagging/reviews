Full of wit and humor, this book lays out the most common areas of friction between kids growing up together, explains what's really going on, and provides expert and practical advice on what to do. There isn't just one solution; parents are encouraged to choose the approach that works for them.As the mother of four, Marian Edelman Borden has had plenty of experience with her subject -- and somehow survived it. Her humor and clearheadedness shine through in her writing, and her sage, down-to-earth advice is -- well -- priceless.If you're a parent, this book is a MUST. It wouldn't hurt siblings of any age to read it, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of my money","review":"I have 2 boys 7 & 8 and thought with the summer months approaching I could use some good advice on how to handle their sibling rivalry. What I learned from this book was that I am doing what needs to be done, and I probably could have added advice that wasn't in the book. It was a waste of my money as it offered no new insight for me.If you are new to children with siblings then maybe this book will help you, but odds are, if you already are dealing with sibling rivalry and looking for advice, this is not the book for you. It was a big disappointment based on the reviews I read. Oh well, I guess I'll keep searching - or perhaps write my own book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I have just dug into this album, some twelve years after its original release.

Timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chillout / downtempo classic","review":"This CD may have been released back in 1995, but the music in it is truly timeless: A combination of funky and jazzy instrumental downtempo songs featuring acoustic drums, synth strings, vibes, electric pianos, funky rhythm guitars and occasional vocals.The sounds on this CD may not be groundbreaking, electronically speaking, but the music is far from dated. More than 10 Years later, there are a lot of artists creating the same exact type of music featured on this CD. Good music never goes out of style!Sure, there has been a lot of quality material released by other artists after this album was released, but that doesn't diminish the originality and quality of the music on this album.If you like downtempo / chillout music, this CD will be a worthy addition to your collection!, not only you won't be dissapointed, you will probably purchase other CDs from Fila Brazillia's catalog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I had such high hopes for this cd, I can honestly say that it was the most disappointing music purchase I have made all year. Perhaps I am just too big on Theivery Corporation but I found little to cheer about in this album.It is just too loopy to keep you interested and it sounds dated, I guess because 1995 is pretty dated as far as electronica goes.

This one has a metal case and band, which adds a little class to the great functionality of this watch. I'm a pilot and travel quite a bit, so I appreciate the second digital time zone setting, which I always leave on Coordinated Universal(Zulu)Time. For day-to-day timekeeping, I just reset the hands when I'm in a different time zone, and this does not affect the underlying digital settings, which I leave on home time and Zulu time. Add to that the stopwatch, coundown timer and Indiglo backlight, and I have everything I want of a watch: good looks and functionality. It keeps very accurate time, and is never more than a few seconds off. The batteries on these models last about two years. You would pay several hundred dollars for a watch like this if it had one of the fancier brand names on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great watch that doesn't work","review":"Oh how I wanted to love this watch.

Then it began this high pitched whistling noise. No joke. We couldn't remove the back of the watch to take out the battery, so wrapped it in some towels and stashed it in a drawer until it ran out of gas. Now we have this great looking, dead watch.

The finish looks like titanium and wears well; the back light is great -- especially in bed, in the car or a dark theater. The digital portion of the watch is also good, and once you figure out the generic instructions on how to use and set the digital portion, it is fine.The only drawback I have found is the size of the band -- IT IS DEFINITELY MADE FOR A SMALL WRIST!!I ordered 5 links from Timex for $4.00 and I shouldn't have had to so -- this is Timex's way of cutting costs and it is unfair to its customers!!!Now if Timex would just make the same watch as an atomic or radio controlled watch with an adequately sized band, it would be great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great online.

I've gotten roughly 5-6 hours continuous play from my unit thus far on a full charge, which is more than enough for me. The upgradeable firmware offers more advanced remote options with each update, yet one wastes a CD-R when I burn a paltry 600Kb file just to update the player. CD-RW's a not recommended for this procedure since the player seems to have trouble reading them.Nevertheless, I've found the iMP-350 a solid buy. The remote unit is snazzy, intuitive and easy to read. The player also has amazing buffer protection. I've shaken it, dropped it and thrown it onto my bed without hearing a single skip. The included earphones, however, should probably be replaced with something a bit more comfortable.Overall, a most excellent mp3-CD player. It's stylish, it's comfortable and it works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is my first non-Wal-Mart cheapo and I am more impressed with this than I am with any other portable CD player in my life. It may be because I am new to the music, but I think this is absolutely remarkable. It never skips, has more functions than a computer, and can play CD's with a hundred song plus long playlist. This is absolutely remarkable. It is within a decent price, and has everything I need at this point. I am sure though, that as my music interests expand I will need something better, but this is for now my favorite new toy. There is one problem though, and that is the earbuds.

Yes the headphones [are bad], but you have to buy good ones just like with any portable cd player. The menu is a little hard to figure out at first, but once you do it is pretty simple. As for the charging and battery issues, if you look at iRiver's website (www.iriver.com), it address these issues. I can't say enough about the firmware upgrade.

The sound quality is OK but no better. There's aliasing of high notes when playing MP3s. The user interface is all through a 1 inch by half inch, low contrast LCD display and the type face is difficult to read in low light and the controls are a set of multi-function switches. You _need_ to read the display because some of the modes and functions are critical and the method for invoking them isn't obvious. It took me a lot of false starts before I got it out of the mode where every song got repeated indefinitely unless you manually advance the play list. You also need to control the battery charging mode. Just plugging the damn thing in and leaving it for 12 hours will result in...nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer Far Clear!","review":"I have a college degree in Engineering and can not get this worthless player to work. It has such a bewildering array of menus and options that it is often impossible to tell where you are. Often times I give up and remove it's batteries to clear out it's memory, and that seems to work. (Hint: you need to keep the batteries out for a few hours).I purchased this player because I wanted one that has a shuffle function. Unfortunately the designers went with the more functions are better attitude when they designed this thing, and went far, far overboard. There are six main menus with up to eight submenus within. Navigation is difficult with only four buttons that must be pushed in just the right way for just the right fraction of a second in order to get the desired function and not something unexpected. It can be a nightmare when you get lost among all the menus.My advice is to steer far clear of this rediculous thing and try to find a simpler, more basic player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip Free? I don't think so!","review":"The ad boasts \\"best anti-skip protection around\\". I must be doing something wrong because this thing skips constantly. You can't jog with it or even power walk with it. Overall, nice to have something that will play MP3s, but not worth the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice, but be cautious","review":"When I got this puppy I was pleasently surprised by its functionality and performance, especially the sound quality. The remote is almost perfect and makes navigation quite simple. This could be a great alternative to the iPod if the batteries didn't die on me after 1.5 hours of constant listening. That's right. The first day I had no problem with batteries, I think I listened to that thing for 5 or 6 hours straight. But once you recharge them, or discharge and recharge, forget about listening to it longer than 1.5 hours. There is an external battery charger, but then the whole idea of 'slim' goes away. So unless you're eager to carry all that additional weight in an unattractive carrying case, don't bother buying this player. Save your money and get an iPod. I got no problem fitting 190 mp3's on one cd and that was plenty for me, but so what if I can listen to half of them on the go? Think twice before you buy this player. I'm returning mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad right out of the box","review":"Recieved the unit two days ago. It really looks good. All of the parts and the manual were included with the unit.

I tried the AAA bateries and still nothing. Then to add insult to injury, I called,left several messages and emailed iRiver ... I am still waiting for a response.

The Bad: 1)The sound quality without the remote is far worse than with it - distortion, and bad highs and lows. 2)The remote itself is difficult to learn how to operate. 3)The only the player operates at all on a jog is if I hold both the player and remote in my hand - it will not work at all in my pocket.Over all it's a good player if you plan to jog and workout with it...and you have the time to figure out how to use the remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this????","review":"When I first took it out of the package it looked great, and I was amazed with all the great things it does.

I was not and still am not impressed by the unit. It takes quite a while to load a CD and that drives me crazy. I am on amazon looking for a new system as I type. Another down side is the external battery pack and rechargable battaries. Its a pain to have to recharge the system when I could simply replace the batteries on a differant system. Also, the external battery pack makes it hard to organize all the the loose cords. I know the unit comes with a case, but it was unexeptable at best. If you are looking for a CD/MP3 player, do yourself a favor and stay away from this one. The only good thing to this is that it is thin. But that is only a superficial benifit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love in begging, ending in divorce","review":"I bough this CD player 3 months ago and it was amazing. It did everything.

The battery life is great to begin with..although my batteries are now starting to give only about 3 hrs on a full charge after a year...get new headphones, the ones that come with it aren't great. I kept this in my bookbag the whole year, and just whipped out the superbly designed remote anytime i wanted to listen...again, extremely convenient and way more versatile than a flash player, and way cheaper than any hd based player worth getting..overall great value for money even at the [money amount] I paid"},{"rating":"1","title":"forget about it...","review":"At first this seem like the price is might be worth buying this CD player. After all it plays CD's, MP3's, and has a built in radio. But its so NOT worth it. I bought it thinking that this would be the last CD player I would ever get. When I put in an MP3 cd it takes FOREVER to begin to play it. Sometimes it does not play it at all. And I don't mean a few track, I mean the entire CD. The letter on the control are way too small. It can also take a while for it to play regular CD's. However, it does have some good features. It does have a great sound. And the FM/AM radio has a pretty good reception.

Meanwhile it had to go through all sorts rough handling and also had to survive a very hot,humid summer in tropical climate of Bangladesh. It worked like a charm. Never let me down.The only thing that was bugging me was its rechargeable batteries. They were almost non-existent. I choose to use alkaline batteries instead. But again, the AA battery compartment is not very well designed and cling to the main set as an unwelcomed entity. The sound is great. Upgradable firmware just rocks!

But after a couple of months it became prone to freezing when reading MP3 and WMA files, which became increasingly worse over time, and now it won't even read factory-pressed CDs. The disc just spins and spins, trying to boot up but failing. I didn't drop it or abuse it in any way. This is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD-MP3 around!","review":"I recently replaced my plain jane 6 year old portable CD player with the Iriver SlimX. What a difference! This player has everything: CD-Audio player, 700 Mb MP3 player, FM radio. Anti-shock that won't quit. I went from about 30 seconds to 180 seconds on CD-Audios and now have 480 seconds on MP3s. Sizewise, it's thinner than anything on the market. It has a great remote that's very easy to use and navigate. It will even use a WinAmp playlist. The only thing lacking is decent carry case (I'll use the neoprene beltpack that came with my old player, even if it has Kenwood imprinted on it). A slight glitch is a short pause between tracks. This is only annoying if you play voice (like speaker tapes) CDs or MP3s. I kinda sounds like the speaker has a bit of gas. Overall, I highly recommended this player!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst tech support","review":"i am, well was a fan of iriver products. i bought this imp350 player a year back i.e. 2003, and now it stops playing mp3 files but only plays fm. the darn player wont even load the cd. i contact support and they tell me they wont replace or even service the player after the 1 year wrrnty period. now that sucks, im stuck with a player that cost me $140 and now it plays FM.in other words, if u want quality and reliability, go for sony or any other mp3 player"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything better with this price?","review":"I spent couple of weeks considering what mp3/cd player to buy. Iriver SlimX IMP-350 has anything you could possibly want. Astonishing design, thin and light, can play mp3/wma, has radio in it, reliable anti-shock system, nice lcd display and so on.I have been using it for 3 weeks and i could so far say that it's best choice.I like running a lot, and anti-shock system made a great job. Battery lasts really long, even though you use the lcd remote.

Suddnely the volume went louder and louder on a song switch and none of the buttons would work. Had to pop out a battery and reset it again...Got a replacement from Amazon.com...It worked well until I realized this player had the hold button malfunction too and right after that THE LCD SCREEN ON THE REMOTE BLEW OUT!

Deceptive Advertising","review":"I was excited to purchase this CD/MP3/FM player. Battery life life advertised up to 23 hours. Battery life was terrible. When you read the fine print in the manual at the iRiver.com website, it says 7-8 hours on internal rechargable batteries, not 23. I ran several tests on two differnet units and each time I got only 4 hours, 15 minutes for a standard CD. To get more time you need the external pod. But the pod dangles off to the side, so the unit isn't so slim anymore.The remote is hard to read and it also dangles and gets tangled with the headphone wire.My recommendation is to buy a standard CD/MP3 player that operates on two AA batteries and provides at least 15-20 hours. Buy it at a local store so you can easily return it if not satisfied. If you really need the FM radio, then wait for sombody else to manufacture one.In two words"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good , but last only some month","review":"I bought this discman in the same time than a friend did.

Then we tried to use it, but got a \\"No Disc\\" error every time, even with store-bought CDs. By that time, negative reviews had been posted, so I returned it to Amazon.com for a refund. My husband then ordered an iRiver SlimX iMP350 to take its place. We loved the design and features of the iRiver player, but it wouldn't recognize MP3 CDs, either, and audio CDs skipped horribly. We tried to upgrade the firmware, but it wouldn't recognize that CD, either.

I litteraly spent 5 min straight banging it into my leg and it would not skip. The batteries are amazing, I charged mine up and ran it for like, four hours and the meter didn't even go down. The Firmware Upgrade, available on the website, is cool. The earbuds are sort of...[bad] but other than that.

I have not contacted the company about this problem, but at full charge I get tops 4 hrs worth of CD player life. That can get pretty aggrevating when you consider that it takes about 12-hours to charge, and there is no separate charger to purchase. Of course, there is the option of the external battery pod, which just makes the entire compact deal a little less compact.Outside of that it bangs out mp3 cds with no problem, and with the right set of headphones (I bought the Koss Sportapro collapsible) and your favorite music you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"A feature packed CD player but missed something very basic","review":"I have been watching this CD player on Amazon.com for several months. I saw a lot of rev reviews here. Finally I took the plunge. I was very excited when I received the package. It is packed with tons of features. Nothing looked wrong. However, when I get the earphone in, I heard some background noise. I lowered the volume. I still hear the noise. I changed some CD, it is still there. I couldn't hear it for more than a minute. Sorry. I have to return it. For me, it missed the very basic function of a CD player. Nothing else matters. I have to go back to my 10 year old Sony Diskman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD player anywhere!","review":"Even if you're not wowed by the unique design of the SlimX, it will impress you with its music playing prowess. It will easily handle any compressed audio format you're using, and as it's upgradeable, that's a promise it will be able to keep. For myself, I've migrated over to WMA format, enabling me to stuff twice as many tunes onto a disc. I cannot hear even a hint of signal degradation, even when concentrating on more extraneous, backround instrumentals. The SlimX itself is fairly intuitive, thank God, because you won't get a lot of info from the 'manual' (using the word loosely). The best part of the deal for me is the indiglo-like remote control, with good read-out and access to all the key functions of the player, without having to actually dig the player out from where you've stowed it (backpack, etc.). The biggest minus are the cheap earbuds included. I would save them for an emergency and use your favorite headphones whenever possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote problems+No rebate","review":"Remote - When i bought the player the remote's backlight wasn't working.I returned it(Amazon we're really great)and got a new one that didn't have this problem.4 months later the backlight simply died and i have to buy a new remote for $25.Rebate - After i got the second player i took off all the labels needed for the rebate,did everything the paper(rebate instructions) included said,but 8 weeks later(when i should've got a cheque) they said that i didn't include the proper papers(i took off all the labels from the box!everything they asked..) and that i will not be getting my rebate.Here is my advice:Don't buy from iRiver,and even if you do-don't buy something with a rebate from iRiver- you'll work too hard to get what you deserve.P.S.- Besides the reliability problems and rebate problems the player is good,that's why i gave them 2 stars and not 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but the ends don't justify the means!","review":"This CD player is awsome.

SO you go ahead and plug in the \\"spare\\" AA battery attachment -- drinks those batteries like kool-aid on a hot day. Very clunky, and unnatural design makes taking it from place to place without the 'remote' unquestionable. and it's touchy slightest movement controls ensure that you'll accidentally change a song you're enjoying when you reach for something.

I firmly believe that you should buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adams Fragmented","review":"Most of the book is a rather pedestrian compilation of Douglas Adams writings at various times and for disparate reasons. The short story \\"A Salmon of Doubt\\" at the end of the book is Douglas at his best, but is tantalizingly unfinished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mish Mash.","review":"This is a book compiled by Douglas Adams' editor, about five years after his unfortunate death. It contains a lot of stuff that is worth reading, including the extent of what he had written of the third Dirk Gently, a short story starring Zaphod from Hitchhiker's Guide, and a few insightful, yet still whimsical, interviews. Then there's his dream movie script - he had the full cast already figured out! I will say, this is worth a read by any fan of Douglas' work, as it manages to be as funny as his actual novels! Good job, surprisingly non-evil computers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting for Fans","review":"This is definitely a book for the fans of Douglas Adams. For others, they'll likely find the first 200 pages to be a mixture of material that probably didn't need to appear in a book. However, the Dirk Gently material in the last 90 pages reminds everyone of how fun and compact and unexpected the humor was that DNA put into his books. It has been awhile since I read the Dirk Gently books, but this, I believe, was the beginning of his best effort. It is too bad he never finished it, but it still provides a wonderful and fun reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but one very small \\"speak-o\\"","review":"I loved this collection, and Simon Jones' (who played Bridie in in Brideshead Revisited) reading is perfect, except for a one two-letter word mistake. In the piece \\"Is There an Artificial God\\", Simon misreads Adams'.\\"Anything that happens happens. Anything that in happening causes something else to happen, causes something else to happen. And anything that in happening causes itself to happen again, happens again.\\"That's how it should be. Simon mistakenly says \\"is\\" instead of \\"in\\" in the second sentence, thereby badly garbling its (otherwise completely sensible) meaning. He must have been tired and not paying attention because it just doesn't make sense as read. Just fyi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Douglas, I was disappointed...","review":"Likely never intended for publication, but published anyway (as every famous writer's memoirs and journals are), this is a collection of ideas that Douglas had. I was incredibly disappointed, as it was toted to me as his fragmentary final book. BOO!Spend your money more wisely, buy Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency series by Douglas or his books about endangered animals. You will get way more out of them. Sorry, Douglas, rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Love Douglas Adams Avoid this Book","review":"Douglas Adams is a brilliant writer with books that are well-crafted, wise and thoughtful despite their chaotic humor. This collection of random thoughts found on his hard drive, should have been left where they were found. Mr. Adams would be appalled to see them in print without his careful crafting and without context as a finished work. If you enjoy the works of Douglas Adams you will be sorely disappointed by this collection of errata, unless of course, you also like reading errata sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picked over pieces put together wrong.","review":"Its like a puzzle with a lot of key pieces missing. Then somebody try's a box of puzzle pieces from a couple of other ones and dumps them into the mess. And your still trying to put it together, half of it all wrong. And that's the way it reads. Like several people tried to write a book like they thought the original writer would have done it and its a mess. Dont waist your money for it unless you just HAVE to have it in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Fry, throw it back","review":"Adams deconstruction of the little black box joke on page 123 applies to this book as a whole. There are few small glimmers of Grand Fishhood but this salmon is just not worth the bait on the hook. Those die hard Adams fans will surely buy it but then again they would buy a book of compiled Adam's shopping lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been a huge Douglas Adams fan for a long time...","review":"but this book just didn't quite deliver. Sure there are some funny moments, but as has been mentioned, it's just not something that Douglas was probably ready to have published. I would have loved to have been able to read another Hitchhiker book, or especially another Dirk Gently book, but in it's unfinished form, it's just not what Douglas would have wanted it to be. Not to mention that it was tiring hearing so much about Adams' atheistic beliefs. I read Adams' books for their humor, not to be preached at about atheism, although some of his atheistic statements actually were better support for theism, which was obviously completely unintentional by Adams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"If you want to read more of the story you will be so disappointed by this book. If you want to read random crap from the author then this book is for you.Save your money. Invest your time in something productive, like clipping your toenails or watching grass grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for my incarcerated son","review":"I got a note from my son thanking me for sending him this funny book.

But don't expect much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two books, really: Adams' articles and a short story","review":"This book is really two books. The first is a collection of articles written by or about Douglas Adams. The second is the short story 'The Salmon of Doubt' which is said to have been rescued from Adams's computer after his death.The collection of articles was so fascinating that the story, appearing toward the end of the text, failed to sustain my interest.If reading for the articles, make sure to look to the end of the book to read what Richard Dawkins had to say about Adams after his untimely death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmally Poor CD Quality","review":"The voices are wonderful, sound is excellent. The CD format could be greatly superior to a regular book, especially for those who listen and drive, if only:1. You could play each CD thru to the end. My machine, which is new and quality, cannot track the last x number of minutes. I really don't know why, but I'm 0 for 2 of the 8 CD's. And the stuff that's cut off is the stuff that other reviewers have been raving about.2. Each CD is recorded as a single track. That means you can't go forward or back or continue listening on a different machine, or play a simple excerpt. Given the length of each CD, this is really annoying.Until the manufacturer gets his act together, I would avoid the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"an unfinished story","review":"the first half of the book has extracts from inetrviews and essays Douglas has written, still fun to read. The second half is a good (but unfortunately unfinished) stry. Good to have if you are a douglas fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great buffet of the wit of Douglas Adams","review":"This is of course, not a stand-alone work of fiction. It is instead a collection of works, from the unfinished Dirk Gently novel \\"Salmon of Doubt\\" to Douglas's many columns and letters. You get a much better perspective on who he is, how he thinks and what he finds important than you could get from his fiction. I laughed my way through this book but from time to time I stopped, stricken by great sadness that Douglas is dead now. It sounds excessive but I really do see him as one of the Great Minds of history. I respect him, his viewpoints and his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good guide, not great.","review":"Usagi is my favorite SM character, I wish I could have a girl-friend just like her.

This gives you all the facts: birthdays, friends, favroite shows, even her likes and dislikes. It even explains the family a bit also. I own this book and the one thing I love is the artwork, and the pages showing pictures of the transformations and the attacks. It's a total guide into the life of Serena."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing :(","review":"I'm a huge Sailormoon fan and this book is not useful for anything but a collectible item. Anyone who watches the tv show on a regular basis already knows this stuff, and it's such a tiny, tiny book for such a big price (with shipping, it's nearly 20!). This is definitely for hardcore collectors only."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the name of the moon, I will reveiw this book!","review":"Serena is such a arcade going junk food eating, klutz we rarely get to see her leader side. If you have the other books this book's layout is just a tiny little bit differant. There is kind of like a Darian hall of fame and some of the normal sections in the books are shorter on Serena's book to make room for the new sections. The one thing that disapointed me about this book is they had almost nothing about Luna! I love Luna and she and Artemis are my favorite charecters. I wanted to now more about her as well as Serena and was suprised that almost nothing about her was in here. I think they should make books like this about Artemis and Luna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, no, not again.","review":"Munkres has apparently forgotten the painful lessons learned in the 1950s and insists on reopening the Range War: does \\"range\\" mean the image (acceptable), the codomain (BAD idea), or both (total confusion)?As a truly unforgivable sin against the succeeding generations of students, this renders the book UNACCEPTABLE for any purpose other than biofuel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent book","review":"One of the best books for first course in topology. There issome weakness in the second part, but for the first course of topology this book is great."},{"rating":"2","title":",,,","review":"This is the standard into to point-set topology for a reason. It covers general topology very well, with easy-to-follow proofs and exercises that are actually possible to do. The problem is that the algebraic topology portion of this text (around 1/3 of the whole thing), is vastly inferior to Hatcher's \\"Algebraic Topology\\" book, which happens to be free. If you're looking for a good way to begin studying topology, then this is the book you're looking for, but if you want to learn about the fundamental group (and various related topics), then Allen Hatcher's book is available for free on his website. It calls to you...[insert spooky noises here]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome text, bad binding","review":"This book is extremely well written; a great place to start learning topology. Unfortunately, the publisher has not given it the binding it deserves. Look, an [expensive] hardbound book deserves a nice binding (with so-called \\"signatures,\\" for instance), not a paperback glue binding that begins losing pages within weeks of gentle use. I took mine to a book repairman at my university library, who took one look at the poor thing and shook his head; there was nothing I could do: it was simply a cheap binding."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"Not much to add here... there are enough easy problems that I can get the hang of something, but also some really tough ones at the end of each problem section. The proofs and examples in the text are really good guides to doing the problems also. In some sections there are counterexamples for, say, the converse of a theorem which are always really pathological. At the beginning of each section there is some discussion on what to expect, why the stuff is important, what to do with it, etc. Even though I had a really good prof for the topology course I did this book was very helpful out of the classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Ribbon Kona Coffee Sampler","review":"I purchased this as a gift.

However, as another reviewer noted, there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin. I'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that I own are for my size, medium 32-34. Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam, but I've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this. Maybe buying the next size up would work, but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and I like keeping 'em close to home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, Wear Them Inside Out: Problem Solved.","review":"I've been wearing these for decades.

The whole concept of \\"fault\\" holds some danger in a relationship if \\"blame\\" soon follows. There is a passage that refers to a \\"circle of power\\" for women, namely rage. Rage is not helpful in a healing process. The book presents suggestions like learning to nod and say \\"Uh huh\\" even before you learn to start actually listening. If a sincere and egalitarian relationship is the goal then I pity the fool who follows advice like that. In some wasy this book seems more accurately targeted to women who want to be \\"right\\" than to the process of growth; the title is provocative and there is not enough emphasis on the goodness that is in most relationships.

And I wish this book had been around 25 years ago as my husband and I struggled to make our way to a now-wonderful relationship. The angry reviews from men do not surprise me - these are the men who blame women and fail to take responsibility for their own troubled relationships. It is sad for them, and even more for the women who love them and want to stay married. Sometimes the book made me laugh out loud, for example, the two-sentence chapter on getting in touch with feelings (Yeah, right) and the three-paragraph chapter on men's sexuality.

Every wife deserves her prince but this book has pounded into her head that I must be her Prince Leopold and that if I fail to ride home on a white horse with a bouqet or flowers in hand every night after a hard day at work then something is wrong with me and I do not love her.

It's also beautifully written...this guy is a great writer. Read the excerpt on the MSNBC Today site if you want to see what it's really about. There are a lot of reviews here written by angry people who haven't read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all men's fault?","review":"This book is just a feeble attempt to ride the recent wave of blaming men for everything, a quick grab for cash.A book for women to buy, read, and feel 'validated' by. You go grrrrls...bite the hand that pays the mortgage (most men still do...women's money is 'their money').What does the author feel is behind the break-up of many of the newly legal lesbian unions making the news lately? Some of these unions have lasted less than a year...how can it be , with no man involved????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piss Poor item & Piss Poor service","review":"I ordered this hat for my wife's birthday, or so I thought.

No apology, nothing, na da.I know that the hat was not sold directly from Amazon, but by the hat manufacturer. All I can say is \\"DON'T BUY A HAT FROM THIS COMPANY.\\" All that will happen is that you loose your hard earned money. I am giving it zero stars, for obvious reasons.J.

I received this in about 4 days and was surprised at the good quality for the price. The elastic band inside should fit all sizes. I cut mine in 2 places because it didn't fit snug enough and tended to ride up. This is not an issue that should deter someone from buying it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Hat","review":"I purchased this hat for a sweet 16 party my daughter was throwing (western theme).

It could be used as a reference by one who knows already the subject. Not recommended for beginners"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"I got hooked on vegitales when I picked up a video for my nephew a few years ago. I dont have kids either so I did not buy this CD for them. THis is a terrific compilation. Its a great CD to destress with after a long day at work. THe only song I did not really like was \\"The Credits Song\\". My favorites are of course \\"his cheeseburger\\", \\"in the belly of a whale\\", and especially \\"Hope's song\\". Overall, I love the messages these songs give to kids and even to us adults. Where was \\"God is bigger\\" when we were kids? So if you are considering a terrific CD for a child close to you, this is the one to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veggie Tales is Awesome","review":"This album is halarious. Although I may be to old for it, it is the cutest most funny kids show ever. I give it a two thumbs up. Vegetales teaches kids values, like sharing, and forgiving. The kids I babysit go absolutely crazy when I pop in Veggie Tales Movies. They especially love the sing alongs. This CD is an assortment of some of their best songs. I've loved Veggie Tales since I was a little kid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performance & Sloppy DVD","review":"Great performance from Michael Winslow. A part from the show, DVD does not look like professionally made. It seems it has been created by a non-artist (maybe rapidly, during lunch time?) -just to make a dvd version. Or maybe the dvd has been released many years ago (before 2000?)... Show is great but DVD authoring is somehow sloppy, the only reason of my lower rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful for quick reference","review":"Though this book is not nearly as useful as other Swing books when it comes to learning hoiw things work. It is organized so nicely that referencing things is often faster than it is in the online docs. Not my favorite book, but well done and original. I recommend it only for veterans. Also its the only book that covers all of the Basic PLAF (I would have given it 3 stars if it didn't have this)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally able to get this in the US","review":"I have been a fan of Peter Maffay since I was a teenager.

This one barely got finished -- I don't see what the positive reviewers saw in this book. The main character was STUPID, no suspense regarding \\"why\\" he is targeted -- author just tells the reader within the first few chapters. Why not let the reader discover the reason along with the main character? The middle chapters are just biding time until the denoument ... reader is better off reading a few at the beginning and then a few at the end -- nothing much happens in the middle. PLEASE authors, give your readers some credit, we are smarter than you give us credit ... the \\"surprise\\" ending was no surprise. Only reason I went with 2 stars vs. 1 is that I did finish it... the ones I can't even finsh get the 1-star."},{"rating":"2","title":"really enjoyed this book, worth the read!","review":"This guy is a very good writer and storyteller, hard to set aside and not keep reading thru the night. I would have given it a five rating but the proof-reader was out to lunch, way too many misspells, words turned around or missing, well over thirty. It still did not take away from the story and the fast paced suspense. I still recommend it and will read more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written","review":"The story is gripping, a serious thrill ride from start to finish.

I was blown away.This is the way a mystery should be.It's scary how believable the plot,characters & situations are..It could happen to anyone.Thank you for adding a \\"NEW FAVORITE\\" author to my growing list.My Kindle seems to be a better value every time I use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Heck Of A Thrill Ride","review":"I've been a fan of Wood's since his horror writing days and thought I would take a chance on his thrillers and he hasn't let me down yet. Accidents Waiting To Happen is one heck of a wild ride, and though this might sound cliched, I couldn't put it down.Woods plotting is direct and exciting, and his characters are all too believable. His narrative style works wonderfully, I actually felt emotional pain when the reason for the main characters blackmail was revealed, and when I came to the near drowning sequence, I experienced the characters panic as my own. Wood's had me hooked from the beginning.If you're in the mood for an exciting thriller, Accidents Waiting To Happen will more than fill the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accidents waiting to happen","review":"I chose this book I love mysteriesBut this one was not as good as l thought it would be"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"if this was a movie I was watching on a weekend afternoon i would rather watch the weather channel.Felt like there was nothing original going on. Just somewhat rearranged parts from other stories.Cliche unbelievable unremarkable characters made of such thin cardboard you wish someone would douse them in water so that they would dissolve and wash away into the gutter.Not a complete waste, but better stuff easily found."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painful Read","review":"Oh my, what a painful read. Didn't think the author would ever get to the subject at hand, just filled the dialogue with so much \\"fluff and puff\\" The main character's stupidity led him to the next crisis throughout the book. Sorry, this book almost did me in, couldn't wait for it to end. Not a bargain at .99 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lead character?","review":"It's very hard to get involved with a book when the main character is a complete jerk. The man deserves everything that happens to him. Unfortunately, innocents suffer because of his actions. It is extremely difficult to root for a character like that. Because of this, it is a difficult read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor execution","review":"The premise of the novel is a good one and very imaginative. The main character, however, is utterly unlikable, a crook who cheats on his wife while whining that his life will be over if he loses her. He's the only character you get to know in this book, and who cares what happens to him? This book also suffers from poor editing with many typos and textual errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story from beginning to end","review":"This was a really good book. Not only is the plot really good but the author gets you so drawn into the story that you begin to wonder if this could happen in real life. Or has this been happening already and you just don' t know it??? I have no doubts this book will be turned into a movie somewhere down the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced at 99 cents","review":"It's hard to figure out what's worse in this book - the lame plot line, the poor character development or the horrible dialog. There was certainly the potential for a good story here, and I'm willing to suspend belief to some extent for a good thriller, but Simon Wood fails on all accounts. The writing is high school level, at best. I rarely write reviews, but this was so bad I felt I had to counter good reviews it's received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck","review":"This is poorly written and poorly edited/ proofread.

Other than that, I don't have much good to say about this book. It reads like the author was paid on a word count. The characters are razor thin and the dialogue is stilted.I had just finished reading the 'Laura Cardinal' series by J. Carson Black before Amazon suggested this one. Those books are FULL of typos but at least the charcters are rich and dialogue feels authentic.Full disclosure: I cut my losses after reading to 40% in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of .99 cents","review":"This just seemed too implausible for me. I kept reading thinking it would get better but it didn't. I finished it and delted it from my kindle. But, for .99 and you just want something to pass the time it might be alright. I don't have that much time to read so I really want to finsih a book and be able to recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the price - $0.99","review":"I bought this book because of the reviews. I should have known better. The writing is awful, full of cliches and short,choppy sentences. Character development is minimal. You read it for the adrenaline rush and forget about it tomorrow. But, that's like listening to bad recordings of bad .midi music; it lowers your standard for what you spend your time on. I have better things to do than spend hours on a book that sets my teeth on edge with the poor writing. Mr. Wood needs a class from the U of Iowa workshop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring","review":"The writing and the initial character and plot development ofAccidents Waiting to Happenwere so mundane that I gave up after reaching my typical 17% go/no-go decision point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please kill him!","review":"Got fooled by good reviews. Glad it was only 99 cents. The main character is so annoying, that I was rooting for his death. There are some good parts...but with no one to root for, it was hard to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Written - Charicatures not Characters","review":"I'm sorry, this book was terrible. The author wastes time needlessly explaining the most obvious things. I was actually embarrassed for him. The plot and characters are just completely unbelievable, and the main character is especially annoying. Really, this is the worst book I've read in a long long time. There are so many more talented authors writing books at this ridiculously cheap $0.99 price point, I can't even justify the price. Don't waste your time on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing for morons!","review":"How this book warrants over four stars I'll never know.

I was hooked from the first page. This is a page turner and you will not want to put this one down. Josh Michael's world is about to turn upside down. He has no idea who is playing on his team!!!This is one of those books, you can't close until the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full suspense","review":"Simon Wood mysteries are so full of suspense, I have to take them in small quantities because they make me so nervous. If you like that high suspense, you will love this and other Simon Wood books. Part of the suspense is based on the real possibility of his situations happening. I found myself looking over my shoulder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Fast Read!!!!!!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I could not stop reading. Fast paced. Josh Michaels is returning from a business trip and driving the back roads so he can speed a little and enjoy the scenery. Suddenly a car comes around him and slams on the brakes forcing Josh's car out of control and careening into a river. As the car is sinking he sees the other driver standing by the road and giving him a thumbs down as if he was a failed gladiator. Who would want him dead? He manages to escape the sinking car and swim flailing to the riverbank. Next day he wakes in the hospital and talks to the police who really dont believe his story. To add to this a woman he had an affair with is blackmailing him. Accidents are happening to people around him. I found it impossible to stop reading and read this in two days. Excellent read!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling!","review":"Lots of twists and turns in the storyline. Exciting and fast moving with alot of suspense. Enjoyed the read and recommend the book. Will look for more books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first Simon Wood novel.....","review":"....and my last.Reading the description of the book before ordering it and based on Wood's past writing creditials, I expected a pretty good novel.It started out well enough, went down hill quickly, and left me disappointed.The writing overall to me was low-caliber, the characters not people I wanted to get to know, and the dialogue a bit simple.Apparently it was Wood's debut book, which might explain it, but shouldn't. It is seemingly being republished in 2012, leading one to think it must have been a pretty good seller, but it was just not for me.It was an easy read....but also an unfilling read. Not recommended if you like a really good book and who doesn't?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced, first rate thriller","review":"So here's the thing about Accidents Waiting To Happen: the premise of the plot is well thought out even though the plot is slightly predictable. Does this make the book any less enjoyable? Absolutely not. Simon Wood was able to take a short thriller and turn it into something that (despite some claims) is entirely believable. Those who don't believe that an insurance company would do such a thing should think about all the people that have been killed by their beneficiaries for their insurance money. Despite this detail of the plot, the rest of it is entirely feasable, well thought out and no less than an absolute roller coaster to read. This book is based more on twists and turns than character development, but the Wood writes well enough that you can get a sense about who the characters in the story are. Anyone who enjoys thriller/mystery books from any of the other popular authors like Patterson, Lisa Gardner or Dean Koontz will enjoy this thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely worth the price","review":"I try to read most of the reviews on books like this before buying. After reading this book I do not understand the 4 & 5 star reviews. Poorly edited. Poor to mediocre writing. Annoying to really stupid characters. Readable if you have low expectations. It does have its moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT worthy of the glowing reviews","review":"Like many others I was fooled by the high ratings this book had received. I was able to finish the book, but it was a struggle. It wasn't completely awful, but not that great either. The main character was so unlikeable that it really ruined the book. The writing was amateurish and word choices were very poor. Just as an example: the main character \\"sneers\\" when he gets blood on him when in the context of the story it is clear that he is repulsed by it. Normally I would give this book 2 or 3 stars, but with the unexplainable amount of high ratings, I wanted to try and give potential future readers a more accurate reflection of the book's quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"insipid and predictable","review":"dont be seduced by a .99 cent book. better to pay more and not be lulled by something that suckers others less erudite"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book is one of the 5 worst I have ever read. I don't know who wrote the other reviews (family of the author?) but I obviously didn't read the same book. The characters are despicable & obnoxious, even the child character. The plot is predictable & who cares anyway with these characters.....The writing is pedestrian. I threw the book in the trash when I was through with it. I wouldn't even donate it to the local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the Top of My List!","review":"This was the first book I have read by this author, but it won't be the last! Exciting and engaging from the start, the writing was excellent and the story line easy to follow without being predictable.A totally believable plot, especially in today's world, and one that makes you question your own security, definitely!I read the whole book without stopping, as I didn't want to miss what was coming next. I then passed it on to a friend, who started it on a Sunday night, and decided to stay home from work Monday and finish it!I highly recommend you try this author if you haven't yet, and this book will definitely hook you. Not for the faint of heart, and certainly not a cozy, but equally realistic and hardboiled."},{"rating":"1","title":"embarassed","review":"I am embarassed to have ordered/read (wasn't able to finish it) this.

Horribly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"An AWFUL book","review":"I forced myself to read 70% of this book before I just couldn't make myself go on anymore. The characters are all shallow and unreal as is the story. I would give this zero stars, actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Match for Author's First Novel","review":"Although I found the gay-bashing theme at first compelling and sympathetic, as I got further into the story the plot took off at the expense of further character development. Clare as a priest who is the pastor of a church faded into the background, getting only superficial attention.By the end I was exhausted, trying to keep up with the galloping plot. Two irritable details about the Chief, Russ, had me saying out loud to the author, \\"Please don't mention Russ adjusting his glasses again, and please don't have him saying for the upteenth time, \\"Excuse my French.\\"A good idea for a plot, but more character development and slower pacing would help a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read","review":"One of the most enjoyable authors I have read in a long time. Her characters are believable, and the villain is always a surprise. Very well written. The heroine is a gutsy, modern priest and true to herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Episode 2 of an excellent series","review":"Spencer- Fleming builds on the foundations created in the first of the series, \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\" in this followup.To me the main interest in the book revolves around the relationship between the two main characters, Clare and Russ. The author does a good job in developing this more and more, the sexual tension between the two still rife and giving us as readers something to wonder about as the series goes on - will they or won't they? Move over Maddie and David (of \\"Moonlighting\\" fame)!Meanwhile there is a decent who-dunnit plot to get to the bottom of, all done neatly of course.All in all, a series well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder with a sense of humor","review":"This was my first venture into the works of Julia spencer-Fleming and it was totally enjoyable. I plan on reading more of her works when I next want to do some \\"light or escape\\" reading.Her protagonist, Reverand Clare, is a delightful, daring and caring human being. There is a hint of forbidden romance with the local Police Chief and a humorous one-upmanship relationship between the two.The plot is a little clumsy in places but the theme of hate crimes and the terror they cause make it worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed this!","review":"A (female) minister detective makes for a very interesting story. Read both this and In the Bleak Midwinter back-to-back; am looking forward to reading more of these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine Character Development","review":"I really enjoy the depth of character development by this author; the life of the priest is depicted well although the ones I have known would hardly have the time for all the sleuthing! The action is heart-pounding and complex. Well done. This series is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of the liberal \\"moralizing\\"","review":"The first book I read in this series was actually the 3rd book in the series. I loved it and went looking for the first two. I enjoyed the first book but I could barely make myself finish this one.It's more of a liberal preaching her politics through the main character with a mystery thrown in than anything else. I got so sick of it I started skimming the book just to find out who done it.It was so predictable. Every liberal is a good guy and all conservatives are closed minded and bigoted (unless the \\"enlightened\\" Clare wins them over to her side). I hope the author goes back to writing mysteries and keeps her politics out of it. Or this will be the last book by her I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Follow up","review":"This book is second in the series and it continues the excellence of the first work. Nuanced and highly readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?","review":"I commute alot so getting a rain cover was great. So when I got it and tried to put it on, I was very disappointed. The picture is very misleading. It looks to be a perfect fit, but hardly the story. The cover might be able to fit over a purse or book bag, but not your typical trunk bag. Would not recommend this to anyone, complete waist of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to tiny","review":"The image should have put it to scale with a bike. This product NO WAY fits typical panniers or least the ones I have. To give you a perspective, it fits nicely on my bike seat as a rain cover for transport, but not good for anything else. Well made product, but the ad was inadvertently deceptive. Perhaps the incredible shrinking man can use it after he transits the basement screen entering the garden at the end of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Tack Oil You Can Buy !","review":"I have had my competition on display in my home for many years and I have been neglecting them terribly. I knew they needed the best and I was worried I would not be able to find the best tack oil that I had come to love. I went to Amazon , and sure enough, I found it and ordered 2 bottles, so that I could have enough knowing how Tanners really sinks into the leather and takes good care of it. My saddles are now gleaming on their stands and I have enough left to do them again. Don't waste your money on anything but Tanners Leathe Oil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain creepy","review":"This never gets off of the ground and I really was turned offby it. Remember those seedy books without illustrated covers that hadpretensions of being more than adult sex novels because they threw in a little plot? Well, this is the same thing for the late '90's. The characters were so wooden and sterotypes - if mannequins could be gay, that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard characters, canned exposition","review":"I really couldn't get into this one, although I tried several times -- so I haven't actually finished it, and it's possible the second half is better than what I read. But I felt that the characters were overblown caricatures, the world-building was something like those cheesy styrofoam sets from the original Star Trek, and the plot just wasn't holding together. The part I really couldn't stand was the fact that in the main couple, one character was younger, smaller, weaker, more naive, *and* always on the bottom (also gentler, weepier, smarter, etc). I like more equality in gay relationships, and I just wasn't seeing it here. I was also bothered that both of these characters (but especially the younger one) had little or no knowledge of the world or culture they grew up in. There were a few weak explanations for this fact, but I just didn't buy it -- it seemed to me like a poor excuse for a heavy-handed exposition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adaptation of the books.","review":"Anyone who loves the books will only have to adjust a little bit from their mental images of the characters to this superb caste who have now replaced themselves in my minds eye. The story lines stick very closely to the books and the almost 2 hour stories do not have the truncated effect of so many books adapted to TV. Thoroughly recommend. For those who have not read the books, do start at the beginning but better yet, buy a book to get acquainted with the characters and their inner thinking and then see the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS!","review":"For Heaven's sakes, go out and get this record. It contains some of the most beautiful melodies I've ever heard. Isn't that enough? If you need more, O.K, it doesn't have a duff track, it beats almost everything DMST have committed to record before apart from maybe the last track of \\"Goodby Enemy Airship..\\" and it will not have you thinking \\"another dull post-rock album\\". I only give it four stars because the artwork isn't as appealing as usual, but i'm not complaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is very good!","review":"I actually dont have this albumn yet but i listened to the whole thing in the record store coz i blasted all my money on [another singer].AND I WISH I HAD SPENT MY MONEY ON THIS.The songs seem instantly likeable.Less soundscapes just really good tunes. The old do make say think is still there but i guess theyve just become more accessible.Which is so not a bad thing, because accessible usually means good.Less raw than landlord, but it still has the lounge feel of self titled. The melodies just suck you in and send you into a trance letting you create a film in your head with the best soundtrack..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great book","review":"This is a great read from one of the classiest guys in the NBA. He is brutally honest about himself and everyone in the NBA (the further you read, the more you'll discover just how disturbing an individual Armen Gilliam is). In true Jayson Williams fashion, all his proceeds from the book go to charity. This is entertaining all the way through, nearly impossible to put down...sports fans and non-sports fans alike will enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose Author ----- Nothing of Interest","review":"I decided to read this book, just to find out what Jayson Williams had to say. My final answer -- \\"Nothing of interest.\\" He spent too much time talking about how much money he is making, yada, yada and nothing about how much he has contributed to the game,or the team. At times his writing sounds so egotistical. This man is a major basketball star who hasn't played for his team in two complete seasons. I quess this book was his way of filling up his time. For those of you expecting to get some inside look at the \\"Nets\\" don't waste your time reading this book. Lucky for me, I borrowed it from the library, so I didn't loose any money purchasing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happily Converted.....","review":"I have always prided myself in being a very disinterested fan of basketball.. Surrounding me each a.m. were echoes of the previous nites games highlites swirling around my coworkers desks.. I just yawned... I was encouraged by my comrades to read \\"Loose balls\\", and really try to understand the depths of these 'dribblers'....In the end, I acquiessed..To my pleasant surprise,I found the book replete with moving, and deeply reflective passages about Jason's life, and his family struggles.. I eagerly laughed aloud at his outrageous stories re: the NBA.. The internal struggles/relationships amongst the players was riveting.. The rivalry amongst the teamates shocking.. The writing in itself,is deeply moving and engaging...A story I won't soon forget.. I am happily converted... I now humbly admit that the game of basketball has claimed one more \\"fan\\"... A truly thoughtful piece of work.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, light read for any basketball fan","review":"I think most any NBA fan or casual follower will find this book entertaining. And it's certainly interesting now, given the trouble Jayson's in for some of the same kind of wild behavior he talks about in the book. It's hard to think of him as anything other than a fun loving guy who (allegedly) caused a horrible accident through wreckless actions. In the book he talks about partying at his home so no one gets in trouble or fights.The anecdotes in the book are usually funny and offer a close and lighthearted insight into a lot of things big time basketball players encounter. My instinct is that there's a lot of exaggeration in the stories, but I suspect they're generally true. Jay comes across as a good guy, as you'd expect, and he seems to be genuinely thankful for his family and his talent. It's hard to not like him and it's easy to enjoy this book. Not great literature by any means, but a fun, light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only recomended for Hardcore NBA fans","review":"Several of the short stories in this book were amusing, but its not very well put together or well written. Not to mention, you wonder if he just put whatever he could to pad the page total, telling stories about one of his teamates heating a roast beef sandwich and such leave you saying, who cares? But Jay gives you a good inside look on the NBA from his eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I bought this book to learn more about Jayson Williams, as many have called him a good man who found himself in a bad situation a few years ago. The truth is he is just like every other idiot who attracts bad situations. I could only make my way through half this book but I wish I hadn't even read that much. He is an immature unnintelegent punk who perfectly fits the idiot pro athlete stereotype and makes all his peers look bad.The book reads like this. So then I said, \\"I oughta punch you in the mouth\\".

Very easy.- When the time is up, it beeps persistently like an alarm clock for 30 seconds. After that, it beeps once every 10 seconds until you cancel it. Basically you WILL have to walk over and cancel this thing eventually or it will drive you crazy. This persistence can be a godsend or an annoyance depending on what you are timing and what you are doing when the time expires.- It also shows how much \\"extra\\" time has accumulated - in other words, how much time has passed in addition to the time you had originally set. This can sometimes be very helpful.Weaknesses:- The keys are rather small and require more concentration to press than I would like.- The display is also small and is not lit, so you have to walk right up to it to see how much time is left.Overall, it is a pretty good unit & I would buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible one","review":"This book is about a gay dude doing some gay things.

The lessons provide a relaxed \\"classroom\\" setting with seemingly personal interaction between the student and the teacher, rather than a format which focuses on dry repetitions.

It is very clear and an concise going back and forth, english to french with the use of a native french speaker repeating the translation twice each time. More relevant/practical in its lessons than some courses.

I thought it was nice how they used the same script for much of it, but how believeable is landing on a desert island and going on a Russian cruise ship? And the scenes, especially the last one, that has the same exact dialogue as \\"An Affair to Remember\\" falls very flat as these actors deliver their lines.

The original \\"Love Affair\\" with (forgive me, I can only remember Irene Dunne as Terry, and my opinion that film was not as good as this \\"Love Affair\\", however. I missed hearing the original scoring of \\"An Affair to Remember\\", but Annette Benning's music with the children was lovely.As most of the reviews that stated they were in favor of \\"An Affair...\\", I missed the climactic ending with Cary Grant's reactions, and also the shipboard scene where he want's to be \\"worthy of her love\\".I don't wish to underrate or \\"dump\\" on this film, but I wish all reviewers would watch the Grant/Kerr version just once.

There isn't a single moment of warmth or recognizable humanity in this pompous load of nonsense. The attempts at humor remain attempts, and the love stories (all four of them) completely lack heat.Mr. Beatty is so busy standing and posing just so to catch the most flattering light that he forgets to act. He is like some old fading movie diva determined to look good one last time and hide those wrinkles. Annette Bening is her usual barely there self.Avoid this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"This movie just never took off. I never could get into the \\"love affair.\\" The music got on my nerves. Was that supposed to be 1920s, or 1930s style music? Whatever era, it didn't fit what was supposed to be a more modern treatment of the original. I thought Beatty and Bening were great in \\"Bugsy.\\" But getting married must have hurt their on-screen chemistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"The first 75 minutes of this modern adaptation saunter along at a relaxed pace. While there's no real snap to the dialogue, and the acting by Warren Beatty and Annette Benning is familiar rather than inspired, the demands of the story are so slight that it doesn't matter. Imagine a pleasant cup of tea on a mildly cool day, with Katherine Hepburn tossed in for good measure, as Beatty's aunt with nothing profound to add. Then, as the story is about to finish up in a glazed stupour, a harsh right turn is made in order to prolong the film for another 25 minutes. Bear in mind that no substantial points are made in these last, glacial 25 minutes - we learn nothing more about the lead characters or their supposed undying love for each other. It's just that 75 minutes seems kind of short for a modern motion picture. Which begs the question, Why make this movie at all?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Conquers All","review":"Excellent movie! I enjoyed the chemistry between Mark Gambril (Warren Beatty)and Terry McKay (Annete Bening, his wife in real life) I did see the former one with Cary Grant and liked it too, but my favorite is this one. Superb acting! And. seeing Katharine Hepburn was truly a joy, a memorable appearance which I will never forget. True love wins over just settling for someone withwealth and power.

Grant and Kerr had the panache to carry it off. Too, this was a product of its time - two people wake up long enough to realize they love each other and they've been far too dependent on others. The characters of suave international playboy and chanteuse with a questionable past and a heart of gold don't play now.Huge sections of dialogue were brought over from 'An Affair' to this film and they don't play either.There are some unintentionally funny moments - watch Annette Benning's hand make spidery shadows on her face as she's gesturing during one ship-board conversation..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same as the Original","review":"I was expecting to better than the original since it was a remake and I love Anneth.

They were all great and each had their own twist to the basic story. As much as I enjoyed them all, my favorite was the Cary Grant one. You can't beat his style. However, each one brought tears to my eyes when they visited the aged relative where she played the piano and \\"Terri\\" sang the title song. Also tears came when Terri learns of her death. And of course plenty of tears when the hero gets the girl. The Beatty/Bening version changed a few details ie: a 3-month separation vs. 6-months; it didn't seem to have the depth of the other two. I would encourage everyone to get all three versions and make their own comparisons. You can't lose with this trio."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful, well-cast, well-acted remake of a great film","review":"This is one of those rare exceptions to the rule that re-makes are always worse than the original.

I think that says a lot.Coming from an editorial and project management background, I found this book to be worthless. It's terribly written, the topics are covered in a very general way, and it ignores important topics such as information modeling.A much better book on the subject is \\"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy\\" by Ann Rockley.

While it captures how an older sibling may feel left out, it was very negative towards the new baby. I kept waiting for the part where Baby Duck bonds with the new baby and discovers how great it is to have a little brother/sister. Instead, by the end of the book, Baby Duck decides to let the baby stay \\"for a couple of days\\" so that she could boss her around. What kind of message about sibling love is that supposed to be sending? If you've just had a new baby in your house, I recommend \\"Arthur's New Baby\\" by Marc Brown instead.

I watched the clock more than the movie, which incidentally, I watched at a cabin in the woods on Halloween. It wasn't scary at all and the jerky camera effect is sort of sickening. If watching a bunch of smug, dopey kids (who possess no savvy of how to survive and negotiate their way in the woods) falling apart and shouting \\"F you, man!\\" for 90 minutes, you'd probably love this flick.

As the movie progressed I kept wondering when it would get good. There is no attention getter in the beginning and was even somewhat hard to understand. The professionals did not make this movie and it is very obvious. The ending went no where! It was over and there wasn't on good part to even comment on. I've seen several of the other newly released movies like The Haughting and The Sixth Sense, after these movies I at least felt like I spent money on something and I did not waste over an hour of my life on nothing. Blair Witch Project was a complete and total waste of time and money. Go see The Sixth Sense twice if you want to watch another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total suck!!","review":"This movie is so bad I can not even finish.

I was extremely disappointed and I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I can see where some people might see BWP as a clever exercise in shooting a movie on a very low budget.

After watching the video, I found myself feeling sorry for the folks who paid more than the $2.50 I did to see it. The premise is clever, but I found the characters annoying, the storyline slow and the abject horror to be missing. In the end, it was just another bad B-horror movie without the blood and gore.

It turned out to be one of the most disappointing pieces of cinematography I have ever had the misfortune to experience. It was neither scary or intelligent.

And it's kind of like one of those movies you can only watch once. I think a thought process here was low budget=instant classic, ala Texas Chainsaw Massacre...which just isn't true. Sure it's intended to be a horror movie, but 80% of the movie just deals with them being lost in the woods. The ending (for me anyway) wasn't frightning at all. I think so much has been done in the way of technology/special effects of horror films and everyday violence on the local news that there will never be a horror movie ever again that will run people out of the theaters like Phantom of the Opera did in the 20s, Frankenstein in the 30s, and later The Exorcist.

I think i probably peed in my pants in fright. I couldn't close my eyes, let alone open them. After the movie was over, i was terrified to move. great scare, for those that say they weren't scare, thats because they watched it in the middle of the day in the city.

There aren't too many like The Blair Witch Project. So it's a unique experience for most people.I wish more movie producers/directors/writers would realize that you don't have to see the scary thing to be scared. In fact, your own imagination is much better at scaring you that any special effect ever could be. So I give this film a great deal of credit, from that perspective.My real complaint is that the suspense didn't build slowly enough. Your mind and body need time to accept an increase in suspense. This didn't happen. They spent too much time on the preliminaries and then seemed to have little time left to scare you.Because this will be a new movie experience for many people.

Even so, about 20 minutes into the film, I was surprised to realise I fell phyiscally bad, like after reading too long in the back seat of a car. The movie itself was scary, not so much because of the witch but because of the thought of being completely and forever lost in the woods. However, I felt so sick that I could not focus properly on the movie, and thus doubtless missed the full effect. After it was over I felt like I had been through and ordeal and not because I was so afraid.

It was scary the last 3 minutes. But the other hour and 12 minutes seemed to be fuzzy, migrane inducing footage of grass going by as whoever was holding the camera ran from some unseen 'witch'... or chased after the punk that kicked the map into the river.

And then it hit me...advertising is genius! THAT'S how they got me into the theatre! I was just a sheep! This film has approximately 30 seconds of redemption- the last scene. That's it. This was a real disappointment for me because I love independent film in general and was glad these guys got their turn- I just didn't feel it was deserved in this case.

Maybe starting out with some faux newspaper clippings or news reports covering the \\"disappearance\\" as wll as clippings relating to past manifestations. Instead the locals are pretty cavalier about what was supposed to be some pretty disturbing events. The bundles of twigs, the stone piles; even with imagination they were in a minimal context and just not frightening. Perhaps some human bones arranged in a ritualistic fashion or other more disturbing allusions to the evil that was afoot. Instead I found it to be just what it was: a \\"mockumentary\\" with an original idea but the product didn't bear out the theory. \\"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,\\" was a film I found frightening, as was \\"The Exorcist.\\" It's a fickle genre..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to find a bus home was scarier","review":"This film was definitely over-hyped in the UK.

I DID understand it, I GOT the point, I just DIDN'T CARE because it was so LOUSILY done(in my opinion), and I am one that gives movies a VERY wide berth when I watch them, I can find a good point with just about ANY movie, the only one I could find with this movie was that it only cost them (LUCKY for them, but they were OVERCHARGED) $35,000 to make. I think a LOT of people bought into the hype before going to see it and are just afraid to ADMIT that they didn't like it.

They even take advantage of the format and throw in some extras. Lost footage, etc. They even put it in a decent keep case, not a cardboard one. But then they put it in \\"Fullscreen (standard)\\" format (a euphamism for removing half the image). What a waste. They don't even give you the option of flipping the disc over or using the second layer to get the entire picture. This is inconceivable to me, because you can release both on one dvd. There are very few dvd's released without a widescreen transfer, and many do not even include one of these pitiful pan & scan transfers. If I hadn't already opened this (who would have thought a \\"Collector's Edition\\" might be pan&scan?) I would return it. I may still try. Everyone should make sure that Artisan knows that people who buy dvd's do it because they want to see the movie in as close to the original experience as possible, and that means a faithful transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Hype & No Scare","review":"I heard the great reviews of this movie, and really looked forward to seeing it.

The movie did get long in parts, towards the middle, but the end made it all worth while. The last scene, running through the house, and the final shots of Michael in the corner and the screaming were VERY effective.

I think if maybe they would have even focused some clues on what it was that was out there (not necessary to show me what it was) and ultimately got them I would have been somewhat ok with the whole thing...but this never happens. Instead you go on this odessey lost, leave it lost and feel annoyed at everyone involved in the movie. I think the actors did a good job with what they had. And if anyone who isn't too into hiking or camping has done so in the woods at night, then you know how creepy some of this stuff is (i.e. the noises they hear the first night). Overall its disappointing and not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad and Sad","review":"The producers got to be laughing all the way to the bank. What a sad and bad use of cinematic intent. How unoriginal. I've seen more captivating home movies than this. Three naive and maladjusted college kids get lost in the woods. They lose their heads as much because they're lost as because of the supposedly spooky shenanigans goin' on. How original is it, to say nothing of how UNscary it is, having a forest of human stick figures, a la Burning Man, appear in a wooded clearing? Why should groups of rocks be scary or significant? Why do muffled sounds in the forest night engender fear rather than simple acknowledgment of nighttime forest reality? Who knows, and who cares, after witnessing this great hype job! The only 5-star quality to this movie is the wondrous marketing sucker job perpetrated upon the public. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BORING","review":"Let me just say that my mom rented this movie for a project in college (Shes out of college now, thank god). ANYWAY, she rented this movie and i thought i would watch it since i love horror movies ( i own friday the 13th, the exorcist, halloween, ect...) and this movie is pure CRAP. I watched this expecting to be scared or atleast entertained. WRONG. It bored me to death if anything. It just has a bunch of teenagers running around cussing and you cant see anything its so dark. Peewee's Big Adventure is a masterpiece compared to this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Project Gets a Failing Grade","review":"This movie had an incredible amount of hype. When people started comparing it to The Exorcist, I knew I had to see it.I'm used to folks in horror movies acting irrationally. I know they'll make the wrong decisions; it's just part of the genere. And I'm completely capable of losing myself in a movie. But these three idiots wandering around in the woods, in circles, without a map? And they can't make it out in three or four whole days?You've got to be kidding me.I couldn't help but be annoyed with the whiny, moody female lead, and be frustrated with her bumbling side-kicks.I was frightened. I was frightened that people so stupid really do exist in our world and that, as they wander lost in a huge broad circle, they'll eventually cross my path."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as scary as a leafless branch.","review":"I saw 'The Blair Witch Project' on opening day in the summer of 1999. The theatre was packed because so much unnecessary hype surrounded the movie. Many people were stupid enough to believe it was real story. Never underestimate the power of marketing. The theatre was packed and what we got for our seven dollars was two hours of twigs, stick figures made out of twigs, and some of the loudest screaming I've heard since watching a clip of a Backstreet Boys concert. Part of this movie are supposed to tense and scary, but I couldn't see what the hoopola was about. At nighttime, the characters hear some suspicious noise in the forest and they start getting scared. I guess these guys have never been camping before. Then there is the \\"famous\\" ending. Be prepared with some earplugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on!","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was so ambitious to see this from all the hype I heard. \\"Scarriest movie ever\\" yeah right. 80% of the movie we saw dead dry leaves or things that we had no clue what we were looking at. And the ending which thought would be cool sucked the most. Please don't see this movie it totally sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funniest Home Movie I have ever seen!","review":"I am not much for home movies but this is a funny one. But what can you expect from three people who go into the woods and get lost. They should have been in the Boy Scouts when they were kids. Sure wish those annoying people from \\"Real World\\" would have got lost with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this movie 0 stars I would","review":"One of the worst films I've ever seen. The screen shakes so much and I almost threw up I mean geez I could do (have) this film in the woods with a really really cheap camera. Also it seems the only word Heather Donahue seems to know in the movie is f--- If you are smart you wouldn't rent this film it's not even scary I mean if ooze dripping from trees and a full moon scares you maybe you should see a doctor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insomnia cure or WHAT ?","review":"Sorry, but this has to be the biggest turkey of 1999. Interesting dialogue would have been good instead of \\"cool, hey man, f**k you\\" etc. To be honest, death came as a relief at the end of this. I don't think I've ever been so happy to see (or sit and read) the closing credits in my entire life. An episode of the Muppets is scarier than this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible, terrible","review":"This was a loooooooong drawn out mock documentary. Extremely thin plot and freewheeling acting -- obviously no script. Not much detail about the \\"Blair Witch\\", this movie just went on and on and on -- going in circles just as the three characters did.The ending came as a total surprise. There was no advance warning of what was coming and no revelation of what had actually happened --- it just ended. Well, I guess that's what happens in mock documentaries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the scariest movies I have ever seen.","review":"I saw The Blair Witch Project back when it came out in the theaters in summer 1999.It still remains one of the scariest films I have ever seen.The movie is about 3 college students who are doing a documentary on a local legend in Burketsville,Maryland.The movie starts out with these 3 students asking people for any information they know on the Blair Witch.They then go into the woods and every thing starts out light hearted and fun until they start hearing strange noises outside of their tent,seeing stange stick figures in the woods,etc.The movie is a non stop scary ride.The ending really is the most disturbing part in the movie.Though almost all my friends hated this movie,I found it to be a terrifying film.The very thought of being lost out in large woods gives me the creeps,but having someone or somthing out there planting wierd things and making strange noises,scares the crap out of me.A must see for all horror film fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, But Sometimes Good","review":"This movie was not scary, but it was acted as home video footage. So you can't really complain about it not being scary. I think this movie was made so the viewers can think to themselves, 'what if that was me?' Imagine yourself in a forest that you can't escape from, and especially if you keep getting encounters with ghosts.I gave this movie two stars because I thought it was boring, but there were a couple of freaky scenes, which were good.This film will probably be remembered as a film that a lot of people like and dislike. An equal movie, to be exact."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent movie","review":"This movie ruled. I loved it, it was the scariest movie I have ever seen and I couldn't sleep for days afterwards. If anyone hasn't seen it I recommend it. The talent Josh, Mike and Heather were excellent. This movie ruled and everyone should see it. Although many people disliked it, they probably don't understand what a great piece of art this actually was. A film everyone wished they could have thought of."},{"rating":"1","title":"About As Scary As A Nickolodeon TV Show.","review":"I heard many great things about this movie.It got great reviews and everything.I also heard alot of people say things like \\"The Blair Witch Project is even scarier than the Excorcist\\".Because I heard so many great things,I decided to see this movie,expecting to be scared out of my mind.Turns out,I wasn't scared one bit.This is one of the most non-scariest movies ever created.It is just unbelievable how un-scary this movie is.Basically,all it is is just 3 morons carrying around a camera saying cuss words at any given time.It's hard to see anything since the camera is all shakey and blurry.So overall,this movie was just plain bad.If you are looking for a scary movie,just keep walkin',because this movie is definitely not for you.Peace Out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Scary, But Interesting...I Guess..","review":"There was a little too much talk about this film, its definitely worth watching, but it isnt what it seems from previews..First of all, them walking in the woods talking about unrelated things is the most boring thing ever..They put things in this film that could have been cut..(well about 80% of the film!)But when it was supposed to be scary, its just kinda interesting I guess.. But one more thing is how it ended, made it lose a star...The only purpose for this was a cheap attempt to make a sequel..(Which absolutely flopped!)If your looking for scary, rent Hellraiser, put down The Blair Witch Project! Its as scary as There's Something About Mary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good!","review":"A decent film by aspiring film makers. I was not scared though, maybe a few chills every once and a while. It was a short movie, but it seemed to drag on forever. I hated the female character, she had a vulgar mouth and her acting was terrible. I was very disappointed in the ending. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. Rent at your own risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was boring and the actors were the only good thing","review":"I am soory because i was all reved up to see a spine tinling of a film and what came out to be was a movie that was less scary than the chucky movies. The actos were good though, especially heather. My advice: Rent the movie first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish and Scary","review":"Despite the fact that this little movie was grossly over-hyped, it still delivers on what it promises: a visually fresh and psychologically scary odyssey into the unknown. While combining an ultra-modern documentary-style filmmaking technique with the old-fashioned \\"less is more\\" philosophy, the filmmakers have succeeded in making something original and genuinely frightening.Although I didn't think it was totally terrifying, I do feel it was suspensful and scary enough. The real appeal is the exploration in human psychology, as we see the breakdowns that fear, disorientation, and physical discomfort can cause. The young actors did a great job portraying their emotions, and hopefully they will move on from here.I recommend this movie to genre buffs and curious fans alike. It is satisfying and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no in between when it comes to the Blair witch!","review":"I love this little fake documentary The Curse of the Blair Witch. It was released before the movie to give a little background info on the witch, plus to entice people to see the film. Worked for me! Even though the legend is complete fiction, it scares me, and this video just adds to the scare! Oh and if you hate The Blair Witch Project, skip this because it won't change you opinion of the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe people are actually falling for this ...","review":"I'm just appalled (sp?) by how many people are actually falling for this movie. I was expecting something better. The only reason I finished the film was because I waited and waited the entire 70-80 minutes hoping to see at least a brief moment of the Witch or the creature or the creepy children or whatever that was scaring the hell out of these 3 unintelligent kids, but never had a chance because it was never there. All I've got were constant foul languages throughout the entire film. Then the film suddenly ended...that was it?Thumbs way down for this film. Very likely will not watch another cheap film by such filmmaker. You've gotten my money, at least give me something worthwhile!! Guys, go grab \\"THE SHINING\\" or \\"THE GRUDGE\\" or \\"THE RING\\" if you need to be scared."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Little Cousin even thought it wasn't scary","review":"I remeber watching it when I was 8 and I was so scared. A couple of years later I was watching with my 5 year old cousin telling her to close her eyes,But for what? I can't belive I thought it was even scary. Half the time you can't even understand what they're doing. All I want to say is that anyone who wants to buy the movie, just rent it, the 2nd one is much better anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"GLAD THEY GOT THEIR COMEUPPANCE","review":"This was an innovative idea that fizzled after about 20 minutes. This was due mainly to the very obnoxious behavior of the would-be adventurers who set out on this supposed ghost hunt.These adolescents use four letter words in such a preponderance of pseudo intellectual ineptitude that I was hopping that they would all just vanish without a trace. They are the crudest, asinine and most repugnant characters I have seen in film for some time. Are we really supposed to care what happens to them?This is a film aimed at the teenage market. Are parents supposed to let their children be exposed to this offensive material?This film could have been presented without the use of the four lettered words, but I suppose the filmmakers would find that not politically correct. Welcome to the next century."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good on video!","review":"I loved this movie in the theater -- I saw it in an early showing before all of the media hype came about, and it was terrifyingly wonderful. However, in video form, it loses not some, but ALL of its punch. What a bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent piece of modern cinema.","review":"Unfortunately, The Blair Witch Project didn't make me feel sick and scared until the last 45 minutes. But that doesn't stop it from been a cool movie. The thing with The Blair Witch Project is that it is all leading up to something. The story is smart, funny and terrifying. It'll definitely put you off camping for a while!You probably know all about the story, 3 student filmmakers disappear into the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland to do a documentary on the mysterious Blair Witch. A year later their footage was found....AAHHH! I'm looking foward to the sequel (s) of this film, and if you haven't seen this, I recommend you see it .. now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blair which project","review":"I waisted my money to go see this movie that was supposed to be the big great horror movie of all.and I would'nt pay one pennie to own it,it was the most boring movie ever the writers need to look up HORROR then try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hansel & Gretel meets Dumb & Dumber","review":"Within the first 5 minutes of the movie, I couldn't wait for the characters to be killed off by something, anything...I'm begging!The movie does not frighten at any point nor on any level. The only level where the film succeeds is in the creation of the most annoying, witless, slacker, and congenitally stupid characters in cinematic history. I would throw the video away today but the Swiss authorities would have just cause to fine me for littering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped and really boring...","review":"This movie did not live up to it's hype.

I watched it late at night, alone, in the dark. What a waste. I suppose someone who'd never been in the woods might have a different view."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can think of 20 movies right now much scarier!","review":"Maybe ... just maybe if this had been a *true* story it would've seemed more interesting, but it's not, and the only reason I went to see this film was because of the overated hype about it being to terrifying. Calling this the scariest thing since the excorcist is a major insult to the loads of truly terrifying movies out there. Geeez, Stigmata was much more comparible to the excorsist than this!I remember when I left the the theater after this movie was over people were quite despondant about it and I even heard some moans and booing behing me! Several people commented on how the constant moving camera was causing them nausia and dizziness, fear of loosing my popcorn in the theater was scarier than what was actually going on in the film.I don't even think renting this movie for Halloween is worth it either. I can't believe these kids are rich over a movie of which I could have writen a much better plot for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad there is no 0 star","review":"A disaster, a two years old kid will not shake the camera as much!

I love scary movies, but I have never seen such an annoying movie. It is the worst movie I sever seen. The image is low-quality, the sound is low-quality, there is no music (even if some is listed as music composer on the credits), the scenario is inexistant. Anyone could take a camera, go to the woods at night and get a better result. I really do not understand how it could scary anyone. The starting concept is good, but the result is a stupid, boring movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most dreadful movie ever.","review":"It's not good; it's not scary; and it's not original. Period.Wow....kids running around in the woods sceaming and swearing at each other. Where are the scares? They're certainly not on screen. Nothing in this movie was scary save for the price of the ticket.The sad thing about this movie was it COULD have been good. But there comes a point where WAITING for the scares just don't work anymore. Eventually there HAS to be a scare of screen for the movie to work and there just weren't any. All we have are kids running around screaming and swearing and making very little sense. Oh wait....we hear branches breaking now and then and we see stick figures....yay....I'm scared now.The funniest thing, when I saw this movie in a packed theater when it first came out, there was one guy who summed up the movie perfectly. When the credits rolled, he stood up and yelled, \\"That's IT???\\" That alone got more of a response from the crowd than the whole movie combined."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely terrible","review":"this movie is absolutely terrible for one the story is false there is no blair witch project.. the makers of the movie made up the whole story in order to build a buzz around the story and for another the filming is so bad that just about anyone can replicate this movie.. just go get a cheap camera and run around in the woods acting like there is something after you.. also as far as a scare factor..lol this movie fails terribly you might i find a little girl to be more scarier than this movie.. to be trutful this movie is a joke if anyone wants a good luagh this is the movie to watch, i laughed through out this movie and thats pretty bad being that the movie is a horror movie and is supposed to scare you.. if your looking for a good horror movie avoid this flick as much as possible"},{"rating":"1","title":"its just a bunch of hippies screaming","review":"this movie dosen't make any sense. i mean the story's messed up,and so is every thing else. its not scary because it never shows this so called \\"witch\\". it just shows people running away screaming. its not scary, completley stupid and low on special features. and if they were going to make this movie, use the actual film instead of sing another one.

After 6 months of hype, I saw the thing and couldn't believe how boring useless this film was. Later that week, a friend talked me into seeing The Haunting, another really bad \\"scary\\" movie. I rated The Haunting by saying that I would still rather see it 3 times than Blair Witch 1 time. Now my scale for bad movies is the BWP Meter. The Bone Collector, for example, was not SO bad. It just had some big plot holes and characterization problems. I'd see it 5 times before I'd see BWP once; therefore it's 5 on the BWP Meter."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage garbage garbage","review":"What a waste of time, money and film.

The lack of budget for this movie doesn't hide the fact that the script is laughable and weak; there's no history at all.

Honestly, I didn't find it that scary, not until the final scene, but where everything leading up to the ending lacked in horror for me, it made up in the sheer psychological torture displayed by the incredible cast.The Blair Witch Project isn't a movie, it's more like a peice of art. If you have the correct perspective of it, even if it didn't make you scared it will disturb you, or at least bother you, and then you will look back at it and admire it, as I did. The amazing acting and the incredible cinematography, coupled with the most innovative plot ever created (right next to The Matrix) results in one of the best movies of 1999, and it makes me proud to be a fan of horror films."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie for wasting your time","review":"The success of the movie was due to the hype built up from internet. From the movie making perspective, it is a rare success in terms of the ideas of exposing the movie to a point that people will go out and spend the money to see it and the money spent to make the movie. But, as far as the movie itself, it is nothing but child play. Glad that I saw it on dvd for about one dollar instead of the regular ticket price. So, it is the movie for you if you REALLY have tooooo much money and have nowhere to spend it. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER Hyped","review":"Nothing scary about this film (besides the money it made). It's a good idea but the movie seemed to go on forever (despite it was only an hour and fifteen minutes not counting the credits).

I can gurante you this will never be a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"For shame... all a marketing ploy","review":"I still have a visceral negative feeling about this manipulative piece of tripe. I'm sure I'm not the only person who went into the theater under the impression that this was real footage of a real event; shame on me for falling for the marketing of this complete sham! Not only that, within three minutes of sitting there watching it, I began to get motion sickness because of the completely unnecessary jiggling of the camera. They couldn't even hold the camera still when they were interviewing the supposed \\"townfolk\\" on the streets of Burkittsville. And then there's the language. I don't know if they thought it would be \\"cool\\" to say the \\"F\\" word in every sentence, but I just found it thoroughly disgusting; I started to hope for the characters to meet their end. Congratulations must go to the folks who pulled in millions by tricking their audience. Worthy of zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stayed an independent","review":"This film is not a piece of cinema, but an amateur horror film. Some people find this its most compelling aspect, it makes it believable to them, but it is in the end the film's achilles heel. Had \\"dan and ed\\" been schooled in the classics, they might have come up with a dense and interesting film, using the SAME TECHNIQUES. They simply lack the visual and narrative grammar to carry it off. Instead, the film comes off as sloppy and weak-storied. There's a ton of backstory, but the film itself lacks depth, intencity and direction. This film is a wasted opportunity to show the world the power of mockumentary filmmaking. Try Cannibal Holocaust (1980, Italian) on for size. This is a horror movie to scare only first-time filmgoers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film was just terrible!!!","review":"This film sucked. It was not scary at all exept at very last two minutes. There were times when they would shut off their light on their camera and not hardly talk for a long time, and it was extremely boring. Even at the supposidly scarry time, the camera shook so bad and it was so much out of focus that you did not know what was going on. What they did at times, was not believable. Like when they found out thier map was gone, they argued for a long time like it would bring it back. Normal people would have kept walking, not just stood there.

This movie should not have even been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible.","review":"I saw this movie in theaters on its opening night. What a complete and total disappointment. The entire audience walked out feeling dizzy, disappointed, and annoyed. It is an absolutely terrible movie, with a nonexistant plotline and not a single scary scene. Not to mention the ending.. if you can call it that.Go buy The Ring instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lamest excuse for a movie!","review":"Don't buy it, rent it, or watch it. It is a waste of time. I wanted to choke the Heather Donahue character myself. I kept hoping something would happen to her just to shut her up. These three could get lost in a library and would be terrified by the books in the horror section. Any researcher I have ever read always goes to the area before any expedition is undertaken and gets comprehensive maps, materials, and interviews. The \\"documentary\\" will leave you in a state of confusion, they never really explain in detail what any of the local lore and legend has to do with the Blair Witch and the relationship to the hermit. This movie was given to me by a friend and I allowed my other friends to borrow it with a strong recommendation that they not watch it. Everyone of them agreed with me after they had seen it, they ended up in the same state of confusion and frustration that I did. I repeat do not watch this movie, you will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful Horror Movie,Such a disappointment","review":"For all the hype Blair Witch had back in 1999 they made it sound good and people said it was creepy and frightening,Yeah right this movie is laughable that this makes Fresh Prince of Bel-Air look scarier by comparison and the way those teens ran around in the woods doing a so-called documentary.This no-budget timewaster is a completely unwatchable mess that has no plot and a bunch of bad words with even worse bad acting,no special effects or blood,no monster or killer.The only good part was the end if you could make it that far."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be called \\"The Boring Witch Project\\"","review":"I actually remember seeing this movie in the theatre when it first came out in 1999. Sitting through this movie was absolutely mind numbing! This was supposed to be one of the scariest horror movies of all time, and what did I get for my money? A bunch of screaming and cuss words. The actors in the movie just run around and screaming in terror the whole time. That's supposed to be scary? And the filming itself is really dark and you can't see anything going on at all! How can a horror film be scary when you can't even understand what's going on in it? Big disappointment here people. Not scary at all. No fun to watch. It's just boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"respect the witch","review":"It will forever be a mystery to me how anyone could sit through this movie and then claim that it \\"wasn't scary\\". Maybe the unbelievable hype earned it a backlash, or the omnipresence of the internet campaign, but when I left the theater after seeing it (while still in limited release, before the hype had become tiring) I was devastated. It doesn't really warrant more than one or two views; I guess the essential gimmick at the movie's heart can't sustain more than that, and it may be unable to deliver those chills on a small screen in your living room, but give this film the respect it's due. If it was a gimmick, it was incredibly successful. Either way, it's method of hinting at atrocities, and building dread through the simplest of methods worked perfectly and I'll never forget how I left that theater with legs of jelly in a state of shock almost. Just for that, it ranks as the scariest movie ever in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"in a single sentence...","review":"The movie starts out with a whiney wannabe filmmaker constantly complaining about the ineptitudes of her friends until one by one they run off into the woods trying desperately to get away from her until she finds them hiding in a house and unable to face spending another minute with her they do the only logical thing and take her out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"The real mystery here is how anybody could claim that this wild goose chase of a movie is frightening in the slightest.Very disappointing.It doesn't hold a bell, book, or candle to \\"Paranormal Activity\\", another far superior documentary-type horror film that actually IS scary...Another 90 minutes of my life completely wasted. Don't make the same mistake..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and quite possibly the worst movie ever made.

If you se him around and he'll start talking to you - run , run away as fast as you can ...or you might and up with him in the theater , watching another trashy film .Most of the people left during first 30 minutes , but he secretly stapled my pants to the seat . By the time when I almost freed myself he already used superglue and I had no choice but watch it . If I would of know better , I should of bring Casper with me ... compare to this film , Casper was a scicological thriller ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay out of this movie!","review":"One of the most stupid, boring, waste of money movie ever made.

Don't waste your money on this over-hyped movie. Watching three students lost in the woods and cursing at each other... (well, if you CAN see them with all the SHAKING of the camera) got tiring and very BORING. NOW, JAWS is a terrifying movie...one that still makes me stay away from oceans and deep water... NO WAY does this movie compare to Jaws...no WAY!!... ALL I HAVE TO SAY... IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE, DON'T! DON'T GET SUCKERED INTO SEEING IT!!!! IT WILL BE A WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY. Yea, there are lots of people praising this movie, because they want to sucker you in to see this dumb movie so they won't be the only dumb ones who spent $$$$$ on this... MOVIE! I WARNED YOU!!

It was different and sort of creepy but very BORING after 30 minutes. These 3 students get lost in the forest and yell at each other.... the camera SHAKES too much! My friends ended up missing most of the movie cause she had to run to the restrooms to throw up. I stayed throughout but should of walked out and asked if we could have seen another movie.I mean C'mon... three students lost in the woods with all that expensive video equipment, tents, food... but...NO CELLPHONE? This documentary was supposedly done in the 90's right? HELLO???? And yes this movie got mega bucks just like the BIG films do but it shouldn't have... They had a $40,000 budget on this movie... where did the money go? I don't even recommend this movie to be rented or bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"This movie was terrible. It was not suspenseful. It was not scary. It was annoying. It would make anyone with the slightest bit of motion sickness vomit. The female star had a terribly grating voice that one is subjected to listen to cry, scream, whine, whine and then whine some more. The most suspense the audience member feels is the wait to how long it will be before this female star is killed off. The Blair Witch Project hints at symbolism and irony and can't even accomplish the hint. It is some pseudo attempt at making something meaningful out of something lame and irritating. Caveat Emptor- Do not waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype, too little substance.","review":"Yes, I \\"get\\" this movie. Yes, it was a great idea. Yes, I know what everything in the woods--from the pile of rocks outside the tent to Josh's kicking the pile of rocks to the handprints on the walls to Mike standing in the corner, etc., etc.--meant. TBWP was a well planned and well executed film, but I simply didn't think it was scary in the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching","review":"I enjoyed this film very much. I was impressed, in particular, by the originality of its concept and execution. I also appreciated the fact that it did not rely on the usual blood and gore, which is so sophomoric and so typical of the vast majority of current and recent horror films. As for the ending, it's outstanding, albeit too cryptic.Of course, the film wasn't perfect. For example,the underlying story of the Blair Witch was insufficiently addressed, to put it mildly. What really bothered me, however, were the tortured explanations for the ongoing use of the cameras. I can't help but think that most people would have abandoned filming once they recognized that they were well and truly lost. And I think it's beyond question that no one would have bothered filming once they understood that they were in ghastly, inescapable danger. Of course, then there wouldn't have been a movie, and that would have been a pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm","review":"This is the worst movie I have seen, but unfortunately I cannot rate in the minus. I spent the whole movie thinking that what I could see on the screen was a prelude to the movie, unfortunately it wasn't. It was this and the fact that I was with a friend that stopped me from walking out. As for scary, nope, not for me, you want scary? Try something else for scary (not scream though, thats more like a comedy.) Maybe its just not my type of movie, but I just hated it. On my scale, I gave it 1 out of 10 cause if you are really really bored one evening, and its on, well, maybe its a good excuse to watch just to convince yourself that other films are good. By the way, you can definately tell thats it only cost 15,000."},{"rating":"1","title":"This would be scary but...","review":"I went camping the same weekend after watching this. It did not effect me in any way. This would be scary but... I'm not the kind of person to get scared. Yes I can be shocked, freaked out, if a movie is suspencefull but this is not. Maybe watching it alone on a windy day in the forest would help, but otherwise this fails as a movie. Other movies WOULD be HORRIFIENG watched alone in the dark on a windy day in some cabin somewhere(LIKE SCREAM) It's the worst movie I have ever seen in the theatres. It probably would be kind of scary to some, I can understand why, but it wasn't effective to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it no stars if I could!","review":"I thought this was absolutely the most stupid movie I have ever seen! This wasn't scary.

I waited in line three hours for tickets. Here's the real scoop. The creators of this film are ingenious. The way they organized and promoted this film is something that will be studied for years to come. But the movie itself is an utter disappointment. It is NOT scarier than 'The Exorcist.' It does NOT do for the woods what 'Jaws' did for the water. It's pretty much a theatrical version of MTV's 'The Real World' with a shoddy and slight supernatural spin on it. There were two things that were genuinely frightening about this movie: seeing just how many times the characters could use the word 'f**k,' and the realization that I wasted fifteen bucks and an hour and a half of my life on this movie. It's worth a rental so you can draw your own conclusions, but prepare to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and stomach churning","review":"This was definately, without a doubt THE worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.

Don't waste your money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves a Special Oscar for \\" Worst Picture of the Century\\"","review":"The three salient features of this boring film are: boring, boring, and boring.

Lot of cussing as well. Wasn't scary; wasn't entertaining. If you are easily frightened, then this may be a fantastic movie for you.

There is no plot, no script,just three incredibly annoying morons running around in the woods screaming.Implausibilities abound.After researching the size of these woods, it is obvious that walking in a straight line would lead to streets or highways in a short time.And what kind of moron would go into the house at the end unarmed and then continue filming at a time when his or her life was in immediate danger.Totally unbelievable and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT SUSPENSEFUL THRILLER","review":"Though the movie isn't the most terrifying film ever, there are some scary parts.

As a film, it has to be the WORST horror movie ever made.The directors should have taken the money they invested in this film and used it to pay for additional semesters at film school. The plot is ill-conceived, the cinematography non-existant. I totally understand what they were attempting to do, but it just didn't work. The idea that someone would go into a wood which is unknown to them, without a guide of some sort is ridiculous. Especially when they know there could be some strange goings-on.The characters are all paper thin and the dialogue was attrocious. I especially was sick of the girl by the end of the movie and praying someone would either kill her off or the darn movie would end.

By a stroke of bad luck, we'd chosen this movie as our final fling with civilization, so...there we were. The most horrifying thing about this movie was the sight of idiots repeatedly doing stupid things in the woods that are calculated to shorten one's lifespan, like throwing their one and only map in the stream, engaging in endless bickering matches instead of focusing on solutions, etc. Afterwards, I said to my friends, \\"If any of those people was ever on a trip I was leading, I'd have killed 'em myself.\\"Don't get me wrong, the creepiness/freakout factor of the movie is considerable...but the annoyance factor of the stupid, self-destructive characters is even greater.

The webpage was better than the movie, I thought. The Audio Commentary was interesting on the DVD. (Oh and to whomever says skip the DVD version...why? So you can have JUST the Blair Witch Project? Why not spend $10 more and get the Curse of the Blair Witch and the commentary?)

The final scene in this movie was creepy, but overall, I did not think this was a scary movie.

However, I have to admit I found virtually the entire production to be monotonous and boring. I kept watching only in the hope that I would finally get to the \\"scary\\" parts. Unfortunately, the film ended and I was still waiting. While parts of it were creepy (such as finding those stick figures hanging in the forest), none of it was truely frightening. Things became very predictable as the movie progressed, and I think the conclusion was obvious as soon as they saw that house. As for the \\"realism\\"...are there actual people as stupid as the characters represented here?

Do not expect to be scared, because you won't be."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointing","review":"Blair Witch has just been released in British cinemas - I thought I'd go and see if it lived up to all the hype that has preceded it. It didn't. The beginning was slow, the middle was slower and the end was predictable. The only reason I didn't walk out part way through was because I was convinced that something exciting was going to happen. I even sat through the closing credits in the vain hope that there was more to come - just few minutes of hidden film, something which may offer the vaguest semblance of a plot twist, a short scene which would redeem the whole sorry film and make me feel like I hadn't just wasted 5. Needless to say, there wasn't. I had been more scared and disturbed by watching Disney's Tarzan a few days before, with it's scenes of people being hung, babies being murdered and women being savaged by wild animals..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much hype - So much promise....","review":"It could not have been a better night, alone in the house, rain against the window, lights down low, living in the country - but sadly - the movie didnt do the business.

How much did they get paid for this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WITCH HAZEL NEEDS SOME ART LESSONS","review":"I am ashamed to say that a friend of mine suckered me into buying this sad excuse for a horror movie. This was pretty much like watching The Three Stooges get scared by bad arts and crafts projects in the woods- without any intentional humor. I am fascinated by some of the reviewers mentioning this pathetic piece of drivel in the same sentence with classics like THE EXORCIST, HALLOWEEN, or THE SHINING. Now those movies did scare me, and even more recent movies like THE RING ( if you could get past the sorry plot ), and THE GRUDGE had some decent shock value, and for genuine creepiness THE OTHERS was pretty sweet. On the cheap side ( and by that I refer to budget only ) PUMPKINHEAD was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as scary as an old boot...","review":"I don't know why this movie was praised by critics and movie-goers alike, as the only thing this film did for me was give me a slight case of motion sickness. This film WAS NOT SCARY IN THE LEAST. You want scary? Go watch the Exorcist, not shaky cam in the dark forest. I cannot believe people were proclaiming this as \\"scariest movie ever\\". Mass hypnosis and sly marketing are the only theories I can come up with to explain this movies success. Zero stars.Also, this movie isn't even original - watch \\"The Legend of Boggy Creek\\" and replace Bigfoot with the \\"Blair Witch\\". Boggy Creek had this beat by 25 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves One Big Yawn!","review":"As mutch as it one done by a bunchof people with a video camera this movie recieves two thumbs way down. In polite words let me say,\\"DO NOT BUY OR EVEN SEE THIS MOVIE.\\" I didn't even get one little goosebump while watching this movie and the bad acing was probably why people though this was scary.

If they would have made it in the tradition of \\"Scream\\" or \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" it could have been better. The photography killed the whole movie. The unsteady movements were enough to make you throw-up! The dialogue was insipid. The character seemed like nothing phased them. All they did was argue! I could of stayed home and watch my parents! Some points were interesting which is why I gave two stars.

It's not as scary as people said it was, i'm a 14 year old female, trust me, i know if a movie is scary or not. but i thought the ending was pretty well thought out, but there were a lot of flaws in the movie, but i can't give away the movie, so i wont say it.

No idiot special effects or monsters, no turning heads and vomiting pea soup, just unease.There are two types of horror movie out there.

They made only one real scene, and it took way too long for the scene. The scariness is a false ad. That was just done to get your attention...

I enjoy independent films very much but this was just horrible...no substance whatsovever...a word of advice to the directors if you're going to make a film on a $2.00 budget then you'd better come up with some really creative lines...a bunch of teenagers running through the woods spewing obscenities for no apparent reason is not a good storyline!

Featuring annoying characters, an inexistent plot and a gaping hole at the end, this 90minute home-video details time spent alone in the woods and human reaction to \\"spooky\\" sounds and sights. This movie features a young women who is probably the most annoying character to ever grace the screen, who can only boss around her fellow campers for the first half, and becomes a sobbing, emotional mess for the second half. This is not a movie - it is a B-grade home video filmed by halfwitted university students.

Not only wasn't I scared, it was painful to watch and might have been funny (especially the \\"confession\\" scene) had it not cost me six bucks. While the concept is compelling, the execution was botched: bad filming (I know its intentional, but its also extremely annoying), worse plot and terrible dialog.

All I found was a story with incredible potential, completetly ruined by characters who lack: 1)intelligence (follow the stream, stupid!) 2)real human characteristics in moments of extreme fear (who keeps filming when being hunted down by a witch?) 3)a vocabulary (swearing in almost every sentence) 4)strength (what a bunch of little whiners they are!)Do not buy this movie, unless you need to see for yourself how bad a movie can be and still get a good review, just because it has a reputation of being produced by people not part of the \\"Hollywood Establishment\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars, HORRIBLE","review":"If this movie was supposed to look like a true story they messed up so many times first of all you see heather putting on her lipstick but talking at the same time, then when heather and jim or whatever his name is are sitting down and no one else is there the format switches.

Blair Witch is a brilliant film done so with unique film styles and an incredibly gripping credo, to make viewers believe it is real and to scare the daylights out of you. I saw it with my friends and convinced myself to believe that every inch of reel-tape was true. Of course it is only a film, done so intentionally, and you will truly enjoy it if you can cast aside the stupid expectations and hype that tends to follow these big-buzz movies.

I know we're used to having everything spoon-fed to us nowadays, but this is an easy one.If you enjoy the things missing in today's cinema--storytelling, plot, and leaving something for your imagination--you'll enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the woods, no one can hear you scream obscenities","review":"Perhaps nausea-inducing, as the cameras won't stop jerking around for a moment, but hardly frightening, unless you consider being trapped with these three stupid, unattractive, and inarticulate people for an hour and a half to be the ultimate horror. Their arguments can be upsetting at times, but, really, who cares? Besides, the film has been overmarketed and overhyped. It's almost impossible to appreciate it as a film at this point. Next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring......oh so boring","review":"I just saw the stupidest movie i have ever seen.All hype, but not one scare.I'll tell ya this though,if you like to hear pepole use the F word over and over again,go watch this otherwise pointless movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute trash","review":"I really wanted to enjoy this movie but actually fell asleep during the last 30 minutes.

It is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was stupid.","review":"I call it the Blair Witch Scam. All propaganda and no substance. They spent $30,000 to make the film, total. That includes film, processing, paying the actors, buying lunch for everybody, renting cars, etc. The distribution company then spends $10,000,000 to promote the film. They make a thousand prints of it and send one to every other theater in the country.In short, the most profitable film ever made, but is it worth your $? I don't think so. And you won't want to watch it more than once. So skip buying the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WON'T GO INTO THE WOODS FOR A WHILE","review":"This movie was outstanding. It was truly original and the acting was great, especially since it was mostly improv. This is a movie that you either love or hate. The people that keep giving this one star don't know the hard work and genius that goes into making a film. This is one for ages. The choppy camera shots and the darkness, when you can hear but can't see, is truly horrifying. I'll be thinking about that movie for a while, especially the ending. Get ready to be scared!!! This movie does to the woods like Jaws did the the ocean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot stupid Language unbelievably filthy.","review":"I got talked into watching this ridiculous joke of a movie by my resident teens.

It's a good thing it was a low-budget movie, because it sure showed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most annoying movie I have ever watched...","review":"Don't believe the hype, it gives independant films a bad name. I have a hard time believing anyone over the age of 15 found this movie scary. I have an even harder time believing anyone might have thought this movie was real. The plot was unconvincing, one minute they were walking downstream and the next minute they were walking upstream (of course they would end up in the same place). The acting was pretty darn terrible, the girl was just screaming and swearing all of the time (I don't have a problem with cursing when it is used in context, but that was just overkill). There were some clever ideas, and the interviews with the locals were pretty good (so that saves it from being a total wash). Only see it if you have the time and money to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"All you lemmings pay attention!","review":"For those of you not quite bright enough to have figured it out yet, the story behind BWP is NOT TRUE! Agreed, the movie would have been much more exciting and enjoyable had I not known that the entire thing was made up.

Pass on this puppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally over-hyped","review":"I have to agree with the person who felt one star was too many. When I first heard about \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", I was very excited. I thought it would be truly scary. Then it seems all consumers were slammed with it. From the Sci-Fi \\"documentary\\" to endless articles to the web page, it was impossible not to know the whole premise was a marketing ploy. The movie, although creepy at times, simply was not that scary. After seeing \\"The Exorcist\\", I had trouble sleeping for a week; after seeing \\"Blair Witch\\" I fell asleep on the way home."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent concept - debatable final product","review":"this movie uses one of the best concepts for a horror movie ever - the problem is that most will know the footage isn't real before they see the film, due to all the hype. i think the less information you have about the film, the better. if you're the type of person who lies in bed at night and wonders if you locked all the doors and windows - go see this movie. and then go camping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't listen to the hype","review":"Movie is original, but completely overrated.

After parting with my 5.20 ($8 for all you people in the US) I duly began to watch the film and thought it was a bit dull to start with. After I got round the fact that this could be a true story, and not just a film, I began to enjoy it a whole lot more. For people wanting blood and guts don't go and see it, but for those who want a more subtle horror then this is the film. It's not what you see but what you don't see that plays on your mind and gets you thinking. I was gripped by this film and once you get round the dodgy camera movement, it is probably one of the best horror films ever. The end scene is one of the best endings to any film I have ever seen; and for the budget this film gets near to the top of my all time favourites. Go see it with an open mind is all I say."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty good, not bad","review":"I think that BW is good for all the things that it's not; a Hollywood big budget movie, incredible special effects, lots of blood and gore. There are perhaps two or three truly intense, scary scenes but I think what's equally good about this film is the how the relationships between the main characters deteriorates as they become further lost in the woods.post scriptum - I think that there is no witch; I think either the fishermen and/or that dude who seemed to know alot about how the children died did it.post post scriptum - the cam work was so shaky that my wife starting getting sick and couldn't watch the whole film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking In the Mirror With A Hangover Is More Frightening!","review":"Whoever says this movie is one of the scariest ever must be afraid of just about anything. The only thing that would set you on edge is the anticipation something was about to happen, but of course, nothing ever did. Unfortuately, most of the time watching this movie is spent waiting for something to happen. It's apparent that what this movie achieved was how a good marketing ploy can turn a small investment into a huge gain. If I'm lucky, HBO will show The Exorcist and I can record it on my Blair Witch tape. Then and only then can these two movies be compared. It's too bad the ratings stop at one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY overrated!!","review":"I saw the documentary on Sci-fi and couldn't wait to see the movie. Well, after waiting in a long line I finally did see it and could not wait for it to be over!! I left there feeling sick to my stomach from the vibrations of the camera. I feel that they showed the best parts for free on Sci-fi! I'm still trying to figure out how this movie has made so much money! Don't waste yours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great","review":"The Blair witch project was scary and exciting although there were pretty boring moments this movie is a must see.

I actually thought that this movie was based on a real story that happened to a group of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT a cliche horror film.","review":"TBWP brings something to a movie tha most films don't - a certain sense of believability. We all know a guy with a hook or an axe who swings at someone ten times WON'T miss, but in the movies they do. What makes a horor film effective to me is believing for just a second, \\"Hey, this could really happen.\\" Kids wander into wooded areas every single day. I've done it myself. And 99 out of 100 times, you're scared out of your mind. As hard as it was, I tried to make it a point not to pay attention to the hype, and go see this movie with a clear mind. I think it rocked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much HYPE","review":"As I am a lover of extreme thrills in many things, I thought (as the media projected it to be the world's scariest...) it would be great to watch it, but it was a total disappointment waiting till the end of the movie for a scary moment. NONE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, terrible, absolutely horrible.","review":"The best part of this movie was when the lights came back on in the theater. I have never seen a worse move. It wasn't scary and it wasn't interesting. It was about three idiots screaming at each other. Probably the worst ending of all time. Everyone in the theater said is that all there is? A waste of money! The only reason it made money was because of the hype!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First movie to actually \\"scare\\" me!","review":"I thought this movie was unexpectantly scary. Maybe it is because i watched it at the theater but i have never been as scared at a movie as i was on this one. I recommend this movie to people who like scary, creepy movies, but not to somebody who doesn't have the patience to wait for the action to take place, in this case the scary parts. The ending was not really good because it left us thinking. But i guess it was well thought because everyone comes up with their own conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast-forward to the last 10 minutes","review":"This movie was a waste of money and 80 minutes.

I only wish I could hire the publicist because he deserves an Academy Award."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like suspense movies, you are going to love this one.","review":"This is the best movie I have ever seen. Even though everyone dies at the end, I still get a sense that those guys are still running around the woods looking for the Blair Witch. The camera is used masterfully with not even a hint of bluriness . Go see this movie, I would give it my highest recommendations. Two thumbs up!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll PAY you to take my copy away","review":"My wife and I have made a film that we have entitled \\"The Watching of Blair Witch Project.\\" This new film depicts the two of us trying desperately to get through Blair Witch Project. Included are horrifying scenes of the intense nausea and occasional vomiting caused by the incessant, unnecessary, annoying camera motion throughout Blair Witch. You will also find frightening the utter boredom we experienced, watching three immature teenagers babble and scream and the babble some more for 87 minutes. I highly recommend \\"The Watching of Blair Witch Project.\\" If you're at all interested in seeing the original film, Blair Witch Project, I'll give you a dollar to take mine far far away from my video library. The used DVD stores won't even take it from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and overhyped","review":"OK, so this film was produced on a low budget and managed to make a disproportionate amount of money. That doesn't mean it is any good. I bought it because I enjoy suspenseful movies, believed the hype, and I can now say I have learned by the experience! It is SO slow, SO tedious and the dialog demonstrates the value of having a good script-writer by its banality. It does create a certain tension, but my recommendation is rent this when you have REALLY reached the bottom of the barrel. I watched my copy once and wondered why, so I left it a few months and tried to watch it again. I failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary as Hell!!!!","review":"After seeing the Blair Witch,I am terrifeid to go into the woods. The movie was extremely creepy,partly because of the fear of the unknown.The camera work wasn't that good,very shaky,and you might get tired of the whining at the beginning,but overall,it was a very good horror film.And if your looking for a good scare this Halloween,see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated. Mostly a flat-liner, with a few blips of life.","review":"C'mon people. THIS was supposed to be one of the best movies of the year? Granted, the acting was better than I expected, but the homemade effects really weren't very scary. The best part of the movie was when the characters' tent gets pummelled with what I guess were ghosts' fists. It was over-hyped, and it just didn't meet my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as scary as I thought it would have been.","review":"The movie style was great.

You obviously possess an incredible imagination and intellect. But you must understand that many people did not care for it. It was not a genre-defining or life-defining event. It was a movie, nothing more. The reviews I have read by people who love this movie do nothing more than spew the same bile as the insipid characters in this piece of garbage. I didn't realize that a hack film could inspire so much psychoanalysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"This was a box office smash. Why? I saw it in the theater after hearing good things about it, and let's just say my reaction of extreme disappointment is an understatement. The only thing that this movie left me with was motion sickness. Here's a quick rundown. Three people decide to take a trip into the woods to find the legendary Blair Witch. As they go about their daily duties, they eventually get lost. Their imaginations start to run wild, and they become convinced that the witch is after them. These are the things that scare them: piles of rocks, piles of leaves, and stick figures. Some people were scared by the fact that the characters just didn't know who was doing these things. You never see anything, or have any concrete proof other than legend and hearsay to actually believe there is a Blair Witch. You're just supposed to assume \\"the witch\\" is doing this. In conclusion, if rocks, leaves, and bad camera work give you the willies, you'll be scared for days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"I can't believe all the attention this movie has received. It was stupid. I gave it a one star because there was no zero star to give."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of 87 minutes!","review":"If you know anything about taste in movies you will not waste your time or money on this movie. It painted a pretty good picture of today's youth. Every other word was \\"F**K YOU \\". They wasted the first half of the movie with a bunch of arguing nonsense and the rest was for the very unmotivated!! I know one thing...if I were lost in the woods I wouldn't spend half of the day taking cigarette breaks and arguing! I would be more motivated to get the heck out of there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"Based on reviews that raved about this movie and how freightening this movie was, I really expected more. I was never scared throughout the entire movie, the Wizard of Oz is a scarier movie. I thought that the extras on the DVD were better than the movie itself. I new the audio and video would be subpar since the majority of the film was recorded on HI8. I for one hope that this does not start a trend in movies, unless there is some sort of discount at the theatre. This movie was basically an amateur video billed as a major motion picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"If u see it in theaters, that's enough","review":"they lead you to believe this is the \\"Shining\\" or \\"Halloween\\" with its scares that are so subtle, they're invisible. the newly discovered footage was cut from the theatricl cut for a reason. and the PC interactive part of the dvd takes so long to load, it annoys you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Sucks!","review":"This movie was not scary, the plot was stupid and the only thing it displayed was a low budget movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype","review":"Well, I don't need blood, gore or CGI to be scared, but I do need more than three piles of rocks and some bundled sticks.

Ultimately disappointing and frustrating. Too much running through the woods shrieking with no payoff at all. Now make the 'real' movie about this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, terrible implementation","review":"Why buy this movie? I dunno. You could have the same visual effect turning your tv off and staring at a blank screen. It's not like the movie has much more than pitch darkness anyway. Hard to even *try* to believe this movie is real [which is the only thing that could give it a 'scary' factor] I mean...If film students in todays colleges are really *that bad* at holding a camera level, there is absolutely no hope for the future of filmmaking when these people come to charge.They should take a class in equilibrium. This way is up. This way is down. This is how you hold something *STILL*. I'll just reiterate... I don't think this is a bad new genre of terror films, I just think that this front-runner is the worst possible introduction to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better see the Discovery chanel.","review":"It's the most boring movie that I've ever saw.

This is because this film was so scary I had to hospital for a severe panic attack. I could have died. The stunning special effects were a masterpiece. The acting nothing short of oscar winning. The dialogue so complex I got lost in places. The only thing the film lacked was that amusing and lovable fellow Jar Jar Binks. However the huge size of the cast more than made up for it.

How can anyone call this a great horror film? It sucks big time. The college students are stupid and uninteresting. The camera work is puke inducing. It takes forever for something to happen. The acting was awful, for it was just a bunch of dorkbags yelling the f word over 100 times at each other. A great idea ruined on the screen. Not recommended. Oh, and stay away from the sequels too, because they suck as well. If you want to see a real horror film watch Jaws (1 + 2), Alien (1 + 2), The Shining (both versions), Carrie (the original), Scream, Salem's Lot, Halloween, etc. Stay away from this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rip-off Project","review":"Is this movie a joke???!!I can't belive all the hype they had with this movie, it was boring and the scariest part for me was paying $12 to see it.If you want to look at close ups of peoples nostrils, then this films for you.

EVERYBODY IN THE THEATER BOOED WHEN IT ENDED!!!!!!!Ignore at all costs and go buy something like The Changeling or Amytiville Horror if you want to be frightened.Cheap budget or not, this was the biggest waste of film ever put together in the history of movie-making.

The movie is about a bunch of dorks who want to investigate some stupid legend about some old, hairy witch that is evil, but not as evil as the creators of this movie. The whole movie you watch a bunch of total idiots whine about how they're lost and stuff and scream obscenities at each other. It's like \\"Beavis and Butthead go camping\\", only Beavis and Butthead outwit these fools by a longshot. The movie is littered with bad special...whoops, I mean NO special effects and vomit inducing camera work (actually the movie itself is vomit inducing). There isn't a remotely scary part throughout the whole thing. This movie is a .... pressed onto a DVD and you should avoid it at all costs. Even the extras suck, judging from the commentary, the directors are complete morons, and the 40 minute curse of blair witch makes you want to flush the dvd down the toilet only more. Buyers beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much more - a complete disappointment","review":"One of the most frightening films I've ever seen was a Sasquatch film in the 70's, which relied upon unseen sounds and a creepy atmosphere in a dark forest. I could hardly contain my glee when I heard the premise of this story. It just SOUNDED so good. The disappointment was crushing after watching this. I, like thousands of other people, was DUPED. These three wusses deserved whatever was waiting out there for them. I was rooting for their doom, as I couldn't take the whininess. It was horrible. I will say that the ending was intriguing, actually a little scary - but 3 minutes of fright DOES NOT redeem the idiocy that preceded it. On a technical note, what you see here is the video transferred to film version - NOT the hard videotape version, which I would have preferred to see. The muddy video-to-film look makes it all the worse for watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"So bad, it's good!","review":"Funny stuff. I was able to suspend my disbelief for almost 20 minutes. I give the creative team two points for originality. I especially liked the deleted scenes, and the commentary track was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"BWP - barely worth a peek","review":"Many said this film is so real and scary. It does feel real because it is soooooo badly filmed that it could only happen in the amaeture hands. If the director insists on the unfocused scenes to make it REAL then there could have been a better plot and more sensible dialogue without sacrifice its sense of reality. By finish watching the film, it makes me feel like a fool. Surely lots of films make people feel like fools by the end, in an amusing way. But this film is neither amusing nor scary. Simply distastful. I give 2 stars for its originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed w/ the witch!","review":"I went into this movie expecting to see a movie that was going to be a cult classic.

The main female character's voice is awful and annoying, and I was wishing death on her before the hour was up. It wasn't scary at all, and after about 30 minutes, I kind of hoped they'd hurry up and get killed so I could leave the theatre. Just not believable. Why didn't they just follow the river out of the woods? Rivers don't flow in circles folks. Who goes camping without at least a couple cartons of cigarettes? Why not start a forest fire. Those dolts deserved to die. Mildy enjoyable at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"tried twice to see this and was extremely bored","review":"Twice I have tried to watch this movie and twice I have been bored and almost fell asleep. I saw it with a friend when it opened in theaters years ago and I kept getting up to get Sprite, Twizzlers and play video games. Each time I would try watching it the Heather character would be asking the same questions or the group would be lost in the woods. I didn't get what was so scary about it except it cost $7.00 to see it...that was pretty horrifying. Then last night another friend came over and brought this movie so agian I watched it....and saddly it is just as I remembered it. The only thing I can say about it is that it is the first \\"mockumentry\\" filmed movie I remember seeing...shortly after a whole slew of \\"mockumentries\\" got released.

The revolting Johnny Mnemonic is beaten\\". But mostly I think \\"No, as awful as The Blair Witch Project is, it is more a gimmick than a movie\\".

This is nothing less than someones idea of what it would be like if you took your dysfunctional family outing in the woods for a weekend. I wasnt so upset that I had spent money on this silly look at what could go wrong on a camping trip, I was more upset with the fact that I will never be able to recoop the 2 hours spent watching this drivel. This is a perfect example of what happens when people throw a lot of money promoting one persons idea of art. I dont fault the makers of the film for the hype machine, Hey this is America, Why not make a buck or two or millions. This movie will depress anyone who actually thinks that this is real and did actually happen. America had a practical joke pulled on them last summer and this was it!

Now if I understand this correctly, the directors of this movie had a limited budget for creating this poor excuse for a movie, but then they all of a sudden have a ton a money for promoting the film?

Finally, one night after the last ray of light had left the forest black, they were never to be seen again. One year later, a bag full of film cans, DAT tapes, and video tapes were found. The behind the scenes video footage and the film, are cut together to make \\"The Blair Witch Project.\\" What a stupid movie. I remember going to the theatre to see it.

The story is clever, I'll give it that much, but there are many details that totally kill this movie. For one, every word out of the three teens' mouths was a curse, beginning in the letter \\"F\\" and ending in \\"K.\\" I think that some people might find this offensive. Overall, this movie is a good waste of 80 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh yeah (yawn ...) very scary","review":"The scariest thing about this movie was that I actually spent the money to buy it.

The outstanding acting and the realistic pacing of the film augmented that feeling of verisimilitude wonderfully.Rent this movie, invite a friend who's never heard of it, and tell them it's supposed to be an interesting documentary.And consider this a suspense movie, not horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thinking man's horror film","review":"This film is obviously not for people with a dead brain.

At no point in the movie will any reasonable person get scared. Without any fear, all you're left with is a bunch of kids running around a forest whining.

From the minute that I popped it in the DVD player I knew that this was about as real as a Road Runner cartoon, but without the interesting dialogue. That's right, the dialogue in a Road Runner cartoon is on a higher intellectual plane than anything spoken by the idiots in this movie. The acting is bad, the cheesy black & white effects add nothing to this movie.This movie is well beyond being saved.

In my opinion (which is correct of course:) The Blair Witch Project is the best horror flick to be made within the last two decades. The Sixth Sense, The Ring (American version), Finale Destination: These films are not scary. Entertaining maybe, but definitely not scary. The Blair Witch may not make you scream or jump out of your seat with fear, but it gets under your skin. It's one of those films that people should put themselves into and imagine what life would be like for them in a situation such as this. What the Blair Witch lacks in visuals is more then made up for in sheer originality. The Blair Witch Project is a creepy and disturbing film that is far greater then what most people give it credit for. A most excellent film indeed :)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good and scary at all","review":"this was terrible. its the worst movie ever. i wish there was 0 stars. the previews said it was the scarriest movie of all time yeah right there just trying to con you intio seeing it. i saw this in theaters too. waste of a perfectly good $..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Things I learned from this movie","review":"1- When people are running around in total panic they will still remember to film the action.2- Male film students have the patience of Job and will submit to a domineering idiot female for days on end.3- Male film students are also too stupid to hide surreptitiously throw away all the extra film, tapes and batteries and thus end the agony.4- Film students are to stupid to follow a stream downhill when lost in the woods.5- Film students are too stupid to walk towards the sun in the morinig and away from the sun in the afternnoon and thus walk East, out of the Appalachians.6- No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.

This is the worst \\" movie \\" I've ever seen in my life, possibly the worst ever created. A silly, 10-year-olds around the campfire storyline, incredibly poor acting, topped off by home-movie camera work. The script( if there even was one) basically has Heather Donahue screeching nasty words throughout the film. If you took a camcorder, went hiking, became lost in the woods, and shouted obscenities all day, you could have made this movie. Horrendous! Don't fall for the commercial assualt, spend your hard-earned dollars elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blair Witch Fiasco","review":"What an excruciating waste of time! I waited 90 minutes for something to frighten me. Then I realized that the most frightening thing about this film was the hype and all of the accolades heaped upon the writers/directors. You know a film is in trouble when within the first 35 minutes or so you are hoping that all of the main characters come to some gruesome end AND as soon as possible! Besides wasting time watching this film, the only thing I regret is that I have to give it at least one star in this review. Zero stars is not an option. Do yourself a favor and buy a Hitchcock video. ANY Hitchcock video. You will thank me later!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the fuss about?","review":"Don't waste your money on this trash.

Get out your own video camera...you'll do a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titanic is more scary than this one!","review":"I've just finally rented this movie and was REALLY disappointed. The idea seems to be OK, but I don't believe that anyone who likes horror movies rated BWP as superb. The main problem of that movie is that you don't have reasons to be frightened. Woods are not too deep, trees are not too high and \\"voodoo stuff\\" is not too scary either. Students hear some strange sounds at night but I didn't hear anything really weird. In fact, it's really more frightening to walk around my countryside house at night!So, if you like horror movies, avoid this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, whatever","review":"Ok, that was cool. Annoying students gets killed in a forest. Now could we please get a _real_ horror movie?

Yet, this film fails, in comparison to the much emblazoned image that it has projected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even bad enough to be good, but it was profitable...","review":"Give Myrick and Sanchez credit. They found a gimmick that worked and milked it for a LOT of money. Like the inventors of the hoola hoop, the pet rock, and the web tailgate for pick up trucks, and, more specifically, Tom Lofton, they cashed in. P.T. Barnum would have been proud of them.This movie will probably go down as the \\"Billy Jack\\" of the 1990s. If you have not watched Billy Jack, watch it first before you consider watching Blair Witch Project.Essentially, this flick goes nowhere and takes 90 minutes to get there. Some say that one has to use one's imagination to really enjoy this movie. Maybe so, but not THAT much.

This film was boring as all hell and there were no shocks of any kind; everything that happened to the kids can be logically explained if you stop hyping the damn thing. No one stops and realizes that these kids were the stupidest beings ever to walk the planet and they deserved to die; nothing supernatural happened in that forest...like I said, everything is can be explained away very easily. This could have been set aside if there was any semblance of plot or suspense in the film, but that (as well as even halfway decent acting) is absent as well.

Not to mention it rips off a much better, though infinitely more graphic CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. (BLAIR WITCH, on the other hand, shows absolutely nothing to be scared of, so even the ending comes off as silly.) There isn't much to this film, and again, once all of the hype went away people realized that this film was a decent idea but not a very engaging feature. See for yourself though; the strong-of-stomach should try HOLOCAUST though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"I'm getting tired of people complaining about camera bouncing, amateurish shots, etc. That was the whole point of the movie! Unedited shots made by the documentary filmakers (students) themselves.I thought this film was wonderful! Too many films now adays rely too much on blood and gore. This film made you think, use your imagination, much as you would in the old horror films of the past. No special FX, no big names, just an interesting premise and good acting.I think that because the ending left so many unanswered questions, that is the reason that so many people disliked it. There was no closure. But, hey, not many movies (not since the empire strikes back <is Darth Vader Luke's father, etc>) have a movie left the watcher hanging the way this one did.

Both good movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: Stupid!","review":"I went to see this at the movies because everyone was saying how scary it was. Apparently these people don't get out much. The acting was terrible, the camera's wild movements made me sick, the F-word was used in almost every sentence, and I fail to see how piles of rocks and stick figures could scare anybody. I'd rather be stuck on a bus with a bunch of rednecks during rush hour traffic than watch this crappy movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing great about this is the marketing","review":"Not terrible, just tedious. Since we all know that this is not cinema verite, is it cinema at all? The rough camera work and improvised dialogue are dull and repetitious. The \\"supernatural\\" doings are contrived and amateurish. What's more, for such a disingenuous project, there's no sense of humor. That's probably the most deadly thing about \\"The Blair Witch Project\\". As far as being hailed for its lack of special effects--well, Val Lewton had that nailed fifty years ago. I'd never thought I'd say this--but if this is the best work than can be accomplished on a low budget, give me James Cameron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, oh God, Why","review":"This is one of those films that should have been featured on Mystery Science Theatre 3000. The acting was horrible, the characters were incredibly dumb, and the film gives it's own ending away in the very beginning. The only things that got me interested was the fact that it was all improvised, and it was a low budget movie (most of which turn out to be pretty good!)The plot consists of a young girl who decides to go into the woods with two guys to see if they can get a glimpse of the fabled Blair Witch. After interviewing a couple of local yokels who look like they should have gotten a spot in the movie \\"DELIVERANCE\\", they begin their hunt. The rest of the film consists of running and screaming the \\"f-word\\" for no reason.

I bet you that's where they got the idea for the Blair Witch symbol...somebody looked up at a ceiling fan and said, \\"Hey. This could actually work. I mean, most people are stupid enough to buy into it.\\" As Chris Rock stated during the MTV Movie Awards, I'd also like to know where the people are with the other 30,000 dollars that it so called \\"took to make this movie.\\" Hardly.

It's ridiculous. Not at all scary. You have 3 annoying college kids on \\"a project\\" in the woods, and their enthusiasm quickly evaporates, in part, because they have to \\"rough it\\"-----that means, they have no electricity or running water. So they bicker a lot, whine a lot, and yell f***-you a lot at each other. It's 2 guys and a girl, and the girl is supposed to be the leader of the project. She's the one who is the most annoying. And the guys make fun of her. Well, the group finds \\"signs\\" in the woods which scare the crap out of them, such as piles of rock and twigs. Gee, really scary. NOT! While watching this move, I nodded off....it was that silly and boring.The end was very confusing. If it was done that way as a lead-in to a sequel, well, Okay.

A good film to hoax anyone with who doesn't know the secret (and I'm not ruining it here, because, if you do buy this film, the secret is the only endearing thing).

Ok, maybe its not exactly a film, but what is a film. To me as long as you enjoy it, and its about 90 minutes its sort of a movie. This film, was scary, but not in the same sense as classic horrors like John Carpenter's Halloween (a classic), or the modern teen horror flicks like Scream. This movie plays more with your mind, you don't see the witch (is there a witch?), you don't see anyone die (do they get killed, or kill themselves?), all you see is what your mind wants you to see. This is even more of a classic when you take into account the small budget it cost, and the amount it took at the box office. The DVD has loads of extras, including extra footage, and a documentory intitled 'The curse of the Blair Witch'.

It wasn't until it came out on video that I gave it another chance.This is by far one of the most boring \\"Thrillers\\" I've ever watched, and I have seen some pretty sad examples let me tell you.The film is basically a group of independent film actors, trying to show how much more intellectual their movie is by having almost every other line be a quick retort or question.An hour and a half of people stumbling around in the woods, swearing, crying and screaming at shadows is not what I would call \\"scary\\".The only scary part, is the fact that it actually scared some critics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blair witch...","review":"this is the worst overrated movie i have ever seen, the critics were either not paying attention or were high when they reviewed this movie. This movie is not worth renting, not even worth seeing on tv. The acting is poor, most of it seemed to be improvisational, why the hell did he drop-kick the map into the lake? It does not even deserve 1 star! don't rent this video!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More humour than horror","review":"I recently watched this movie for the first time. From the moment I first heard about it years ago there was just something about it that made me think that it was no big deal--despite the mammoth hoopla surrounding it--and now I know that I was right. Not that I'm trying to be conceited, that's just the way it turned out. There was really nothing scarry about the movie, although I've come to wonder whether this has something to do with the unadulterated lampooning of the movie after it was released. Probably not though; it just doesn't seem to hit the right cords, and as a result I found myself laughing quite a bit throughout this thankfully short movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riviting.","review":"A film that is shot mostly with 8mm and 16mm cameras, the film makers remember what scared us most as kids, the dark and the unknown fueled by imagination. We learn to fear things in life, but there are basic fears that are hard wired into us, and the makers of this film exploit them briliantly. My wife and I watched this film on October 31st just after dinner, and at 31 years old, I have never watched a film that has left me with goose bumbs THE NEXT DAY. This is an outstanding movie, and a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good acting","review":"I would just love to know if this is based on a true story there is so many rumors going around that you don't know whats true and what is not"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Just Crazy White Kids Lost In The Woods For Two Hours","review":"I saw this movie once with my boyfriend Tyrone and three times with his homeboy Eddie. I thought I was gonna be really scared the first time. It's like two hours of these crazy white kids lost in the woods. They never really find a witch or nothing. After the third time, I hated the whacked out white girl with the plump cheeks and that grating voice. Man, her voice sends chills down your back. She's the scary part. No, but I give it two stars for effort. But it just ain't scary at all. No way. It's just crazy white kids lost in the woods for two hours.

Promised way more than it delivered, made me nauseous, and irritated the hell out of me with its non-story story.

Everyhting about the acting, and attempted \\"real life feel\\", was so bad it was laughable. The profanity was completely overacted and out of context. It was not believeable in the least (pay attention to them following the river, anyone would know better than to think that they were \\"lost\\"). There were some interesting concepts and the interviews with the \\"locals\\" was pretty good (so that is it's only saving grace). Only watch it if you have two hours and $3.50 to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"More power to them","review":"After all the hype, I was expecting something special, scary, or both. I was gravely disappointed. Throw in a great dane, a green van, some groovy music, and a spooky villain or two and you have something.

On the 2nd (or 3rd?) day someone has the bright and practical idea of following the sizable stream they are by DOWNSTREAM! Why not! Of course that would have led them to nearby civilization.

Some kids go out into the woods with a camera and come back with what is a really lousy film. It isn't scary. It isn't funny. It isn't pleasant to watch.

I was very disapointed. The only remotely scary or interesting part is the end. The rest is just a bunch of the cast yelling and crying and shots of the forest floor. It is annyoing and boring.

One of the Top 10 in 1999","review":"Having read all the reviews below, as a horror movie fan, I have something to say. A basic requirement for truly appreciating horror movies is no other than imagination. If you constantly cling to special effects, if a horror means blood and thunder for you, if you are too lazy to use your head and hold such a seeing-is-believing formula towards a horror film, and if your IQ (by which I mean Imagination Quotient) is nearly zero, then this work of art is not for you so spare your unwisely swearing. I love The Exorcist, The Shining, and now I recommend The Blair Witch Project to everyone who enjoys those one-of-a-kind horror classics as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly scarier than Howard the Duck","review":"This overrated, overhyped movie was a complete waste of perfectly good film (or camcorder tape).I could not wait for this movie to end. It is nothing more than people with a camcorder complaining about losing a map and cursing all over the movie. How people can call this imaginative, witty or original is beyond me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone should drop a house on this witch","review":"Great Marketing appears to have drawn the crowd to see this one. Blair Witch offers a creative cinematic perspective however this movie gets lost in a most boring sequence of camping events and one highly annoying female character. The acting is horrible and the plot nothing more than overreactive hysteria to a bunch of freaky nonsense and mind games. The ending is somewhat scary without alot of special effects..but not nearly as scary as it's hyped out to be. I have seen some very creative and scary films without the violence and splatter ... unfortunately, Blair Witch is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"a victim of the hype","review":"i regret to say that i was caught up in the totally unwarranted hype surrounding this movie and spent the money for a dvd . first , it was not frightening and second i found the almost incessant and gratuitous use of profanity to add nothing to the film's storyline , and in fact it detracted from the attempts to build tension and fear. surely , the actors vocabulary is not representative of others of that generation. this film could have been done a lot better while using the documentary type filming technique.

I found the ending particulary awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Fuss??!!","review":"I finally rented this video and it was one of the worst films I've seen in recent memory. I cannot believe the hype and positive reviews that it has received. The female lead over-acted throughout, she ruined it! She was answering or asking her next questions before the person answered. Ridiculous, boring, not worth the time or $4.19 that Blockbuster charged me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only unbiased review you will see here...","review":"I'm sorry I fall in the category of \\"dont know what all the hype was about\\".

My heart pounded throughout the entire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"The Blair Witch Project was a movie that received an unnecessary amount of media attention because of its cinematography and originality. The movie is a little scary but the climax just didn't leave me satisfied. I knew, before coming into the theatre, that this movie was not real, so maybe that influenced my reaction to it. Anyways, if you haven't watched sixth sense yet, go see it and don't be in a rush to rent blair witch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mockery","review":"This supposed film is not suited to even be discussed unless warning others not to watch.

There is no second chance for this group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please dont buy this trash!","review":"This movie contains the worst attempts at acting I have ever seen. The story was equally as horrible. Almost the entire movie is spent with these three idiots arguing about where they should go, instead of getting there. The directors did have a good idea though: \\"Lets make a cheap movie, hype it up via the internet, and see how many cattle we can get to come see our movie for 7 bucks a pop\\". It was one damn good marketing scheme, and made them tons of money; whether or not it was their plan to do so, they certainly do not deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"evil dead ripoff","review":"a fair horror film at best, the blair witch project is cheap ripoff of \\"The Evil Dead\\", the original spooks in the woods movie. forget this and see Sam Raimi's masterpiece (a.k.a. the ultimate experience in grueling terror)"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH HYPE!!!!","review":"To tell you the truth, this movie was pretty bad.

I feel stupid and cheated on wasting an hour and a half for some movie that just nauseates you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot, creative, stupid movie.","review":"I have mixed feelings about this movie. First of all I think the plot is WONDERFUL, VERY creative. The bad part is that they cuss to much, every word was a swear. Also, it was boring and overal not a fun movie. Probably the biggest reason for my mixed emotions about this movie is that the commercial missled me into thinking this was a classic horror movie, and this is far from a GOOD classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"short but powerful","review":"this is a movie that most people will either love or hate. I'm somewhere in the middle. I don't love it, I don't hate it. I was aware of its hype when I saw it. I can't say I was really scared, but I found it quite entertaining, especially the interviews in the beginning. The trio of filmmakers and the people they interviewed were very much like normal people, which gave this film an eerie feel of reality that made us care about them. I don't recommend seeing this on video, because it's so short some people might feel cheated. But I definitely recommend the DVD. It has many extra features including a commentary track and a documentary. Rent it first though. It's a movie so original it deserves to be seen once at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insomnia hit me!!","review":"After this seeing this I had a hard time sleeping, or being alone in the dark.

They believe in the tooth fairy and Santa Claus.4. P. T. Barnum would love them all.Here is my profile of those who don't like it:1. They believe little they hear and about half of what they see.2. Some people would call them cynical. They believe that all people's actions are motivated by self interest.3.

In reality is mostly booring. Maybe only 5 to 10 minutes of real thrill. Now I know why movies are filmed the way they are. I think they exagerated the \\"natural\\" filming.

There is unnecissary swearing, and terrible filming. It was terribly boring. It just started to get a bit interesting at the end, but then the movie suddenly ends unnexpectedly.

Maybe the best I've seen. I guess the thing I really liked about it was that there was no hand holding. No carbon copy, cookie cutter Hollywood baloney. It left a lot to your imagination and the workings of your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Plot, No Direction, No Payoff.","review":"This movie is all hype. All build-up, no pay-off, and no real scares. It could have been an *okay* movie, but the gimmick gets old and the end is horrible. Ford said to make a good movie you need three good scenes and no bad ones. This movie has (maybe) two good scenes and about 7-10 bad ones, but what do you expect? No script, no director. Any coherence that emerges from this mess is due to the editors (who deserve some credit...some). If you want impromptu film making, rent Breathless. If you want scares, get the Exorcist. If you didn't waste your money on the movie in the theatre, don't spend it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking and outstanding movie.","review":"Many people expected to see another high tech movie thriller. This wasn't meant to be a big time hit, that is why the camera work wasn't outstanding. The point is, is that the people who made this movie dared to break the mold of your traditional \\"scary\\" movie. In that respect, it is outstanding. I found the plot captivating because I didn't find out it wasn't real until after the movie. This movie plays off of your own fears better than any movie I have ever seen, for that reason it is an instant classic, much in the same respect as Citizen Kane, Psyco, and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blair Not Scary Project","review":"Everyone knows this is supposed to be more a psychological thriller than gore-fest, but it still fails. 2/3 of the movie has the three main characters screaming at the top of their lungs.....at each other, at the witch, at the creek. If I was that scared for that amount of time, I would be too weak with fear to scream that much. I appreciate what the film tried to do, and I admire the creativity in its approach, but all that annoying screaming never amounts to anything except a lame ending where Mike is standing in the corner in accordance with the legend.....give me a break!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Biggest Hype of 1999\\" coincides with \\"Worst Movie\\"","review":"Let's keep it simple. The plot? Three obnoxious kids go into the woods and - nothing happens. Nothing whatsoever. Zip, nil, doo-dah. For roughly an hour and a half you wait for something interesting to appear on the screen. Does anything ever occur? Nope. Oops, my mistake - the kids fight a lot. What's to like about this movie? Nothing. What's to see? Nothing. What's to be afraid of? That people actually thought this was a movie worth giving up money for. What's to be terrified of? There's a sequel planned. This review actually gives you more plot than the movie had. This movie would never have been made 20 years ago, but studios weren't as desperate then. Leave your brain at the door if you plan to see this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lordy, was I bored!","review":"Low production values, an endless amount of meandering through the woods, cheap effects...I had to keep doing housework to stay even faintly interested.

But I really felt this flick was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Scary as hell!\\"...for less than 10 minutes.","review":"Forget about seeing this movie if you want a horror flick. See a home movie with complete idiots in the cast instead of this and you can save a LOT of time and money. If there was a \\"0 star\\" rating, I would still give it 1 star, because of the horrific end to this whole mess. The ending is basically the movie, so please don't waist your money unless you really like the movie, or you are a hardcore Blair Witch believer.

I think this was a discrace to the three students who died in the woods, and would not suggest this film to anyone. Furthermore the students are alive this was a hoax and someday it will be proven. For ex. the scene where Heather and Mike wake up and find there companion, Josh missing, Heathers' first words were, \\"We didnt get an ear shot...\\" Now when she looks in the wrapped up sticks what does she find there? An EAR..go figure people? Now if they were killed, then like I said this is poor taste in honoring the dead.

What a waste. The only thing I thought was decent was the acting. I thought the kids did an \\"ok\\" job making you believe they were lost and scared. other than that, I thought it bombed big time. The ending was a huge dissappointment. It was basically alot of nothing. I can't understand why anyone would think that this was that scary. I found myself waiting for the scary parts, but they never came. I'm not a big horror movie fan because I think most of them are just slasher flicks. However I do appreciate a good terrifying movie once in a while but this is definitely not one of them. Save your money.

I give credit to the people behind the film for creating a lot of hype around the film which tricked everyone into seeing this waste of celluloid.

Then, my mom wanted to see it and luckily she paid for me. She didn't believe me when I said it wasn't scary. She gets scared easily, and was disappointed also. Then, my friend wanted to see it and of course she wouldn't listen either, but she found out also. So at least I know I'm not the only one that hated it.

For $80,000, this was a bad production; especially since the noises they kept hearing at night (a rather major plot element) would have been SOOO much more effective if I could have actually heard them at all clearly, a problem easily corrected in post-production by the most novice of editors.Dramatic license (a 5-day camcorder battery), obvious oversights (GPS anyone), and at times hammy over-acting bothered me beyond the fact the movie continually gave me flashbacks to my college video production class."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT","review":"I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS INTENSE AND IT KEPT YOU ON THE EDGE OFF YOUR SEAT.

And why was Michael standing in the corner? And WAS there a witch or was it just some \\"crazies\\" living in the house? If the movie was more exciting and/or really scary/suspenseful, I wouldn't have cared - I would've been caught up in the film - but I wasn't. Very overrated film. The directors have a good eye, but need better work on a script."},{"rating":"1","title":"TORTURE","review":"I can't believe that there were people who actually believe this story really happened. Come on, if there had really been three film students missing, we all would have known about this \\"story\\" months ago. Of course, I had to see the movie for myself, and I was never so bored in my life. Obviously people who liked this movie are the same people who are believing that Elvis and Karen Carpenter faked their deaths and are living a secret married life somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!","review":"5 minutes into the movie and I was already waiting for it to end. I think people who are into this movie just like the hype surrounding it. Making a movie camcorder style has been done before. It's just that these guys did a little better job at it and the media hyped it up (not to be confused with advertising hype...though it's getting hard to differentiate the two).My point can clearly be seen by the fact that some people loved it and other hated it. Just look at the other star ratings. It's either 5 stars or 1. Very few in between. I myself hated it and thought it was a waste of time and money.Actually the most annoying part was the girl. I think most people will agree with me on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not stand up to my expectations!!!","review":"well i got to say that the blair witch was not all that it was craked up to be. i guess that i went in there with to high of expectations. but either way, between the motion sickness and the antisipation to be scared out of my wits (which never happened) the only good thing was the acting, you could really see the panic set in at the end. but other than the acting i found the movie to be neither scary nor interesting. maybe if it would have been real i could of gave it a better review....but it was not. so i guess that i got to say that i would not even give it one star....sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough substance to carry the Hype!","review":"The only worthwhile scenes are very short and at the end of the movie. I worked at a video store and couldn't believe all the \\"gossip\\" about the movie being real! Still? Wait until it becomes a .99 cent rental then try it! BOO! There, I just gave a bigger scare than the whole movie! Stick to the original \\"Halloween\\" for a good flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the footage should have stayed lost - or been cut a bit more","review":"There were three scary parts to the film, two I can't review as it would spoil the film and the third is the violent camera work. I accept that this is supposed to be their documentary footage but its hardly award winning stuff.The film did not maintain the interest of the audience, infact, I've never seen so many people walk out of a film. The times that they build the tension they lost it to long stretches of nothing but Heather and Mike arguing.A very clever idea but not tight enough to scare the majority of people. I do however, identify well with the feeling of being lost while tramping/hiking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of the decade!","review":"This is no \\"Exorcist\\". I got the video hoping for some kind of thrill. You could go to the bathroom 5 times and not miss anything. Anyone who has a video camera and knows 2 other people could make this film. They don't even have to be in the movie. I fast-forwarded through the whole movie and didn't even see anything worth talking about. And that's just what the movie was, all talk, no action. Very, very disappointing. Anyone who likes this movie has got to be brain-dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with the movie, just watch the extras","review":"I watched the movie, and quite honesly I do not understand what the big deal was. It was interesting in terms of the dynamics of three people lost in the woods, but in tersms of a horror movie, it fails terribly. The extras were infinitely scarrier than the movie itself. I also believe that any movie which cannot stand on its own (without the aid of its website or extras) is not a good movie and rises slightly above a gimmick."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of money","review":"My husband and I have a collection of numerous types of movies and this one will not be added to it.

We definitely won't make our collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"scary but original","review":"I thought this a great movie but you expect what's going to happen at the end.Don't get me wrong, I loved the ending and how it was so real.

This movie is so bad. It is in no way scary, there is no blood, and the acting is horrible. As if; like I would actually buy this video. I saw it at the movie theatres on opening night because I was suckered by all the hype. The only reason that it is rated R is because of the profanity. I can't believe that there are people out there who are crazy enough to buy this lame crap. Don't waste your money. Believe me, it is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I spent the worst $5.50 of my life to see this!","review":"This was like, the pukiest movie I have ever seen!! I can't believe anyone would belive that it was real or that they'd think it was scary! The only scary thing about it was that it was actully made and that people would see it more than once. The idea was decent, but it wasn't acted at all right. And it shouldn't have been put out that it was fake, b/c then people went to see it and knew it was totally bogus. I will say the directors did a good job with setting up the woods to look like it was real, but again, it wasn't acted right at all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was different then any other movie","review":"I just saw this movie tonight and it was a real scary movie. But I why I didn't give it 5 stars is because if it was really real I would think the kids would shut off the camera when they were crying. Except that it was way cool. You have to watch the whole movie to know what is happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot believe this won critical review","review":"A friend loaned me a copy of this movie to watch and I felt insulted by the loss of time it took to watch it. What passes for realism is simply poor acting. I don't feel (on second) nervous for the people, this is supposed to be a researched project (I work with television production) and they haven't researched the area? Then, for some extremely stupid reason, they throw away the map? The rest get's less realistic and the actors and acting are so annoying you are happy that the characters meet their fate. This movie is flat our garbage and I will never watch it again"},{"rating":"2","title":"EDGE OF YOUR SEAT THRILLER!","review":"This movie, I belive is the best movie of 1999! The people, of course, are real, and although a lot of people say it sucks, it really doesn't, because you can feel their fear through the watching of this movie.That is why I gave it 5 stars, because of the real -life intensity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ed Wood Couldn't Make A Movie This Bad!","review":"This is without a doubt a film which should stand by itself as a true piece of garbage, not even deserving the title of \\"motion picture\\". It is a sad statement of our society that a THING this bad could have enough people like it, so as to enable the producers to make millions! It isn't even good enough for a laugh. Unbelievable GARBAGE! I'm using the DVD as a coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Over Rated, Not scary","review":"Okay, kids are trapped in the woods with something (that you never see) following them. OOOOOOHHHH! Despite the poor acting and alot of swearing- it seems to be kind of a think movie. A movie that if you think about it, it might seem scary. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unscripted, and it shows","review":"Men on film: And now for The Blair Witch Project, Hated it! OK, in all seriousness, I did hate it. First, as my title says, it was horribly unscripted. They cursed and whined and swore and fought and profaned and complained and used colorful French, and in the end, particularly because of their French use(that's a joke), I really didn't care what happened to them. They weren't endearing characters, there was only the scantiest of a plot, which made me hate them all the more, and the ending was just...there. If you like cheap scares, see The Mummy. If you want less cheap scares, see Swirl of Echoes(I think that's the title). If you're habitually empathetic with all movie characters, regardless of jerkiness(pun intended), see The Blair Witch Project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, No Plot","review":"this should have come on network tv. What a waste of $4.00! There was no plot, how do we even know the Blair Witch existed? We don't! I believe that these kids just wanted to make some loot and did. I have a story idea. How about the Blair Witch of the Ghetto! Now that's scary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a good horror film, if.....","review":"Like most of the people out there, I was curious to see what all the talk was about on this movie. Family members had seen it and said it scared the daylights out of them. And these were people who don't scare easy. The only problem was that before I saw the movie, I saw one of the actors on Jay Leno. So when the ending came, I knew it wasn't true. And the ending made the whole movie. The actors/actress should have stayed hidden to make the movie more believable, then it would have scared the daylights out of me. Now you have to wonder, was any of the movie true?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"This film is frightening only if you have never been camping, or if you are somewhat hysterical to begin with. I won't bother with listing everything wrong with it; just be aware that if you are a reasonably self-assured adult the only really effective moment of horror comes right before the end-credits, and chances are you will have given up on the film long before that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Scared Et Al At All!","review":"While watching this video I was rooting for the Witch (not Heather), so that the movie would end sooner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary?","review":"I was more sick then scary. never before did I have to leave a movie because it was making me sick. everything about the movie sucked. how does the battery in the camera lights last so long without a charger? Don't they have a cell phone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept, but....","review":"wasn't this movie supposed scary? i was a little scared after the movie, but that quickly wore off. i was lead by all my friends and reviews to believe it was the scariest movie ever. there is no story behind the legend (except for scattered facts thrown into the movie) but it left me wanting to know more. if you want a real horror mockumentary, go see the last broadcast. another low budget, but much better carried out movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undeniably a blockbuster!!!!","review":"Whomever has seen this movie and did not like it, I must say that you should not be allowed to criticize films. Never has a movie been made that has shown such intense, scary realism as this one did. The low quality of the movie makes it even that more realistic, and you will never find any actors that will be able to show such pure fear as these people. I left feeling deeply disturbed, which is the way one should always feel after a scary movie. This movie is one-of-a-kind, and should definately be seen by everyone!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"This is a truly terrible film. No, really. Not a backlash against its success or anything but just a very bad film. I cannot understand how such a terrible film - three students with a shaky camera - get scared by twigs.It is not scary. It is not tense. It is not good. Please, do yourself a favour and don't bother. Is Hollywood that desperate to produce something \\"new\\" and \\"different\\" that it resorts to releasing a \\"demo\\" film. Don't be fooled by the low-budget tag the film has aquired, this does not disguise how bad it really is.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"PERFECT RECIPE FOR A THROBBING HEADACHE!","review":"I couldn't believe how the people behind the promotions of this trash could claim this is such a good film. I have made video-documentaries myself and based from the footages they've made, the only so-so significant part are the interviews, nothing else and there is not one good video documentary you can make out of those other footages. I have to admit that I was foolish enough to be lured to watch this film, it's worst than the films we have locally. Also, I would like to tell anyone who plans to watch this garbage, this is not even a horror movie, it didn't scare me a bit. What I got at the end of the movie were 1) a throbbing headache 2) an insignificant nightmare for thinking all those times after watching it how bad the movie was and 3) endless disappointments for having to spend on that worthless movie...hear me and deprive yourself of what I felt...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, if you have any self respect don't watch this.","review":"I would have to say with all honesty this was indeed a movie first. This was the first movie I have ever watched that made me want to cut out my own eyes. The fact that I managed to stay awake for the whole thing has lowered my own opinion of myself. I waited and waited for the much anticipated scare. Yet it never came. If you viewed this film and were genuinely frightened by it, I am truly sorry. They do, however, have many institutions available to help you. You obviously have some issues to deal with. As for those of us that are normal, well adjusted, and intelligent individuals who live here in the real world. Don't waste your time. The bottom line is this was the worst film I have ever seen. I feel it will only cause you to question your own intellect and lower your bank account. If you have the money to burn then literally burn it.

WHAT THE F--- DID YOU DO THAT FOR YOU F---ING MOTHERF---ER? \\"Etc.Oh, I forgot to mention: I was not scared for a split second of this movie.

Secondly its not scary to see 3 dorks who get each other in the way be scared all night because of some noises...and thirdlt the ending was just plain idiotic: (Soilers) they start to scream like crazy (dont ask me why) and the camera falls to the floor, interessting, isn't it? o_OMay I add that the F-Word is a huge part of theyr vocabulary?

I've gotten mixed reviews, so I decided to go give it a shot, only to discover that this is the most blatant waste of time and money I have EVER seen. I think about the only thing good about it was the semi-decent ending (and even that wasn't too good). I just kept wanting to slap those idiots in the head for being so stupid... Number One: You don't kick you map into the river. Number Two: If you find a river while lost and hiking, you don't walk away from it, you follow it, and Number Three: If you don't use a compass (which you always should while in an area you don't know!), YES OF COURSE you will walk in a gigantic 15-hour circle. It wasn't scary, it wasn't well written, and I just think anyone who hasn't seen it shouldn't waste their time and go rent/watch the 1945 version of The Picture of Dorian Gray... Now THAT'S a horror flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"See THE LAST BROADCAST instead","review":"Blair Witch was a fair spin on the whole \\"mockumentary horror\\" idea, but it is hardly original. A few years earlier, a better movie came along, but through some tragedy, isn't getting the kudos it really deserves.Blair Witch is rambling, the cameras are so shaky that some audience members would get nauseated during a viewing, and the scares, although bona fide creepy, come few and far between. If you want to see a superior movie with a very similar concept that is much better constructed, less shaky and ultimately more creepy, pick up a copy of THE LAST BROADCAST. It may be hard to find, but it's worth it if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not creative genius","review":"Simply put, I'll never be convinced that they did not steal the entire premise of this movie from the Last Broadcast. That being said, the first time I saw the Blair Witch I admit I was caught up in the entire concept. Now I see it as a horribly flawed movie made by people who certainly don't know how to tell a story. The greatest flaw in the entire movie is simply that the movie can't exist if they turn the camera off. Unfortunatly, its hard to convince the average viewer that someone would continue filming after being stalked in the woods and losing one of your counterparts. In that situation I would have also followed the direction of the planes that you can hear flying over head through out the movie. I wouldn't buy the dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great?more like grazing on the fields of mediocrity.","review":"Starting off, the only reason why everyone thinks and thought this movie was so great is because it was the first movie of its kind.The movie only had one scary part which i wont ruin for you.Little background on characters(so how sorry for them do you feel).Oh, and like the x files, they scare you by showing you what you arent afraid of.Works for the first 30 minutes, then you get used to a bunch of kids running and screaming..and you dont even hear whats chasing them?WTF.Its stupid like that.But in its defense it does have some cool parts in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blair Witch Waste of Time","review":"I thought this movie was an absolute piece of crap. I have seen scarier images watching various nature docuemntaries. I waited until it was released on video then bought it. Unfortunately I was not able to retrun it after I watched it. The idea that the various critics though this movie was \\"Scary as Hell\\", Rolling Stone, really upsets me that these are the people who millions of movie patrons listen to on movie recommendations.

I was close to actually stopping this movie half-way through, and I always finish a movie, no matter how bad it is.

There is no excess of blood and gore, no cheesy special effects, and you don't even see the monster(s). This film works because less is more, the little sounds you hear watching the movie late at night, preferably in October, really instill a feeling of dread in you that lasts long after the movie is over. this is my favorite horror movie, because there is no guy in a hockey mask running around with a knife,(or is there?)and it really gives you the feeling of an urban legend gone awry. This film is better off watched only a few times a year, ideally Halloween, because if you see it too much, then you will become immune to all the subtle little bumps in the night. If you allow yourself to be surprised by the movie, it works so much better. Sit back, relax, and prepare to sleep with the lights on."},{"rating":"1","title":"They made one big mistake that ruined the movie...","review":"Why didn't they show the witch at the end or something? Or a noise of it, or blood, or at least some kind of hint to show that the Blair Witch was there, and the students would meet their doom. That would have made the movie scary at the end (at least for me). It would also leave you with a haunting nag as if to ask: what happened to them. They should have showed something shocking in the house at the end, to make the movie more complete, instead of that ending that just left you confused. That's what I think"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe in the cinema...","review":"Alright...I watched this video at home and in the middle of the day, maybe that has something to do with what I think of the movie, I don't know.

About half way through the movie I completely lost any sympathy for the kids. I wanted them to die, if nothing more than for being so annoying. They were annoying, whiny, stupid people.

Lemme see now... three totally obnoxious, foul-mouth college kids traipse off into deepest Maryland (I'm cracking up just typing this) looking for signs of some kind of local witch. They manage to lose themselves in the woods by a river, yet (did it ever occur to these bozos that if they followed the river they were sure to come to a populated area?) and are never seen again. Don't we wish. They actually came back and made a sequel to this mishmash!

This has already been done, and in much better, realistic ways, I can't believe it, thank god the sixth sense came to rescue the year, because if not who know how much more money this huge piece of $h?t would have made, sure the creators are multimillionares by now, thanks to all of those stupid people that threw their money away.

Yes, it relies on suspense and the unkown to drive your fear. Yes, critics love it. Does that make it something you should buy? Nope.The characters are unbelievable, getting lost in the woods in Maryland? And next to a river no less? It is insane that someone could be that stupid. The suspense created through the filming is nice, and a good break from the teen-age horror flick, but it is ruined by the horrible acting, bad dialogue and ridiculous precept. Do not waste your time and money, it just isn't worth it... you find yourself wishing it were over... and then it is and you say THANK YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Sominex","review":"The shaky film making, the meandering scenes in the woods, the \\"improvisational acting\\" (swearing profusely is NOT acting) made this a real dog of a movie.

Thank goodness it was a free rental (I wasted a gift certificate though)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I think everyone made too much of a big deal out of this movie, I really think it is a waste of time. I wasn't going to watch it in the first place but my friend saw the previews and decided it's THE scariest movie and we should all go watch it. I would usually step out of a movie feeling like i'm in a dream or something, still reviewing all the scenes in my mind but this time I left feeling stupid for paying money for it. It's true that the way they did it- Making the actors face certain situations without knowing about them earlier- and by that acting 'for real'- Is definitely a cool way of doing it, but still overall- I don't think it's worth anyone's time and attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna see something real scary?","review":"If you want to see something real scary, then this is not the film for you.

I was able to capitalize on the \\"is it real\\" question. I played it up just like it was advertised when it was released. I didn't give an answer and told them to think for themselves. It was so fun. Scared the hell out of them. I loved the concept of this movie and the marketing done on it when it came out. A real documentary filmed by three zealous high schoolers just trying to earn a grade. A very creepy finale that leaves much to the imagination.

There was not one creepy moment in the whole movie. The whole thing was so dull that you could only laugh about it. Okay, 3 people are lost in the woods. They are frightened, they fear for their lifes. What are they doing? They are filming each other! They hear sombody scream, they come to a mysterious house. What are they doing? Are they looking for some kind of weapon? Maybe a stone or a branch? No, they are still filming! One of the filmers gets lost. What is the other doing? You got it, he is still filming!

A trio of dumb city kids go off into the woods with little food, but apparently a truckload of film and try to film a documentary about the \\"Blair Witch\\". We are treated to about 20 minutes of a black screen and a good 15 minutes of some pretty trees. Other than that, these guys just go about scaring themselves and boring the viewer. The 'documentary' aspect of the film is overdone, as these guys can't even manage to hold the camera straight most of the time, and the dialogue rarely rises above a fourth-grade level. All in all, about as interesting as watching paint dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never been less scared my entire life","review":"This idea had potential, but ended up just being drawn out and repetitive. It would have been better if \\"whoever\\" was stalking the kids was taking home videos for their own sadistic pleasure... that would have been scary... this was just uninteresting. Watching gave me more a feeling \\"if I was there I'd be freaked out\\", but watching it on a screen didn't quite make it.It get's 1 star for originality and 1 star for the scene when the guy tells the other two what happened to the map, the only scene in the whole movie that illicited a response from me, laughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best legitimately scary movie since the excorcist!!!","review":"i believe i was one of the few people in america who hadnt seen this gem.i guess i was being stubborn and going against the hype, so i broke down and purchased it on amazon.com.

Mostly because it didnt have to depend on the usual blood and violence of horror movies.It plays on the human mind.Thanks!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"how good the movie was","review":"The movie was very realistic. I think that just about everyone I know that watched it had a nightmare. To make it even scarier we took one of our friends out to an old abandoned house right after we all watched the movie and it even scared me a little bit and it was my idea. I still can't figure out weather it is or isn't a true story yet. I thought is was good because it was like reading a book and how they make it so you can't put the book down only I couldn't take my eye of the movie. I seems like the only way you will be able to understand the movie is if you listen very carefully to the begining and everything that they say kind of sticks in your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCAREY AS HELL","review":"In the hour and a half of watching this movie, I have never been more terrified. The fact of knowing this really happened and these 3 students are missing and still have never been found is creepy enough, but to see this kind of footage on tv brings it all to life.

This seemed too real","review":"Most scary movies are surrounded by the same plot. Stupid people being killed one at a time until the main character dramatically kills or supposedly kills(sequel)the killer. I was on the edge of my seat through pratically the whole movie of Blair Witch because it was so realistic. It was so easy to put yourself in anyone of the actors position. For once there was no hero and no monster haking up pretty,young girls who wear two square feet of clothing. There was no omnitiont observer who saw everything, and no creepy noise that built up everytime someone was going to get haked. This movie has given me a whole new outlook on camping. The woods will never be the same again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype scores again","review":"I just watched this so-called horror flick. More like MTV \\"Real World\\" meets \\"Deliverance.\\" Very disappointed with it. The implied horror wasn't very well implied and it wasn't that scary, either. It was simply really boring. However, it was original and creatively made. It's worth watching once for that.

I would rank it no stars but Amazon wouldnt let me. It was not a well thought out or filmed production. They go into the woods, lose the map, get lost trying to get out, find an abandoned house go in get killed. Here is a hint for everyone- if you go into the woods and there is a creek on your right then it should be on your left if you are backtracking your steps, and if you find the house you were warned about dont go in. Another down fall of this movie is its determination to compete with porn films in the language used during the whole film. There was no script- just a cussing competition. It was filmed with a regular handheld video camera and very rarely has a steady screen. It is filmed mostly in the dark with only a flashlight for lighting. A really hyped up movie that fails to follow thru with the promise of \\"terrifying\\" or \\"suspenseful\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"blair witch project","review":"good thing i did not have to pay for to see this piece of garbage by the way i did not want to give it a star but its required"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen.

I cannot think of one moment in the film that was the least bit interesting. I guess there was the initial anticipation that something of some interest would happen, but after 45 minutes of mind-numbing boredom I finally gave up. I guess the rest of the audience I saw it with felt the same way, because everyone in the theater laughed at how ridiculous the ending was, but I guess it was fitting considering how bad the rest of the film was. I basically see this movie as two poorly spent hours of my life that I will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the most awful movie ever made...","review":"This movie was awful.There is no other way to say it. It had the potential to be good but they went NOWHERE with it. I guess because of their limited budget but that doesn't change the outcome.It's a totally predictable movie that leaves you wondering why it was made when you leave the theatre. Nothing is explained about half of the things mentioned on the movie.This is a DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the \\"thriller\\"?","review":"Having experienced the master of psychological thrillers, Alfred Hitchkock, in my youth, I find nothing eerie, or scary, about The Blair Witch Project. The two moments in the film worth watching were left unexplained...therefore meaningless. Script was poor, camera technique juvenile, plot sophomoric at best. The only thing that kept me awake after seeing the movie was the screeching of the female lead...truly annoying. If you are tempted to purchase the movie based on the lure of previously undiscovered footage, be advised that they are only trailers used for advertising. $130 million dollars...boy, weren't we all duped by the studio hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not scary, but very funny....","review":"I went to see it wanting to be scared and to be as serious as a person can be, I was not scared. I don't get the reason people got scared. I am scared more by practical things like people breaking into your house of stuff like that..but anyway, I thought the movie was funny. The way they ran around and ran away from rocks and bickered was absolutely hilarious. I was busting out laughing!! And Heather needs to take a lesson in shutting up. I mean, F--- this and F--- that and F--- you and RUN F---ING RUN YOU FILTHLY BAS----!! The F-word got old after a while, I mean, that is one of the parts I found non-believable. And I think that she could have said it maybe 123 less times. But overall, I think the movie was good, VERY unique, and should be in any movie buffs collection.

While the premise was intriguing, the payoff was not. When you start looking at the clock after a half hour it is a bad sign for any movie. While trying to maintain a documentary feel was assumed, the movie was badly in need of editing, writing, less jiggling camera work, and a sense of what horror is about. There were no scary moments except my wondering how many more times they were going to say the word \\"fu**\\" again. Want a good scare? Watch \\"Sixth Sense\\" or the \\"Changeling.\\" Don't buy this movie, rent it first, then come back to Amazon.com if you feel you really want to own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"scariest movie I have ever seen","review":"This film is not for the unimaginative; most of the frightening things happen off camera and you are forced to use your own imagination.

I wanted to like it because the approach that the writers took to making this movie was refreshingly different, plus I also like movies that convey an atmosphere, not just gore.

I didn't expect them to get along all the time but I also didn't want 90 minutes of three people bitchig and moaning at one another. At the end, I didn't really care about these people.

Not much of a financial loss, right? To tell the truth, I was laughing throughout the film, especially during the tent-shaking scene. Scary? Yeah, right! I normally don't watch horror movies because I do frighten easily, but this didn't even affect me.

HAD those wandering souls been real people who disappeared many moons ago, THAT would have been scary.It amazes me that it made as much as it did. Maybe with the profits, the cameramen can go take a course in photography. The girl can go to etiquette class. The guys can get a real map. I've had a scarier experience in my bathroom.

Stick figures hanging in trees and piles of rocks are NOT SCARY. There just wasn't enough tension or a sense of claustrophobia to make the movie interesting.

Rent, maybe, if only to satisfy your curiosity, but if you do rent, get another film as well because you'll probably want to switch this one off after about 15 minutes.

But with these gimmicks gone, the film does not stand up on its own. Half the time it's a bunch of idiot, hick kids screaming at each other, the other half of the time you have no idea what's going on because all you see is dark, shaky, camera shots. No wonder people left the theater throwing up, if those stories are true. Even if you pay a penny for it, you've still lost your time. Can't I give it less than one star?

That's all I'll ask.Anyway, I started this in the evening while the film was nice and light-hearted and as the film progressed into it's dark, horiffic nature it got dark outside my house which kind of freaked me out. Anyway, it was really entertaining, very well executed, and pretty creepy. The whole idea is really cool I think. I'm surprised people actually thought it was real, but oh well.

I was so annoyed that I didnt even attempt to watch it a second time.Avoid this one. ....I don't usually criticize a horror film coz I like most of them, even ones that are truly aweful but this film is terrible.It's not a horror film, it's a film designed to bore the hell out of you.

All it was was about 3 nimrods cussing like sailors out in the forest, and then the witch kills them. Probably not since the Wizard of Oz have I cheered on the actions of a witch!I don't know what horrible movies you have seen in the past that you would recommend others to kindly stay away from (this movie is second only to \\"The General's Daughter\\" in my book\\"), but please, please, please do not watch this if you have never seen it before!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blair Which(?)

The three protagonists were totally unbelievable (well, I can't believe normal intelligent people wouldn't get their act together and work as a team to solve their problem, after the initial blame directing). I understand they've made a sequel (or a prequel). Sitting through another would be much more a nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious, unsatisfying, boring, predictable. I'm sorry. :(","review":"First, let me say I didn't experience any of the hype. I know you can't believe it, but I missed it. I was dragged to this movie with a friend who was ribbing me the whole way, \\"You've never HEARD of this movie? You've never HEARD OF IT???\\" He filled me in as we went, but when the movie started I only knew it was supposed to be \\"really scary\\" and that people had left the theatre rather than endure the horror.I was braced. But it was a joke. A parody. It had to be. I sort of laughed and nudged my friend, but just like everyone else in the audience, he was taking it dead seriously. So I kept quiet.I found the premise and the \\"handy-cam\\" photography tedious and felt a little sick to know how many budding students of cinema art had their work trashed when these guys succeeded. The whole phenomenon is ludicrous.Maybe if I had been injected by the hype, I would have had some context in which to appreciate this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is absurd!","review":"I must have been living under a rock when this film was first released because I knew very little about it when I rented it. BIG MISTAKE! I was under the illusion that the film was a real documentary that had been discovered. Not only is it not real it is not even good as a fake documentary. I was so dizzy from the camera going up and down and round and round that I could barely keep up. Also the language is filthy. The female explorer should have her mouth sewn shut. It was trashy and vulgar. When the film ended (thank goodness) my husband and I just looked at each other with dumbfounded stares and debated on whether we should ask that our money be refunded. Don't bother with this one. The movie is certainly not frightening but knowing how receptive and excited the entire country was about this film is extraordinarly frightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"the scariest parts were shown on tv for free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this was so ridiculos and lame,it wound up being a comedy.the audience were laughing their heads off.until they realized they paid for this crap!!!!!then the water works began.i had a feeling this was a product of some very clever marketing.and to be honest,i really did want to enjoy this.it was original for the most part,it didnt have any rappers(A HUGE PLUS!!!!!!)and it was supposed to be the most frightening film out.i was very much willing to dish out $... for this.but like i said up top,i saw the best parts on tv.i knew the movie was gonna get bashed,the producers knew this was gonna get bashed.i could see all of the spoofs before they happened.and what do all involved go and do?MAKE AN EVEN LAMER SEQUAL!!!!!!!!!!!!THIS FRANCHISE DIED A QUICK AND VERY ENJOYABLE DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":"Have you ever gone camping?

I was expecting something amazing but this was just lame. As other reviewers have said, it was just boring. The characters (especially the girl) are so intensely annoying that you just cannot wait for them to go down. I didn't think it had any real atmosphere at all and the joggling camera REALLY started to bug me after 20 minutes. And as for that last scene, with the guy against the wall? I thought he was there emptying his bladder. I gave this one star for the audacity of the hype and another star for the actor with the goatee (Josh) as he is quite fit and the only reason for a repeated viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dumb horror movie!","review":"This movie was just like Deliverance except it's not even scary. I can't believe they lied to us when they said it was a true story. If your going to go rent this movie you will be a little disappointed. It's just about three filmmakers who get lost in the woods and can't find there way out. There are too many bad words in this movie too. Do not see this movie it's bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time investment","review":"I have to go with the other reviewers who have described this as a boring, tedious film where not much of anything really happens. The only scary part was at the very end, and even that leaves you scratching your head wondering what happened. The concept for the movie was original, so you have to give them credit for that. But it just wasn't as frightening as the filmmakers thought it would be or as the hype led me to believe. I found it silly and annoying, particularly the never ending use of the f-word, the s-word, etc. These kids should have been bright enough to come up with better dialogue than that. But the main thing is it just wasn't that scary. If they had shown some kind of menacing figure off in the distance, a shadow, just SOME kind of tangible evidence of some creepy witch or other bogeyman, it would have been much scarier. Little piles of rocks and stick figures just aren't very scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bland Witch Project","review":"This movie is more a snooze-fest than a scream-fest. A good 77 minutes of the movie is just meandering drivel, as most documentaries made by teenagers are. I see what the filmmakers try to do in this part, which is to build suspense, but that won't work if there are annoying, foul-mouthed teens in the way. By the time the movie finally becomes a REAL horror flick in the last 10 minutes, you'll either have given up on the movie, fell asleep, or got too bored to notice. All the hype about this movie is built up on the last 10 minutes, so for those of you who haven't seen it, just go straight to the end. Trust me, you won't be missing anything. Otherwise, just have a friend sneak up on you and yell \\"Boo!\\" and you'll probably save money."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrifying","review":"this movie is horrifying. horrifyingly hyped up. this movie is not scary at all. i had heard it was like the scariest movie ever. pleas, the scariest part of the movie was just when a camera drops. a camera dropping. if that is the scariest scene in a horror movie then this movie shouldnt of even made it to the theater. it should have been a straight to video realease. take my advice dont but or rent this movie its all hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not EVEN Entertaining","review":"This movie lacks everything, from good acting to a well developed script. The plot is by now very well known, however this moview is neither scary nor entertaining. It is impossible to feel what is on screen is actually occurring (or did occur) hence making it jsut as impossible to be scared by the movie. As a horror movie it failed me. The script and acting are so bad, that watching BWP is worse than having to read a dreadful novel for your high school english class....the first 20 minutes or so of the movie are unbearable, worse than bad documentary. Well, I for one did not appreaciate this movie, but I can only speak for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money and Watch Scooby Doo Instead!","review":"\\"The Blair Witch Project\\" is tied with \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" for the most overrated and downright silly movie of 1999.The plot is really pretty simple - a bunch of Gen X'ers get lost in the woods, say the \\"F\\" word a lot, and get picked off one by one. Nothing you can't get from your average episode of \\"Scooby Doo\\", except for the language and violence. But even if foul language and wanton violence are what you want in a movie, there are still better choices than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new version of Deliverance","review":"Really, if you don't like suspense films, this movie is not for you. I found it a good example of a suspense plot. The unexpected is in every shot of the film, ritual marks, frighten night sounds, isolated woods, the panic of being lost, guilty feelings. No one can see who is haunting this group of youth persons. Camping, in such conditions is really a nightmare. If you saw Deliverance, 197?, a group of far mountain residents takes an explorer group men as haunting animals. In the Blair Witch Project these three youngs are taking in such manner. We can't see who use them as sadistic victims, in the final scenes, in such scary situation, all she has to do is scream, scream, scream..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie reeks!","review":"I would have assigned this movie minus stars if that option had been available. If you are afraid of your own shadow and your IQ matches your shoe size then this is the movie for you. However, if you have any gray matter in your head you will avoid this movie like the plague.

This movie should have a subtitle, \\"I'm Gonna Make A Cheap, Boring, Waste of Time, Idiotic Movie and Hype It To The Rafters So I Can Rip People Off and Laugh All The Way To The Bank!\\" Being from the Capitol Hill area of DC I can tell you that listening to the bologna espoused by our elected (and wannabe elected) officials is infinitely scarier than anything this movie has to offer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to call it the Blair Witch Bomb","review":"Amid all the hype about this movie I saw a \\"documentary\\" about it on TV and thought it might be real. My sister, daughter and I had to go to a city 130 miles away to see it. What a waste! Turns out the documentary was scarier than the movie. My daughter, who is 19, really was unnerved. My sister and I kept looking at each other thinking \\"We paid money for this?\\" My thought was that if I was lost in the woods, to heck with the cameras, let's get our attention on getting unlost.

I was totally convinced that this was going to be a fantastic movie; The reviewers were convinced, some friends saw it in the USA and said it was good and the newspaper reviewers said it was good - It couldn't possible be anything other than good? Oh boy was I angry when I saw it. A bunch of American students running around swearing at each other for 80 minutes and getting scared about absolutely nothing! The girl narrator was appalling.

If you didn't like the film or weren't intelligent enough to put yourself in the characters shoes - stop whining about it it doesn't mean the at the directors are to blame - it's you! Just remember next time to book yourself into Van-Damme's next film ok? Personally i found the film a refreshing and realistic - almost Film Noir masterpiece - I went to see it with four of my closest friends who were all male and they found it equally entertaining.

It's not. It's more psychologically horrifying than anything else. And also unlike anything you'll run across on MTV or whatever else you're into. Nothing jumps out and grabs you in BWP....you have to do something far more scary....use that thing between your ears. This movie wasn't meant for the masses. Masses: stick to the Friday the 13th series and Meg Ryan movies. Leave independant cinema to people who appreciate and understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of the century","review":"I consider myself fairly sophisticated when it comes to movies. I have loved movies my entire life and I usually love critically acclaimed films, especially odd and obscure ones. I love art house films! The Blair Witch Project, however, has completely baffled me with its' success. It is, with no exaggeration, the worst movie I have ever seen. I found it to be almost unwatchable and it was not scary in the least. The actors are irritating and the dialog is insane and repetitive. It is a gimmick which has gone over quite well. I would not recommend buying this dvd if you have not seen it yet, unless you want to use it as a frisbee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, scary as a mud puddle.","review":"I had high hopes for this movie, and it let me down completely. Bad acting, unneeded and constant use of the F word. Undeveloped story... The main characters totally unlikeable. I personally couldn't wait until they were killed off. It could have been a great movie, but the producer/director/actors would all have to be changed and a writer who knows how to develop a story would have to be hired.

I'm all for making horror movies that don't show too much, but this piece of turd doesn't show ANYTHING. Nothing. I'm sorry, but lame. Low budget is not the problem. Overacting, no script, and no idea what the hell you are doing, is. I have been more scared by the spiders in my basement than this jelly.If your expecting a story, look elsewhere.

Basically a boring ripoff of Cannibal Holocaust about student film makers who go into a woods investigating a legend about a witch and never returned but their footage was found.

Unfortunately, it ended up being a waste of five dollars. I don't see what's so scary about it; all you really see is three kids running around in the woods and getting lost, which is frightening, but only if you're one of them! Stick figures popping practically out of nowhere is mysterious from the audience's point of view, but doesn't exactly send chills down one's spine, unless, again, you're one of those kids. There really is nothing scary about the film, with the exception of the fact that it was based on a true story and if there is one area the film succeeded in, it was making you apprehensive about venturing out into the woods of Burkittsville, MD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I ever saw, and biggest waste of cash","review":"I would not recommend this movie to anyone, in fact, I have told people to NOT go see this movie, unless they like throwing their money away.

I thought that it was going to be really scary, but what it was, was really stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"I may never go camping again...","review":"I saw this movie years ago, in a bursting-at-the-seams packed theater. I had to wonder at the people bringing their three year old to this movie and the constant crying sort of proved my point. There was also a very drunk person that puked in the aisle more than once during the movie. And yet somehow I was trasported to a place of such terror that I almost puked in the aisle myself, and longed to join the child and cry out loud. This mock-umentary is so suspenseful and frightening I have to put it right up near the top of my list of all time scary movies (simply for the scare factor, not for the plot). At that time I computed the movie in my brain as a true story, not a work of fiction, and I've never been able to fully rewire the association. And therefore, any time I go camping I require prescription drugs to get anywhere close to sleep. Thanks Blair Witch Project, for ruining my chances at a peaceful time in the great outdoors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary now? No. Scary then? Yea","review":"If you saw it in the theater on opening night, you know what i'm talking about. At that time, whether it was real or a hoax was for the most part unknown.

It was a one shot deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"Well, it wasn't scary... but then very few things scare me. It was certainly a very different movie with an intriguing story line. They could have limited the use of the \\"F\\" word (maybe cut it back to every OTHER word, instead of every word). I really enjoyed it. The only bad thing is, whereas every movie has one line that you remember from it, the one from the BWP was Heather's confession, which is also the only spoken part of the movie that does not contain profanity and the only part of the movie that does not require yelling and screaming and being stupid. But it will definitely stick with you. Perhaps it is significant that I have seen that music recently, and I am leaving soon to go camping in the woods. Trust me, it is not that scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"The Blair Witch Project proves that you can have no budget, zero production value, no script, terrible actors, hopelessly incompetent photography...and still make a lousy film.

That mean's we're still alive, because we're smoking!\\"Also, these people were supposedly stuck in the woods for about a week, but they somehow managed to have enough battery power, without recharging, to keep their camcorders and flashlights going during the entire duration.

When exactly was it even remotely frightening. Boring, yes. Stupid, definitely. Waste of time and money, absolutely!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll spare you the trouble...","review":"This is the worst low budget film ever made. Seriously, my recent Hi-8 of a family picnic where the dog jumped onto the table and stole a hamburger is scarier and has better production values than this lame excuse for a horror movie. People get lost in the woods, they gradually disappear, something vaguely scary is going on but the camera doesn't hold still long enough to catch anything. You know when you roll down a hill in a trash can and then try to walk? Imagine you're holding a camera while doing that. That and hearing ambiguous evil sounds like \\"the owl, the mongoose, or the washing machine whirr kind of altered to sound kind of creepy.\\" Cinematography aside (far aside), Casting was done very well, if the goal of the film was to pick people who the audience wanted to see summarily killed by the end of the film. In that case, awesome choices. [applause]."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of celuloid (film)","review":"If I could give this film negative stars, I would! I did not find it scary at all. It was not inventive, imaginative or anything redeeming. This is really a \\"movie\\" about some kids acting stupid in the woods. The characters are just not believable, and it was very hard for me to believe that there is something out there that these people are really scared of. If you have not seen this movie I would not recommend wasting your time on it unless you are jut dying of curiosity. That and the fact that a good friend of mine told me it scared the living daylights out of him and he had nightmares for days are the reasons I watched it. I cannot figure out how he was so frightened by it. I generally have a wild imagination, but this did not grab me."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like this movie stop now","review":"This movie was vaguely frightening which is I suppose the only thing that saves it at all. However once you get over the hype and the motion sickness it all boils down to one thing. Three people ... in the woods. I will make a few allowances for it being a visionary film as far as how it was made, etc. However, If i wanna spend hours listening to people complain. I will go to work. Frankly, after listening to these three whiners for 90 minutes, I was kind of glad when they all bought it in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece","review":"Actually, I wish I could give this movie 0 stars, but the Amazon rating scale won't let me! This was suppose to be scary? I simply became sick from all that damn camera shaking. The characters were annoying and the ending was terrible. Anyone could have made this movie. What really makes me angry are the people that acually liked this movie or were scared by it. Are you kidding me?

But to prove that it really did scare her, when she went to the bathroom at 3 that morning, I went and stood in the corner and waited for her to come back. Her piercing shrieks would've fit right in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the footage was real, it might have been a little scary.","review":"I think that this movie made it's fame through hype. I'll admit, I was excited when we finally got the video and we first turned it on on Halloween night. However, it was possibly one of the most boring movies that I've seen... recently at least. I was extremely disappointed. It was cheaply made, which is what brought it all of the attention I guess, but there are plenty of other scary movies with good special effects and where the camera doesn't bounce around the whole movie filming feet and piles of rocks.

I kept waiting for something remotely scary, but before i found that the credits went up, what a relief. The phrase \\"its what you dont see that scares you\\" is just an excuse for having no budget. I think lots of people gave this move good review for the simple reason that its not a mainstream hollywood film, regardless of whether it was any good or not. Too be scard by this film i think you would have to be the sort of person who got terrified by your next door neighbour coughinh at night, this film really is dreadful. i would reccomend that you dont wasted your money on seeing this film, rent somethong scarier, like the rugrats movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blair -Yawn- Witch Project","review":"I had already seen this at the cinema and wasn't really interested in the DVD. I sat down, turned the lights off, hoping to recreate the cinema atmosphere and try to catch the horror i must have missed the first time... something i now regret. Whatever effect (however minimal it was in the first place) this had at the cinema was completely lost on the DVD. It was not scary, it did not seem real at all and the acting was simply ludicrous now that i think about it.

Not because I wish to deny them of their right to an opinion, but because I take offense to the constant insults to those of us that HATED the movie. Get off your high horses people, if you actually enjoyed this movie then maybe a reality check is in order of YOUR \\"intellect and imagination\\". I am not a violent person but I wanted the characters to be brutally killed, not because I'm a \\"brain-dead suburbanite that was raised to expect blood, gore, and explosions\\", I just wanted to shut the VCR off and stop waiting for something remotely interesting to happen.

Drove way out of my way to avoid the only woods in this city. Didn't even want to look at my sleeping bag, let alone a flashlight. Terrified of going anywhere in Maryland, which is hard if you live in DC. I'm just glad I saw this AFTER going on my big camping trip for the summer.In the theater I was distracted by the shaky camerawork and the endless bickering. Even the last 10 minutes didn't really scare me -- just seemed a little silly. But afterward, in thinking about it (the great thing is there are a lot of different ways to interpret what happened) and putting it all together? I was scared. The bottom line: it doesn't look great, and there's no slick editing or anything, but if you have half a brain in your head you will be scared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche","review":"Ok this was bad really bad. I mean first it made me sick watching the damn camera moving around but I would've been able to deal with it if it had an original and scary idea.

Come on how many people didn't know what that meant? and then how many people didn't see 2 stones popping up after that one guy died???? Those are just 2 of the Cliches. Now about the movie being \\"scary\\" it wasn't, not in the least. First off the nights were way too frickn' short to be scary, a movie as triveal as Friday the 13th could stretch one single nite into one long movie that had some scares. When this movie gets remotlie interesting they say \\"turn off the camera\\". that is so retarded and annoying.In short this is not only horrible but it is also a bad horror Cliche that isn't good for ONE fun cheap scare."},{"rating":"2","title":"woo hoo this was a thrill ride from *middle* to end!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie was extremely boring IN THE BEGINNING but as the movie went on it got more exciting AND creepy.

For me, low budget and independent do not have to be synonymous with complete lack of filmmaking technique, which is what I saw in this grossly overrated film. Examples of films done on a shoestring budget that show dazzingly skillful and inventive technique include \\"pi\\", Sam Raimi's \\"Evil Dead\\", and Michael Almerayda's vampire flick, \\"Nadja\\". \\"Blair Witch\\" on the other hand, looked like it could have been made by any minimally competent group of college film students or cable access producers, once given the original premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was a ok movie, it started off rather slow.

Three young actors swearing and arguing their way through mostly jiggly video and chasing suspicous sounds in the dark. When it ended, I was one of about 15 people who all said at the same time, \\"Is that it?\\" It was unreal! We all said the same thing! None of us could believe it. If you just gotta see this, save your money and borrow it from some mope who wasn't as wise. If you love it, fine. We have different taste. But I've seen lotsa movies; lotsa scary movies.

Watch Lilies or Maurice instead, or 'Mars attacks'."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Totally Disappointing Movie.","review":"I just recently saw this movie and can't believe how overrated it is. The idea behind this movie wasn't bad--it's just that The Blair Witch Project went nowhere and fell flat. I feel that this movie could have been a whole lot better, but my impression is that it was made too quickly or something. Another thing--this picture is not a horror movie, but it tries to be a psychological thriller. I can't say the acting was bad, it's just that The Blair Witch Project has been horribly hyped and overrated. I can honestly say that I didn't get scared even once. The ending to this film was poor also. I felt really cheated. The idea behind this movie wasn't completely bad, it's just that it didn't come off well at all and was a complete waste of time. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"It was a pointless movie, about three kids with no guts that were buggin about every little sound that is normal to hear in the woods. It will make you motion sick. It was not scarey, I would go out in the woods right after watching it and wouldn't be scared. It didn't have enough blood and guts you know the gorry stuff like if Heather or Josh got hacked up. I will never watch this movie again not on HBO, Cinimax, or FOX.

The wait was in vain. I have to give it credit for its originality in the style that it was filmed, and the improptu dialogue, though I thought Eddie Murphy might have had a hand in the writting since only his movie seem to have the f-word as much as this did.

The only thing that should have died was the batteries for their cameras. How did they manage to last so long, anyway?

If you like the woods of Maryland and listening to idiots who haven't got a clue what they're talking about then this is the film for you.The plot is sketchy at best and how anyone can actually consider that this was even based on a true story I don't know. I know children who have come up with more convincing and 'Real Life' supernatural tales.On the whole jolly bad show, it's a shame it wasn't a true story.Advice to budding BWP style film-makers, try filming in a backdrop with a little more history and put some realistic scenes from supernature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over hyped but significant","review":"It was well over-hyped. From the reports on tv I was hoping for something that would mess me up for life but that isn't the case. It's not nearly as scary as people make out, in fact I only jumped once at the very end. Some of the acting seems a little \\"over acted\\", like they're trying to hard, amateur night really. But it's a significant film as far as movie history goes and it's nice to see something shot on a low budget that's watchable. I'm more of a fan of bug budget hollywood efforts, certainly not cult cinema but I enjoyed this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farce of the Blair Witch","review":"The Blair Witch Project was a stunning breakthrough in the filming industry. This movie's incredible first-person viewpoint kept me on the edge of my seat. If one hasn't paid too much attention to the media this is a study in cult horror.

I expected to be scared senseless, though. And I wasn't. It was creepier to think about afterwards than it was to watch it. Too much arguing. Too much whining. And a couple of pretty big gaps in the logic. I've never met anyone who throws away a map because they're lost. I just didn't buy it. However, if I was convinced going in that this was a true documentary and that this actually occured, then it would have the potential to be the scariest movie ever made, simply because it would be like a true snuff film.

Too many movies these days rely heavily on special effects to keep the audience entertained and spend precious little time on character development. This movie is not one of those. All you get are the characters and a direct line into how a weekend in the woods wears down the minds of three young people. Excellently acted, very genuine. Yeah the cameras were shaky...yeah there was lots of cussing....but think about it....If you were out in the woods for days, without food, lost as all get out, and being pursued by some unseen thing/person....how would you be acting?

Having seen the movie in its limited run before it went nationwide, before the media latched on, I was neither disappointed or impressed.

It isn't revolutionary, I could point a video camera into the darkness and shout\\"OH MY GOD THERE IT IS THERE IT IS!!!!\\" But then again maybe I would get caught up in plot. I do credit this film for returning its viewers to an age old idea: Your brain is scarier than what your eyes. How cute. I also credit the filmmakers (One of which ran off with about $39,000) for a very savvy marketing effort. The bottom line, while not revolutionary, it was a good ride.

There were times when it seemed like you were watching an actual documentary rather than a movie. I can also appreciate that, unlike most films, you are not readily presented with what you are supposed to fear. A good job was done of presenting an atmosphere. There was no \\"horror movie formula\\" being followed, which made the outcome unpredictable.I guess my problem was that I didn't enough of a connection with the characters to care whether they lived or died.

Mr. Lee's own account of his childhood, early adulthood, film career, and genuine love for his wife and daughter often brought me to tears, made me laugh, and inspired me. This was, clearly, someone who made the most of what was given to him in life.After reading his autobiography, I can honestly say that this is a man worth knowing. He has had a phenomenal life, accomplished more than most, and appears to be a genuine \\"good guy\\" trying to make it through life, just like the rest of us! Hats off to you, Mr. Lee! You are superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't believe this is Singapore (or how fast it changed)","review":"Its simply amazing going through Singapore's history through this book. Its almost unbelievable how much change has occured in Singapore, especially when you look at pictures of Orchard Road in the book and it looks literally like an orchard, unlike the ultra-modern shopping district it is now. Or the pictures of Bugis as an old Malay village with it just next to the shoreline, and thinking about the amount of land that has been reclaimed. You'll encounter feelings and thoughts like this over and over as you go over this book.Recommended for the Singaporean who's curious on our own past, or for the visitor to Singpapore who wants to know more about this small island nation.The only thing that I find disapointing with the book are the photos chosen for the \\"modern era\\" depiction of Singapore. Some of those pictures simply don't belong there, like the pictures of the local actors and actresses..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supremely silly","review":"Perfect humor for 4 through 7 year-olds, but silly enough to be enjoyed by the whole family!My father used to read it to me when I was a kid, and I'm just so glad we found a copy for my son..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am silly, you are silly","review":"Bought this for my nephew who is about to turn 4.

If I had read the book before I purchased it, I would not have made the purchase. I was prepared to really enjoy reading all of the silliness.

It is a little dragged out and slow. I think this could have been done in a couple of chapters, then the daughter comes on the secene. After the little girl comes into the picture is when the book actually becomes very good, but it doesn't leave much time till the end of the book, which leaves a lot of questions unanswered.This is the first in a series of three books about three college roommates, which was not elaborated upon in this book.

I can't afford it so far but keep checking. Well worth reading, trust me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of the Slackers","review":"I eagerly awaited the release of Close My Eyes and rushed out to buy it. I wasn't expecting what I heard at all. It sounds quite different from their earlier stuff, but, nevertheless, it's a good album. Close My Eyes is more toned down than the Slackers' other music, though it still mantains the energy and soul of a skanking classic so central to the Slackers' style. The album also sports a slightly modified band lineup (Ruggiero leading of course and Lyn also on vocals) with subtle trombone and tenor sax sans trumpet.My advice to all loyal Slackers fans is to buy Close My Eyes because it truly is a good album and it's a new phase in the band's evolution. But to listeners new to the Slackers and especially those new to Ska, I would recommend getting The Question and/or Redlight, arguablly their best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slackers Rule NYC!!","review":"One of the best releases of the year and an almost perfect album from begining to end. Every song just gets in your head and refuses to leave until you play the album again and sing out loud! Rocksteady riddims abound (old dog, bin watin etc) but there is plenty of good old slow ragga jams (real war, lazy woman).Until this moment I have been a casual fan of the Slackers but now I will never miss a gig!

I didn't know who would like it more, him or his mom. As it turns out the whole family has enjoyed it, especially my 8 year old nephew. Some reviews mentioned that the kids don't enjoy it because they don't know who the guest hosts are but I have to say in our case that wasn't an issue. Actually I'm pretty sure I had no idea who Peter Sellers was when the show originally aired. It is a classic for the whole family to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milk","review":"This short novel is based heavily on events and characters from the authors own life. A typical DArcey Steinke tale in that it is more than a little bit sad, somewhat ugly and yet still beautiful all at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Trinity","review":"Darcy Steinke weaves together a wonderful journey where you observe spirituality, sexuality and the diversity of the human condition through the dark and ambiguous lens that is the writing of Ms. Steinke.There are few answers here because there are no \\"right and wrong\\" where these things are concerned. The mundane lives of the characters in this novel hide the complexities that lurk beneath the surface, the desires that drive us to take great risks for small rewards.The command of language is wonderful, and her take on view from the bottom that she exibited in Suicide Blonde is even more developed, so palatable in this book that you can taste the desperation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I Thought","review":"I read the summary of this book and thought it would be very interesting. Instead all I got was a lot of unanswered questions. Mary just had a child and is unfilled by her husband, who stays out long hours supposedly working. Walter her gay Episcopal friend is looking for love in all the wrong places, and John the monk who just left the monastery that Mary ends up having a sexual relationship with.The author intertwoves religion and sex that part I did not get. Did not enjoy but felt I needed to complete this book at least to see what happens and yet everything still was not tied in. I know not all books come to a full conclusion but this one left you hanging long before it was close to ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing","review":"The plot is actually rather interesting, but then the writing is rather poor. Jennifer Cloud does not have a huge future, though she did have a interesting plot in this one. The characters though don't make very much sense at all. Craig is very poorly written. He's suppossed to be insane I guess, but he's too reasonable for that throughout, and he's too stupid to have any feelings for. The protagonist, James, is rather poorly written himself. Julie is probably the only mildly interesting character in the novel, but she doesn't fill as many pages as the other two. Overall, good premise, bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Setting the record straight.....","review":"I really can't review something that's not out yet, but I had to comment on a previous \\"review\\". The author of that review bashed The Sims Online (TSO). I agree with his assessment of TSO, but it has nothing to do with Makin' Magic. Makin' Magic is an expansion to the original game.

All of them have had success and has added something very unique to the game. The Sims: Makin' Magic Expansion pack is supposedly the last of the Sims, that is, until the Sims 2 is due to release March 15, 2004. I had wished that Maxis' last addition would be the use of cars, bikes, and motorcycles. To me, this last expansion seems like Maxis' afterthought before they come out with Sims 2, which they are promoting a lot. Makin' Magic does not appeal to me because there is already magic in some current expansions. Maxis should be reducing the price of this expansion since it doesn't deserve to be called one."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE PATIENT AND WAIT A BIT LONGER!!!!!!!!","review":"EA has made alot of expansion packs for the Sims this one doesent seem to much fun. the main turn off is that there coming out with a game called the sims 2 in febuary and it suppost to be much better than all the other sim games.

If you're a die-hard Potter fanatic, this expansion might appeal to you, but a lot of people don't like the fact that the series has gone in the opposite direction of an everyday-life simulator.After Unleashed (the best expansion IMO) the game takes a solid five minutes to start up and will take up multiple gigs of hard drive space. And that's assuming you haven't downloaded any fan-created content from the web.Makin' Magic is not an great expansion, but it's decent for adding a couple more hours onto a franchise well past its prime. With The Sims 2 on its way, there's not much reason to spend money on Makin' Magic. I'm an unabashed Sims fan, but after seven expansions it's time to stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sims + Harry Potter = One happy person","review":"OMG!!! Can it get any better? An all-new Sims expansion pack combiened with the magic of Harry Potter! Although I haven't played it yet I'm sure that this will definately be the best expansion pack, and what a way to end a great game!

Please Maxis stop making expansion packs, I admit they are great, but why not just make another Sims with all the stuff together. Now I know people are gonna say, they use it to make more money!

Extreme caution is required when opening the spout, which snaps open, b/c hot waters spits out and will scald your hand if you don't move it out of the way fast enough.

In this work, Vlastos works through four big questions about Socrates and the Socratic method from Plato's early dialogues in an elegant fashion.

It feels like it is pressing up against the arch of my foot, and it really is kind of painful. I really like Adidas, but unfortunately I can not recommend these sneakers, because they remain uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap cut, runs really small","review":"UPDATE: I notice the price on these has dropped substantially from the original $50.00 or so that I paid. At the price they are now, they're Wal-Mart material (and that's just about right) but you wouldn't be paying extra for shipping at Wal-Mart.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Just received these yesterday and was horribly disappointed. The size 8-1/2 is equivalent to a size 7-1/2 !! Ridiculous. I might have been able to understand this if I'd bought a really cheap shoe or an off-brand. But these are Adidas, mid-priced, and there is no excuse for this. Now I have to go through the hassle of taking these to the post office to return them and waiting for my account to be credited. If life were fair, I'd be credited for my time and trouble to do this, but that hassle is the cost I'm now paying for the convenience of shopping on the internet. I'll think long and hard before I try to buy shoes this way again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable enough but not even worth the cheap price","review":"I should have known better when I bought these. I guess part of the blame lies with me because I was looking for a cheap tennis shoe and I got what I paid for. They're comfortable enough, I guess, but I couldn't play tennis in them more than once because they soles were almost completely smooth after playing in them. I was sliding all over the court. Not good and I haven't worn them since.If you're just looking for a shoe to wear around casually, these would be fine. If you're looking for a shoe to actually play tennis in, definitely look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality Shoes","review":"I don't expect that these shoes made by Adidas are such low quality.

The kind of \\"perverse\\" reversal that occurs in this piece of nonsense has been done before--namely all or most at least of the Britcoms that I have seen over the years. Problem is they do it so much better. If anyone recalls \\"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin\\" I'm sure you'll understand what I am talking about. In fact I believe the author of those books was someone named David Nobb. But after the Monty Pythons and some of the others --in fact even Americans are doing it better, eg.

What a wimpy ending, if you can even call it an ending.The main premise of the book seemed to be to remind its readers that they have everything, there are people who have nothing, and that the readers should give their possessions away and then they will have nothing too.Being good in this book seemed to have everything to do with money, and nothing to do with the soul: especially conerning the scene with GoodNews's sister.An absolutely pointless, stupid book. Don't read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indulgent","review":"This was an interesting premise, and in some cases very funny. But it raved on too much. I understand that Hornby was trying to get across some deep ideas, but a good storyteller will do that though the story. There was too much inner monologue here. However, the description of a long marriage was good, if a bit depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"I've had bad luck with Hornby. I became familiar with him through movie adaptions of his earlier work. They were excellent movies with characters I liked and related to, so I can only assume they are based on very fine novels. This led me to pick up the next Hornby book that came along. The premise appealed to me and I was entertained by this book's opening pages, but as it moved along it seemed Hornby had less and less to say and nowhere else to go with the plot. His breezy writing style made this book easy enough to read so I did make it through to the end. But I was sad to have been introduced to the prose of such an obviously talented writer by such a forgettable novel. No doubt he has more top notch books left in him, but this one certainly won't be the novel to base his eventual legacy on."},{"rating":"1","title":"deathly dull, thin as paper","review":"What a disappointment.

I was very disappointed...","review":"I have never read a Nick Hornby before and received this one as a birthday gift. Started out with a lot of promise and then just COMPLETELY lost steam. He didn't follow through on any of the issues he raised, they all just sort of faded away.Also- I felt like I was reading a screenplay instead of a book, that Hornby was so obviously angling to create the film that will presumably be created from this, rather than a book. It was as gimmicky as \\"Liar, Liar\\" or \\"What Women Want\\" in its plot-what happens when the crankiest guy in the world becomes a 21st century hippie? Unfortunately, nothing happens, really. I was very disappointed in this one- it was a chore to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are you and what did you do with Nick Hornby","review":"I adored High Fidelity and About a Boy. Hornby is a genius at drawing characters who are lovable despite their flaws--because, let's face it, most of us are flawed and hope to be loved anyway. Yet with Katie Carr, Hornby has managed to paint a character completely devoid of feeling and totally self-absorbed. She hates her husband, yet won't leave him and continues to belittle him every chance she gets. Does she stay with him for the sake of the children? I wonder, since she seems to dislike her children as well. While funny in parts (parts that are few and far between), How to Be Good left me depressed and wishing for the old Nick Hornby, author of books that are seriously funny, hopeful, and believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing that Hornby flair","review":"Having been a Hornby fan for quite sometime, I snapped this up when it first came out and was eager to tear into it! The story is, conceptually, very intriguing, and starts off in true Hornby fashion, a delightful read. However, as the plot winds on, the story and the concept fall flat. I had to force myself through to the end, and was left very disappointed.Of course, I will most certainly read whatever he puts out next. Besides, everyone deserves a good flop now and then. Kudos for the effort, and high hopes that what is to follow far surpasses this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I have truly enjoyed Nick Hornby's other tales but this one killed me. It would have been a lot better if it were about 100 pages shorter. By the end I lost track of the characters and storyline and just felt like I was being preached to. Too bad - my recommendation is to read About A Boy and High Fidelity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book!","review":"A very talented author strays out of his comfort zone, and the results are lousy.

All his books before this one, however, I'd highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's as lame as the title","review":"Compared to Hornby's other books, which I really liked, it's not very good, or very funny or really ANYTHING. It just sort of blends in with the other books I've read. It doesn't stand out in any way. It has no edge.

David, well he changed a lot and there was a lot I didn't like about what he changed. There is extreme point where he got annoying. Sure it was nice to give some of the stuff they had to people who didn't have any and sure give some money to the homeless, but when he started spending all his time with Goodnews and changing the views of his children is where I got annoyed.Overall this book had sort of a poor ending with much more said about what had happen and what was going to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I bought this book because I was in the mood to read a good book. The reviews made me think this was a \\"hilarious romp\\" and a \\"powerfully sympathetic....\\" yadda yadda. I must say I was extremely dissapointed. The main character is apathetic, self centered and I could not identify with her nor sympathize with her. If you are in the mood to read something that leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth, then go ahead.

Stop reading any paragraph over three sentences. They never get any better.2. Ignore all parentheticals, and skip any paragraph that begins with one. (They never matter.)3. Better yet, save yourself the trouble and skip the whole book. It's 300 pages that begin with an unhappy married couple considering divorce, and end with an unhappy married couple looking out into the cold, dark night. Ugh.I *loved* High Fidelity, so it pains me to say it, but this one just ain't worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good, ... really!","review":"'How To Be Good' by Nick Hornby is a disappointing read. Actually, the book is a mess. The plot, such as it is, involves a dysfunctional London family who brings aboard a vagrant, Mr GoodNews, who has mysterious powers to make things ... good. Yes, total rubbish. Mercifully the author does have a sense of humor. But unfortunately midway through 'How To Be Good' most of the humor fades and it becomes burdensome to read.Bottom line: it reads like the author made it up as he went along. Bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, sharp, acidic, eloquent and existential.","review":"Hornby does a great job of displaying the mental gymnastics that settled, comfortable people can perform while trying to figure out what it means to be happy. Although not in an altogether pleasant way as Hornby is definitely skewering those who have enough time to induldge in bourgeois, self-centered concerns while at the same time recognizing that they are valid, tricky emotions that a lot of people wrestle with. Doesn't paint a very flattering picture but it certainly is a real one-- it dares to be honest and bluntly addresses the fact that many of us behave in ways that don't even make sense to us or what we believe. That most people are hypocrites, even those who devote themselves to trying not to be.As for many of the negative reviews, I think you have to be able to relate to the subject matter to enjoy it-- meaning if you are (or have been) married for a long time then the book makes a lot of sense, even in a somewhat painful way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shallow gimmick.","review":"I'd have a hard time categorizing this as a novel. It's a cartoon gimmick idea, which Hornby has then tried to stretch into novel length. The trouble is, the gimmick is underdeveloped and not half as clever and funny as the author thinks it is. The entire book is, in short, an insult to any reader's intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"The only reason why I am rating this book a two, is because I am a fan of Nick Horny. However I was not a fan of this book, it lacked the humor and the originality as the other novels I read by him. About a Boy was an excellent read, as well as High Infidelity, this book just fell flat on so many areas. The main character was just weak and whiny, she complained about her horrible marriage but yet she stayed with him. I just wished that the story was told in a different character, Katie was too whiny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking forward to more Hornby","review":"Although I've seen several movies based on the author's works, this is my first Nick Hornby book. I must say, this is the best thing I've read in a long time, and I'm looking forward to more. Many reviews tended toward the disappointed. I suspect the themes of middle-aged angst and a twenty-year marriage on the rocks deviate too far from Hornby's other hugely popular novels. Free from any of this baggage, I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable read. The author manages to address difficult issues like hypocrisy, mid-life disappointment, and dying marriages with sharp insight and laugh-out-loud humor. The novel ends on an ambiguous and somewhat down note, and some readers will have a problem with that. But life usually comes down to getting on the best we can without tidy resolutions. Toward the end, the main character, Katie finds escape in the richness of reading and music. Would there be half as many Kindle and iTunes sales if life was tidy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"High In-fidelity\\" or \\"Affairs and Street-people\\"","review":"Next time I pass a panhandler or step around a mound of dirty blanket on the sidewalk I'll think of this book and be glad I'm not one of the characters- becuase I'd have to do something.In \\"How To Be Good\\" we have a luke-warm marriage forming a thin layer of ice when the wife finds a partener to have sex with. As she deals with the gulit and sundry other emotions her husbands morphs into Mr. Roger's, befriends Mr. GoodNews (who cures ills with magic hands), hands money to street-people and starts the neighborhood bringing homeless people home.What are the motivations to be \\"good\\". Told through the eyes of the unfaithful wife (and a Dr. to boot) Hornby explores this part of our phsyche somethimes with a scalpel and others with a chainsaw.If you want \\"High Fidelity\\" again re-read it and don't compain because Hornby didn't re-write it. If you want to be challenged in an entertaining way by a good and clever writer read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic","review":"Katie Carr THINKS of herself as a good person. She's a doctor, a mother of two, and supports all the right liberal causes. Her husband, however, is a bitter, angry man -- until meets a New Age guru who transforms him into a person DOES good things. His transformation calls into question Katie's beliefs about herself and her marriage. This novel sheds light on what it really means to be good and the compromises we all make. As some reviewers have said, it is somewhat depressing, but it is written with great wit, and I feel, great realism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Sad, Sweet, Thought-Provoking & Highly Recommended","review":"Just when you thought he would cash in on his name, Nick Hornby keeps getting better. I've always thought he was funny & able to hold my attention, but this book takes his writing to another level. He's actually provocative & disarmingly funny at the same time. A wonderful read that I highly recommend, especially to anyone over 35 in a long-term relationship. You'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm.....","review":"While I loved Hornby's ABOUT A BOY. I have to say I found HOW TO BE GOOD much too tedious. GOOD is the story of a family in crisis as told in the mother, Kate's point of view. We spend waaaaay to much time in Kate's head as she agonizes over being a good doctor, and whether she should divorce her husband or not. Her husband, David is in the midst of a spiritual awakening and things take off from there.Although I liked the snappy writing style, I thought that parts of the book just drug on endlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to be Bad","review":"I loved High Fidelity but have read Hornby's subsequent books with increasing dismay. I suppose the tip-off should have been that the jacket cover only had reviews of his previous books--maybe there were no good ones fit to be published of this one. The premise on which this book is based is far-fetched and unbelievable--the Angriest Man in Holloway is turned into a saint by a pierced weirdo called GoodNews and then goes on to give away the Sunday lunch to homeless kids. Astonishingly enough his doctor wife (the narrator) stays with him even though he gives away his childrens' toys and forces them to entertain the most horrible children in their class just so they could be \\"good\\". It is a contrived book that is really not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the pulping mills ready...","review":"... because, honestly, this is all that this book deserves. Nick Hornby is one of England's best novelists by far, but it seems that fame has its price. Every other book he has written is engaging, absorbing and masterfully written. This one must have been something he wrote decades ago and left in a drawer somewhere, or he wrote it as a dare to see if anything with his name on would sell. The question of \\"how to be good,\\" a very interesting premise, is totally wasted by using the most hackneyed and implausible stereotypes, the characters are paper-thin cartoons, and the result both irritates and insults the reader. What a shame - a once great author just threw it all away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes....zzz.....","review":"First, she (the book's character) wanted a divorce.But the husband said, \\"No\\". Then she tried again;and he still refused.

So he agreed to the divorce;but she said she didn't want one after all.OH-MY-GOD! I was already at Chapter 4 andthis ding-donging was still going on. By then,I've already made up my mind: I parted ways withthe book and moved on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing...","review":"I loved High Fidelity and especially About A Boy, but this one was just no good. Neither characters nor plot ring true at all, and Hornby never really arrives at any conclusions. Hornby has shown that he can do much, much better, so save your time and money and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to be a boring book...","review":"This was a very dry, yet easy read. I have to admit I finished this book because I was hoping that the author's past performance would shine through. It didn't and I was disappointed. I read High Fidelity and About a Boy both before they were slated to be movies and I absolutely loved them. I've underlined sections of each book that were particularly profound. Each chapter of HTBG was like the one before. The characters weren't very interesting. Their problems seemed contrived. Their involvement was bland. To sum this book up in one word, Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE BOOK","review":"This is one of the worst novels I have ever read.

Like, \\"for an instant, all was wonderful! Then it sucked again.\\" The ending was incomprehensible, and left a foul taste. I understand Katie's retreat into books and music, but as a salve for all that is wrong with her life?It seems like most modern novelists can't write endings. It's as if they have such fun with a story, then realize they have to wrap it up, quick. Franzen's \\"Corrections\\" struck me the same way. Sinclair Lewis never had this trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"By one of world's best authors...","review":"... yet sadly one of the worst novels I have ever read. Unbelievable (in all the wrong ways), shallow and, untimately, pointless. Read anything else by him instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nick Hornsby failure","review":"The very idea of the main characters is so very repulsive to the reader, it never got me to do anything except hate them thoroughly by the end of this short story about fiddling about nothing. Where 'About a boy' had interesting characters from all walks of life, this objectionable work only expresses the characters in a shallow fashion, jerking to a halt to explain unbelieveable stories about less than interesting people. The only juicy parts of the book were cut short, as confrontations came to a head only to be rigidly cut off to be explained later, as if the writer wanted to convey the story in the fashion of \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\", but then never coming back to the original issue. Horrid novel. Can't waste any more of my time with it, but I did warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snorefest.","review":"Boring boring boring. This book was terrible. I'm not sure why anyone would decide that these characters and plot were worth writing about, much less why anyone would want to read about them. On the whole I like Nick Hornby, I'm not sure what happened here. I paid half price for this book and I still feel gypped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Reality?","review":"I didn't much enjoy Nick Hornby's \\"How to be Good.\\" However, unlike some of the other reviewers, my issue with the book isn't that Hornby's characters are unrealistic--I thought his characters were believable and the situations entirely poissible. David's deelings with Goodnews are just a slightly more extreme form of a midlife crisis, but that doesn't mean that it's preposterous. I simply found the book to be very depressing, something I would not condemn a work for except that the reviews plastered on the back cover praise the work for its humor. There are funny moments, particualarly in Kate's attempts to handle her husband and daughter as they gang up on her, but overall the work is a rather upsetting look at a modern marriage. Although I didn't enjoy the book, I think the problem doesn't lie in Hornby's writing, but rather in what I felt was misrepresentation of the book's content by the publishing company."},{"rating":"1","title":"it could have been so much better","review":"THe first 75 pages of this book are really excellent: a marriage in crisis is portrayed with humor and pain, the characterisations of the family bitingly realistic.THen, like way too many contemporary novels, it suddens adds this ridiculously lite surrealistic tone, and completely loses credibility. Badness get \\"[taken] out\\" of people and personalities miraculously change, etc. The novel then turns onto a strange and rather too general question of how to become a \\"good\\" person, which bored me, but that is a matter of taste. From a very good start, it lost for me.This is a talented writer. Perhaps my wish for more realism, which he can clearly accomplish with wit and style, is outdated. But I did not like the way the book degenerated into a kind of sit com.Alas, I am so often disappointed by the new \\"happening\\" novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I don't think Hornby can write from a female point of view. The whole time I was reading the book I felt like the protagonist was man saying the things what he would say, if he were a woman. I never felt like I truly understood what Katie was about or why she did the things she did. She seemed to bounce through life, simply reacting to those around her.Plus this book was incredibly depressing statement on marriage - do not read it if you are thinking about getting married or are recently married. I loved High Fidelity and About a Boy but did not enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down from a Hornby fan","review":"Among my favorite reads are \\"About a Boy\\" and \\"High Fidelty.\\" And, truthfully, Hornby writes just as well in \\"How to Be Good.\\" His characterizations provoke reaction, the depth of Katie's thoughts are very real, and the wry, sarcastic humor is on target.Even so, I did not enjoy this book. Finishing it was just a hair less than a struggle. I don't necessarily read to feel good all the time (though that is among the reasons), but this book _really_ doesn't make the reader feel good. It's downright depressing and frustrating. I wanted to shake Katie so many times; admonish her for not standing up for herself more.Then again, I also wanted to shake her for relying so heavily on her profession to make her \\"good.\\" It is highly annoying. But I suspect that is part of Hornby's point, so I won't go any further down that road.A talented writer, yes. An interesting, though somewhat dubious storyline. Worth your time? Perhaps. Unfortunately only you can answer that question."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I love High Fidelity and have read it 3 times; Fever Pitch, even though it's about soccer, is one of the best sports books written, in terms of trying to explain a personal and ultimately trivial mania to the world. I think Hornby began to lose it a little with About a Boy; I found that book to be without any edge and just a little bit too precious. But with How to Be Good, Hornby loses much credulity. Without giving away any of the plot I'll just say that the plot is not believable. Hornby does a great job with his female narrator and when he/she is explaining the rotten state of her marriage, nothing rings false. But when the \\"motor\\" of the book begins, the bottom falls out; after this, the book is a tough read -- why go on reading what will happen when none of what is happening seems remotely true? It's a shame; this could have been a much, much better book had not Hornby stretched us to the limits of reason. However, he is discerning, clever and unpretentious enough to rebound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel...","review":"This book could have been a refreshing move away from the pedestal that Hornby was beginning to find himself upon - the voice of men who don't really want to grow up. He was brave to tackle a new subject area. But he didn't pull it off.To be short, he can't write a believable female protagonist.Not only that, he surrounds her with characters, sets up an interesting idea, and then does nothing with it - for page after interminable page. A failing marriage is great material... but Hornby fails to deliver a plot, and after endless meanders the book waddles over a limp finish line. You'll get more entertainment reading all of these reviews.. and it costs less, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I've read High Fidelity and About A Boy, and they are both two of my favorite books. Therefore, I was surprised by the serious tone of How To Be Good. Yet, after I got over the initial shock, I found that I was enjoying this novel. It's not as funny as High Fidelity or About A Boy (I can't imagine a movie based on this novel), but as a study in marriage, and in what it truly means to be charitable, it's highly entertaining. Actually, I can see this book as Rob and Laura (the main characters of High Fidelity), 10 years into their marriage, if Rob were to spontaneously decide to stop being cynical take up spirituality.My one gripe with the book is that Hornby's casual, slightly detached tone is better suited towards a male rather than a female. I didn't quite believe that the person telling this story was a woman. But that's my only issue; otherwise, the book was rather good."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Thing To Remember","review":"Every decent book leaves the reader with at least one idea, memorable character or imprinted feeling. What I found unforgetable in this particular volume, was Hornby's description of how love disintergrates in a marriage. Not a dramatic betrayal, a sudden illumination, but a slow progress of decay that leaves people numb and enervated. Hornby writes about the \\"language of hurt\\" that couples develop. How we use our intimate knowledge of one another to jab and prode and scorn.There is much more in the book, such as, the character of Goodnews who provokes both hope and skepticism. There is humor and wit and wonderful insights. But for those who have know the truth of how loves dies, this book is a bitter sweet chronicle of the vagaries of the human heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Hornby Scores Again","review":"It seems as though Nick Hornby has fallen into some sort of progression, from relationship hopping in High Fidelity to the establishment of a strong emotional relationship in About A Boy to a failing relationship in How To Be Good. Each successive novel has become a bit more serious in tone yet no less entertaining.How To Be Good follows Katie Carr through the emotional ups and downs of a failing marriage and her quest to be \\"good\\". Yet she has a bit of competition when it comes to be good because of her husband's sudden shift in attitude. What ensues is a very well rendered and quite humorous look at relationships, why we stay in them and how fragile they are.How To Be Good is definitely not as funny as Hornby's past novels but it seems more heartfelt than his previous efforts. The trade-off is a positive one. So read How To Be Good and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"fantastic topic but a bit disappointing","review":"Nick Hornby's previous novels were very entertaining. When I read the blurb of this one, I couldn't wait to read it. The theme is very exciting and thought-provoking. However, I found it a bit slow in parts, and jerky in others. I particularly found the character of GoodNews believable and likeable, but he, too, petered out towards the end. However, I must admit that there were 3 places where I really did laugh out loud. Not great literature but a pleasant read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it wasn't just me!","review":"This is my first Nick Hornby read and I was very tempted to make it my last. I had a really hard time getting through it. I usually read a book straight through in 2-3 days and can't wait to read them at any free moment. But, I had to force myself to get through this one. The book didn't flow very well and seemed to skip all over the place.Seeing negative reviews from people who have read his other books has helped me decide to give Hornby another chance.I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Hornby fans","review":"If you like Hornby's style, and I love it, you will not be let down by \\"How to Be Good\\".Hornby is still a relatively young author, and certainly has room to improve, but I've read all of his work and enjoyed this one as much as High Fidelity, and only slightly less than About a Boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nagging message spoils story","review":"Although I like Hornby's work in general, I was dissapointed by this book. Okay, sometimes it's funny, sometimes I could even identify with the characters or the situation, but all the time I was irritated by a nagging mosquito who was trying to deliver a message. The message is, I guess, that it is not easy to have a clear conscience and that we are all only human and should try to make peace in our own home and family first. Not an earthshaking revelation for me. And as this message is already Very Clear after the first two chapters, I kept hoping for an interesting new turn of thought, but alas, none came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Boring... Annoying Characters","review":"A friend of mine recomended this book for my book club to read. 6 of us read the book and all 6 of us complained the whole time we were reading it and hated the whole thing. The common consensus of our group was that it was impossible to make a connection and to care what happened characters because they were so annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring!","review":"This has to be one of the slowest books I have ever read! The topic sounded interesting, which is why I bought the book, but the story never went anywhere! I continued reading it despite my urge to put it away forever only because I expected it to pick up the pace at some point. Seems like a book by a first time author, not one that has rave reviews on other books. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Definitely buy and read \\"About a Boy\\" and \\"High Fidelity\\", but give this one a pass. It's awkward, boring and tough to get through. The characters are ridiculous caricatures, whereas the characters in Nick Hornby's earlier novels were wonderfully real. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Hornby's previous books; however, this book was a huge disappointment. As one reviewer mentioned, he has changed his tone in this novel, that wasn't the problem. The book was simply uninteresting, the main character was unappealing, the plot/dilemma is revealed within a few chapters and from there the book doesn't move, the same problem is reviewed over and over, the same character traits are displayed repeatedly with no forward plot movement. I am an avid reader and cannot remember the last time I did not finish a story regardless of how bad it was. This book did me in, I ended up skimming through the last two chapters and wishing I hadn't bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his usual high standard","review":"When I bought this book I fully expected to enjoy it. I've loved every other Nick Hornby book I've read. But this was a complete let down. The story starts badly and goes nowhere.Completely without merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Read","review":"The book is very pessimistic, and the characters are very unlikable. I kept hoping for an upbeat twist to the story - and it never came. You really want to grab the characters off of the page and shake them and scream \\"DO YOU HAVE NO PRIDE, SHAME, OR BALLS?!?!?!?!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best","review":"Somewhere in Nick Hornby's wandering meditation of just what constitutes good and bad I got lost along the way. I loved both \\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"About A Boy\\", but found alot of this book hard to even like let alone love.His narrator Katie Carr is a married doctor who's having an affair. Her husband David is a bitter syndicated columnist who undergoes a spiritual transformation which has resounding effects on Katie and her two children. The book never bored me, more just left me baffled. The characters were not particulary likable and the ending seemed too pat and neat.I came through the book not rooting for Katie or believing the novels outcome, just with a vague notion that I should be doing more for the homeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"It inspired me to do something for charity...","review":"... by giving the book away to the nearest charity store. I received this novel as a Christmas present. It was a short read, at least, but a cringingly bad one. At least it is only a few hours from New Year now, so I can say that the extreme displeasure of wading through this pointless novel will soon be relegated to 'last year'. This book was so badly done I wouldn't know where to begin describing it. Let's just summarize by saying novels usually benefit from having a plot, and slightly credible characters (not women protagonists speaking like 40-year-old men... or little boys speaking like 40-year-old men either). I hope someone at the thrift store can find a use for it. Toilet paper, perhaps?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A marginally better read than the phone book.","review":"An intriguing central idea, explored by a very talented author (his previous, books, anyway). Here, he does nothing with the idea except bat it around like a bored cat with a worn-out cat toy, before abandoning the novel in a limp conclusion. The characters are all bad stereotypes which only cheapen the points he occasionally tries to make in the murky swill of aimless text. It is one of the most utterly pointless books I have ever read, and a complete waste of time. His other books, however, are brilliant, so read one of those instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give a no-star rating!","review":"Extremely depressing. I kept thinking it HAD to get better but, sadly, no. By the end, I was hoping something cataclysmic would happen to these extraordinarily unlikeable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to be good","review":"I have to agree with some of the posts that I see below. This was a very odd book. I purchased it thinking it was going to be one of those British-like \\"Bridget Jones\\" books. How far from the truth.The characters were wimpy and boring. Good News should have been kicked out of the house along with the husband and the coniving daughter.This was a waste of a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not only depressing but chauvinistic as well...","review":"Extremely disappointing read about a woman in a hateful marriage to a hateful man who at times is pretty hateful herself. None of the characters are likeable, and the humor used to try to make it all palatable falls flat. Suddenly he wakes up and turns into a model of goodness while she struggles with the decision to stay or go, a decision which is made in such a way that makes me hate her even more, not because of WHAT she decides, but HOW and WHY. She is WEAK. I think Hornby actually hates her too. The underlying message of how to be good (concerning her character, not his- of course it'd be great if we could all be overflowing with good will toward men) is certainly not one I'd let any other woman OR man bother to read if given the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Pop Drivel","review":"I read and enjoyed \\"High Fidelity,\\" but this book is junk. I feel as though Hornby is pulling one over on us, dashing this book off in the time he could scrounge between New Yorker articles and conference calls with his publisher. I would be more forgiving of the flat plot, dull characters, and failed thematics if I felt that he was giving it his all. We know from High Fidelity that he is capable of storytelling that uses pop culture references and flip Britishisms as texture but ultimately hits on something more meaningful. In \\"How to Be Good,\\" he asks an interesting question (the title) but does nothing with it.If you don't care about any of this and would be satisfied reading Nick Hornby's grocery list in a pretty binding, click \\"Add to Cart.\\" If you're interested in exploring a character's ethical crisis, skip this book. Try Dostoyevsky."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new outlook","review":"Hornby does it again. It's quite different from the single male character perspective that is given in his previous novels. Anyway, it's definitely worth the pickup. Like his other books, it is an extremely quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite entertaining","review":"I've been dragging myself to finish this book in the past 3 weeks and finally I'm close to the end but not feeling exciting at all. There are funny and hilarious moments, with outstanding observation and descriptions of characters and scenes but overall not quite witty and the flow is not smooth. Difficult to grasp the main points that it intends to deliver. Better watch Hugh Grant in \\" About a boy\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good parts but weak overall","review":"I really enjoyed High Fidelity and About A Boy so I thought this would be just as good. Not so. Only read it if you are a completist, anybody else should pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter waste of time","review":"Perhaps I am missing something that others seem to have found appealing, but this book was possibly the worst novel I have ever read. The characters are almost without exception loathsome, and at no point did I ever feel like the protagonist was actually a woman-- it read like a man's idea of how a woman thinks and feels. When I finished the book (and how agonizing that was), I was not relieved-- I was angry at the writer, and angry at myself for even picking this one up.Do not waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like pulling teeth.","review":"I am going to have to stop listening to recommendations from friends.I purchased this book ONLY because my good friend raved about it.Well I am also raving about it. Raving mad.What a load of ...... I tried to get into this story, and just could not get over the hump that someone would want to live with someone like that.That goes for both characters.I kept plowing away at it, cause MY FRIEND SAID SHE LOVED IT...............and you know what, the premise is so non believable, that I finally got to the 8th chapter and gave up.I was surprised that I gave it that much.First time I've read anything by this author, and I do not think I will read him again.There are just too many good books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodie Goodie","review":"I just recently read HOW TO BE GOOD, my first venture into the world of Nick Hornby. It's one of those novels that compels you to turn the pages by making you wonder just how annoying its characters can possibly get.Very well written, though.It's a kind of Woody Allen-style high concept premise: the bitter, flippant husband in the piece goes for a back rub from a new age mystic, and magically gets all of the cynicism rubbed out of him--all of the humor, too. Overnight, he becomes so \\"good\\" you can't stand him.Nice use of irony. I like the line in it when the liberal, socially conscious wife is shocked to find herself saying \\"F--- the homeless!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate overstretch by an otherwise competent author.","review":"What a shame. Nick Hornby does so well when writing about subjects he knows about. Here, however, he tries to break the formula and write about something different - and it all goes horribly, horribly wrong. The story... well, just isn't a story, simply one idea stretched beyond breaking point. The characters are cartoon-like, and in the end it just doesn't work. Read anything else by this brilliant author, but avoid this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Great","review":"Didn't like this one much, for many of the same reasons that others have said below. In the first few chapters I really didn't feel Katie thought and acted as a woman, which really irritated me, but this did get better. It was well written, as in readable, and thought provoking in places, but far too much went unexplained, and there was no satisfactory resolution. Too much just seemed to be allowed to happen without context or justification. I was glad to finish it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been better","review":"i'll keep this review short and to the point (unlike the book itself)... 'how to be good' drags on and on with characters you could not care less about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contender for the title of Worst Novel Ever.","review":"Amazon.com, I understand, have a selection of well over 2 million books. This novel should be at the bottom of the selection list compared to any other book they sell - it's that bad.Hornby, perversely, is one of England's finest writers - usually. But this book is badly written - annoying characters, a story that goes nowhere, unbelievable premise and limp conclusion. It's not worth the paper it was written on. I highly recommend ANY, in fact ALL of his other novels. This one is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so relieved to see the other bad reviews!","review":"Usually a Nick Hornby fan, but not this time. Besides being meandering, plotless, bizarre and implausible the characters are all quite dislikable, most notably the narrator. While the other characters seem to have a character arc, no matter how unrealistic it may be, the narrator remains hateful, unhappy and stuck, with little kindness for anyone nor any self reflection. That she has an epiphany about the pleasure of reading is just further torture to this reader since this book seems to bring little joy to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to be Mediocre","review":"This is the first Nick Hornby's book I've read, and even though I'm giving this book 2 stars...it won't be my last Nick Hornby book. I say this because ultimately Hornby's a funny writer (with better material out there) and \\"How To Be Good\\" starts off like a charm; a middle age man confronts his selfish consuming vain ways, with the help of bum/guru, and tries to make the world a better place, even if that means making his family miserable. In curious form, the narrator is the man's wife.Over the course of the book, what starts off like a sure fire concept seems to get muddled and confused. Slowed down by Hornby's love of pop culture references, the book wades though social experiments like Adopt a Bum that arn't funny, end up being too predictable, and go nowhere. In the end, the family grows to appreciate each other but it was too little too late for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with boys, Nick","review":"I have read and loved all of Nick Hornby's books for their honest and hilarious look into the minds of committment-phobic men. This book was a huge disappointment, maybe because loutishness is not quite so funny on a woman. I have read reviews calling this book \\"hilarious,\\" but didn't find it funny at all. Page after page of this woman complaining about her husband and children was just depressing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to be good is Good","review":"I have to read more of Hornby's works now that I finished How to be Good. It is very funny and enlighting - really grasps relationships, life, pop culture, and etc. I would highly recommend this book. Fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm shocked and amazed this has such a low star rating","review":"I thought this book was fabulous - it was the first Nick Hornby book that I read and I like it just as much, if not more, than his other books. It is cleverly written, hillarious in subtle satire, and interesting. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbingly pleasant...","review":"Nick Hornby can write. I've read everything he's published, and I was not disappointed with How to Be Good. While it's an obvious departure from the themes pursued in his other fiction, the humor and warmth are still there. We also encounter another example of Hornby's use of the flawed hero. Do you love Katie or do you just want her to shut up? Whatever your decision, How to Be Good is a fun read, though not as good as About a Boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hornby Writing with a Woman's Voice","review":"Hornby challenges basic liberal notions in \\"How to be Good,\\" and does so while writing in the voice of a woman. What does it mean to be a truly good person? How do you balance out how your actions will affect another person? While you are doing \\"good\\" for someone else, you may be hurting another.I'm a big fan of Hornby and I liked this departure from his norm. He must have listened to his female friends in developing the voice and psyche of Katie. At one point in the novel, she realized the chaos that her life has become, and as her former lover and husband discuss her future over her own kitchen table, she wishes that they would just make a decision for her, and if they did, she would live with it, and live with it forever. She was tired of fighting, tired of trying to be \\"good\\" and was ready to relinquish control if it were an option. I don't know that most men could understand that sometimes that's just how a woman may feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree with the reviewer who states that the book raises a lot of issues surrounding the choices one must make in a middle-class existence but shrugs them off before really resolving them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretty crummy book ....","review":"I rated this book at one star only because amazon.com doesn't allow a reviewer the option of zero stars. The author of this book is a biochemist -- not a trained historian -- and her amateurism certainly shows, particulary in the early chapters where a competent historian would be careful in the assessment of the historicity of sources. So Alic retails a tradition -- presented as though it has a factual basis -- about Moses and his wife operating a medical school in Egypt. Never mind that there is virtually no evidence independent of the Bible that Moses even existed. Perhaps needless to say that the Bible contains no mention of said medical school. Shortly thereafter readers are told that Cleopatra studied human anatomy and physiology by dissecting condemned prisoners alive. The source for this horror story turns out to be a rabbinical tradition -- scarcely an unbiased source when dealing with Greeks or Greek culture. The rest of the book is at best naive hagiography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and engaging","review":"I loved this book. Ysabella and Merlyn captured me and held me in their world.

It was a very methodical, scholarly, and somewhat \\"dry\\" read, but absolutely fascinating. I had always had many questions about the assassination and the many supposed cover-ups/conspiracies.This book and theory I believe answers almost every point worthy of debate in a very plain spoken, matter-of-fact manner that leaves you stunned. This is the way most governments, officials, and beauracrats react. They don't lie- they don't reveal. They don't cover-up they- just aren't forthcoming. I've always thought that the truth would not be made known in my lifetime. Wouldn't it be nice if before they pass away some of the principals would come forward and heal the 30+ year old wounds in our country's psyche."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth will set you free","review":"Different from all other \\"conspiracy\\" theory books, this is the account of Mr. Donahoe's attempt to explain the events from a purely ballistic point of view. By approaching the evidence without a predetermined idea, he has unearthed a long held secret that is so simple as to be startling. He convincingly explains the \\"magic bullet\\", the various fragments, and the relationship to the famed Zapruder film of the various shots that rang out in Dallas. And finally there is a beliavable reason for the government to \\"alter\\" the full truth. A somewhat dry, but engaging read with lots of supporting drawings, photos, and testimony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a theory, but an interesting one","review":"What if one of the Secret Service agents in JFK's backup car stumbled and inadvertently shot the President? An unlikely thesis, but one which is quite convincingly tabled here as author Menninger relates the long and painstaking research of an American ballistics expert. Fine as a magazine article, but the concept is thin and the book is mostly padding. Menninger too readily accepts Lee Harver Oswald's involvement in the assassination and his account of the angles of fire is flawed. An interesting contribution to the assassination archives and well illustrated, but not to be taken too seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent seller","review":"Great book delivered very, very quickly.

It's clear that EA Games just adapted a soccer-game engine, trying to minimize the three-dimensional nature of Quidditch. That, combined with the utterly predictable AI system, makes it possible for an adult player to WIPE THE FLOOR with any and all comers.It's aggravating, really: It's not likely that there will be another version of this game made for adults with, say, an AI system worthy of the name. And EA games could have so easily created a workable 3D flying system--just use the usual WASD/three-button mouse controls from any first-person shooting game or else the independent-gravity flight engine from \\"Freelancer\\" or similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been better!","review":"I was so excited when this game came out because I thought it will be very fun just like how quiddich should be but after I tired it at home it was just okay to me.

I like the graphics and stuff in this game but if I were you, I would rather buy the Harry Potter 1, 2 or 3 computer game instead of this one.

I have only unlocked the 2001 Broom (I don't know if it has anything to do if the computer plays better??)It is really realistic! - Loads of the people you know from the books are in it and it's great fun, with the commentaries, blugders, special moves and more!...Although, a match will take some time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS GAME","review":"I had been looking forward to this game for a long time. I just bought it and cannot find words to express my disapointment. This game had a ton of potential, but it was not realized. The thing about quidditch that was to have set it apart from soccer, basketball, and hockey is that it is 3D. Unfortunately this game is not 3D. You only control backwards/forwards and left/right motion. You do not control the vertical aspect of flight. In other words, you are for all intents and purposes on the ground. If you want to play quidditch then do yourself a favor and just play the quidditch portions of the previous harry potter games. At least then there will be something to do besides playing a watered down versions of hockey.

Since so-called Christian parents are on the whole too ignorant of the Bible to be able to teach it to their children, they give the job, like so many other child-care responsibilities, to the TV. The inane and unfunny vegetation featured both here and on the awful television show are a metaphor for the modern so-called Christians: little smarter than vegetables, bumbling, and fettered to slavish dogma. \\"Jonah\\" presents nothing more than sanitized, numb, platitudinous drivel with a bit of mistranslated \\"scripture\\" thrown in here and there to satisfy the consciences of emotionally dead suburban moral mutants.

Was not Jesus on death row?Also, for a show that would sound to parents like it would promote vegetables & healthy eating, they sure do glamourize cheese puffs!Furthermore, for a movie that is historically inaccurate; cheese puffs, a pirate ship, with motor etc., they decide to include text about \\"your wives & sheep\\".

Jonah drags. The time delay from gag to gag and scene to scene is tedious. The film seems to just wander. The scenes dont flow all that well, just meandering through the story instead of a good production. And then by the end you feel like it is the same game 1000 times over.

Navigating the McCulloch site to discover that parts were missing was not particularly convenient.I don't know how long it will take to get the missing parts, but now I am faced with borrowing or renting another one while waiting. Arriving DOA counts as an automatic fail by my reckoning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for patio","review":"I bought this under the impression that I could use it to clean my patio. It proved useless. It was barely strong enough to remove everything. I called up McCulloch and a woman with a near-indecipherable accent told me that this unit isn't meant for patios and that I would need a 3000 PSI unit. I appreciate her honesty, but my uncle has a 1500 PSI pressure washer that works just fine for patios. 1600 PSI should be more than enough. This unit is just plain useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good value until it breaks......and it will","review":"The unit worked fine for about three hours then the nozzle would no longer adjust to full power stream. Could not replace just the tip - had to buy the entire wand so I ended up spending a few hours to build tools necessary to free up the nozzle adjust mechanism. Second season the \\"plastic\\" hose coupler broke. This is a poorly designed part and you have to be extremely careful not to stress it - good luck. This part is $10 + shipping from McCulloch except they no longer make it and nobody has it in stock. I went to [...] and ask where I might find a similar part. It turns out that this is a fee service and for $37 a technician would tell me how to solve my problem.Forget McCulloch, there are better options when you need power tools"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine for light duty cleaning","review":"I picked this unit up to take some mold and mildew off the wood clapboarding on our house. I thought it did a great job of cleaning while not damaging the underlying paint except for one or two places where it was already peeled. Our water supply is through a well so even with that the pressure wash more than adequate. It likewise took a layer of mold and mildew off our metal patio furniture and stone work. I have no experience with higher pressure washers but for me this unit was more than adequate for what I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCulloh FH160G","review":"I bought this three weeks ago and it got here on time.

Terrible product. Dont buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedium par excellence!","review":"The study of history has it's fascination for the modern reader to understand what happened in these far flung places of the past. Certainly history has it's dull moments, but if you enjoy reading about political intrigue or war, history can be a better read than any fiction. One would think the rise and fall of the Ottoman Empire would give an author/historian the ability to produce a masterful work giving the material content, sadly, that is lacking. Finkel can't even make war and intrigue interesting. This is one of the most tedious history books I have ever read. Sure, it is loaded with facts, but with an incoherent writing style that jumps from place to place and concerns the reader with every non-important minute detail, it makes for a difficult read. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource for Ottoman history-it is large for a reason","review":"This book is large for a reason- it is a comprehensive work on the History of the Ottoman Empire, not a small pocket-sized guide for just anyone. That is what is lost here, for this book delivers on what it promises. If you wish to know much more about the details of the Ottoman Empire and love history, then I highly recommend this work. It starts from the first conquests of the Ottomans onwards up until the beginnings of the Turkish Republic under Ataturk, which is 600 years of fascinating events. It provides details into the minds of each ruler and his governmental structure, how relations were improved or destroyed, and provides many references from primary sources which add to the narrative. Don't buy this book if you want a quick lesson- buy it if you are truly serious in learning more of the history of the Ottoman Empire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Osman's Dream: History of the Ottoman Empire by Caroline Finkel","review":"I began this book with great anticipation but was very disappointed. It was difficult to follow the author's stream of thought and the historical lines, i.e., date, years, decades were repetitive to the point of confusion. The characters moved in and out of the pages, seemingly without rhyme or reason. There was obviously an effort by the author to remove or dilute much of the historical evidence of violence associated with the Ottoman Empire. I completed this book only because I refuse not to finish a book once started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow political history","review":"I was quite disappointed by this book - its like a 19th century history with a shallow retelling of the names of Sultans, dates and major battles. I would have expected a greater analysis of the socio-cultural milieu in which the Ottoman empire arose and the institutions it spawned. I kept reading on hoping that this would follow but its really just a chronological listing of sultans, the major battles fought - if you want a political history of the empire, this may work for you. But when, why not just read the Wikipedia entry if you have no interest in the socio-political institutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a great book, I loved reading it. Caroline Finkel's writing style is absolutely flawless and mesmerizing. I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Denies Armenian Genocide","review":"While this book provides a rather quick paced narrative for a large span of history, its divergence from established historical fact regarding the Armenian Genocide is so blatant as to border on propaganda. While the author spends a short amount of time on the issue, admitting that \\"some\\" atrocity took place, her views completely run counter to a vast amount if well established research. Given the significance of mass murder and her attempts to belittle the issue, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!","review":"I normally love thick history books but the author is a very boring writer. Nothing like David S. Landes, Jacques Barzun and Henry Commager Steel! Also, she has a linear narrative, starting with the supposed founding of the Ottoman Empire and ending with its fall. Boring!!The book would benefit from a discussion of the economic and religious reasons for the failure to modernize of an empire that threatened Vienna as late as 1683. Otherwise, the book is informative but again, boring!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it 0 stars?","review":"What the hell was this? I think this has got to be one of the most boring books on the planet.

The guitars and synths are always spot on. This album has a more refined sound. The opening song Meaner is a great introductory, heavy, riff laden explosion of sound. The song \\"Insects\\" is more on the hip hop pop side but is done well. My favorites on here are \\"Meaner\\", \\"Not The One\\", \\"Peace is your dream\\", \\"Gravity\\", \\"Do it for money\\", \\"California\\", and \\"Just say no to Love\\". I enjoy Siebold's voice and being able to hear it. I'm sooooo tired of industrial bands that mask their voice. Skinny Puppy did it first so we can give them credit but everybody, their dog, and their family began to do it from after that point. It's really played out now. I can't wait until the new CD \\"A New Ghost\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Seibold and his music, but Ditch has to go","review":"This is quite possibly the worst album Seibold has ever put out. Before releasing this album he did go on tour with Pigface. Maybe that tour took up all his time and he had nothing left for his new album, but in any case, Ditch down right stinks. I am probably one of the biggest Hate Dept fans and lovers of industrial music, so in writing this review do not think that I just don't understand industrial and can't appreciate it. If you do want to buy a Hate Dept album, I strongly recommend you get \\"Omnipresent.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the Future cartoon","review":"I'd like to start by saying that I gave a one-star rating because I was disappointed that the seller wasn't able to send this tape out to me, but I'm sure that it was not their fault.

The costumes and settings are totally lacking in imagination and carry no semantic weight. The attempts to create a visual equivalent for the musical leitmotifs of the operas are too literal and very much in the spirit of a mechanical translation from opera to comic book.

I bought the panasonic 256M SD card here also at amazon and it worked wonderfully.2) No protective case at all, so the LCD is exposed all the time which maybe dangerous.

What a bunch of b.s.! The \\"impact damage\\" was a tiny scuff mark that did not result from a drop (since it was never dropped). We babied this camera and took extreme care to be careful with it and it just decided to quit on us.

That being said, this Erasure offering is way off base. They've exchanged the charm and happiness apparent on \\"Cowboy\\" and \\"I say, I say, I say\\", and turned out a dreary, depressingly melodic, bore, and that's not what makes Erasure great.

OH MY GOSH!\\" This book is not for people over 10 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"more like a journal than anything else","review":"This book is about two friends, Tara*Starr and Elizabeth after Tara moves away. They first talk to each other through letters, but then both of them get computers, so they can send each other e-mail. They talk about everything that is going on in their lives, and every possible creative idea and bit of bad news. They realize that their friendship might be ruined because of their changing lives. Their friendship goes through the ultimate test when something terrible happens to Elizabeth's father. They end up still being friends, but they know that their friendship will never be the same again. This book is great for people that like to read journals, because it is like two journals in one. If you don't like journals, you will find this book boring. I found it very interesting, but at some times, it was just plain boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I Thought of \\"Up A Road Slowly\\"","review":"I think it was a great book. It showed how the main character Julie matured through her years of growing up. Also, the book didn't focus on a perfect life. It included some bad and good in her life. People can relate to some of the characters in the book. Then if they see themselves in a bad way theyn can change. I being of the age of 13 read this book for school and I would recamend it to anyone who is reading this no matter what age. The way this book was written you won't know it was written in the 30's. Even though it is out of print I would think it be worth while to track down a copy and purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one you will want to buy and keep","review":"I read this book back in 1968 when I was in the seventh grade.(and many times since) I fell in love with the way the book was written and what the story told.All of us have a little bit of Julie in us. I bought one copy and then found another in the library sale last year for a quater! Now I have two, one to loan out and the other in case I never get the one back. If you read this book and you do not agree that it is a great book then something must surly be missing from you life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up A Road Slowly","review":"This is the best book I have ever read, not necessarily because its a real page-turner, but because the message it gives to anyone who reads it goes deeper. The story is about Julie Trelling growing up in her Aunt Cordelia's house in the country after her mother dies. Julie is seven at the time and the story ends when she is 17. Through the story Julie learns to deal with loss, embarassment, friendship, and most importantly love.Many characters such as Uncle Haskell, Brett Kingsman, Laura and Danny Trevort help Julie to feel these things. This book also has a very witty dialogue and the characters are not perfect, thus being real. You can't help but feel moved and better after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey From Girl to Woman","review":"I loved the book Up A Road Slowly by Irene Hunt. I thought the story of Julie Trelling growing from a spoiled child to a gentle and kind young woman was very beautiful and touching. When Julie is first sent to live with her Aunt Cordellia after her mother died, she is a tomboy with a mind of her own. As the book progresses, Julie begins to grow up and view her world in a different way.This book is great because it shows growing into womanhood the way it is: hard. Irene Hunt didn't make Julie seem like she always was perfect like some books make their main charactors. I would recomend this book to anybody over the age of ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book suxs","review":"this book was really bad i didnt like it at all. we read it for school and it was boring"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"My 10 year old daughter and I read this book together and we both enjoyed it very much. It made bedtime very easy because we both looked forward to finding out about what happened in the character's lives. Even though the book was written and had a bit of an old fashioned sensability, my daughter was still engaged and she was exposed to a lot of new vocabulary. The book made us laugh and cry and it sparked a lot of conversations. Very enjoyable and memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"Ok I honestly don't think that the book was that good really it was not the best book I've read but it was ok"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Novel To Remember","review":"If I must decide, I think this book, Up A Road Slowly, deserves four stars. Each new chapter seemed as if it was opening a new chapter of my life. This novel was about a young girl names Julie; this story tells about her heartache and happiness.

It is easy to relate to the main character, Julie Trelling, as she experiences life from the tender age of five, through her completion of high school. Julie's life is not exciting, and is quite ordinary. However, that is the beauty of the book. Irene Hunt took things that happen in everyone's life, gave them a special charm, and added a little wisdom as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"My reactions to UP A ROAD SLOWLY","review":"I think Up a Road Slowly by Irene Hunt was a realistic aproach to explain the troubles and good times a childhood could be and often is. I enjoyed the book very much and felt like I was related to Julie or was her friend. Thats how well written the book was it made you feel like you were there experiencing those things with her. The variety of characters and personalities of each was even better. I think it was fun to read and although I as a person am not always fond of taking time to read, when i did read this it was very much worth it!

The sparse and laid back arrangements might just pass muster but I fear what I cannot get to enjoy despite numerous listening is Tim Hockenberry's voice, which is what I can only best describe as someone sounding like Joe Cocker with a sore throat.I fear the whole CD ended up grating with me every time I played it and so I have now donated my copy to my local charity shop for resale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique yet familiar","review":"Highly recommended. Some unique arrangements of these familiar Dylan tunes. Tim Hockenberry's voice fits the material well. Two originals join the 10 Dylan songs, and Bonnie Raitt plays slide on Mr. Tambourine Man.

Great thermometer and I'd highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking product","review":"I bought this for my 2002 Chevy Tahoe LS. The grill was not as easy to install as you might think. The retaining clips that are to hold the grill in place are not the best. I would have choosen a different way of holding the grill in place. I ended up using only some of the clips and used wire for other parts of the grill becuase the clips either were not long enough to snap on to the grill or didn't seem to hold well. I also had to bend the grill a little to get it to fit properly. However, over all it looks great and is secure only after using the wire to hold it in. You can't even see the wire so no worrying about seeing the wire if that is what you are worried about. Cleans up really nice. The bugs seem to come off with little effort. Instructions are not that great either. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a true blessing","review":"This album is a true blessing.

The clinical questions are very useful for exam revision, with concise answers and diagrams.

No valid advice given by the instructor so adjustments could be made for fitness level. All in all, a very fustrating, boring endeavor.

However, I would recommend reviewing the society and culture of Egypt before or while reading this book because it contains many references to the region and society of the country that may be unfamiliar to people from other countries or non-muslim readers. Overall, very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd and enchanting","review":"An odd little book - kind of a Zen Goth collection - that ultimately makes me want to live better and more thoughtfully. Along with the poems are reflections and explanations and some history of the author. This isn't a book that I would read straight through but something to have nearby for frequent foraging. There are pages of great stuff here that will provoke new thoughts and insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I think that this book had the potential to be better than it is. Many of the poems are amazing. Of particular interest were the poems of the Zen masters. Their death poems show a lifelong dedication to searching for enlightenment and the final fruition of a philosophy where the difference between life and death is meaningless. The summaries of the lives and deaths of many of the poets provide an interesting illustration of the culture of the Japanese poets. However, I was less impressed by the work of the so called \\"haiku poets\\" many of these men were not masters of their craft and it is obvious in their death poems. Also the introduction is full of interesting information, but is quite dry considering the unusual subject matter of the book would seem to offer endless possibilities for an interesting commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful little book!","review":"I was first introduced to the hardcover edition of this book back in the mid 90s. This is a great way to gain many insights into Haiku and its cultural milieu. The author also gives alternate translations and explains much of the language of the Haikus. Also after a long day at the office it's a great stress reliever to get a window into the lives of some great poets of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you buy, buy new.","review":"This is a great anthology of poems. I consider it a must have for anyone who has even a passing interest in eastern poetry. My one complaint is that the copy I received was listed as Very Good and was barely passable as Poor. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intimate look at Japanese feelings on Death.","review":"This book is a collection of Death poems from throughout Japanese history. There is a long standing tradition of writing a farewell to the world shortly before your demise. Most of these are written by Zen monks or Haiku poets, and most convey a peaceful, resigned, almost restful view of death. If you're feeling mortal, worried that you might not live forever, it may give you a little peace of mind. This view of Death is very different from the traditional Western one, and provides an interesting window on Japanese culture. The only thing I didn't like about the book was its tendency to lapse into pedantic historical explanations between poems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally live!","review":"I was in Row 6 for the Knack's first Philly show and it was like being at a Beatles concert. Girls were screaming and the band was tight. Originals and covers (including a Beatles tune) made the show one of the best I ever saw. I have the Laser Disc of that tour, so that has kept me going until now. It was great to hear the band's new songs like \\"Pop is Dead\\" and \\"Can I Borrow a Kiss,\\" alongside favorites \\"(Havin' a) Rave Up,\\" \\"Another Lousy Day in PAradise\\" and \\"My Sharona\\" on this CD. For the fiathful and the uninitiated, this is a great addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out when you Zip Off","review":"These pants are quite nice. I bought them for my fiance and he liked them quite a bit (once we got the right size), but the zipper on one leg is a bit tough to work and only zips correctly when you get the teeth lined up very carefully and zip cautiously. The peat moss color is nice, since you tend to get dirty hiking and camping, and this color doesn't show the dirt like the lighter khaki color does. We've bought another pair of the Columbia pants (that have 30+ SPF) in a lighter weight fabric and are quite pleased with those as well. They wash up nicely and are quite handy for outdoor activities."},{"rating":"1","title":"They could do a lot better...","review":"I read the reviews that said the graphics were horrible, but I didn't care as long as I had a good rugby game to play in the off-season. I bought Rugby 2004 and Madden 2004 and they arrived on the same day. Talk about a huge difference. Madden's graphics are extraordinary, the level of gameplay is extensive, nearly everything about it is top notch. Rugby, even though it is the same year-edition as Madden, is atrocious by comparison. The graphics really are terrible, the gameplay is choppy and hard to get a handle on, the sound and music sucks, and it's just not very fun to play. This game seems more like Rugby 1998 compared to other EA games. I agree with the other review that said EA probably spent most of their budget on licensing rights, and little on the game itself. Even if you love rugby, save your money. It's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable, practice helps","review":"Don't expect a very intuitive game.

The price sounded too good to be true and it was.The ball head would not hold camera securely. Very hard to adjust in proper position, and lock in place. The mount would shift when locked, making the adjustment pointless. The ceiling clip is not correctly designed as there is no way to secure it closed except by gluing or taping it in place.Best part of it is the little 1/4-20 stud mounted on the round plate. If the ball head was better made it would have been useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I guess you get what you pay for. The ball would not lock in any position, no way no how. A waste of any amount of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap inferior construction","review":"This part broke as it was being installed which made it unusable. The only worse mount that goes with camera is the one they include with camera purchase so if you want to mount the camera your pretty well stuck using this mount. There may be mounts available from companies other than Foscom but I am not aware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this","review":"Just like everyone else have mentioned in their reviews, this universal camera mount is worthless. The build in my experience, is pretty good - that is the weight, the connecting joints and mounting bracket. Where it fails is its functionality and this is isolated to the ball head joint, the most important component in this kit. It doesn't stay put no matter how tight you screw the thumb-screw in. I purchased it as a recommended product when I purchased theAgasio M105I Outdoor Wireless Wifi Waterproof Bullet IP Camera with IR-Cut Filter, Two-way Audio, Night-Vision, Email &. Guess I'll be using the bracket that was included with the camera. From the look of the video review and a handful of other viewers, it's a hit or miss with a larger probability range in the \\"miss\\". If you are considering this joint, you're gambling your $5.00 unfavorably away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Construction, Not easy to set","review":"This mount seemed promising until I tried to use it. The main problem is that it is very hard to get the camera attached to remain in the position you placed it in. To lock it down you have to push down hard on the swivel cap and quickly tighten the screw. Hopefully the tension will be enough to keep the camera from flopping down due to gravity. This causes another problem, as while you tighten the screw to hold the camera in place, if you tighten it a tad to much it strips the teeth on screw hole and makes the whole thing useless. You might get some use out of it if you are extremely careful with it, but don't do a lot of adjustment or you WILL strip the screw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theft prone -","review":"I bought this along with Loftek CXS3200 Wireless Camera. But I found that this assembly is all threaded type. You basically keep adding the different combination to get the right fit for the camera.But this threading is the weakest part as the camera itself can be unscrewed from the rod & taken away.So If you are looking for an outdoor mounting soln, this is not for you.Also I found that my CXS3200 has a 340degree view angle so the stand which came with camera is good enough.I hope I can get a refund on this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Tripod Heads","review":"Bought four (4) of them. The heads are weak... possibly defective. When I attempt to tighten the heads, the heads often refuse to stay put. Weak, weak, weak product. Very dissatisfied with the heads, in particular, not the entire mount. These are supposed to support up to a 10 pound camera. Mine weigh less than three (3) pounds and the Videosecu heads seem very untrustworthy... even with only that little weight. The fact that the mount is metal is good. The fact that the mount features modular pieces that are all connected with standard 1/4\\" threads is also good. But I had to buy stronger Manfrotto heads to replace the heads that came with my Videosecu mounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word....JUNK!!!","review":"I ordered 3 of these brackets to hold my new outdoor cameras. This item is complete junk! They fell apart when hand-tightening! Also, they fail to mention that you need a hex wrench to tighten the other side of the bracket! 2 of the 3 brackets are broken! In my opinion, this is another reason why we should avoid imported junk from you-know-where!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Videosecu 2-6 Inch Adjustable Universal Pan Tilt Video Camera Mounting Bracket with Ceiling Clip 1BO","review":"I like the mount how you can adjust it,i with it came in another color like white and the mount where you place it to a post,house you need to make it better like a screw in type to the base , Because the one no it will move on you it wouldn't stay."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cheap Piece of Junk","review":"I didn't expect much, but I did expect it to function. It arrived in a crushed box inside a padded envelope. Not terribly important, given that nothing inside was fragile, but still not a good sign. Then, it became apparent that the only real piece of this I wanted, the ball joint, was not functional.The thumb screw that tightens the ball joint in place is cross-threaded in the body, and cannot be completely tightened. The ball joint, therefore, is still wobbly and unstable no matter how tight you manage to get the set screw. If any weight is attached to it at all, like my iPad, it just falls over. It's a flaky design to start with, so I'm not sure it would be much better if the screw threads weren't messed up.I'd send it back for a replacement or refund, but at the price it's just not worth my time. I'll find something better locally. Save your money. This is a cheap piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you really need these","review":"I ordered many of these as suggested with Foscam cameras. Turns out the cams came with their own mounts and Amazon should not have suggested to buy these to me AND should have listed that those cameras came with mounts. These mounts are a little better than the included ones but not much and I found that 1 out of 3 screws didn't have a fully imprinted screw heads which means there was no way to screw them in through the mount in to a base and you'd have to improvise with your own screws to install the mount. In the Foscam case you can not simply use their screws with this mount because they are too small for the mount's holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ball swivel a dud","review":"As others have mentioned the ball swivel is a major problem. Impossible to tighten enough to hold an outdoor camera. The flimsy Foscam factory mount worked better than this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"the material is very cheap","review":"The main issue with this product is that the material is very cheap.

With their first single reaching as high as No.2 on the Billboard Hot 100 with \\"He Loves U Not\\", a refreshing R & B rocker, these girls have what it takes to ride into success.With great vocals and refreshing pop tunes, this group has what it takes to become superstars.Why 4 instead of 5 stars, because there are some duds here on the album as well, they put too many songs on the album. The producers should of focused a little more on quality than quantity and dropped the interludes that go on throughout the album.Otherwise a nice pop treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream's Awesome CD","review":"Dream is definately a great band! The CD \\"It Was All A Dream\\" rocked my stereo! Excellent sound, great songs, who could ask for more? All I ask is that they make another, even awesomer CD for me to listen to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let this one go!","review":"Every time I listen to this cd all I ever listen to is He Loves U Not. Know why? Because it's the only good song on the whole cd! I'm getting tired of spending my money on [music] like this just to find only one good song on the whole disc! It's just one of the milloin horriable cds out there. Don't even think about wasting your hard earned money on this cd! Just listen to the radio if you want to her the He Loves U Not song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing...","review":"We all know \\"He loves you not,\\" and it's a good song, but not great. And the rest on this album is just filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME!","review":"YO, MY AUNT BOUGHT THIS FOR ME, I ACTUALLY WANTED IT AT THE TIME BECAUSE MY FRIEND HAD TOLD ME IT WAS AWESOME. NEVER TRUST YOUR FRIENDS. IT ONLY TALKED ABOUT LOVE (MAYBE NOT SINCE I DIDN'T LISTEN TO THE WHOLE CD, SO DON'T DIS ME). NOT THAT I DON'T LIKE LOVE IT'S JUST THAT IT GETS A LITTLE OLD. MAKE THAT ALOT. MY DAD CALLES THEM P. DIDDY'S (WHY THE [HECK] DID HE CHANGE HIS NAME) HOOCHIES. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE. THEY SHOULD FINISH HIGH SCHOOL AND GET A REAL JOB. NO TALENT WHAT SO EVER. SAW THEM LIVE, ALMOST DIED. REALLY STUPID LYRICS. MAKE YOU FEEL SAD THAT THEY ACTUALLY SING THEM. VERY PREDICTABLE, I COULD GUESS EVERY NEXT LYRIC. THAT'S PRETRTY SAD SINCE I'M 10 YEARS OLD. POP IS EVIL, ALWAYS WILLL BE, ALWAYS HAS. IF YOU WANT REAL MUSIC, LISTEN TO ME BANG ON MY PAINO, YOU'LL THANK ME I TOLD YOU."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"When their first Single \\"He loves u not\\" came out, I loved it and thought for sure their album would be amazing. I bought it and was shocked, amazed and finally too bored to go on. I was shocked when I heard the cheesy and corny interludes they had, something like a Britney Spears rip off. I was amazed that ever other song on their album sounded exactly alike. They had one good song, and then they tried to make a whole album based off of that.Don't buy this, see if you can just buy that one single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible! The Most Consistently Enjoyable Pop album ever!","review":"I'm shocked there aren't more people here who love this! It's fantastic! Unlike pop veterans Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears, whose albums contain a few great songs and a whole lot of filler, there isn't a single bad track here! Any of these could have easily become humongous radio hits, and quite frankly I'm in awe that that didn't happen. It is just plain depressing that these girls didn't release anything beyond this-their music is the best pop I've ever heard in my life!! You will be humming to all of their songs for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"delicious pop music, but obviously short-lived","review":"all of their songs are very catchy, the girls have talent; But the only worthy song is not He loves U not, but When I get there. because this is the ONLY song that is not complete girly fluff crap. But Dream is obviously short-lived, because after a while it gets old and all the girly fluff thing really gets you. ironically though, they do represent those girls who have nothing to do but talk about boys all day. this is like THE perfect example."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a nightmare","review":"The first hit single, \\"He Loves U Not\\" was great but unfortuneatly the Dream girls couldn't produce anymore hits like that. \\"This is Me\\" is also a pretty good song. The rest of he album however is repetitive and bubble gum pop. The rest of the stongs lack originality and steady beats. There are a lot of random interludes where the the girls are just talking boy crazy with no sense. One of the worst songs is \\"Mr. Telephone Man\\". The song is senseless talking about a hung up phone call. Most of the songs are like that with senseless lyrics and random tunes. These one-hit wonders need to produce more than just a single on a 17 track album. Try again P. Diddy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Band","review":"I love the CD! The best thing about this CD is that it's a mix of pop and r&b, which are my 2 favorite categories of music. I think the girls have a really good future ahead of them. I can't wait for another CD from these fantastic foursome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was it all a dream?","review":"No, these girls CAN really sing. From the intro to the end it's a solid pop album. The uptempos are your standard pop/r&b stuff (mixed in with a bit of funk/electo-pop) but there's something special about how the girls approach each song. The ballads are sweet (espically \\"miss you\\") and their harmonies are really awesome. A really good choice to add to your cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blew me away!","review":"When I heard there debut single (He loves You Not) I thought it was a slammin Track,and when I got the cd the first day of it's release I found out it's a slammin album!...They give pop a completely new sound and the best part about this album is that it will probably appeal to bubble gum pop fans and R&B fans because the album is a mixture of both! a couple of my favorite tracks are (in my dreams) (Pain) (what we gonna do about us) & (Mr telephone) which is a very well done remake of a hit (new edition) song. Basically this album is gonna get the group somewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've heard","review":"This Cd is very, very good. These girls have alot of talent and they make wonderful music together. All of their songs have a great beat and they make you want to sing and dance to their wonderful tune. I heard \\"He loves u not\\" on the radio and i had to get the CD. Now I have many more favorite songs from this CD. These girls should continue making such great music because I will definatly buy their next CD. I recomend this CD to everyone, every age, and every different language, because even if you don't understamd English, the wonderful beat on this CD will make you happy. I hope these girls are very succesful and keep making such great music. And I hope that anyone who looks at this reveiw will make up their mind and buy the CD. Trust me, you will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, creative pop...","review":"I love this album! The girls of Dream don't only have unique songs but also talented voices. Songs range from the up-beat hit \\"He Loves U Not\\" to the slow \\"Miss You.\\" Of course, having, a founder like Puffy can only help the group's success. I recommend this album because I believe that Dream is the best music the millenium has seen yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I found this album enjoyable.","review":"This was such a great CD. I don't know what happened to them. For those who don't remember Dream were the first all female white pop group on P. Diddy's Bad Boy Records. They hit it big too. Their first single, \\"He Loves You Not,\\" was a big hit on TRL and the girls became MTV staples but to date this was their only album. The album had some great songs and the girls even remade the New Edition hit \\"Mr. Telephone Man.\\" I found this album enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"More pop crap","review":"I don't own this album, or any other pop album. I don't need to, because what I've heard on MTV is bad enough. All these groups are the same, all their videos are the same, it's stupid as hell. They take a few teenage girls, slap a ton of makeup on them, and put 'em in shirts that reveal their midriffs over some tight pants. Unless the girl weighs over 90 lbs, then they put her lard a** in a full shirt, cause we can't show someone who actually has some flesh on them, 'cause everyone knows that's ugly. Then the girls dance around making goofy faces and acting \\"sexy\\", as if a sixteen-year-old girl would know what sexy was if it bit her in her butt. I have news for you teeny-boppers, tight clothes and make-up do not make you sexy. Sexy is all about attitude, confidence, how you carry yourself. MTV is full of crap. Every female singer on the whole channel has more boobs than brains.Listen to some real music, made by people who have some talent. This crap isn't in that category."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is not a Dream","review":"This is a great cd. There is such a cd that is so good that is not a dream. They Have a good sound and they new and great. I would buy this cd if I was anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"New pop at its best","review":"While the music IS pop, with producer Puffy, the music becomes edgier, with a more hip-hop flavor. This suits the CD and its singers, injecting Dream with lots of catchy beats and tunes (something Bad Boy is known for). Although the skits between songs are somewhat annoying, this CD is easy to sit down and listen to (or get up and dance to!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reaching for their dream","review":"A few weeks ago, I saw this CD at a local store. About to embark on a 6 hour bus ride, I bought the CD. My friends and I were listening to this amazing CD all the way to and from New Jersey!Dream has put together an amazing CD with popular singles such as He Loves U Not and This is Me mixed with other songs and fun interludes. The 4 girls who make up this band have an amazing vocal range, and they have an incredible future as musicians. In this era of \\"boy bands\\" and rappers, good pop music is hard to find. It was All a Dream is a great CD for anyone searching for good pop music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Try A little harder","review":"Ok P Diddy and the Family might have hit big with this pop group straight out of the junior high but their success has no future. Listening to this album reminds me of just how successful B*withced became.... One hit white girl wonders... But I likely will not wonder. With songs like \\"What we gon' Do About Us\\" it is obvious these girls should finish grammar school before pursuing their musical careers. I am glad to see Bad Boy wanted to find some good girls and try to make them bad... at English that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pinch me!","review":"Like, Oh my god! Have u ever woken from a dream and tried desperately to go back to sleep to pick up where it left off because it was so good? That's how I felt after listening to this album. These girls r so talented, they rise far above their far below-average looks. When I first heard them on the radio, I thought it was another Britney Spears song. Then I thought it was Christina Aguilera. Then I thought it was Jennifer Lopez. Then I thought they were Destiny's Child. When I found out that it was a brand new manufactured pop band, I couldn't believe my ears! Their voices r as beautiful as their baby fat midriffs. Never has a group of artists barely out of puberty raised the national consciousness to a higher level. Well, at least not since Kris Kross anyway. Hopefully they'll get even younger. I dream of the day when fetuses will sing! \\"He Loves U Not\\" is a great song. If, like me, u r too lazy to write out simple words like \\"you\\" and \\"are,\\" then this album is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"if i was a teen, i'd be Dreaming too!","review":"I'm 24, and I'm perfectly surprised with the level of maturity this album presents. This is probably the best teen group album I've heard in years! The music is unmissable, despite the lead vocalist's lack of 'umph' in the songs when needed. Noticeable tracks: He Loves U Not, When I Get There, Mr. Telephone (\\"...there's something wrong with my line...\\"), Miss You and best of all tracks, Do You Wanna Dance. I have only one dislike in the album, which is there's the same lead singer in all tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Don't get me wrong...i LOVE the whole teenie-bopper pop scene. With goups like N*Sync how could you not. I got this album because i love \\"He Loves You Not\\" and I just figured that all of the songs would be good....but I was wrong. The girls have good voices but the songs suck! The only good songs on it are \\"He Loves You Not,\\" \\"He Loves You Not (Bad Boy Remix),\\" and \\"In My Dreams.\\" So don't waste your money. If you don't believe me, go dowload some of the songs and see for yourself. If you want to get a good CD get J.Lo or O Town. I'm very disappointed in Puffy...I thought for sure he'd of done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"It turned out to be all a dream in the end","review":"Dream, the quartet of teenage jailbait, hit the music scene with their deliciously flavored \\"He Loves U Not,\\" a petal-plucking electronica-oriented tune about a boy that is theirs, not yours. Though no Christina's their voices can be hardly recognizable through the electronic instruments that are prominent in It Was All A Dream. Turns out true to its name it WAS all a dream because Dream, though quite successful to teenybopper girls, broke up a year after their release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This cd is extemely boring for the average girl older than 9. I am 14 and this is quite possibly the worst cd i have ever heard. The lyrics are VERY babyish and the target audience for this cd if 8 year olds. These singers are older than me but sing for 8 year olds. This cd is overall, extremely disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"How old are they?","review":"this group of girls have underdeveloped voices, and i feel are not adequate singers. maybe if they waited a few years they wouldnt have gone out as \\"One Hit\\" wonders. after their 2nd single did we see them again? No, because the quality of this cd is very poor. Dont waste your time or money buying this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"So kute","review":"This album has to be the best one they have put out.They are young aspiring talented singers and they definatly have a future.My favore song on this album is \\"This Is Me cause it shows that you are your own person and that no guy should try to compare you to another girl.But if you like dream or r&b then this is the album to buy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is so generic...","review":"Why must me we pelted with teen band crap? These songs have no progression! It's just the same repetitive choruses, typical dance beats, and sappy ballads. VARY THINGS UP DAMNIT! I have no idea why people who just might have some singing talent go to such lengths to make their music so typical. If these girls threw in lots more harmonies, longer songs (can any pop band write a song above 4:30?) and less repetition it will be much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sasha","review":"This CD is very, very good. It's not your average girl- group CD. It has a lot of really good beats and dance songs. It has a big Bad Boy influence with it's beats. My personal favorite song is Pain. It has several really good songs that stick out, like He loves U not and Mr Telephone man. It's still pop, but refreshingly unbubblegummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD","review":"WOW, P DIDDY PLEASE STOP THE MADNESS. WHO Told these women that they had talent.

Well, for once in my life, it was actually a good splurge! He Loves U Not, In my dreams, and This is me are all fantastic songs, as are all the rest on the album. Most suprising of all is that the 4 talented girls that sing these songs are only 15 and 16 years old! Dream is a band with a great future, and I would recommend you buy this CD today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TRASH","review":"Dream is just another pop group that doesn't play their own instruments, doesn't write their own songs and can't sing. They are just another Britney Spears and 'N SYNC ext. group my advice do not waste your money on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"How many tracks are there really?","review":"First I wanna say that the musis is awesome. The songs have a catchy beat and the music is origional in terms of melodies. I can play this CD over and over and still not be tired of it. There are two problems I saw with the CD. The first is that the content of the songs is ALL the same. It is all about wanting a guy that for some reason or the other she can't have. The other problem was the interludes. I didn't know what an interlude was when I bought the CD. For people who don't know, it is the girls talking -- no music. I think it is basically there to take up space. The intro is there for the same reason. There are really only 12 real MUSIC tracks. I the music really was great though, I just usually skip the interludes and the intro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not have bought it","review":"I am sorry for buying this CD. While it does have a couple good tracks - (When I Get There and He Loves You Not) some of the songs were bad - (Pain, Do You Wanna Dance)But maybe it's because I grew out of the pop image. If you like pop to make you dance and songs written by 50 year old song writters, buy this.

So far there's about 3 or 4 of these new hot groups that really can't sing. I'm on to Eden's Crush. At least I know they can actually sing from watching their special. Nice idea to get this groups going but please let at least 2 of them know how to sing or at least know how to harmonize together. This is too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"People like this stuff?","review":"Wow,this cd is pretty bad.I bought it for my girl,because shes into this kind of music.And i was listening to it with her and was thinking to myself how can anyone like this stuff.I was grinding my teeth as each track played and wanted to get the hell out the room.After about halfway through the cd i couldnt take it anymore and told her to please turn it off.This isnt as bad as some of that other teen pop garbage.the track \\"he loves you not\\" has a catchy beat to it and i was kinda embarassed when i caught myself bobbing my head to it.And the girls are cute(theyre young,but,cute)and i can tell that they have some talent, but if they keep making songs like the ones on this album they wont be around long enough to fully achive the little pontential they have to be a serious music group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe it is all a Dream....","review":"This new pop group may spring a question into the minds of all of us... isn't this just another Britney Spears or Christina Aguilira? They harmonize songs that are about boys and crushes, loving and wanting guys and all the great things in life...They use the snazzy lyrics that every pop star uses, the he loves me not, do u love me...etc... They sound great and have okay songs but arnt we just remaking already great pop sensations? It seems like were doubling the pop industry by 3 and new groups spring up at every chance they get, obviously for fame and fortune, competition and all the great stuff. Can't we limit it? Pop is becoming overcrowded and they all sound the same... How will we begin to tell the difference?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"A superve cd!

This is the second time that I have ordered something from an Amazon outside vender and received a totally different Item. I have never had an issue when dealing with Amazon Directly, only when dealing with certain outside vendors that sell through Amazon. If this happens one more time then that's 3 strikes and I am out. It is not worth my time over a $6 item to return it and wait 3 weeks for another one. I guess I will write it off as a bad experience.

The casting was solid, the sets were solid, the costuming was solid, the story was solid for its genre. The directing must've been solid -- the proof is in the pudding, as the adage would go.This film watches like a great, fun flick, with a truly original character. It looks like the cast must've had fun, filming the work. The viewer most certainly has a great chance to really enjoy watching this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauling it in space.","review":"Fans of Dennis Hopper should enjoy this funny movie about being an independant space trucker, and going against the flow like Dennis Hopper characters often do. In the process, he and two other like minded people he picks up on a space station, end up fighting space pirates and also fighting some serious killer robots to save Earth. I liked the fact that no matter how bad things seem to get for our heroic space truckers, they managed to keep the jokes comming, and your funny bone tickled. The budget restraints are evident in the space seens, but the various ship interiors were pulled off quite well in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe you have to be a trucker...","review":"I am a space movie enthusiast. My friend Ian will pay dearly for recommending this one! Don't get me wrong, they have some original ideas... my favorite scene actually had me laughing out loud when the Charles Dance (the doctor from Alien 3) tries to get it on with Debi Mazar but has \\"technical\\" difficulties. Here an there they made some efforts to remind you that you were in space, but I wouldn't call it a space movie. Maybe I just think Dennis Hopper is annoying. Charles Dance should have been used more, he did well with what they gave him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever!","review":"In the quest for bad Sci-Fi's, we found this. By far, hands down this is the worst movie you could possibly see. If they had negative star ratings, this movie would qualify. I'd rather watch my arm being severed off by a butter knife.

It's been reviewed so many times that I really don't know what I can add. I guess I agree with the other reviewers in essence. I was particularly grossed out at the image of cute little Debi Mazar having sex with the genetically remanufactured space pirate with the pull-start crotch engine. Thank God that didn't happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Main Stars are Dennis Hopper, Stephen Dorff, Charles Dance, Debbi Mazar","review":"It makes me crazy to see the stars listed for a movie or TV series are NOT the main characters. Amazon, apparently, has copied the actor list from www.imdb.com and so the main characters, who appear further on down the list, do not even appear after the title of the movie. A potential buyer of this DVD would be looking for the main characters not the bit players.I have tried to move up the stars in a DVD's list of actors before but have been rejected. Sometimes, but not always, someone actually looks at what I am trying to do and fixes the problem. Example: On Tour of Duty, a female actress was in a few episodes of ONE season but she was the only name Amazon put for all 3 seasons instead of Terrence Knox, et al. Doesn't make sense. It was finally fixed.By the way, I really like this movie and would recommend it to those who like sci-fi action movies with good actors (characters!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hilarious Little Classic","review":"I stumbled across this film on VHS in the used bin of a Blockbuster. I thought, Dennis Hopper and Charles Dance, why not? Truckers in space, why not?Why not? Indeed. This hilarious little gem is full of pleasant surprises. Yes, it sorta runs out of steam by the end, but who cares?It's a classic direct to video film, low budget, but it makes the most of what it has.

The first five minutes of this film are the only five minutes worth watching, it builds suspense but doesnt deliver. The sets are corny, the costumes are lame, and the writing subpar. The only other thing remotely interesting is the filmakers view of trucking lines in the future, with all of the flashy neon signs and advertisements, it will probably be very acurate when we eventually get interstellar highways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Effort For Great Cast","review":"I thought the cast alone would make this one worth seeing, but I was wrong.

Is there a ranking of less than 1 star?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost nothing good","review":"This movie is one of the worst movies iv'e ever seen.The effects are just terrible,they should have used computer graphics(This movie was doner in 1997 when computer graphics were a standard).The plot isn't better and the acting is also terrible.Dennis Hopper is a good actor but seems to almost hate the role and Debi Mazaar altought also a good actor is hopless in this part.Stephen Dorff gives us a few good scenes but theyre not enough.Even the humor doesn't make you laugh.I can't belive why Dennis Hopper is caught by really bad roles these days(Waterworld etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Visuals - Bad Story Line","review":"I found that this movie had good special effects that were engaging to watch, but the story line was choppy at best. The story line seemed very disjointed. I would get up to do something and come back to find that the three main characters were in a different plot twist than when I got up! The plot was several mini adventures that were just thrown together.

Many of the tunes are old jazz standards made famous by others, but this cd does justice to all of them. Many of the tunes are reminiscent of older Jimmy Smith renditions. Rudy Van Gelder does a wonderful job of engineering a group of very accomplished side men and Papa John rocks the house. Nice addition to any B3 organ collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than solid follow up","review":"The Stix is, overall a superior album the A Livingroom Hush, which sometimes struggled for cohesion amid its kaliedoscopic sound and genre bending. The same overall timbre applies to this next offering from Jaga Jazzist, but with fuller, more poignant tunes and a better weighting of the electric, band and rock elements. In short, more accessable and all the better for it. Buy it if you think Norway is dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy research and mystery mongering","review":"This book is one of the many on the Bermuda Triangle that is more interested in acting puzzled over \\"disappearances\\" than actually doing any investigation or research. Many of the so-called \\"mysterious\\" disappearances are in fact only mysterious because the author couldn't be bothered to check the facts, presumably relying on second-, third-, or fourth-hand accounts. The gold standard for books on this topic is Larry Kusche's \\"Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved.\\" That is an example of how a little careful scholarship clears up decades of mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"unconciously limited perspective","review":"If you deal with gold every day, you may eventually think gold is the most important matter in the world: not because that is a truth, but because you are 'unconciously limited' to that topic.

It details the line of progenitors leading up to Darwin's theory as well as the historical milieu in which Darwin swam during his lifetime and some of the forces, social and otherwise, that influenced him prior to Origin of Species and beyond. Himmelfarb gives an insightful criticism of Darwin's theory working simply from the internal organization of Darwin's thoughts. Himmelfarb is so brilliant in her analysis that my only criticism of the book is that she didn't critcize the theory in a more detailed fashion.But it is a very readable and accessible book, and one that clearly points out some of the failings of Darwinian theory, many of which have been picked up by other critics over the years. However, I suspect that for the more sophisticated critic of Darwin, this book lacks sufficient scientific evidence--though it remains a fine history of the person, his theory, and its reception at the time of publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why are you overworked?","review":"This little day-to-day book may help explain to us why as women we often make life choices that leave us over-worked and feeling bitter and unfulfilled. Using a combination of quotes, questions, and tough-love talk, Anne Wilson Schaef's book sheds some 12-step spiritual-style and common-sense light into the dark corners of the busy-rushaholics- work-aholics life. Give this book to a woman you love or admire who \\"does too much\\" and then buy a copy for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Women on the Go","review":"What I love most about this book is that it is small enough to bring with you anywhere you go, and the wisdom large enough to calm and soothe you no matter where you are. It's the type of book that you can open to any page, and find wisdom ranging on topics such as: Being present to the moment; Busyness; Exhaustion; Goals; Honesty; Wholeness; Live life fully/Curiosity; Forgiveness; Feelings/Control; and the great list goes on - all 365 of them.If you feel harried and rushed, are in a long supermarket line, or stuck on traffic, this is the perfect book to open up and get you to feed your mind with wisdom to bring you more inner peace.

That one can discredit any psychic evidence when purported by a close, real-life contact such as Wendy Weir, sister to one of the Grateful Dead guitarists, was with Mr. Garcia doesn't even come into question when very little of Jerry's personality appears to have survived his death, according to the author's \\"channeled\\" dialogue with his \\"spirit.\\" He sounds just too holy and out of reach to be true, and \\"Dead Heads\\" would be better off searching the VEDAS than here. Actually, the entire book including Weir's condescending approach and predictable upper-class conflicts suffers from flat affect. If this was meant for a pot boiler, it's a brave attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Estimated Prophet?","review":"First off, I think the author is sincere, and had some genuine experiences but got carried away with the glamor of her subject and pushed it into an unintentional parody of everything that's new age and deadhead. As a \\"new age deadhead\\" I was sympathetic with the book at first, but her self-seriousness, the kitschy drawings and prose, and the deification of Garcia just about did me in. My guess is Jerry would have hated it. I wonder what Bob really thinks... At the end of the book, she solicits readers' spiritual experiences, dreams, etc. with Jerry and other band members. It sounds like she is planning a sequel and is heading for a career as the spiritual teacher for Jerry-worshipping deadheads. This is the kind of stuff her brother sang about in \\"Estimated Prophet.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"With all due respect","review":"I looked through this book at a bookstore, so I don't claim to have read it all. But come on! Jerry never spoke like this in his life! What puzzles me is why Wendy thought disseminating HER beliefs through the oversoul character would work. I'm not judging her channeling ability at all. I am a Buddhist (not a New ager) and I believe in the continuation of life but how would Jerry's intelligence and personality turn into a new age potpouri? My greatest feeling about this book is sadness that someone so connected to the Dead family could do this. The great thing about the Dead thing is the songs weren't dogma. The music and show experience allowed for different people to make discoveries on their own. Why would the man with the greatest handle on individual freedom turn into a dogmatic eastern mystic overnight?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Who's Gonna Channel Pigpen?","review":"The one thing that Jerry Garcia hated the most was the tendency of some of his fans to elevate him into some kind of guru. With the publication of Ms. Weir's book Ol' Jer's ashes must be spinning in the Ganges.This book has nothing to do with the life of Jerry Garcia. It's about Wendy Weir, whose life as a hard-core newager/occultist/whatever isn't anywhere near as interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"shameless waste of paper","review":"This book is unbelievable nonsense. Jerry's spirit allegedly calls Wendy Weir, \\"little one.\\" As the SNL Church Lady used to say, \\"Well, isn't that special.\\" Jerry was a Beatnik not a Boddhisattva and he never talked like this in life, so why should he after death? Wendy Weir needs a pyschotherapist. Either that or she is consciously committing a big hoax for bucks, which would be utterly contemptable.

When we received it we knew from reviews that it would be flat but after letting it set for awhile that the feathers would expand and that hasn't happened yet. The fabric is so rough. It feels like paper. We have washed it hoping that it would help and it didn't. It is still so uncomfortable. It also doesn't fit like a queen comforter should. I read about this in another review and wish I would have listened.This was a complete waste of money.

If I could smack the person who posted it on amazon, I would. It was one of the biggest regrets as far as purchases go because I could have gotten something way better for my money.

I didn't learn anything of value from the book or the class, and neither did any of the dozens of other people I have talked to in person (undergraduate and graduate students). It seems that Gouda doesn't really know much about Networking. Thus, he created his convoluted interpretation that nobody else uses or really understands so he can elevate himself on a pseudo-intellectual pedestal. The other regular Networks teacher at UTCS is currently using a decent book 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet' by James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross.

All Fall Down is no exception, with a stellar cast of actors like Angela Lansbury, Karl Malden and Eva Maria Saint to support Warren Beatty, it is definitely worth watching. If you watch plays/movies written by Arthur Miller, Tennessee Willianms, Eugene O'Neil and such, you understand that there will not be a fairy tale ending. It's a story of a true womanizer and roamer who comes home and disrupts the family life. A story about a younger brother who idolizes Warren Beatty until he sees him for what he genuinely is. And of course, there will be tragedy that everyone has to cope with and understand how it relates to them. It is not as powerful as \\"Death of a Salesman (the Lee J.

All characters say: \\"Hi, Berry Berry!\\"...\\"Can we have a conversation in depth, Berry Berry?\\" Major cringe inducing.That this was produced by a major studio in 1962 is mind boggling.

The sound on the LP is good mono but rather boxy. I like Dinah Shore in the lead, but she slows down the tempo of some of the songs and can be rather stiff. Still, I like this better than the Decca/Merman recording as the Shore recording is more complete. If you can find it, get the soundtrack recording with Merman and Donald O'Connor.

Scott's singing on Perhaps...sometimes was hard to understand because it seemed kind of in the background. This problem has been fixed on 1985, only to create a new one. Scott's voice is a little irritating which can put off some listeners. Also sometimes i think the drumming is too fast.

Because of the shape of the pond, we ordered two of these nets and joined them by weaving them together with nylon twine. We made a tent above the pond so that the birds would still have access to the water on each end. Even with the weight of wet leaves on the sides of the \\"tent\\", the net has held together and kept our pond entirely clear of leaves and debris. Very sturdy. Good product.

The netting went around and over everything, with a separate section cut out to access the trees. We had so many cherries last year it was insane! Not a single bird was able to get at the tree and the netting held up perfectly! At the end of the season we carefully took it down and rolled it up to store for the next season....in a couple of weeks we will re-wrap the trees. Given the number of cherries we had last year I will probably be giving a bunch away or canning them....we had more cherries than we knew what to do with last year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"We had a Herron problem with our koi pond. We put the net over the pond and after one more visit, no more problem. Works like a champ. The black colored net is almost invisible when 5 yards away and the 3/8 inch mesh keeps all the leaves out, but still allows us to pass the koi food through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great net","review":"This net is just as advertised and arrived as predicted. The only negative I could give is that, due to its large size coupled with the tendency of netting to catch on anything and everything while getting in position, it would have been nice to know in advance which was the long or short side (we guessed wrong!) so as to pre-position it near our pond. They could put a simple diagram on the package to help.This is a really good net and overall experience.Mike from Oklahoma"},{"rating":"2","title":"My tot LOVES this video!","review":"I had never heard of the \\"Little Robots,\\" but since my three year old son is obesessed with robots I decided to give it a try.

It will not even recognize any VCD's at all. I give it 2 stars only because the progressive component output is a feature I was after too. It is a very quirky unit though. When using the progressive DVD output you are only able to program or view the VCR menu from the DVD component output even though the VCR is only output on composite or RF modulated outputs. Big dissapointment for a Samsung product.

I did find that reading the manual is only usefull for understanding all the extras. Basic operation is best by just using your intuition and trying it!

I tried a CD-R that contained over 500 JPG backup files of digital photos and had no problems viewing them. The quality of the photos was excellent. So far so good.

However, the DVD tray would NOT open! Also, the buttons on the unit responded intermittently, I had to use the remote. The product manual was useless, with no info on how to troubleshoot a stuck tray.The real surprise is that the VCR deck had a tape in it...obviously from quality control. It appears this unit failed quality control and still made it off the prodution line. The problem is Samsung, not Amazon.I returned the unit to Amazon and bought a Panasonic combo (PV-D4743S Progressive-Scan) for $10 more from Best Buy. It works like a dream. and, the instruction manual has info on how to handle a stuck tray. The features are awesome, both DVD and VCR.

After an hour wait with Samsung helpdesk, they quickly determined that the unit was defective.I've decided that the convenience of a combo DVD/VCR is not worth the complications, so this unit was quickly boxed up and sent back for refund.The only good news is that Amazon has a great return policy ... get on the web, note the problem, print out a UPS packing slip and drop it off at the UPS store at no cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD tray wouldn't open right out of the box.","review":"I bought this primarily because of it's small foot print.

The film is an engaging, hilarious, offbeat day in the life comedy that holds a skewed mirror up to your circle of friends and mine. Anyone who sees this is going to know someone like the people in this film, and its this familiarity that makes the characters and the story work.

Or getting laid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, intriguing, and most importantly, realistic","review":"This was the first film I've seen by the Butler brothers, and I really enjoyed it. I'm glad there aren't more movies about an average day with every day characters, because then films like this will be over looked and, unfortunetly, not be enjoyed.

With my first one I would occassionally not put it back in its case but instead would just throw all the cables into my backpack if I was in a rush. Eventually the tip of the cable (not the removable tip) broke and it stopped charging.The replacement that I bought, I treated like antique china. I was always very careful to but the cables back neatly in the back and handled it with kid gloves. But eventually the end of the cable just fell apart as well (and replacement cables can not be purchased separately.)It's too bad as it is a cool product idea. If you get one you'll love it at first.

This cinematic classic - Jim Thorpe: All American - tells the story of a native son rising from the Indian reservations of Oklahoma territory to an Olympic champion. His Olympic glory was tempered when his medals were stripped. A miscarriage of justice to say the least.

The dialog is anachronistic and full of cliches.Bad, bad, bad............It is a mystery that the average score given by 182 people is close to 5 stars.By the way, Jaws has a better plot, characters that are more developed, scary movie with substance.

I recommend it to anyone who loves action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent terriflying true story","review":"This is an amazing story based on real events that happened in Africa during the construction of a major railroad link. These lion's bodies are even on display in the Natural History Museum in Chicago,Illinois, because the horror of what they managed to do has never before nor after their reign of terror occurred throughout African history to this very day.The movie is frightening, and at times bloody, yet I feel that the movie honestly portrays the events as they occurred, and pulls no punches,so it is realistically portrayed as it really happened.There are true heroes in this film that faced death in their efforts to stop the killings,and shows man's humanity in caring for others and being willing to sacrifice themselves to stop these unprecedented animal's killing spree.This film is probably not for the faint of heart...because it is truly frightening, and, at times, bloody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I loved this movie, it was so realistic that it chilled me to the bone. When the Lions attacked the man in the village and dragged him away, I was in a state of shock. It was amazing to see the intelligence of the Lions and to actually watch while they boldly carried people off, I was as frightened throughout the whole show as the cast.

It would be interesting to actually read the book of the film to find out how much has been made up. Did the lions cave actually exist in the way that the film depicts it, and did Paterson (Val Kilmer) actually outrun a lion in full flight. However that aside we have an excellent film, gripping, and a good story.All characters are sound, and well acted. Val Kilmer plays the lead part well, however you cannot help but wonder which hair gel was around in 1900 that could hold hair so well.Michael Douglas plays the hunter with his usual skill.But throughout the film I could not help but wonder why the natives did not set a controlled fire in the long grass to remove all the lions cover, would have made killing them so much easier.See it...man versus nature.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, terrible quality","review":"I purchased this movie thinking I would receive high quality.

Colonel J. H. Patterson, D.S.O., and engineer that was commissioned to build a bridge in the Tsavo region of Africa during the colonial period. His work was interrupted by the activities of a pair of male lions, intent on thinning out the conscripted and hired labor as quickly as possible. This is based on a true story. The film takes liberties with the book from which it came: \\"The Man-Eaters of Tsavo\\", by Colonel Patterson, but I can't say I minded that too much. If it's one thing that drives me to distraction its \\"experts\\" that nit-pick about the details of a genre picture. This is a Hollywood film, a Hollywood blockbuster, no less - not a documentary. In short, this was a tremendously tense film throughout, and Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer turned in two fine performances. The cinematography of Africa was beautiful, and the lions were terrifying. Did you expect a historical document?"},{"rating":"2","title":"'The Devil has come to Tsavo'","review":"This is one of the best adventure/suspense movies ever made and deserves ten stars! Well written and paced, even the music chosen was excellent in keeping the tension at the proper level. Douglas and Kilmer are terrific, believable characters as they round out an already intense story based on two real lions who terrorized an area of Africa. I saw one of the stuffed lions at the Field Museum in Chicago (don't know where the other one was that day) and it truly did send a chill down my spine. If you love action/adventure, or just superb acting period, buy this one for your shelf. My only regret is that it doesn't have the added director commentary or special added features that we are spoiled with when we buy more recent DVD's. Though I could only put five stars, this is a ten star movie!!! Be sure to also pick up a copy of Patterson's book 'The Man Eaters of Tsavo' for more info on the real lions.Chrissy K.

Throughout film history many actors have tried to capture the essence of being cool. James Dean paved the way in his performance in Rebel Without A Cause. In my opinion, Johnny Depp creates a character that goes to that same level. It's the type of movie you'll watch over and over.

I only just got into Johnny Depp late last year and I've been trying to see the many different roles that he's played over the years. Depp turns in one OUTSTANDING performance as FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone a.k.a Donnie Brasco. He gets accepted into a mob family and soon becomes \\"like them\\". This was my first film I've seen of Al Pacino's. Pacino was fantastic as Lefty Ruggiero. Both lead actors turned in the most amazing performances, I was so happy! I loved this movie so much! It was actually the first mob film I've seen. I also liked Michael Madsen's performance as Sonny Black, he was great! This is a must buy for any Pacino or Depp fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mob Story","review":"D. Brasco is a good story and is alot less violent than most mob movies. It isn't as good as the Godfather or Goodfellas.

I think he deserves alot of credit for his hard work and determination"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best, most accurate Mafia portrayals I ever saw!","review":"Next to Goodfellas, this is the best, most accurate Mafia portrayal I have ever seen.

The point is made but not laboured .There are few more effective mobster movies than this one .For me , it is up there with the first 2 Godfather films and Goodfellas .The film is well made and will not disappoint .

Of course, the author might have gotten a few facts confused in the book, but the fine folks who made this film straightened them out. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad Mob movie","review":"Goodfellas was the first Mafia movie that actually got it right. Donnie Brasco is the second. Personally I think they wasted film and time showing his personal problems with his wife and children, but I can see where showing his mental anguish at being away from his family, and in creating relationships with mobsters might have weighed heavily on him. This is a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal","review":"Johnny Depp confuses me. Known for his esoteric choices this movie did not seem to fit with his usual fare. Rather mundane compared to other parts of his.That aside, I was not impressed with something Donnie Brasco. Nothing of this film was bad but nothing stood out.

As you watch Pistone (Depp) infiltrate the mafia through unsuspecting Lefty (Pacino), you get a glimpse into their world. The world of cash, scams, and murder, and an undercover agent is thrown into the middle of it all. In the end, he needs to get out. After all, this was just his day job, but it became his life. Incredible performances by Pacino, Depp, and supporting actor, Michael Madsen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donnie Brasco","review":"Based on the real-life Joe Pistone's memoirs, Mike Newell's \\"Donnie Brasco\\" offers one of the freshest takes on the gangster film since \\"GoodFellas,\\" capturing gritty street life in 1970s New York City as well as the melancholy mood of the times. In one of the great roles of his late career, Pacino excels as Mafia nobody Lefty, combining a wise guy's street swagger with a loving, fatherly air as he takes Donnie under his wing. Depp is equally strong as the conflicted cop, dutifully mining information but increasingly strained by his dual life--so much so that the cracks start showing. A gritty, poignant drama of divided loyalties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Mob Film!","review":"If you are into the whole underground world of the mafia than watch this movie cause it has all the twists and turns that all of those movies in that genre offer. Good movie based on real life FBI undercover agent working with the mob."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tired genre gets worse with Donnie","review":"The story of Donnie Brasco is one of the more compelling tales of organized crime and policing in America ? too bad the book was clunky, convoluted and cliche-ridden. I had high hopes for the film, but the big-screen version offers nothing new in either the gangster or cop movie genre. In fact, if you thought Michael Madsen's one-note turns in Reservoir Dogs and Frankie the Fly were spellbinding, then you're in for a treat: he's back, with the same hulking presence, complete with his trademark monosyllabic muttering. Depp is completely miscast as FBI agent Joe Pistone, and the twisting of \\"facts\\" in the film ? his strained relationship with family and feds ? is puzzling if you've read the book. Why critics raved about Donnie Brasco is beyond me. Spurts of blood, an uninspired '70s soundtrack and Al Pacino does not a good gangster movie make. Leave it at Goodfellas, and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Hollywood","review":"Anyone who likes this movie hasn't read the book! The scene when \\"Sonny Red\\" gets hit and Donnie Brasco is right there helping cut up the bodies is very amusing because it never happened.Also,if the real \\"Lefty\\" ever saw this movie he would want to kill Al Pacino for playing such a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book","review":"The movie on it's own merit was alright, but I read the book first. The movie pales in comparison to the book. There are scenes in the movie that never took place. In fact the movie was kind of hard to stomach. The real Donnie Brasco, (Joe Pistone) tells a much more gripping story in the book. Maybe the movie should have been whacked along with Sonny Black."},{"rating":"1","title":"Donnie Brasco","review":"If you are a mafia movie fan then this should be a disappointment. Tacky acting by Depp and Pacino wrecked this film. The mafia phrase \\"forget about it\\" is used and used again. If you want a real mafia movie stay away from the likes of Pacino and Depp trying to act tough, which they don't do very well at all.

While it is a scholarly work, it reads like a juicy Jane Austen novel. She travelled all over England researching church records, going to grave tombs, and going into random upstairs rooms in buildings rarely seen in order to bring us the real deal behind Late Middle Age theater. Not only do we learn about theater from this book, but we learn of the inner lives of the church, of patrons, and the cult of the virgin.One person in whom we become intimately connected in is John Baret, to whom the book is dedicated. We learn he is a man who was very wealthy and had more influence in the church of one town than he should have had. He had the type of status within the church that a priest enjoyed.

I have had the Iowa Baseball Confederacy in my room forever but I waited until the semester was over to start reading it because I wanted to give it full attention. I read Shoeless Joe a couple of years ago and it is still my all-time favorite book. I went into this one with high expectations. However, they were not met. I just didn't like the characters, didn't care about them. The Plot seemed like a bunch of short stories together that made no sense.Magic is a key element in Kinsella stories. However, this one just seemed too fantastic. I don't know how players coming back from the dead in Shoeless Joe seemed more realistic than the time-travel, magic Indian, and the obsession with the game in the Iowa Baseball Confederacy, but it just does.The book is worth a read if you're a Kinsella Fan but don't waste your time otherwise. Read Shoeless Joe again."},{"rating":"1","title":"He swings and misses","review":"In purchasing this novel I had hoped to be entertained as much as I was when I watched 'Field of Dreams' the adaptation of one of Kinsella's other novels. I enjoyed 'Field of Dreams' so much, and enjoy baseball even more. That story moved me enough to indeed visit the movie site, as Terrence Mann says for reasons they do not understand. But I found that though this book was about a game which lasted over 2100 innings it had little to do with baseball. It reminded me of something bordering on the works of Stephen King. I found that I had little sympathy for Gideon Clarke, or any of his fellow travelers. There is very little baseball action, the diamond only serves as a backdrop for this sorry character's flawed life. A novel it is, but not a baseball novel. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore","review":"As an avid baseball fan, I was anxious to read Kinsella's novel. What a mistake. I normally finish every book I start.

Kinsella needed to be taken care of. When I picked up \\"The Iowa Baseball Confederacies\\" I did not expect to read it entirely in one day. But Kinsella has that kind of effect on a reader. He intertwines fiction with fact, reality with fantasy. He develops characters so well that you feel their pain when things don't go their way, and you share in their joy when things do. The story of Gideon Clarke and his obsession is a page turner for anyone who enjoys fantasy novels, and a healthy knowledge of baseball wouldn't hurt early. His use of the greatest double play tandem in baseball history, Tinkers-Evers-Chance, lets the reader associate reality with Kinsella's fantasy world. The story of the Iowa Baseball Confederacy and their 40 day baseball game versus the eventual World Champion Cubs of 1908 is a book I strongly reccommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"true imagination","review":"This is wonderful tale.

He started a silk business in Thailand, and built a house gave dinner parties and collected oriental art.then one day he went out for a walk and dissapeared. And no one knows what happened.there you go you just read the book.on and on about people trying to solve the mystery of what happened to him, seers, detectives, with doctors and on and on..so what?I immediately gave the book away to someone..to see if he was as dissapointed in it as I was.Havent felt this way about a book in a long time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Curiouser and curiouser","review":"Bought this book on a recent trip to Thailand.

The art is great, the action is enough to make me stick with the TV, and there is also many funny parts as well, you know who I mean right? I'm not regret just to register into 4kids to see it online. I'm not buying the movie yet, I'm going to wait until Japan have it. The movie is so GREAT, better than dueling alot!

So it's not like you have to wait for a villian or a bad guy to show up to duel like the other shows. In this movie it's more fun because the monsters,e.g capsule monsters in this realm, actually talk! I was very surprised when I heard Dark Magician say, \\"Behold, the source of the storm,\\" when he was helping Yami pass one of the five trials.It also has several 'other' monsters that you might not have never seen on the other movies. Monsters like happy lover and Thunderkid(that yellowish lizard), dark witch and Aqua Mador.Love YU-GI-OH? Then buy this! It will not bore you, I guarantee it.You just gotta buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"something I forgot","review":"Another bad thing about Yu-Gi-Oh!

Worse than DW4 Empires.","review":"This game is pretty much the same as Dynasty Warriors 3 and 4 but without the lag. DW4 Empires dont have lag either and is a much better game than this Dynasty Warriors 5 IMO.In Dynasty Warriors 5 each character goes thru about 5 stages then you see the ending. The stages are boring, small, and all look the same. The strategy of capturing bases is pathetic, DW4 Empires's design is better. To make things worse all stages are available from Free Mode. After awhile I got tired of playing the same stages, geez all the characters share stages, a big let down. There are NO witches, soccresses, battering ram, catapult, fire breathing cart, etc.... I was expecting all this and more. The stage design is truly sad.Overall I don't recommend buying this game. Get DW4 Empires instead or Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This game is probably one of the best games i've even played.

The camera angles sometime get annoying. If your a DW fan, pick it up, otherwise, this game isn't going to turn you into one."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"Ive never been a big fan of dynasty warriors. But this game is just bad. First off on easy mode you can defat an entire army by yourself. This is because the enemys never attack. once i ran into the center of a group of enemys and i stood still. I didn't get attacked for ten minutes. Also all of the soldgers look identical. there are about three enemys that dont look the same.and there are only 4 hard fights in the entire game. Also THIS GAME IS REPETTATIVE. you have 6 attacks per character but they all do the exact same thing. And one hit kills petty much all enemys. Now this game is long but so what. If you have a huge pile of garbage, is it really any better then a small pile of garbage. and either way it is still garbage. just like this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printing Press Wedding Software","review":"A complete waste of money.Not user friendly.

Just a re-release by Sony of songs they still own the rights to in an effort to sqeeze more money out of Mariah's fans without offering anything new, or anything collectible.And Amazon's this listing does not show a picture, nor does it indicate that this is NOT the single, nor that it is a re-release.

It was a great way to learn about my state and my family's history, without being bored with facts or a geneology list. The story brings alive the extreme hardships, the commitments to land and family (immediate & extended), the love of both, and to my amazement, their ability to still find time to \\"relax\\".If anyone is curious about homesteading there are alot of facts in this book that will reveal what anyone's fore-fathers might have gone through.

One of my all time favorites \\"Roadie\\" has the feel of a restless soul, a little plaintive blues harp , nice back-up, and the cool lead vocal from Peter Maffay. \\"DU hattest keinen Traennen mehr\\" (You had no more tears) is a story of two shy somewhat forlorn individuals finally connecting.

He pushes it around making vroom sounds. The figure is also a hit. He plays with it and puts it in the car to push. The one negative is that the sound effects are way too loud and the laugh at the end sounds demented. My husband disabled the speaker so only the lights flash and the engine sounds work.

Unlike many other cookbooks I've bought under similar conditions, it has stood the test of time and I keep coming back to it, year after year, as my tastes and lifestyle have changed. The recipes taste fresh and flavorful; they are healthy as can be because the ingredients are mostly fresh produce and grains and beans.

Diana Shaw authors this book as one of those naive middle aged ladies who assumes if you are a vegetarian you are on a weight loss diet. Her refusal to use the words cream, cheese (other then cottage) and butter, other than to scold the use of these ingredients, and her annoying placement of \\"nonfat\\" in front of the word yogurt made me draw a habit and a ruler over her book jacket photo. The only 2 reasons you should buy this book are A) to deprive yourself of real food in an effort to lose weight or B) to avoid having to buy spices, because she uses close to none. If you want a good veggie cookbook stick to the Moosewood series or Madhur Jaffrey or any thing other than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essential","review":"This may be a very essential book for hard core cooks who have a lot of money to buy the grocery's needed.

At least the notion that any single person can \\"steal\\" a holiday when they didn't do a national ban plus killing anyone who dares to celebrate is funny enough that I snickered through the whole thing, but this book is ridiculous.The author just needs to understand that a secular nation, such as the US, cannot endorse a religion, hence why it cannot endorse Christmas. However, it can also not ban individuals from celebrating. Everyone can celebrate on their private properties, during their private times.

Many previous WWF albums had themes that were already outdated. This has the current versions of the music that are heard on TV.

Definitely a good addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angle, de-de, Angle, de-de, Angle, de-de, Angle","review":"Finally the dub-dub F has come out with Kurt Angle's theme.

My favorite would have to be Lita's theme which can get tiring after a while. I just wish I could find out the band who played the song! Raven's music is pretty cool but the bird sound can really get to you after a while! Kurt Angle's is pretty patriotic in a kick butt sort of way. It sounded like Ja Rule was the main man in Rikishi's theme \\"Bad Man\\" but I was pretty unsure. Too Cool's music was probably the only song you could dance too and that was really the whole purpose of that song!

Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Dudley Boyz, Undertaker, hell they didn't even add on the Hardy Boyz' theme, which I feel is honestly the best theme music in the WWF today (Well, ok, next to Triple H's).

The antennae and legs are wiry and bendable so you can move them in any direction you want but well secured to the costume. It is truly one size fits all as my 4 month old fit just fine in it, and it is stretchy so it will fit a much bigger baby too up to 25 pounds. The fabric is shiny and attractive and had no comfort issues for baby. My 4 month old does kind of have a small head so the headpiece would kind of flop to the side a bit but was easily re-adjusted. The perfect thing for this ensemble would be to get a metal bucket (well padded of course!) to put baby in for a photo op and you could also get a chef hat as an adult costume to complete the look.One important note: You do need to buy a red coverall underneath it though as it does not come with this costume!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Cool!","review":"We love this costume!

We're just ready for some DVDs! Keep up the good work guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich, Scott, Dave, Smitty!!","review":"Our 2 year old looooooooves these guys. I must admit, my husband and I have been caught singing the songs too. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful First Novel!","review":"I must tell you that I finished the book by Friday night after picking it up on Tuesday. Not because I was in a rush... but because it was such a \\"page-turner\\"!Wow! Amazing effort in a first novel... I thought the book was well written and your descriptions vividly described your settings, both in Houston and in \\"Potter Springs\\".I loved the themes you returned to again and again in the book of faith, commitment, service on the ministerial side of things, but also the human themes of love, a sense of loss, feelings of betrayal, forgiveness and reconciliation.Secondly, as a preacher's kid who grew up in \\"small town\\" America in the country, then became a youth minister, I could relate to many of the issues raised by the setting of the book!However, as I mentioned before, I loved how those \\"universal\\" themes resonated in this story. Again, excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and Romantic","review":"This was a light, quick little romance. This is a story about Amanda and Mark. Mark is a Baptist minister. He is very much in love with Amanda. So much, they break the moral law and have to quickly get married. Potter Springs is a small little Texas town where Mark lands a job as an assistant minister of the local church. The rest of the novel takes you through how they establish their life in this new town. The character development isn't real deep but the story is definitely engrossing. Not really believable, but enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique voice","review":"This author weaves an engaging story and literary prose into a novel worthy of the highest praise. Potter Springs will touch the heart of anyone who has nearly lost the thing most precious to them. Miss Coleman brings her characters to life with a charm that makes the reader want to hang over the fence and gossip about them. Expect to see this Author on the bestseller list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace abounds in Potter Springs","review":"Britta Coleman's award-winning debut novel presents a love story filled with broken characters searching for a second chance, searching for grace. Set mainly in small-town Texas, the novel's main characters convey their desires to be known, rescued, and loved with such authenticity that they reach out to the reader in a subtle, endearing, \\"we could be friends\\" kind of way.Great characters aren't accidents; they come to life through great writing. And here, the writing is superb. The words pour eloquently off the pages straight into the reader's heart.In writing this novel, Britta did not leave her deeply grounded faith at the door; instead, it is obvious on every page. The message of grace resounds, and thankfully, it resounds to a larger audience because Britta sought to publish Potter Springs with its redeeming message in the mainstream marketplace. Thus, this enjoyable page-turner will have you believing that \\"being lost is a good way to start getting found.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Put It Down!","review":"Amanda and Mark Reynolds are two people very much in love. Their future looks bright and rosy until a series of events finds them realizing how very little they know about one other. When they must move to the small town of \\"Potter Springs\\" their lives become even more complicated, and their marriage begins to crumble.This is a wonderful book from debut novelist Britta Coleman. Her prose is woven intricately in this beautiful story about love, loss, forgiveness and redemption. She makes you care deeply about these two people and the eclectic mix of characters she's created. There are times you laugh, others when you cry, sometimes all on the very same page. This is an incredible read you can't put down. It's in my top 10 for 2005."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it only if you can read quickly","review":"I bought this book for $2 at a used bookstore - I bought it based on the silly cover and even sillier summary on the back.This book is a bad book. While the first half is somewhat amusing, the second half of the book is quite painfully bad. You're left scratching your head, wondering what Cordwainer was thinking with the last part. Chicken planet? What?Only read it if you can read it quickly (2-4 hours) and feel like reading a silly bad sci-fi book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Robin McKinley but...","review":"Robin McKinley is one of my favorite authors. Her prose, her characters, her worlds are all terrific. From her retelling of the story of Beauty and the Beast to her highly original vampire novel Sunshine, I've adored everything she's written. Until now. Somehow, McKinley completely missed out on having a real story with the Stone Fey. Despite the childish format (with wonderful drawings) it's too adult for children yet not long enough or deep enough for adults. Try one of her other wonderful books but skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written but dull","review":"when I finished this book I was disapointed althought \\"the stone fey \\" was,as all of Mckinley's books,well written I found the plot boring completly unlike the other books she has written such as \\"spindle's end\\",\\"beuty\\" and \\"rose daughter\\".this book was sort of unfineshed and the \\"end\\" was stupid. I think the story was so short and dull it was almost not worth being written."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"After reading and loving what was assumed to be a series of books, this was a disappointment. It was NOT appropriate to young children, and even failed to keep the interest of this adult. I can't figure out the purpose of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted and unfit for young readers","review":"After reading this book, I was befuddled. I am an English major in college, and I did not grasp the point of this book. But then again perhaps there is no point. Regardless, I would not recommend this story for children or even most young adults. In addition to its confusing plot, McKinley makes frequent use of the word \\"Damn.\\" If that weren't enough, it has strong sexual overtones, as in the statement, \\"the taste of his mouth in hers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A book not ,a good story yes","review":"The story has a certain mysterious quality that made you want to keep on reading. Nevertheless I was very disapointed upon the ending I found myself thinking McKinnley could have done better much better. As in THE BLUE SWORD or THE HERO AND THE CROWN and what ever is wrong with turning it into another BEAUTY. I would not recomend this book to a child they wouldn't like it nor to someone who loves to read as much as I do they would find it disturbing in the upmost but to someone who doesn't care so much and doesn't pickup a book often enough to know the difference between this and some of McKinleys other works I think they would really enjoy this as a first book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but...","review":"...I wanted more depth, more meat to the story. Ms. McKinley's writing is always superb, but there just wasn't enough of it. I agree with the reviewer below - this would have been a great full-length novel. I'm ready for another novel about Damar! I wouldn't say this book is not for children - I would have enjoyed reading it as a 10 year old - but I think the format is a little too juvenile to appeal to a pre-teen or YA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work, and not for children.","review":"Robin McKinley is my favorite author, and I was very disappointed in this book. I bought it not only for myself, but for my kids, and let them read it first. Neither said much about it, and I was surprised until I read it myself. The story is disturbing and of sufficiently adult content that I would not categorize this as a children's book. It is also not as well-written as her other books. There were even some sentences that I had to read a few times just to get the correct meaning. I loved the illustrations, but didn't like the story. Not too many nine to twelve-year-olds will get the point of this story -- I'm not so sure I did myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordered for a friend","review":"Ordered for a friend that does not have a computer but wanted to save money and shipping.

I have the magazine, and several of her other October issues from over the years, and was disapointed that there was nothing new in this book, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.That being said, if you -DON'T- have the magazines, this is a fabulous reference and idea book. The decorating tips and recipes in this book are delightfully spooky and classy at the same time. Most of the projects in here are pretty affordable as far as materials and supplies go. I was glad to find that it wasn't filled with tons of cutesy kid's stuff. It's a 'grownups' halloween decorating book.Another reviewer said that if you could only have one halloween book, this is it. I almost agree. I wouldn't trade my copy of 'Scary Scenes For Halloween' by Jill Williams Grover for the world. If I could only have TWO halloween books, this would be my 2nd choice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great crafts, treats, costumes and more!","review":"Halloween is one of my favorite holidays and this book has some great ideas for crafts, costumes and food. One of the best halloween inspired snacks was for ladies fingers and men's toes, I brought these to a Halloween party and they were a big hit.The crafts and recipes in this book are fairly easy to make with planning. Don't try to pull anything off at the last minute. But with some planning and the right tools/ingredients you can achieve a really beautiful finished product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book","review":"This book has engaging photography and a lot of useful information pertaining to Halloween decorating and cooking. As with all Martha Stewart books and magazines, the pictures are colorful, vivid and enchanting. The ideas are exquisite and do not look cheap or tacky. Most of the projects consist of easy-to-find materials and can be done by most anyone. These ideas are, obviously, from Martha's magazine from years gone by. This book is even more useful if you wish to compartmentalize years worth of the magazine's Halloween ideas/recipes without having to search drastically for back-issues, which can be almost impossible to buy all of. I only wish there were even more pages in this book, as I can never use enough of this lady's decorating ideas for any holiday. I have no real complaints regardless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of some of Martha's Best","review":"I am a Halloween fanatic. And when I discovered that Martha Stewart was also a Halloween fanatic, I just couldn't wait to see what she would do with Halloween decorating. This book is a nice collection of some of her best or memorable projects for Halloween decorating. I think it's a great collection for someone who just wants a basic overview of how Martha does Halloween. But after getting it, I ended up hunting down several of the magazines that these projects came from. It was a lot more effort and costly than buying the book, but I'm glad I did, because the mags from which these projects come contain SO MANY more awesome projects! So, if you want a quick and affordable overview, this is a great buy. But if you really want to collect ALL of her fantastic Halloween projects, I'd say either spend the time and dough to hunt down the mags they came from, OR simply go to [...]...her website is HUGE and contains pretty much everything she has ever done! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully laid out book","review":"I bought this book for Halloween decoration ideas and this book didn't fail to disappoint. Unfortunately being an apartment-dweller, this book is geared towards people lucky enough to have a nice, big old house in New England with requisite front porch, etc. The food section provides some great ideas that go beyond candy corn and Dum-Dums, that anyone can try. It was fun just looking through the book. For those that go all out for Halloween, this is something that would be a welcome addition to their holiday deco library."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't already have the magazine....","review":"....It is a good book. Like the other reviewers, I bought Martha's Halloween magazine last year, and it has all of the same things, with only a few minor changes. I was also very dissapointed with the book, because the magazine was good and I had hoped for more of the same. So if you don't have the magazine, buy the book. If you have the magazine, save your money.... the one or two additional projects don't justify the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing more than her magazine from last year...","review":"If you bought Martha's Halloween magazine last year, PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS! It is nothing more than alot of the same idea's and pictures, except with a hefty price tag.

Everything is here, packaged so efficiently and beautifully that even die-hard Martha Mag collectors will want it.

Frankly, I'd like to know why this was produced and even distributed. The artist was out of tune most of the time and seemed to be struggling with it all. The wording of this whole album could have used some work as well, it all was just out of wack...from her search for her man to counting on her or calling out or being lonely its like what the heck?!

The battery is of good quality and will hold a charge much longer than the thin battery used in the 680. In fact it is the same battery used in the 650 so if you moved up to the 680 from the 650 just use the 650 battery. The new back is a slightly different matter. It is of much thinner plastic. Just slightly heaver than the plastic show through packaging used for many electronic equipment. It is not a smooth a fit and tends to fall off. It is hard to lock into place and even if you take extra time and attention in locking it on the phone it still tends of jar loose and fall off in the holster or your pocket. On long trips especially when I am using the radio or pod cast feature and the 680 battery dies I just take the back off and put the larger 650 battery in and I do not even bother with the flimsy easily jarred loose from back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent selection, if somewhat sterile execution","review":"Song selection is excellent and contains most of my favorites.

There is some very worthy information in this book! However, I wouldn't reccommend this book to someone who is learning about acting for the first time (like I was.) When I had performed my first monologue in class, I had received some good comments from my teacher and peers, but I was also told that I had lacked emotion in an area of the script where it should've been injected more strongly. Then again, the monologue I performed wasn't written by the brilliant David Mamet; whereby if the script is \\"that good\\", the actor can just say his/her lines and still make an impact on the audience. Overall, the book can be very effective for actors. But, again, I certainly wouldn't \\"marry\\" everything I was reading in this book if I was just starting out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This guy is horrible really.

If one is going to call one of the most respected and widely-used schools of acting a \\"cult,\\" (s)he should at least know what (s)he is talking about.Stanislavsky himself said that there is no Stanislavsky \\"system\\" (as he wanted his work to be referred -- lower-case s, quotation marks, and all), but only what works for the individual actor. Playing the action is what Stanislavsky emphasizes in ALL of his work.There is a STRONG sense of arrogance in this work. I don't understand the \\"lines on a page\\" part with no character -- it seems to produce an extremely shallow view of acting. There has to be a difference between what a 3rd-grader and a seasoned professional can do on stage. It has nothing to do with how well you read, in case you were wondering."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"very true, no BS account on what exactly should be the actor's work. highly recommend to directors and actors who are afraid of scr#$^g an opportuniy in tyhe big screen.mammet knows his stuff. from the 3 books on cinema and drama, this is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much heresy and little common sense for the actor.","review":"Mamet is a playwright and a very good one at that. And from the perspective of a playwright, he has written a book for the actor (and the director, and even the waiter or waitress that may serve him dinner in his favorite restaurant). While some may find the book interesting, it offers very little common sense for the actor. In fact, much of Mamet's advice is out right bad! This book is nothing more than an angry playwright ranting and railing against bad actors, bad directors, and anyone else who may have aggravated him along the way. If you're an actor, read the book to be amused but please don't take any of his advice to heart. It will do you a disservice."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Respect For Acting","review":"Mamet has no respect for actors.

However, I am in agreement that he calls the Method hogwash mostly to enrage Strasberg and Meisner gurus (of which there are many--and it's like the Jets and the Sharks--there's all this competition as to the \\"right\\" way of acting.Mamet's idea of boiling down to the essense of what an actor does (which is not bringing his emotional problems to the audience) is valid and should be taken into consideration--however, he says that in the first chapter and in every subsequent chapter.

If you commit to the book as you do our craft, you will come out with a much better understanding of what this acting thing is all about.If you're looking for feel-good puffery, don't get this book.

She said that it is harsh and you cannot take what Mamet says personally, but it is valuable. I was amazed at how simply he trashes the ideas of the old schools of acting and suggests a more practical and accessible way to work as an actor. It's something that children can do.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in real acting and not just intellectualizing the simple yet difficult craft. It is also a must for anyone who wants to direct.I do however give the same warning that I was given. It is harsh and you cannot take it personal.

And it isn't. While the first book, Star, was fun and frothy and made some sense, this one seems rushed to print and because of that, doesn't flow, doesn't connect and just is in no way believable. Half the fun of the first book was trying to figure out who everyone was in Anderson's roman a clef.

Once Jimi and Star had their abrupt meeting with an unwelcome photographer, it just went down hill from there. I did not like the character of Jimi at all!! In Pamela Anderson's first book Star, Star Wood Leigh was a loveable character with a lot of zing! In Star Struck, Jimi turned out to be a self-centered, spoiled, immature, perverted a**hole and took Star down with him. I was hoping the second book would be as fun as the first, but I was terribly disappointed. It was as though Pam Anderson just quickly threw the ending together just to get it done and over with. I did not feel the energy at the end. It wasn't even original! I was never a Pam Anderson fan untill I read her first book. I thought the second book would be just as good.

Otherwise i find it very uncomfortable. The front of the seat pushes up against the back of my legs so it's pretty bad for circulation. The cushion is really thin and you can feel the wood inside, which will crack fairly easily if you lean to the side even slightly. My back hurts if I sit in it for more than 2 or 3 hours at a time because it's not really ergonomically curved for any sort of support. All in all it's a great deal if you just want something to sit on for 30 minute sessions but if you spend a lot of time sitting on a day to day basis you really should get something nicer for your own health."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow. $50 for a leather chair?! oh wait.","review":"Looks good and is cheap.

Great deal for an accessory that is overlooked often."},{"rating":"1","title":"A badly written mess","review":"I live in Florida. I knew a lot about this case prior to reading this book. Not only was this book full of misleading information (Goths and Vampires are not one and the same) it tries to make Heather into some poor misguided little girl who never had any idea something was wrong. I can buy that peer pressure made this girl do what she did, but Jones never really explores that avenue. She goes from telling us that Heather thought this was all a goof to being a shell shocked, pathetic figure who can't figure how what's up. How did she get from one end of the spectrum to the other? Jones doesn't tell us.Almost every paragraph had a word or three in italics, Jones way of pointing out that this little bit of information was important. If her writing was better, she wouldn't need to highlight the important information by putting it in italics. She's also be able to give a deeper story into what happened instead of this shallow waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LOT OF FALSE STATEMENTS IN THIS BOOK","review":"I AM A TEENAGER FROM EUSTIS, FL AND I WAS A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN ALL THIS HAPPENED.

I was sorely disappointed to discover the accounts of the events very chronologically confusing and disconnected as if all the facts and interviews were \\"shuffled\\" like a deck of cards. Ms. Jones jumps back and forth between different characters perspective in a highly redundant fashion. Imagine the flow of the movie GROUNDHOG DAY with Bill Murray, only on a morbid level. Only when the group was apprehended by the authorities did the storyline take on a more direct, focussed approach. I did enjoy the depth to which Ms. Jones was willing to take the reader into the minds of the characters so that they might fully understand the power of peer pressure and isolation."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Roderick, not Rodney.","review":"This author clearly has not done even basic research on this case or she would at least know the correct name for the focus of her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure crap","review":"Let me give you the idea of how this book flows.#1: Rod does something horrible.#2: Rod tells all his followers that he is something .#3: Rod does something weird.#4: Rod explains that he is something else than #2.Ok, next paragraph, start over. This sums up about the first 320 pages of this book. I have no idea how this actually was published. The story, while being an interesting one, is horribly told in this book. There is a lot of stuff that the author just threw in the book that does not fit in the story, make sense, or is absolutely meaningless. I'm glad I paid $0.01 for this book and not full cover price.Aphrodite Jones may be able to \\"look terror right in the eye\\" as the back of the book says, but she sure didn't know how to tell about it with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"The book was way too long but interesting.

It felt as if the story just dragged on an on in her own words. There wasn't much of quotes from the experienced lives. You had to understand from the writers point of view and not the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Embrace is deep","review":"The Embrace by Aphrodite Jones was a great book. I really had no clue at all about the story before i read the book. Not only did she do a good job on the book, it almost made me think she made things up by all the interviewing she did. There are so many facts in this book that she must have spents years getting them together. Aphrodite Jones wrote the book so good about Rod Ferrell and his clan that i felt that i was right there and living what they were living. Over all this book is great, if you like true crime books you got to get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a must read!","review":"I read this book in about a day, not that it is short but I was so engrossed in the lives of Rod Ferrell and his groupies.

Her writing is bad--want to read a real true crime story, try Capote's \\"In Cold Blood.\\" I get real tired of the \\"roleplaying games are evil\\" media craze. These teens were sick. Roleplayers and roleplaying games are not subverting the youth of America-- parents who let TV babysit their kids are. Maybe the whole true crime genre is down the tubes. This book is for paranoid, bored housewives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story, Incorrect Information","review":"This made a great story and I couldn't put it down... until I talked with some of the real people involved. The problem is she takes the facts and adds her own opionion to it, mixing up the truth. Though this is based on a true story, her version is 75% fiction. If you want a version based on Pure facts, try Linedecker's version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensationalism and nothing else.","review":"Aphrodite Jones immediately seeks scapegoats to blame these murders on. She finds roleplaying games and music and she sticks to them as the main reason that these tragic events happened. Jones is not a criminal psychologist, she is a tabloid reporter and this book makes that fact apparent over and over again. It starts with a poor premise and that premise is poorly executed. I recommend you spend your time and money elsewhere. I got this book at a dollar store and I spent a dollar too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, I just woke up","review":"I picked this book up because I thought it would be interesting to find out what was in the mind of Rod Ferrell. What I got instead was a wasted $7. Ms. Jones is a very poor writer. The first 150 pages or so kept repeating the same things over and over again. I can't count how many times she wrote that Charity drank Rod's blood. Hello, we get the point. By the time I got to the actual crime itself, I was already frustrated with her lack of narrative and any semblance of chronological order.I do agree with some of the reviewers who said this book portrays kids who role play as bad seeds. I think this is a gross generalization. I also agree with the reviewer who said that it appears as if Ms. Jones was in a hurry to finish the book.I wouldn't waste my money on this one if you can help it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"I'm pretty sure Aphrodite Jones interviewed the players thoroughly as the ideas she managed to write down in detail could only come from the minds of juveniles who have watched too many bad movies and played too many video games.What the reader gets is an in-depth look at a group of nit-wits, murderous nit-wits, certainly, but nit-wits none-the-less.Avoid this one. I'm really only giving it .02 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER SLAP AT ROLEPLAYING","review":"This book is yet another attempt to attack role- playing, making it the latest bugbear of the Christian Right(after rock music). It's also an attack on Goths, with little or no true information on what \\"Goth\\" is(like last year's media misinformation campaign after Columbine). Pass on this piece of fluff and pick up any White Wolf Games sourcebook, to see what role- playing truly means. Or read PIERCING THE DARKNESS by Katherine Ramsland, which takes a fairer look at roleplayers and Real Vampyres."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing topic handled in a pedestrian manner.","review":"I kept wondering when the author was going to achieve some narrative and structural focus.

But I never gave a damn about any of the people not even the victims."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I really wantred to enjoy this book. But I couldn't get into it. I remembner when the events of this book happened. It was so strange. The kid was really a weird looking dude. And I couldn't belive the hold he had over these other kids. When someone is sitting cutting their wrist and other people it's time to call in the men with the nets. This could have been avoided..if his mother had called the police when he attacked her with a kitchen knife. But as much as the writer tried to get me into the story, it was just too many charactors to keep up with, and she seemed to ramble on and on about the blood drinking, instead of sticking with the FACTS of the story. I found it Borning. Too Bad! Could have been a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books ever","review":"This is perhaps one of the worst written books ever published.

However, this collar also has an unbraided portion, which is the weakest link in this case. The braided part is strong enough (although not as strong as the Walmart leash we had) but beyond that, the unbraided portion was flimsy. Not only would the end of the collar beyond the buckle keep slipping out, but the rings on the unbraided portion would break off and that portion would start to fray, so we had to replace it because the collar was slipping off every time our dog pulled hard on it when leashed.I could see this collar lasting longer for a small dog, but we have a strong 60-lb dog that will pull against the leash sometimes and this collar just couldn't withstand that."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment","review":"I own 10 of these Dover CD ROMs, and this one will not read.

Some attacks are the original Japanese ones while others are the DIC version. Why is it so hard to get it right? I wonder what they will do when they reach the later episodes and try to invent new people's names and places and clothing brands.

The one saving grace of the film was a short Benny Hill segment that was very well done, and actually got a chuckle out of me.The second movie on this DVD, Filthy McNasty, was actualy better then Mulva, but still lacked the charm I would have liked.

I really wanted to give Mulva Zombie ass kicker a chance and I appreciate it's tribute to Troma, Romero, & Savini but that doesn't justify the lame dialog and lack of any real splatter. Bottom Line the gore is sparse and ill timed,the dialog & humor is awful. Mulva talks like a wigger if you can even understand her due to her \\"humorous\\" speech impediment.

These movies are the kind of thing you and your buddies might shoot on your college campus if you ran around with a camcorder for a few weeks. If you like buying fan-made videos at cons, you might go for these. Briefly, on that level, the main feature, \\"Mulva\\", is good for some silly laughs.

BUT, Mulva is so terrible, it's fun to watch so it's a must for a bad movie night. From the screechingly irritating \\"star\\" (who makes me long for Jar Jar Binks) to the laughably inappropriate ska music (did the director have friends in a ska band?) it's a riot. On the other hand, \\"Filthy McNasty\\" isn't so enjoyable. Possibly a so-bad-it's-good, but marginal at that. I won't even bother with the plot as by writing this review I've put more thought into these movies than the people associated with them ever did.BTW, these look like home movies, and you can literally make a better one by getting a bunch of friends together, a camcorder, and spending $20.

NHL 2004 is the best ever. All the players are very realistic and, for once, they actually do realistic things. You can see the snow spray from their skates from stopping. It took me a while to get used to the new controls, but once you get it, it's great. (you may want to get a logitech dual action controller, so you can use the Bruise Control).The music is very cool. The only problem I have is the fighting. I think that it is a great idea and very realistic, but I can never seem to win a fight, but mabye that's just me. A great game all around.

And over. AND OVER.Otherwise, it's lots of fun. It's always nice to see well-endowed bald gay Sicilian police detectives who speak nothing but German represented in the movies. In a lot of ways, and not just the rubber from hell, this movie is surreal; the fact that it's shot ON LOCATION in New York...with an all-German cast is just the START. Furthermore, it's obviously been written in Germany, because it feels a lot like a foreigner trying to be American in the script.Still, the gags are immortal and some of the one-liners are hysterical (\\"It's...It's...\\" \\"It's exactly 30.6 centimeters long.\\") Pick up, especially if you love sick humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"(Almost) A Cult Classic","review":"What shocked me about Killer Condom was that it exceeded its low-budget expectations with a surprisingly intelligent and touching love story.

A detective with \\"special talents\\", religious cultists, a drag queen and on and on and on. Is there a plot? I suppose there might be but the film is to busy exploiting the freaky characters and going for cheap laughs than trying to further something like a story. When some reason for the madness in the city is finally revealed, you don't know whether to laugh or throw your popcorn at the screen.You'd be well to remember ... is ..., no matter how you dress it up.

I agree with another reviewer--pick it at the library if you're curious."},{"rating":"1","title":"This gruel shows blatant hatred for Halloween fans","review":"This dreck is cynical and unredeeming - not even entertaining in a slasher-flick sense. The problem arises when producers wish to keep the Michael Myers gravytrain rolling but have no course on which to set it. John Carpenter established that Myers was pure evil - and that worked within the relentless context of the first film. But as time goes by (and movies get made), the excuses for bringing back Myers become not only silly, but so unimaginative as to show a complete disregard for the money-paying public. \\"Curse of MM\\" has no creative core - only producers and distributers after a quick buck. It's a shame, because Michael Myers started out a pretty good kid. Now look what he's turned into. Beware this movie and return to the source. \\"Halloween\\" is still the scariest movie you can put into your VCR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Beats the Original!","review":"Alright. By now everyone has heard all there is to hear about Halloween 6. Everything negative that is. Since I am a dedicated Halloween fan, I did enjoy this movie. However, I had to watch it a few times to truly enjoy it. I am a longtime fan of Donald Pleasence and this movie just seemed to be the last thing that Pleasence really wanted to do. One thing that I truly enjoyed about this movie, although it was a very sad thing, was seeing the movie dedicated to the memory of Donald Pleasence. I wish that I saw more done on the life of Donald Pleasence. Overall, if you are a true die hard fan of Michael Myers, you should enjoy this movie. If you are not a major Halloween fan, this movie is not for you. On a side note, when is the so-called Producer's Cut going to be released. From what I have heard, the Producer's Cut sounds ten times better than the current home video version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Better than Michael Myers?","review":"Halloween, the quentisential slasher franchise, often forgotten by mainstream movie fans due to the fame of such franchises as Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th, yet so much better. Halloween 6 is by far the best of the later Halloweens (the ones proceeding 3) The acting is very well done, the cinematography is good as well as the storyline. This one brings Halloween back to it's roots, with the return of Tommy Doyle( the boy from the first one) and Dr. Loomis as the main heroes. Plus it brings Michael Back to being a killer period, no lovey dovey like in 5 with his niece, just straight out killing people, the way we love it. Granted the movie isn't that scary but it's a Halloween so it's great. It beats the living hell out of H20 and that's for sure. So my advice for you is to buy this movie because it is actually a movie that can be watched and rewatched many times over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come home Jason Vorhees, all is forgiven.","review":"One of the worst of a bad lot. Boasting merit for an explanation behind Michael Myers(and the explanation is so lame, you'll think you could make a better one with a ten second brainstorming session),this inscipient slasher offers absoloutley no scares, surprizes, thrills, or even laughs. You can predict exactly when, where, and how the killer will make his appearence with 90% accuracy. This movie doesn't contain an ounce of life. I suppose you could watch it if you're really bored and would like a laugh, but don't tell me I didn't warn you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated sequel that's not perfect but very enjoyable.","review":"Halloween 6 was considered as an offence to fans of the series and as an unworthy sequel.

The only reasons I gave this 4 stars is beacause Michael looked his best in this movie(mask, size, etc...) AND because the bootleg Directors cut that's circulating is perhaps the best and most interesting movie of the ENTIRE series, YES, I believe its better than number one. SO, I think you should check ebay for the Producers cut of this flick, the Audio/Video has little to be desired but the Film is a Halloween Masterpiece, with everything from the soundtrack, to the ending being different from the commercial release."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The best one I've seen yet...\\"","review":"Being the sixth movie in the popular HALLOWEEN franchise, featuring a masked homicidal named Michael Myers, who started off chasing his sister and moved on to his neice. Now I won't spoil anything, but the beginning is extremely cool and freaky and the ending was so perfect, I don't think, with the exception of every single FRIDAY THE 13TH film and JEEPERS CREEPERS, any other movie of this kind could have such a perfect ending. There is only one thing I don't understand, why does Michael Myers keep taking his mask off at the end? Why don't they ever show his face (they did in the first one, though)? Where does he keep getting his new masks?

There is also the stupid subplot of the Man In Black and Thorn which is Michael's evil. The Producer's Cut explains a lot more. It is gory, it is a kill-fest, and the plot is weak-- (thanks a lot Halloween 5, you just destroyed the series.

There are some redeeming characters, but it is so obvious they're going through tired motions.The setting and mood was excellent. John Carpenter should be extremely proud of his little piano notes. They keep you attentive. The film feels as though it as an artificial gloss, and it is distracting. But it looks nice. The blood and deaths are real, except the electrocution.

Not only is it slow paced, but just so 90's and unoriginal. The kid, Tommy, in this movie is obsessed with Michael and does the whole locked in his room and has every article ever written on him thing. Always looking out his room with his bionoculars. Such nonsense. After like a week he would get bored of that. But this kid has done it for like 10 years. Not only that, but Jaime was apparently dirty and was having a baby. Also, I don't like how Michael was caught by a satanistic cult, nor about the whole thing with aligning his evil to the stars. The whole movie is just nonsense. Really. This movie and the Rob Zombie Halloween 2 movie..just...no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull & Dumb, Bad Combination","review":"The acting is stale, the plot is awful. The Man In Black was a piece of crap and the Michael and his mask is again not scary but more funny than anything.

This one is the worst in the franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD BAD","review":"If you can locate the producers cut of this movie I here thats better. What we have here is a mess.

This movie is not only boring, it doesn't even try to be consistent with it's past sequels. What happened to Dr. Loomis's Scars on his face and hands? Why is Michael so big and brawny now? Why do they change the Shape's mask in every movie? This movie makes Jason X look like an Oscar winner!

Perfect blend of gore and story-line."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE SUCKS","review":"I liked it much better when Michael Myers was just a lunatic who would not die.

H20 is much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste","review":"I attempted to watch this film when it was released in theatres back in 1995...I bailed with only 20 minutes left of the film and got a refund. Over ten years later, I finally viewed the producers cut and compared the two...although the producers cut is a masterpiece compared to the theatrical release, the damage had already been done by the horrible Halloween 5. I can truly say I am only a fan of Halloween, Halloween II, and Halloween H20, the true Halloween trilogy. Those are the only ones I own on DVD. Halloween 4 was actually good but I just can't view it the same way as when it was first released since 5 & 6 all but buried the series...sad to see Donald Pleasence go out this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Shelf","review":"Great addition to the series.

I don't think so! The 1st Halloween worked so well because of it's lack of gore and it was very suspenseful. Now, it seems the more gore a movie has, the scarier it is. What a shame. True fans of Halloween will agree with me. Not \\"hardcore fans\\" who like a movie with blood and guts but no plot. The man in black turned out to be Dr. Wynn. Who in the hell is this guy? He is in the original for about 5 seconds and now pops up all of the sudden? And where in the hell was Tommy Doyle at in Parts 4 &5? If he is so obsessed with Michael, then how come we don't see him until now? And you mean to tell me that the Strode family is living in the Myers house and don't EVEN know it's the Myers house?

I try to give sequels as much credit as possible. Halloween's 2,3,&4 were respectable sequels that helped keep the franchise going for two decades. However, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is one I would rather forget about. This is the worst sequel in the series just behind Halloween 5. The beginning is vague and pointless while the ending is a complete disaster. The movie thrives on extreme gore, which is not something Halloween has used in the past. The original is practically bloodless and yet considered a classic. The film tries to introduce a reason behind Michael Myers' evil ways which only complicates the story even more. One good thing about this film is that it can be left out of the series and you wouldn't even miss it. Trust this Halloween fan, this movie stinks from beginning to end. Thank goodness Steve Minor was able to salvage the series with Halloween H20!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh!","review":"I am a huge Halloween fan, but even I was disappointed with this entry. It made me believe that, had he lived, Donald Pleasence would have appeared in Halloween XXIII. The guy would make any movie, and for Halloween all he needs is the overcoat and a gun, so he can run around screaming, 'HE HAS RETURNED! HE IS EVIL INCARNATE!' Gotta love Donald, though. Anyway, this flick is a clinker. We waited 6 years for this! Doh! Pure cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm CLUELESSLY in love with Paul!","review":"Good movie.

That single mother doesn't have to worry about being single anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing","review":"Worn out slasher movie produced by John Carpenter which in my opinion is an insult to the Halloween series as a whole. The storyline is terrible. Jamie's body is found and her relatives must protect her baby. This film was made in memory of the late Donald Pleasance who died in 1996. Couldn't they have honoured in some better way?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the kind of movie that causes remakes.","review":"Thank God H20 was released and saved this series, for a bit, because Halloween Cure of Michael Myers is the worse Halloween movie of the series. Halloween 5 was even better than this one. Although if you ignore the story and only watch Michael do his thing, he is quiet violent and should please slasher fans on that level. Other than this, the whole \\"Michael kills because of a cult,\\" is way to cheesy. I think Jason Voorhees being brought back to life by lightening (Friday the 13th, part 6) was more serious than this. Blamming a cult is so clich��, and has been done to many times.So if you are a huge fan or the series, buy it for your collection. If you only like the first two, or the new ones, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCARIEST HALLOWEEN EVER!!!","review":"This is the scariest one is the series. Most people hate this one because it explains why michael kills a reveals the cult that is behind all his madness.

H2O wasn't bad either. and season of the witch is good, just don't expect myers to be in it. watch it as if it was NOT part of the halloween series and you will have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good addition to the Halloween series","review":"I suppose this movie was ok but only because of Donald Pleasance, but the fact that they made Michael Myers some kind of demon was outrageous. I liked Myers more than any other famous slasher because he was actually a human. No they made him into a demon? Crazy. I would not buy it, I would only rent it for the sole purpose that it is Donald Pleasence's last performance. One last thing, they substited real scares for blood and gore. The original was by far, the scariest and it had little to no onscreen violence. I would reccomend Halloween: H20 instead of Halloween 6. Halloween H20 delievers the real scares."},{"rating":"1","title":"it aint that bad","review":"ok look michael myers is my fav ceriel killin dude or watever they call it in that genre. when i saw the movie it really is a waste of time. its not very good at all compared to other halloween movies. and for horror fans this movie is not worth time. it aint scary. after tha movie was over i was like ...... is that a halloween movie?? but for serious fans like me for this series u must atleast c it once although its not good. and its about time that old guy dies. the ending was also crummy. tha only good part is wen tha guy gets electricuted. i wouldve gave this movie 3 stars instead of 2 but on tha front cover it said best halloween movie ever. so i gave it a score lower for quoting stupid stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say I liked it","review":"One of the better of the sequels,this movie explains micheals origin Im not going to say much on the count of spoiling the suprise but I will tell you this, Micheal raises more hell in this movie than in any of the others put together.

You can just see him looking out into the audience saying \\"This is awful.\\" Also, I haven't seen this much gore or killing in a long time. I think more people die in this movie, than in 1, 4, & H20 combined! This movie is similar to \\"Halloween 2\\" in the gore catergory.

By no means the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Bad as Halloween 3","review":"Okay , this is the not the worst of the Halloween movies , but it is the worst of the ones with Michael Myers in them.

They really messed the series up big time with this one. First of all, a lot of things don't make any sense. Who is supposed to be the father of Jamie's baby? What is up with the ending altogether?? Who is that screaming? I think what makes this film so bad is that they killed Jamie off. Then they introduced some characters that no one really cares about or would even remember. Tommy Doyle?

END"},{"rating":"1","title":"curse of the producers missing cut","review":"I've seen both versions and suggest skipping them both (along with Halloween 5) unless you just can't help yourself.Pros for \\"The Curse of Michael Myers\\": better pacing; some of The Shape's (George Wilbur's) more intimidating moves are in the \\"new\\" ending which makes up the last 17 minutes of this version.Pros for \\"The Producer's Cut\\": I personally enjoyed the \\"origin\\" of Michael Myers presented in this version (even though the movie was slow); although I felt really bad about Dr. Loomis' fate at the end, I enjoyed Michael's escape.Neither origin really adds much to the story line and the end of the theatrical version is pathetic. At the end of The Producer's Cut you may wonder if Michael is off to continue his pranks or is done killing. Guess H20 answered that question...Happy Halloween"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! Stupid Movie!","review":"This is one of the worst films ever made. The story and characters are so unbeliveable and evn worse, as other reviewers stated, there are scenes in a DVD that is not availible on Amazon that are not present here! That is so stupid! Can't studios nowadays make a decent definitive edittion of a movie. Take my advice and stick with the true Halloween trilogy: 1, 2, and 7. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked","review":"Man, what a disapointing sequel, well, all of the sequels were disappointing except 2, I mean they killed off Jamie-lee Curtis and the neice or whatever, so what do they have, a guy who won't die, killing people, no creativity there"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is a smash hit !","review":"I personally think Halloween h2o was the best of them all even better than part 6. If anyone really and truly wants to know part one told the story but never said why he killed his sister.In fact I don't think any of the halloween films indicated why Michael killed his oldest sister when he was six years old I mean maybe it was a curse but like Halloween part one said Michael this six yaer old boy was just standing there holding a knife in his hands.If you just take one look at his eyes you'll see the evil,his eyes are as black as the devil's heart itself.This guy is the devil!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary. But that is it.","review":"In the 6th of this series Mike is back (And with a differentmask again) to kill his Family. This time he has targeted theStrodes. A Jerry Springer family that consists of a knife wheilding son a Psycho father a Gang member brother and a Stupid but nice mother. Scary. But nothing more. It fails to give Halloween any dignity and disgraces Michael Myers by linking him to the druids. Worth a rent and a must for fans. Pretty Violent stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Moustapha Akkad, this one is the worse of em all","review":"I happen to be a person who likes all kinds of movies, and who somehow feels intrigued by Michael Myers since the original Halloween. The story was a good one in the first two parts, the third was a total shame, 4 and 5, in my opinion really topped the first two... Danielle Harris was great. Now for the 6th part, they didn't reach the price of Danielle Harris and she doesn't even appear, plus the story is a total fraud... it tries to make it look more \\"commercially understandable\\" with this stuff about the \\"curse\\", I mean... Get real... fortunately H20 is a lot better.I have to admit one thing: The soundtrack rocks, one of the best for halloween, and quite different. Plus the photography is somewhat interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Bad As Everyone Makes It Out To Be","review":"There are a lot of things about this movie that cloud the storylines, but some things that other reviewers slam are explained. Michael impregnated Jamie to create a final sacrifice. I think he planned to kill Jamie and then the baby. He tracks down the Strodes, who happen to be living in his former home, thinking that they have the baby since he can't find him after he kills Jamie (by the way, I wonder what Michael would have named the baby), since they would be related to Jamie through Laurie. That's what the call that Mrs. Strode gets saying \\"we want the child\\" is about. I'm not sure how the cult kept Michael for so long, but I think that's why he does away with them, possibly avenging himself for their using him. There are holes in the story, such as why the fetuses are shown, but Michael is at his menacing best here and the gore factor is off the charts. All in all a good horror flick that shouldn't be controversial, just enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael ROCKS!!! Awesume movie out of the Halloween series.","review":"This is certainly one of the best out of the Halloween series. Sadly though this is the last time you get to see Donald Pleasance as Dr. Samual Loomis which unfortnately he passed away in the early 90s. In this series, Michael Myers returns after 6 years persumed dead in a fire. The killings begin again, one by one where he starts off hunting for his niece's baby and then heads back home to Haddonfield where is reign of terror continues.The horror ends up all the way back to Smith's Grove.Personally i love all the Halloween movies, and this is one of them that i enjoyed, particluary with Michael's killing (expecially towards the surgeons at Smith Grove) & movements which i find really creepy.5/5 The saga continues with the return of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in the next series in H20.I recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cash Grab For Echo Bridge","review":"Attention Amazon.com customers....1. Avoid this release like the plague. This Blu-ray Disc only has the movie and nothing else. LITERALLY! No subtitles, no trailer, no anything.2. The picture is subpar for a high-definition transfer.

It was not worth waiting 6 years after the previous halloween. It did not seem like the director thought about what he was doing. First of all Jamie is suppose to be 15, when it appears that she is in her twenties. Second there was no point in putting all new characters such as Kara Strode and John Strode. There was also no point of bringing Tommy Doyle back. All this movie explains is the cult thorn. Which is why Michael go's after his family members. It is not hard to figure out that Dr. Wynn is Michaels Father. The only reason this junk gets two stars is because Dr. Loomis is in it and the director some how manages it to be scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"What CRAP!","review":"This movie was horrible, but had a few good scenes.

I fell in love with Ms. Kelly's writing style at that time. She doesn't write a book that I wouldn't give to my girls to read. After reading The Lady's Companion, I decided to try her other books and became hooked. I then put forth the effort to get a hold of all of her works. I finally got this book, Daughter of Fortune, through Amazon's out-of-print books department. At first I was disappointed (this was before I read the book) because it wasn't a Regency romance but I decided to read it anyway. I fell in love with it and now it is one of my favorite works by this author. I think Ms. Kelly is one of those unsung authors that write excellent prose but the publishing companies want more flash than style. This book is extremely well written and historically accurate. I would recommend this book to anybody.

As readers who loved this book warn, she places her characters in perilous times, well she often does that. At the end of the opening journey our heroine discovers she is homeless and friendless. She soon finds herself living in a complex social structure that defines for life the circumstances and struggles of the people around her. In this story her characters have none of the inventive opportunities or escapes we find in other Kelly stories. Not even Carla Kelly could interest me in this set-up, so I put DAUGHTER OF FORTUNE up for sale online and felt like a fraud. I say YES, to most Carla Kelly, but NO the newer Mormon stories and a strong NO to DAUGHTER OF FORTUNE."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIP: Wear cotton underneath","review":"To avoid them getting stanky, cut the toe out of an old cotton sock and wear that underneath.

They are VERY comfortable, with the exception of the fabric between the thumb and forefinger, which is poorly designed and always causes a bit of agitation. Yes, these gloves will make your hands sweat, and no, the gloves do not get smelly (at least not from nighttime only use). To find the correct size, cut a piece of string and wrap it around your wrist at the hand. Measure on a ruler, and that's the size you need. I measured my wrist at 8 1/2\\", and I ordered the large size, since it said up to 8 3/4\\". They fit absolutely perfectly. Having the metal bar on the bottom and top of the hand is great, because I tend to flex my wrist both ways while sleeping.

I hoped for years that the Jack Benny version would be revived at some point, and was delighted when it became available, only to have my dreams shattered by what I should have expected, sly comedy turned into broadly coarse burlesque. Benny, with the right director, such as Lubitsch, was capable of great comedy, but in this, the effort of pushing the point that Benny was really a butch male and couldn't have a gay bone in his body turned the comedy to coarsness which undermines an otherwise splendid cast, including Kay Francis looking her best and most charming...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Benny Comedy","review":"Ordered early for requested birthday gift, this DVD arrived in a timely manner but when played, skipped in several places but too late for refund.

He loves to play with this table and it is sturdy and durable from everything I can see. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fun but it LEAKS...","review":"I cannot recommend this toy because it LEAKS. My 21 month-old daughter really likes it, but the lower pool began leaking after only a few weeks and we have to put a bucket under it to collect the water. To make matters worse, the legs DO NOT come off once they're on, so we can't even box it up to return it! I tried everything to get the legs off without breaking the toy and it just isn't possible. Overall just a bad experience, clearly some reviewers haven't had this problem but you're taking a chance if you buy the table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great water table!","review":"My daughter recently received this water table for her 1st birthday. She absolutely loves it! She plays with it - whether there's water in it or not. I've seen some other water tables that are unnecessarily large; this one seems to be just the right size for her!There are two downsides to this water table: 1.) the water wheel does not attach to the table; it is easily knocked over. 2.) the toys are lacking; the boats are three pieces each. Within a minute of assembly (no lie), my daughter pulled them back into pieces. I'm not sure why these couldn't have been made as a solid structure. I have added some additional toys for her to play with.As a whole, my daughter just loves splashing around in the water. The \\"issues\\" that I find with the table don't impact her fun what-so-ever. Overall, this was a great gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"My mom bought this for my 5 year old daughter and 2 year old son, and they absoultly love it. The first day they played with it for 2 hours and I had to force them in the house. They now ask to play with the water table everyday as soon as they get out of bed.They love to pour water into the tower and make the paddle spin. I do wish it had more toys and the boats tend to sink, but for $30 I'm not complaining too much.So if your on the fence about wheather or not to get this toy, take the plunge and make the purchase you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun but it leaks ...","review":"I bought this toy for my granddaughter for her 2nd birthday. She LOVES it. But one of the plugs leaks badly and my daughter is afraid it will mark the deck. I understand there are replacement plugs and I need to figure out how to get hold of one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, leaks and more leaks!","review":"We purchased this table for my 18 month old daughter. She had a blast playing with the table, loved making the water wheel turn. The problemn was that the table leaked, and leaked and then leaked some more. I called customer service and was told to use vaseline until I received my replacement plugs. The vaseline trick worked for all of 15 minutes and then it was leaking again. Finally received the replacement plugs and they did not fix the leaking problem. I ended up having to return the water table. I hated doing having to return it since my daughter enjoyed playing it so much but the leaking was so excessive that it was just not worth it. We ended up getting a water table by Little Tikes and have had a much better experience with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN","review":"This toy allows my water loving 0ne year old to play in water to her heart's content. Its possibilities will grow with her over the next couple of years. Children ages one to seven were gathered around playing in it at the birthday party. I would definitely buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great water table!","review":"My 14 month old LOVES this table! It is easy to move from inside to outside. It sits low enough to the ground and it comes to about waist high on my toddler. Helps with the improvement of gross motor skills. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice, sturdy toy","review":"My husband and I bought this toy for our kids last summer as a compliment to their sandbox. They absolutely loved it! They enjoyed playing with the boats and the water wheel and kept them cool on those hot summer days. It's pretty sturdy, too and the toys that come with it are made of a good, solid material. I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple yet fun, just add water & kids!","review":"I bought this for my 18 month old to use on our deck since he didn't like the swimming pool. He had a blast with this! The dipping cup is perfect sized, the water wheel begs to be played with, the there are no plugs to get pulled out & accidentially drained. It is very sturdy & safe. We put sand in it during colder weather but take off the water wheel, as it doesn't work well with sand even if you take off the blue reservoir on top. The sand just gets into the wheel and stops it from spinning freely. But it makes a great sand table without it! You can do sand & water on separate sides of the table since there is a divider.I have no complaints at all with this table! Perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best water table ever","review":"This is a great thing for children. My little one loves it in fact we have 2 one for home and one for grandmas it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, great price","review":"Alot of water tables out there, but this one is durable, easy to put together and the waterwheel is a great feature. The price was great too and you cant beat having i delivered right to your front door! Comes with a few cute toys too. Until we cleaned our deck we set it up in the den and our daughter loved playing with it even without water so whal-lah it became a multi-seasonal purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor quality","review":"Great idea...was so excited for my one year old grandson to play with...however he was a little small yet so 4 yr old sister played with it. She enjoyed it while it lasted...didn't last long, bottom cracked and wouldn't hold water. Still a great idea. Just need to make it with a more durable plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!","review":"This water table is great for the price! We paid $25 for it and my daughter loves it. The only thing I can say that I do not care for is that it has no drain. I understand that there isn't one so the kids don't pull it out; I'm sure there is a way of making a child proof plug. The toys that come with it are decent we added a few of our own as well. The height of the table is perfect for my one year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Play Table!","review":"My 3yr old daughter loves this! I wish I would have bought it when she was younger so she could get more time out of it. I think she will still play with it for a while, she just might have to sit on a chair. (too tall)Great toy, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Water Play Table","review":"We liked this toy and got much use from it over the summer in the backyard for my 2-year old son. The accessories that came with it were good. The kids also used Fisher-Price Little People and made a \\"water park\\" for them in the table. Plenty of room for imaginitive play with this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful water toy! A must have!","review":"My 17 month old little girl absolutelyloves this toy. We play outside in texas heat for ours with it, I have added more cups and some fun fish to play with. She would stay out there all day. Its easy to empty and so easy to clean. I am so glad we have it. It sure keeps us cool!The water wheel is so easy to use and she loves watching it spin. Lots of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to clean","review":"I purchased the water table and sand table separately because I knew that my 3-year old would not be able to resist mixing sand and water. I don't blame him. I liked this water table because I could just dump out the dirty water when the kids were done and refill it with clean. That would be hard to do with a combination table. The kids love the water wheel that turns and the ramp for the boats. The only fault that I can find with it is that the legs are really short. It sits low to the ground even for a 3-year old. They usually just make do with it or sit ina couple of plastic chairs while they play. Over all I think it is a good purchase for water play."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad plastic","review":"returned it in a day.. the plastic is horrible.. the boats wont even float.. the wheel tower does not stay upright.. i would rather pay 10dollars more,.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!","review":"My 2 y old almost drawn in this table. Not saying it's not a good toy but you have to watch your child every second. Thank God I did.. She just got it and was playing with it and suddenly I saw her head stuck in the deep part of the table with her legs up..My daughter is not disabled or stupid in any way. She was reaching for the toy and slipped. It just happened. So it's not a safe toy! The boats that the company provides with it are a joke. They don't float at all.You have to buy your own toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"I got this for my 16 month old twin boys. All they do is try to climb on top of it. One of them actually got on top, and it tipped over, and he hit his head. If you buy this, make sure it is on a soft surface. I do not recommend it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very exciting and it does not have a lid!","review":"I saw this water table at the store and I must say that it was not very exciting. The water funnel is the best part of the table and even that is just okay. The table does not have a lid, which is a serious negative to a water table. I don't want my kids playing with this inside because they will make a mess, but if they play with it outside, then I have no way to cover it. It will definitely get all gross being outside in the bad weather. Leaves, bugs, dirt and who knows what else will get into this table. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Disappointing Purchase","review":"After reading tons of rave reviews on this toy I was very excited to go purchase one for my 2 1/2 year old daughter for the summer. She already has a Step 2 ladybug sandbox that she absolutely loves so I figured this would be a good addition...WRONG! My daughter shows very little interest in it at all and the only thing she does use it for is to climb inside of it and try to use it as a swimming pool which of course isn't very safe. I am dissapointed that she doesn't like it and now we are pretty much stuck with an almost brand new toy that will probably get very little use."},{"rating":"2","title":"fuuuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnnn","review":"one of the best hot weather toys a 2 year old could have plays with it all the time.keeps the child busy and happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Summer Fun","review":"My kids ( 3 1/2 and 10 months) really enjoyed playing with this water table this summer.

My 2 1/2 year old son thoroughly enjoys it. I don't know why the fuss I read about in the reviews over the waterwheel easily falling or not being attached. It sits just fine in the area it's supposed to sit in. My son loves this water table. The neighborhood children love it too. It's really nice for a hot day. I would suggest this to anyone. Your kids would love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great invention!","review":"It was easy to assemble and my son loves it! He puts all of his water creatures in it, and plays for hours. It has two plugs on either side to drain out the water when you are finished playing with it. The first thing he wants to do when he wakes up in the morning is go outside and play in the water. The WaterWheel table is the perfect size and comes with 2 boats, a cup, and a Water Wheel. Great invention!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WaterWheel Fun!","review":"Our first one came to us unfortunately completely dented (through an Amazon vendor.) The second one though has been a hit! Our daughter got it when she was about 13 months old and now that she is just over two, she can not go near it without wanting to fill it up and \\"play water table.\\" She loves it so much that she will run outside to the tap and try to fill it up herself. It is large enough for her to have room to play, but small enough to store in our condo's small garage. The price is reasonable too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Summer Fun","review":"My 2 year old LOVES playing with her water table! She has so much fun pouring from the top and watching it flow to the bottom level... and of course, splashing. It's the perfect height for toddlers to 4 year olds and it's always the hit with the kids when we put it out for play dates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Water Tower","review":"The real problem with this product is that the water tower is not attached. My toddler son would become frustrated when he poured water into it only to see it fall off. I eventually \\"made the water tower go away\\". Then it was just a boring / overpriced water table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy for many ages","review":"I bought this water toy for my 7-year-old and both she and her 3-year-old sister love it! It gives them an oppotunity to play in water in a way that I approve of. I don't have to worry about a small swimming pool posing a danger to my little one or killing the grass. This toy keeps the water clean and elevated and is easy to dump or move. A fun toy for big and little kids alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Happy","review":"My 15-month-old daughter really enjoys this water table, and it's big enough that she and another child can easily play with it at the same time. She doesn't care too much for the water wheel, but that might change in the next month or so. She tends to take all the pieces off (including the boats) and dumps water all over herself with the cup (or attempts to drink from it before I can stop her). I gave this product a 4 rating because I don't know how she'll enjoy this toy in the future, and she doesn't have a lot of interest in all the pieces. If she maintains interest and can engage with the water table in the future, I'll probably revise my rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good water table!","review":"My son has been playing with his water table since he was 11 months old. He loves splashing in it. He isn't really interested yet in pouring water into the watermill contraption or moving the boats around. He does like to pick up the boats and run around the yard with them. A word of caution - the sail does not stay connected to the bottom boat piece so be prepared to lose one or the other, or search the yard for them. Overall, I highly recommend this product. My son is always drawn to it, even when it is empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son loves it","review":"My son who will be three in September loves this activity table. We even bring the toys into the bathtub on rainy days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Activity Table","review":"I bought this for my 2 year-old grandson and he loves it.

It provides hours of entertainment. My only complaint is that I did not purchase it sooner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of fun in the sun","review":"This water table was the biggest outdoor toy hit for three summers, from when my son was 1 to when he was 3. The water wheel action was fascinating to him; the boats were so fun to float around; and the height of the table was perfect throughout that period. This is an extremely durable toy that we intend to keep for our future children and pass down to friends for many more years of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waterwheel play table","review":"This thing is fantastic - keeps little guys busy for hours. Small enough so any standers can play but entertaining for older kids, too. Personally I'd rather have just water and not mess (literally) with the sand, so this was perfect. It's also nice and small for urban yards. My sister-in-law has one as well, several years old, that's held up really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous toy!","review":"fabulous toy for outdoor fun! my son got it for his first birthday and played with it all summer long.

It was a huge success and it even arrived 3 days early. Thanks for the great product and service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storage anyone?","review":"This is a nice little table, but it doesn't come apart for storage, which means that... unless you have a very large basement or storage area in which to keep it in off-season, or don't mind leaving it outside in the rain and snow, or want to use it as a coffee table in the living room, you'll be giving it to the neighbor's kids and letting them worry about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite!!","review":"We bought this last April for our daughter (17 months old then) and she has played with it CONSTANTLY since then. It's her favorite thing to do, and still is now that she's 2 1/2. We set it up on the deck or on the grass next to the sand box. It's always a huge hit and keeps her occupied for hours. During the winter, I put it in the garage with large dried noodles and beans and various pots, pans and scoops. The educational value is awesome, durability is good and overall value is great. Can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome summer fun!","review":"We got this for our twins' birthday and had a small party with 8 or so kids over. This was the starof the party and was plenty large for all the kids 1.5-3 yr olds to play around without fighting. Thelittle boats that come with it are rather pathetic and were rapidly discarded. The fact that the water wheelis not attached was not a problem, it was sturdy enough to stay up most of the time and the kids lovedthat they could pick it up and pour the water out (usually on someone else). Overall a great buy to keepthe kids entertained and cool on hot summer days."},{"rating":"2","title":"WaterWheel Table","review":"I purchased this for my one year old grandson.

I did need to buy her a plastic smock to wear as she tended to spill the water all over herself. I found that out the first time she tried it :)..She loves going outside and playing with it. Everytime she comes over we go outside if it is a nice day so she can play in it. I wouldn't recommend this for indoors for toddlers but during the summer months this is great. It keeps her entertained for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for summer!","review":"My son played with this last summer every time he was out in the backyard and he absolutely LOVED it.

The kids absolutely love it. The teacher says it is hard to tear them away from it on afternoons. She uses it to teach them science (water advancing the wheel) and math (with measuring cups, etc.). She gets in a lesson and the kids have fun!I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for few","review":"This toy is much better than most combo water/sand tables I've seen.

I like that it was a water only toy, we have a sand box and that mix just has nightmare written all over it. Its a sturdy table and was simple to put together.

She loves it! She's still learning to stand and move around @ 8 mo. and the table is sturdy enough for her to pull up on and hang on to for balance (supervised of course). She really likes watching the water wheel go around and splashing away!The drain does leak a little, but it's not a big deal. When we're done playing with the water, it gets dried off and brought inside as an additional play table. We stick toys in it and she walks around the edges playing with the toys in the middle.Great value for the money. I had looked at a bunch of the other reviews on combo sand and water tables and saw good advice to keep sand and the water as separate activities to avoide a big mess. We'll get her a sand box when she's older, since she's still too young to have sand - it would just get eaten."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"Purchased this last summer-it had been on the deck all along and found it to be cracked.

Living in Michigan, it is hard to come up with water based play activities during the winter so we thought we would try this. It has allowed for some water play inside and my son seems to enjoy it. However, he has more fun in the bath. I am hoping that it will be more fun when we can use it outside and not have to worry so much about making a mess. As for durability, the table itself seems sturdy. i am a bit concerned that the small accessories may not last, but nothing has broken thus far. At this point, I would suggest this for anyone looking for a simple, affordable water play table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was fun for a while","review":"My son LOVED this for about a month but then got sick of it fast. Its a great toy though and I still highly recommend it. I also recommend you get some additional toys to go with it because the flimsy quality of the sailboats that came with it were subpar and broke the first time he yanked on the sail (the sail didn't pop off but instead CRACKED off). Also the drains both drip even when they are in securely... but for the price and sturdiness and easy of moving it around, its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of fun","review":"I purchased this table for my 2 year old and he loves it.

It was challenging and fun for him as he discovered how all the parts worked --his big sister caught on quickly and loved telling him what everything did. She insisted on wearing her bathing suit so she could splash the water as much as she wanted and get as wet as she wanted! I recommend it for fun on a hot, summer day.

He is now almost 6 and still plays in it along with our 4 yr old and 2 year old. Younger kids play with the water wheel, boats, and love to splash with it while the older kids use it to fill various buckets and cups and to load squirt guns. It sits out all winter every year and with a little cleaning each summer looks perfectly new. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun indoors or outdoors","review":"I love how sturdy this play table is. My son was giggling w/ excitement the moment we put water in it, and he loves to pour water into the wheel. On warm days he is outside with it, or i bring it in and put other items inside like rice or beans. My only wish is that it had a drain. It's a bit awkward to pick up and dump water out of. That would have been very convenient if it had a drain plug. But we are happy with it regardless. And there is room enough for 2-3 kids to play happily in as well. It was easy to assemble - just pop the legs on."},{"rating":"2","title":"He loves it!","review":"This water table is just what we wanted. Our son plays with it on the back porch on hot summer days. He loves the water wheel, 2 boats, and the little cup to pour water to make the water wheel spin. He is 19 months old, and the height is perfect. He sends the boats down the 'slide,' as he calls it.

But they have hardly done justice to W. D. Ross. I have only made my way through Book III (out of XIV)of the Metaphysics, but I am distressed by too frequent errors of punctuation, omission of words, change of word order, and a total mangling of the last paragraph of Book III that makes it altogther unintelligible.

In my quest to find recommendations of \\"gay lit,\\" I have been better served by collections such as _Pages Passed from Hand to Hand_ and especially _The Columbia Anthology of Gay Literature_, both of which provide not only spot-on analysis but also sizeable and helpful excerpts of the works themselves.

On the whole, the Viet Nam-related material contained in \\"Taking Fire\\" goes far beyond \\"artistic license\\" to the point of gross misrepresentation and self-aggrandizement at the expense of historical accuracy. I have no reason to believe that he did not do the same thing in this book.

This guide was horrible. It skipped over large regions of California that one might might be interested in. Living on the edge of the deserts, I couldn't help but notice that the guide didn't really pick up the area between the deserts and the coast. There is a lot more to California than the coastline, Palm Springs and the Mojave desert. This guide is useless unless you only plan to travel to the places it has. Furthermore, many of the entries are not objective, rather I found them quite insulting to people who may actually be associated with the areas they described. For example, an entry about a local university stated that the students only gain entry because their parents paid to get them in. This is not needed in a travel guide and I find it insulting. I recommend the Fodors guide to Southern California instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"guide book gives an unfair review of anaheim,CA","review":"I think the book has some strange opinions. It actually likes Barstow,CA better than Anaheim,CA. Very strange. Purchase not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prize A Viewer's Reward","review":"The Prize is a fast, humorous, suspense story set against the backdrop of the Nobel Prize and the Cold War. A great cast headed by Paul Newman, Elke Summer, Diane Baker, Kevin McCarthy, Leo G. Carroll and Edward G. Robinson in one of his later performances.Paul Newman plays a once promising author, now writing mysteries under a assumed name, who receives the Nobel Prize for Literature. His curiousity leads him into many embarrassing and dangerous situations. No superhero, he uses his wits to survive.Rarely seen on TV or mentioned in reviews of Newman's career, it is unexpected pleasure to watch. Set against the glories of Stockholm and in color, it is a feast for the armchair traveller. Get the popcorn ready and sit back and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Drawer !","review":"After visiting Stockholm a few times I was very keen to see this film. The location is among the most beautiful in the world.This film is almost 40 years old, however it still looks incredible.Mark Robinson's direction is very Hitchcock, and in my opinion works better than Newmans and Hitchcocks very own \\"Torn Curtain\\" effort.One of Newmans top ten if you ask me, it's just a shame that it doesn't recieve as much recognition as it deserves. Great fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware !","review":"If you're thinking to order this DVD---be VERY careful! I did, and instead of the 1963 movie with Paul Newman I received a DVD-R with a totally different movie. Both the disc's label and jacket show Paul Newman's image, but still the movie is another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon owes an Apology","review":"Like the two previous reviewers have stated, this movie is not as advertised. I remember the Paul Newman movie to have been good cold-war entertainment. The DVD Amazon sold me contained what looked like a 1970's TV movie having a guest appearance by Chuck Wollery (maybe it is worth watching, after all)! Amazon has put up its usual return hurdles for this piece of junk--even after three customer service emails. I have urged them to credit everyone who bought this item to be credited the $9.99 it cost without the hassle of returning it, but to no avail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus PRIZE","review":"Not the Nobel Prize but only a movie about snow.

My favorite song is \\"One Good Reason Why\\", it's a good time with its zydeco/party vibe. But I also really like the sweet \\"My Heart Wants to Run\\" and the quirky \\"Damn the Money\\".

Loved it too much as they say. It was his Christmas gift and it brought him pure joy. He squeaked and threw it into the air. Grabbing and shaking it with total abandon. The first hole showed up almost right away.A slight tear on one of the seams. The next hole on the dark blue bone was in the middle of the toy. The first squeaker to stop working was the orange one. It was worth his happiness, I just wish it would have made it a while longer. In it's defense my dog is a Bernese Mountain Dog who is all male and a maniac. The attack jack should be fine for more gentle dogs just not aggresive players and chewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very colorful and fun","review":"Let me start with my 2 dogs - 85 lb & 70 lb and they sometimes entertain themselves and pull from 2 ends of a toy. Unfortunately, my dogs are on the larger end, so suffice it to say not much lasts long when they attempt this friendly fun of tugging. This didn't either - about 1 minute of that and it ripped at the seams. They can still play with it a bit, but not without supervision because of the stuffing. I still like it - if you have one dog or two that aren't quite that strong, go for it. If you are in my situation and are thinking, yeah...my dogs will probably tear that one up, they will.

My 20lb boston terrier also played with it a few times. I was very disappointed that within 2 days, half of the seams were burst open and the stuffing was sticking out. Since this is sized for a larger dog I expected it to hold up well to our little ones. My dogs have stuffed toys that have lasted over a year without the seams splitting.

Well, isn't that just great? The \\"new\\" Godsmack song, \\"I Stand Alone\\", is the feature track (they even managed to write the name into the movie), and listening to it just makes me laugh. Didn't this song used to be called \\"Awake\\"? I swear, it's the same song, only with different lyrics, and more distortion. But then, what more could you expect from Godsmack?The rest of the album doesn't have much to offer, either. I like Nickelback, but this song isn't so great. The only really good ones are the Sevendust one, the System of a Down one, and the 12 Stones one. The rest is pretty uninteresting, and you know bands like Drowning Pool and POD are gonna stink to high heaven. The Creed song is ok...This is a good example of why soundtracks are usually not worth buying.

The music was the best part - John Debney's score is certainly as good as his last action score, Cutthroat Island.So why 1 star? NONE of the music on this 'soundtrack' is in the movie, let alone has anything to do with the movie. It's just a bunch of ...heavy metal bands playing noisy beats accompanied by someone screaming.

Some of these tracks arent even featured on the artist's other cds. Quite metal though... Hip hoppers and and punk rockers beware...All in all in was a great album. The greatest soundtrack I've ever heard I suppose.

I read the reviews but don't remember reading about her getting raped by other men and so purchased the book online, so for those who don't like rape of the heroine by other males don't purchase this book.

Still, I wanted to be able to solve the really tough puzzles so I figured a book such as this would help. It's worthless unless you've never tried the game before. It has NOTHING about the advanced techniques like X-wings and Swordfish which are necessary to do the VERY hard ones. The book is very short, too; less than 100 pages.

It teaches the basics of logic and takes you through every step so that you can make sure you understand it. If you are a beginner get this book first and don't even look at anything else. If you are stuck at finding hidden triples, X-wings, and Swordfish get this book.

Marking in actual possibilities is only mentioned in the end of the book in relation to a brief mention of doubles and triplets. The book is strictly for beginners and is a complete waste of time for anyone who has any proficiency. There are almost no brilliant ideas and the title is completely misleading.

How is it possible that the RON wins every battle it fights, losing not one commander? The weaponry Stirling uses (essentially Civil War-era) resulted in extremely large amounts of command-level casualties. While Commodore Alston is wounded a great many times, she somehow never dies or is even permanently wounded. Her perfection, as well as that of every general officer of the RON, gets annoying and totally ridiculous by the time the novel ends. In contrast, Walker's lack of perfection (and his realization of it) makes him the most interesting of the characters, and I find myself rooting for him, although an Islander victory is inevitable the way the books are going. Stirling might as well have killed Walker in Island and saved us the trouble of reading two more books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stirling is great","review":"This is the second book in the Nantucket series and, as with all his alternative histories, it is believable and interesting.As with all his books it is important to read them in order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stirling continues the Nantucket series in fine style!","review":"What's not to like?

Stirling hate men? I asked myself that question over and over again in reading this novel and it's predecessor. With two exceptions that I can think of, the women are portrayed as strong/positive, while the men are portrayed as weak/negative. Can not women be evil and men be good? I would like to think that both genders are capable of roughly equal amounts of positive and negative character traits, but the author does not seem to think so.The biggest problem with both of these books, however, is that the author does not seem to understand that Bronze Age warfare relied on far more brute strength than modern warfare. The reason that women did not regularly participate in warfare until the second half of the 20th Century had little to due with sexism and much to due with physical strength. I would suggest that the author should read more about the ancient Greek and Roman styles of warfare before he ventures down this path again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sequel to a great first book","review":"After being thrilled with the first book of this series, Island In The Sea Of Time, I bought both sequels together and buckled myself in for a helluva ride.

Having listened to the broadway recordings (which I found lacking), it is obvious that THIS is the way Candide should be heard, as an opera. In this form, the beautiful and complicated music of Bernstein provides the most appropriate contrast to Voltaire's ridiculous (but hilarious) satire, making the work all the more enjoyable and meaningful.

I mean what started off as a great proto-ambient experimental electronic band begins to degenerate into a bunch of new age noodling. The 1976 concert is a classic, the 1977 one is good but is interrupted by annoying DJ who is impatient for the band to continue playing (they should have edited this out) and after that its not quite as good. That said the 1981 concert has some good pieces from Exit. All in all, Tangerine Dream began to lose their live edge when they stopped improvising and focused on actual pieces.

It would be nice if this actually locked in place, as opposed to just dial tight. I have found that I might not notice that the grip has loosened, to where it was about to fall off. I find myself checking the dial, to make sure it's tight, often. Otherwise, I love it, and can't imagine my D200 and D80 without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAKES AN ALREADY GREAT CAMERA EVEN BETTER","review":"The Nikon MB-D80 Multi-Power Pack-Grip for my Nikon D80 Digital SLR camera adds to the already great feel of the D80. The added ability of being able to turn the camera sideways to shoot (portrait style) and have the release button is fantastic. It also adds to the profile of the camera making it look like my old film Nikon F-5 (which I don't miss anymore). I have had many an 'eye and head' turned since getting this grip.The ability to shoot hundreds of photos and not worry about running out of power is wonderful. Took a four day motor trip shooting pictures all the way and still had plenty of power left. I highly recomend this grip to any Nikon D-80 owner. Saw some comments about it looking plastic or cheap and I disagree as it looks and feels just great, matching the finish of my D80 perfectly. AAAA+ Is my personal rating.

Have used it many times. Fits wonderfully but feels a little cheaply built (all plastic). Matches wonderfully with the D90. Would recommend try after market grips, as you may find one that looks and feels just like the Nikon grip but half the price. That is what i should have done. Still a great grip if you need to have all of one brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"World of difference","review":"I can't imagine owning a D90, or most DSLR cameras in this range, without the grip. This not only breaths new life into the camera, using 2 batteries at a time is essential especially for weddings. But for me, past the added bonus of an extra shutter release and the extra battery...This is all about how it makes your camera feel. The D90 body was sized down from some previous models..I have big hands, and the grip makes the camera feel like a way more professional DSLR. Really, world of difference on how the camera feels. I even feel like I get more respect as a photographer, get a lot of comments and people thinking its a much more expensive camera. It's worth the money, don't hesitate on this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not perfect.","review":"This is a great addon for a D90, but I have to give it 4 stars for the following reason:The shutter release button is in no way similar to the one on the D90 body (and I assume the D80 body too). There's no \\"clicking\\" feel between the half press and full press. That's the only downfall, but it's kind of an important thing for the price.Other than that, it adds a proper weight and balance to the camera body. And I can shoot for weeks on end before needing to charge the batteries. (Only use genuine Nikon batteries!!)It makes the camera look pretty intimidating too (re: cool)!Knowing all this, I'd say it's worth the purchase. I'd buy it again, and I'd also buy an updated version if they fixed the shutter button."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you pay for","review":"You only need this battery pack if you are taking weddings or traveling in areas where recharging will be difficult.

Plus, it's not very bulky and is well thought out regarding buttons and grip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is great but I received a defective one from Amazon","review":"I love using the MB-D80 multi-battery pack.

The really good news is, it comes with a plastic insert which holds 4 AA batteries to run the camera. It also takes 2 EN-EL3e rechargable batteries which will power your Nikon until the end of time! The battery door of you Nikon comes off very easily and the MB-D80 fits right in. The fit and finish is great, however it does make the camera a bit heavier. Of course with the MB-D80 installed, the camera no longer fits into it's case, but you probably suspected that. The other really good news is, the MB-D80 also works with the new Nikon D90, the successor to the D80. The D90 uses the same batteries as the D80, so it figures that the MB-D80 would be compatible. All in all, a great purchase at the typical Amazon low price. If you're going on vacation, this is a great accessory to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"I have two D80's and only had this grip for one of them for a while...and found myself never using the body that was without the grip. So I finally broke down and got the grip for the second body.Not only is this a must have for stability while taking pictures, but the verticle shutter release is something I don't know how you could go without.The battery options are also nice, with having the ability to use two batteries for extended picture taking, as well as the ability to use AA batteries if you need to.The only reason I didn't give this item 5 stars is due to the price.In summary; would I buy one again...I already have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon MB-D80 Multi-Power Battery Pack for the Nikon D80 Digital SLR Camera","review":"I love this add-on.

I had to loosen the screw for it to connect properly and power the camera. It didn't feel secure after that and would still lose the connection periodically. I was also expecting it to made out of the same durable plastic and grip that the camera is made out of, but this felt cheaper. I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon MB-D80 Battery Pack","review":"I was a little concerned that the Battery Pack would not fit the new Nikon D80.

Looks good in our yard.- Our lid stays on, and it's never leaked or blown off.- Umbrella fits under sand box lidThings to consider:Obviously, you're paying extra $$ for the attached picnic table. It's really really cute, but my 2 year olds have never actually sat at it for more than 30 seconds, even to eat, because the sand box is too tempting. And if they were to eat at it, usually it has sand all over it.This gripe would be about any sandbox and 2 year olds. They love to play in sand, but they get covered with sand - in their clothes, hair, ears...

Rather, it's about how to exercise the imagination and enter the imaginative realm while remaining grounded in the realm of your familiar, everyday life. Elizabeth Shulman wants to open a store because she wants to imagine a new role for herself in her own life, a role that isn't, in fact, at odds with the self that she notes constitutes the core of her being. It's no accident Elizabeth decides to open a store, to create something of her own that will contribute to the well being of her community, after viewing (and being inspired by) a painting. We feel for Elizabeth, support her in her efforts, because she does what we wish, everyday, to do: imagine how we can create something we can call our own."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was similiar to watching it rain.","review":"I wanted so much to love this book. It starts out beautifully describing a people, a lifestyle and a part of the country that all deserve the intricate detail that Mrs. Goodman uses to paint their picture. The problem is that after the picture is painted, it just stops. No story, no emotion, nothing. You so want the characters to interact and they simply brush against each other on occassion: even husband and wife, brother and brother. Several of the characters introduced actually dropped out of the story without an explination. I hoped until the last page that this book would \\"wake up.\\" It was sort of like watching it rain. The author has mastered description, her next work should add a little story to the words."},{"rating":"1","title":"clumsy, uneven book","review":"I don't think this book deserves only one star, but I wanted to do my bit to lower the rating. I am amazed at the hyperbolic praise given to this book. Perhaps there aren't many novels that go into the minutae of conservative Jewish life, I don't know. But what I DO know is that some of the prose in this book is as stilted as a 7th grader's essay. Other passages are nicely wrought. But the emotional life seems once-removed and meager. About halfway through the book I started skimming, to hit the highlights.

It's a novel about community and about isolation, and how both are pretty much a part of everyone's experience.

Like others reviewing here, I kept waiting for the big drama to explode -- it never did.

I keep hearing this book compared to a newer one, The Ladies Auxiliary by Tova Mirvis, and, like the previous reviewer, I feel The Ladies Auxiliary is a much better story with more lyrical and beautiful writing. It is exciting to see the blossoming of so much literary fiction about Orthodox Jews."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"The reviews and praise for this book have been misleading. After having read several books by Chaim Potok, Naomi Ragen, and Nathan Englander, I was very disappointed by Allegra Goodman's novel. Potok, Ragen, and Englander actually have lived in and know the Orthodox communities.On the other hand, I don't think Goodman really knows what she is describing. Not only does Goodman portray the Orthodox community inaccurately, but I did not feel any empathy for her characters. I suspect that the Orthodox community she is describing would not have eaten Barton's chocolates or Hebrew National meat. Nor would I have expected a woman to be left alone with a man in a room.Similarly to other reviewers here, I kept hoping that I would like the book and that something would happen in the narrative that would make me enthusiastically recommend it to others.Oh well, there will be other books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - don't waste your time","review":"This book was a waste of my life.

What I found though to be the overarching problem with this book is that Goodman looks at this world from such a distance that the story is ultimately unengaging. Other readers have complained that it's boring or that there's no plot -- I know what they're referring to, but I think it's not so much the lack of plot that makes it a boring read as it is the fact that there's so little passion here. Even the writing is so unwaveringly precise that instead of being a virtue of the book, it becomes a flaw, rendering the book dainty instead of daring. I came away from this book wishing that something, anything, might shake Goodman up a bit, that next time we might see some flash of real emotion, some hint of unrestrained raw energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative, enjoyable real life people.","review":"this book is so informative concerning the lives of the orthodox jewish people living in brooklyn ny. i thought i knew pretty much about the everyday living, but ms.goodman really explains how the Rav controls their lives. hope she continues with the same people and tells more about their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six characters in Search of a Plot","review":"This is probably the longest short story you'll ever read, but a novel it is not. There is no plot, no climax, no resolution, no dramatic tension. It has a few interesting characters, just not the ones who hang around long enough to move the story along. About 100 pages from the end I ran into a member of my book club who had finished the book and asked her if anything was going to be resolved by the end. I promise not to spoil the ending for anyone ...if only there were one to spoil. I can't for the life of me understand how this slight work could have been shortlisted for anything except reworking in a creative writing class for beginners.There is no dearth of excellent fiction about Jewish life. Why this one is being touted is a mystery to me. Francine Prose and Rebecca Goldstein are at the top of their form. Maybe Goodman will get there but she is not there yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written glimpse into a closed world.","review":"Allegra Goodman has given us a beautifully written glimpse into the closed world of the ultra-orthodox Jew.

This is really a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A modest portrait of a microcosmic orthodox Jewish community","review":"Goodman's portrait of this Kirshner community of religious Jews who summer together in the countryside of upper state New York is both sympathetically respectful and sharply observant. It is about being Jewish in a non-Jewish world, about being bone-deep religious in a world where religiosity is not common, about submitting oneself to the dictates of community rules in a society that prides itself on the oppposite. Yet the two contrasting sons of the Rev Kirshner's family seem not unfamiliar, the plight of Elizabeth pulled between the growing sense of her subculture's strictures and the larger but frightening possibilities outside that, the chasm betw3een the older man tied to his sisters and his young wife Nina - these seem part of a microcosm of any world, however small, however specifically different. It does tend to be episodic; it is limited in the range of its displayed emotions. but it is a lovely book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story to get lost in","review":"I picked this up at a used book store, knowing nothing about it except what the cover told me. Having grown up on the edge of the Catskills, having had some experience in my home town with \\"summer people from the city\\", and being an avid reader of Chaim Potok, Faye Kellerman and Harry Kemelman, I felt this book about a small Orthodox Jewish community that moves upstate together from NYC every summer was \\"chosen\\" for me. I loved it absolutely. Rich story, full of complicated characters, details of life in a traditional society, and insight into the human spirit. Reminds me of the best of my summer reading when I was a kid--getting utterly lost in the lives of the fictional characters, and never wanting the story to end. A reviewer from Newsday called Allegra Goodman a \\"young Mozart of Jewish fiction\\". How apt."},{"rating":"2","title":"book to recommend to your friends","review":"I picked up this novel solely because of its nomination for the National Book Award. I was not even sure it was a book with which I would relate, not being Jewish. However, believing that all great literature is universal, I read it.What a perfect delight this novel is! The first thing I thought of was how much I would like to use this book in my Women in Literature class when it reaches paper. The main character is wonderful, and judiciously, yet strongly, attempts to fight the patriarchal world of the Rav and his rules. Anytime someone says to me, \\"is there anything good to read?\\", I immediately recommend Allegra Goodman's study of the social contract and one woman's fight to make others see the rules for what they are--restrictive and one-sided."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice collection of songs","review":"Many people will not know who Nicole is.

If you have a newer MP3 player, this isn't really a problem anyway, so that point is moot. what isn't moot is that for whatever reason each song has a 2 second pause BUILT INTO EVERY MP3 file, meaning that what would normally be a usually unnoticeable or slight load time in between songs, you now have to contend that the mix will be broken up, GUARENTEED by the 2 second break, which throws you out of the experience of the mix anyway.I wouldn't buy the MP3 files have been fixed, and I would love to recieve them once they are fixed.

Since the CPU is always running so hot, it always sets off the fan, which seems to go off every 2-3 minutes with light web browsing, and is almost constantly on when doing anything more intensive. The schizophrenic nature of the fan is noticeable and somewhat loud compared to sound level of any Pentium notebook I have ever heard.Also, the hinge design is very poor. I have had laptops in the past with similar hinge covers that broke off after about 12 months of use- why can't these guys just make metal hinge covers like IBM???For more information, do a google on the \\"unofficial Averatec support forums\\" on the web, and read for yourself...Pros: Dirt cheap Cons: Gets real hot, fan makes more noise than most notebooks, shared video memory, poor hinge design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, Light, Great Price, and Features","review":"Small, light and great price---that is why I bought this computer.

Even though the previous book was a disappointment, there was still hope! Let me tell you that the first 36 pages of the book killed that hope right quick! Only one out of the three readers in this house made it to the end of the book (and she cheats!). I agree with all the previous reviews although I believe that some were too nice. The book left me with two burning questions: 1. It's obvious the author didn't read any of the previous books, but isn't there anyone who has oversight over the entire series?(I say let's line 'em all up!) 2. What's the best way to get this book out of my house? I find it almost impossible to throw a book into the trash, but, in this case, it would be morally reprehensible to perpetuate it on the used book shelves. BEWARE! (And by the way, that one star wasn't my idea.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed.","review":"My expectations were set high by the prior books in the series. Unfortunately, this book did not meet my expectations. Too many details were left outstanding. Why bring the infant into the story? Why no discussion of the affect of his prior occupation?

I set a 3 digit pin and had all my important papers inside and when I went to try to open it, it didn't open. I was flabbergasted because I couldn't get to all my important papers. After trying to open this with several different numbers, I finally found the 3 digit pin that worked to open it, but it still sometimes doesn't open.Don't buy this product, you'll be sorry.

It is the best file carrying case i have ever seen and the locks on it are very strong and putting your combinaton is made easy with the instrutions that come inside the box. This box is chromed on every corner and down all the sides for protection. It could take the force of being checked for storage in the belly of the plane at a airport and not get hurt. Really it is worth more than what Amazon is selling it for because this box will last you a life time. BTW, the handle is solid chrome and feels good to carry.

She and Luther are the epitome of soulful song interpretation.Why she doesn't record more is one of the great enigmas of modern music!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Morrissey NEEDS NEW SONGWRITERS","review":"Just because he is Morrissey does not mean that he gets to put out mediocre albums and everyone has to fawn all over them. I am tired of reading reviews that say \\"It may not be as good as Viva Hate, but ...\\" or \\"At least it's better than what's on the radio right now.\\" Maybe if we hold him to higher standards he will take some action and find more talented people to write his songs. \\"Ringleader\\" is merely a good-enough album with the occasional catchy or interesting bit, but nothing that rises to the level of brilliance; nothing that anyone will remember in 5 years. \\"You Have Killed Me\\" and \\"In the Future\\" are both catchy (and sound like variations of the same song) but ultimately forgettable. \\"I'll Never Be\\" starts out promising but self-destructs. \\"At Last\\" is just painful. We all know Morrissey is capable of brilliance. Why not measure him against the standard of his own potential?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well color me dissapointed","review":"I'm not a very good reviewer, but I know enought to say that I am so dissapointed with this album. I'd been looking forward to buying it for months, and after listening to it once I had no desire to listen to it again. It's boring, it's that simple. I've never been a complete fan of where Morrissey went musically with \\"You are the Quarry\\", but at least that album drew me in enough that I couldn't stop listening to it for days. I've re-listened to \\"Ringleader of the Tormentors\\" now a few times, and still it comes out with every song sounding the same. Only the single \\"You Have Killed Me\\" really seems to stand out, probably because it's a bit more commercial sounding. If you're a die-hard Morrissey fan like me, you probably bought this the day it came out. But to the less fanatic Morrissey fan, I would suggest buying an older album instead, and pretend this one didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"So... Life Is A Pigsty","review":"Posle odlicnog albuma iz 2004 You Are The Quarry(5/5), album Ringleader Of The Tormentors osim smelog naziva nenudi nista drugo. Pa zasto Morrissey? Ok, svima se manje vise desavaju kiksevi ali dati albumu takav naziv, a snimiti takav tresh tako nesto od Morrissey nije za ocekivanje.Da pogledamo, na albumu je 12 pesama.Od tih pesama samo su dve vredne. Pesma koja otvara ovaj promaseni album I Will See You In Far Off Places i prvi singl You Have Killed Me. Ostatak nije vredan pomena.Jebiga Morrissey, Italija te je totalno sjebala ili si ostario duhom i postao totalno dosadan i hiper kic patetican.Kao iskreni fan, bezi iz Italije dok jos ima nade za tebe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morrissey's Explosive Kegs.","review":"Yes, what the professional critics have been heralding for the last several weeks is true: Morrissey has discovered sex. Fortunately for us, it hasn't dampened the quality of his solo work, for \\"Ringleader of the Tormentors\\" is yet another fine effort from the ex-Smith. \\"There are explosive kegs/between my legs\\" he reveals in \\"Dear God Please Help Me\\" (with a string arrangement by the legendary Ennio Morricone), and in the closer \\"At Last I Am Born,\\" he confesses: \\"I was once a mess/of guilt because of the flesh.\\" The first two singles, \\"You Have Killed Me\\" and \\"The Youngest Was Most Loved,\\" are of course fine standouts, but my personal favorite is the seven minute \\"Life is a Pigsty\\" which slowly draws you in from the first note. It's hard to believe that Morrissey's solo career was almost on life support a decade ago, but \\"Ringleader of the Tormentors\\" shows that he still has a few witty tricks up his sleeve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, not his best though.","review":"I've been soaking up this CD for about a week now and I must say I do like it. I still think it's not as good a YATQ but it's still good ole Morrissey.He has his usual stuff here life, death, US bashing ect. (I kind of just look over that stuff.) \\"You Have Killed Me\\" sounds like an out take from YATQ and it is a good song. \\"I'll Never Be Anybody's Hero\\" is very \\"Alma Matters\\" ish. Still good. \\"Life Is A Pigsty\\" is a great song. Nice bass line and ambience in that song. \\"The Father Who Must Be Killed\\" is a great catchy song. I'm not super fond of the childrens choir but he doesn't over do it. \\"The Youngest Was The Most Loved\\" also another good one here as well.Overall a great Morrissey performance and I sure hope he tours with this album. Conservatives love you too Moz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Comeback for those who know him best","review":"Many people seem to disagree with the sound, the tunes and the new \\"personae\\" Morrissey has built in his new Roman exile. But, let's be sincere, this record is an excellent demonstration that, wuth the right people associated, Morrissey excels in his \\"glam-indie cult rock star\\".If you can not tolerate the roaring guitars, the velvet string arrangements, the children choir on the catchy \\"The Father that must be killed\\"(to be the second single) or the repetition of the hook and choir of \\"You have killed me\\" (the current single), then, why waste your time saying that this record is boring.This is a record that falls very short to match the beautiful Your Arsenal, but improves greatly the mistakes on \\"Southpaw Grammar\\". So, If you know Morrissey work and you feel like spending your bucks on a new record, this is the one you must get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moz strikes back","review":"Not endowed with wide mass political appealing as YOU ARE THE QUARRY,this album is blessed with personal accounts galore instead.It starts off with I'LL SEE YOU...meticulously set against Middle Eastern melodies,leaving you to guess who the song is about....BIN LADEN?.The second track is one of the best as it pictures Moz struggle(I think) with his fleshly desires and sexual inclinations(NO MORE CELIBACY??).The third track,YOU HAVE KILLED ME is intelligently the first single as it enshrinesthe presence of death related verbs/themes(so common in his work)yet accompanied by love and sex..THe rest of the album is very consistent with the artist's releases prior to QUARRY.Yet another romantic tune stands out,WORK OF ART .In it, the use ofwords such as PUKE distances it from the traditional romantic genre.Overall,a great album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tormented...And Bored to Death","review":"As a hardcore devotee for many years, I am \\"truly, truly disappointed\\".

I even found much to like about his much-panned Kill Uncle album (especially Harsh Truth of the Camera Eye: Brilliant), and I was very excited to get this one based on all the great reviews and because I liked quite a few songs on You Are The Quarry, but the first listen was very dissapointing. It sounded like a mishmash of everything else that came before put in a blender and chopped up into a confusing hodgepodge. Perhaps later (after I recover my eqiuilibrium) I can go back and try to let it \\"grow on me\\" as other reviewers have done. What a shame to become a petri dish of a fan.

Recorded in Rome, Morrissey's new home, the album is replete with both poignant and buoyant songs. This is his finest CD since Southpaw Grammar and proves that Morrissey was the Smiths. He is still an incomparable lyricist and he will never be replaced as the music industry's most vehement vegetarian and adamant animal rights activist. No Meat Was Murdered for this celestial CD. Let's hope Morrisey remains in Rome because he has been bestowed with Divine Intervention that brilliantly resonates throughout Ringleader Of The Tormentors. Every song is amazing !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud of an album with few good tracks","review":"I love Morrissey and he is my favorite musical artist. However, this is his weakest album ever (weaker than \\"Maladjusted\\"). It is a let-down, pure and simple, especially since it follows \\"You are the quarry\\", an out-and-out masterpiece. The songs on \\"Ringleader...\\" are longwinded and boring. There are rumours that a new album is in the offing for 2008 owing to the fact that he's been performing \\"All You Need Is Me\\" on TV and concerts. I hope the new-album rumour is true because Morrissey needs redemption after this aural waste of time.Out of the 12 tracks, only three songs are decent: \\"The Youngest Was the Most Loved\\", \\"You Have Killed Me\\", and \\"I Just Want to See the Boy Happy\\".All in all, if you are a diehard Morrissey fan and feel the need to collect every albums he's put out, then get this one.

This does not diminish the fun my dog has with this toy. He loves to shake it, let the balls fly all over, then chase them around and try to corral them all. He loves chasing after the balls and he loves to fetch them as well...they work good for indoor fetch since they are soft, but still have a good weight and travel fairly far.

I have to buy a new cube because the cube that I have is all chewed up and the balls/toys are falling out. The balls that were included with the toy are in pretty good shape because he would rather play with the smaller super balls that I put in the cube. I also use the cube as a storage box so he can dig for the one he wants, though if he's in the mood, he'll take them all out at once. This was a great investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy","review":"My dog loves this toy or more specifically, the balls that come with it. It didn't take her long to figure out she could pull the balls out of the cube and when she did, she quickly disregarded the cube. The cube doesn't provide much of a challenge although I found it gains her interest when I put larger toys in it, ones that are a bit difficult to get out. She had more fun running around with the balls and chomping on them till the squeakers broke than anything but this toy has certainly proven to be entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Junky Toy From the Same Company As the Squirrels","review":"Another toy my Westie puppy [10 lbs] had ripped within minutes after taking it out of the box. The cube has been shredded, she still plays with the balls. Maybe it's my dog, everyone else loves these toys and my dog destroys them in minutes and I feel like my money has been thrown down the drain. I will never buy another toy from this company. The cheap toys will have to make her happy, I think her teeth are just too strong to make the toys last longer than a few minutes. I did write a letter of complaint to the company but I'm sure they won't care especially since I seem to be the only one with a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily destroyed","review":"After purchasing other Kyjen dog toys that were durable enough (relatively speaking, durable to me means lasting at least a couple weeks or more), I opted for this toy to feed my little dog's insatiable appetite.Unfortunately, the stuffed balls each lasted a couple days only. In fact, the plastic squeaker air tubes already began to protrude through the weak seams almost immediately, and the air chamber easily deformed permanently enough to prevent their operation.And this \\"damage\\" was done by a 1 year old, 6 pound Chihuahua (yes, their smaller teeth are sharper than larger dogs).The only positive thing to say about this toy is that it's much harder for my dog to pull the balls out of the puzzle box, so he spends a little more time playing with the box trying to get the balls out.Again, other Kyjen toys lasted much longer than this. I definitely would not be purchasing this toy again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for toddlers and dogs alike","review":"We purchased the IQube for our puppy and we weren't suprised at all when she loved it. The soft balls also were loved by furniture and walls that she would toss them into. (Yes, our dog throws the ball for herself sometimes..) What really surprised us was that our year old nephew loves playing with it with the dog, too. He can grip the balls and enjoys the bright colors. With the variety, he pulls one out, throws it for the dog and while she chases it, he gets another out. Priceless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving cube that is soft and smashes down easily.","review":"I had a German Shepherd pup who was 7 months old and EASILY got all of the balls out; whipping the cube around and having them all spill out. She enjoyed chewing more on the balls than throwing them about. I kept stuffing them back in and she would immediately take them out with her paws and mouth. This may be an okay toy for a smaller breed dog, but not large breed as they have a bigger mouth. A small breed may have a harder time to yank it out. My second Shepherd male pup did the same thing as my female so it was not just my one dog. All the squeakers are broken after gnawing on the ball the first time. Oh, and the openings rip easily. It is soft and mushes easily. Don't be fooled in thinking that its a \\"sturdy\\" cube because it is not at all. Was very disappointed after the first minute of playtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cube is really small and tight","review":"The balls are very difficult for me to get out even with two hands & knowing how to do it.

I don't know why I kept reading it. I first read Audrey Rose as a teenager and remember enjoying it on two levels. First, it was scary. Second, it made me think. The characters were interesting and sympathetic. This sequel disappoints on all levels.

I went to a camera store and took all my camera lenses with me along with other items I carry in my bag, just to see if it all would fit; it did. My camera fit in the main compartment with a telephoto lens and also with a zoom lens, no problem. The fit was better when I had the telephoto lens in the middle pocket and the zoom lens in a side pocket. I was also able to put a smaller lens in the other side pocket or carry my charger, cleaning cloth, etc. There are other smaller pockets to hold additional batteries, USB cable, etc. Plus, the bag is compact and easy to carry."},{"rating":"2","title":"great camera protection","review":"I use this case with a Nikon D60 (18-55mm lens), and it works great. I don't have an extra lens right now, so I use all the compartments to store mostly accessories, cords, etc. It's really sturdy and stable, as far as cases go, and I really feel that my camera is well protected. As someone else mentioned, the only thing that bugs me is that the lens hole in the suspension part is a little on the tight side - but it just means I have to be a little more careful taking the camera out of the case. Hopefully, though, I'm doing that anyway! I don't know if I would use this case if I were traveling or carrying my camera around all day, since the shape is pretty boxy. For storage, general protection, and short trips, though, it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag your Canon SLR & Accessories","review":"If your reviewing bag options like I did and you found this one you will be happy.

Two side pockets for extra lenses.Problem is very obvious, it is too big if you don't want to carry 3 lenses with you to travel.

You can send empty cartridges to the company for recycling. They also have both normal and high-yield cartridges. For a little extra money, you can get twice the number of prints.Cons: It does drain the electricity--expect house lights to flicker! It was disturbing at first, but I'm used to it now. The printer is loud when it operates, silent when powered down. The duplex option is expensive, if you need that functionality. You'll also need to buy another paper feeder for larger paper sizes.Overall, I'm extremely pleased. I'm on a Macintosh system and had no trouble with drivers or set up.

It really runs like a champ. None of the four have ever broken down and the only necessary maintenance is changing the toner. We rarely have any paperjams and print on all different types of paper, including envelopes.One strange thing - probably driver or software related (so only one star deduction) - is that it sometimes fails to print underlining. If I have a Word document on my screen with underlining and I push print twice, every so often the first copy will have underlining, but the second will not. Very strange.

It certainly is the smallest, lightest pump out there, but it can only inflate a road tube to about 60 psi(I've seen riders bend stems pumping away with this little wheezer). Thats ok to limp home on from a training ride, but it's not good enough if you are self suppporting or want to finish a long ride after dealing with a flat. You will be better off with a more substantial pump or CO2. Recommended as a back up only.Follow up - Got a flat tire mountain biking last month (tube type set-up). Thought I had my larger pump along, but it turned out to be this one in the camelback. Turns out it pumped up the mountain bike tube just fine (lots of pumps required of course, it doesn't move much air). Apparently this pump is ok getting pressures in mtb range (55 psi in this case), but can't get a road tube even close to 100.

If Gore is so wildly off on this one critical figure, why should I trust him to present this issue ?Gore's book contains for instance pictures of a peninsula breaking off into the ocean. Without the context that this represents the 3 % of Antarctica tha has never been stable, and that the other 93 % of the continent is frozen ice which actually is gaining in mass, Gore is just manipulating the data, and manipulating us.If you want a real picture of global warming, read Bjorn Lomborg's \\"Cool It\\".

He even decides to save some space in the book for a whole section about Al the man, complete with cute pictures of baby Al and his parents, big Al and his kids, etc. Obviously, its very relevant material to a book on global warming.But the most damning thing of all, is that none of his work is cited.

I used to believe in global warmign until I did research for a paper. Now I just think Al Gore is an uninformed idiot just looking to find his political niche again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsensical rant by a failed politician that refuses to go away.","review":"After having his damaged credibility saved by the Supreme Court in the infamous 2000 elections Mr. Gore is back and this time he tackles \\"Global Warming\\". My first thought when I heard of this was \\"There is no limit for Gore's irresponsibility\\". Take this for what it is; another attempt by this guy to stay in the limelight.If you want serious information on this very important issue for our future this book will not provide it. Many of the facts are overblown of completely wrong. There are many other resources by real experts of the matter in the form of books or websites.Don't spend your time or money with this hypocrite. While you are trying to be conscious with your surroundings and your environment Mr. Gore is wasting and polluting more in one day with his motorcades and private jet rides than your whole town does in a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Eco-socialist Blather","review":"Gore knows as much about global climate change as he did about inventing the Internet. I bought this book hoping to read about the real, scientific causes of global warming; namely, sunspot activity (except in some parts of the world, where we are experiencing global cooling). Instead, all I got was blame on humans for existing and the typical left-wing eco-extremism. The bottom line is this: if mankind cannot fix global warming, then how in the heck can they be blamed for causing it? Gore is an idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern day alchemy","review":"Where to stop? Warmed over out of context statistics, invective, hysteria and hyperbole. For a lousy, dreary, frantic fantasy read, this is your book. If Amazon allowed minus stars this would rate a minus 2. I borrowed a copy for a friend and can truly say it's best use would be barbeque fire starter."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Inconvenient Truth by Al gore was disappointing","review":"I found the book less full of facts and more full of computer generated what-ifs and pictures of young Al and his wife hiking, etc. It failed to point out that the same things that are being said today have been headlines in Time magazine and others in the 70's and other times in the past and that this global warming fear is cyclical if one is to look at history. It also failed to point out the impact of non-man-made events on global warming. I thought the pictures were pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"China a role model on pollution control?","review":"I recently got back from a trip to China. I saw a half dozen cities and what was most remarkable about all of them was the pollution. It was like nothing I had ever seen, and I live in New York City which is supposedly the most polluted city in the United States. The pollution in China is so thick you can taste it. So I was shocked when I got to the part of this book where Mr. Gore praises China's environmental record and claims that they're on the \\"cutting edge\\" of environmental technology. That was too much. Mr Gore uses the word \\"truth\\" in the title of his book but I think he's being about as truthful as when he claimed that the main characters in \\"Love Story\\" were based on Tipper and himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazon fails to deliver","review":"amazon attempted to extort second payment on undelivered itemswhile claimiing \\"we will refund you later\\". they continue to use shippers who will not deliver to all addresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mass psychology phenomenon","review":"We will look back a few years from now and see that 'global warming' is nothing but a hoax.

At least not to the degree necessary to establish anything like Al Gore's book as facts. Conjecture that is not connected to consistency is the nature of politics, at which Al Gore excells, but it is not science. Remember, Al Gore claimed he invented the internet too. What more needs to be said. The real shame is that there are enough uneducated, irrational and emotional readers that will accept this as gospel to propell this urban myth into the realm of \\"media\\" credibility. That is to say, any lie repeated long and loud enough will become \\"fact\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Subject","review":"What is this book doing in the listings for Meteorology?

I learned that the Artic ice cap is on average less than 10 feet thick while the Antartic ice cap is 10,000 feet thick. Now I am aware why the Artic and the tundra are so vunerable.

It didn't. I was hopeful that we could still do something about it. The book (which I purchased a little while after seeing it) was more informational, but, in my opinion, less touching. I really recommend this book and the DVD, when it comes out. It is necessary if you want to keep Earth blue and green."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated Picture Book","review":"This is nothing more than a picture book sprinkled with platitudes and a few stories about Al's life including some charming family photos. There are a few graphs purporting to make a case but none of the data is newer than 2005 and none of it is cited to a traceable source. The year 2005 is, of course, before we began to experience record cold winters and extended cold spring and fall. That's also before recent revelations that the data has been cooked and faulty satellite sensors missed arctic ice masses the size of California. It is before Al bought his $9 million house on the beach in California. This book is clearly intended for those whose intellectual capacity is limited to looking at pictures. There is no bibliographic reference or footnotes for those who might wish to read further or check Al's claims. This book proves only one thing: at one time in his life Al Gore was actually thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Since there ain't no zeros, I give this book a star rating of one....","review":"Nothing but a big money maker for Al Gore all based on a gigantic hoax. This man has no shame, and cherrypicks certain data to back up his insistence that \\"global warming\\" actually exists. Heck, nowadays these clowns can't even call it \\"global warming\\" anymore...now they call it \\"climate change.\\" Thank God I only checked this piece of rubbish out of a local library and read it through just for laughs, and at the end of reading this worthless drivel that this Al Gore dude is a total whack job and phony.

I sat down and began to read his story and it stirred a feeling inside of me that really hit home. Mostly because of how close I am with my father, who introduced me to this sport that has become my life passion and also because through his story I could relived the excitement, fear, and pride that came along with my first turkey. This book is full of information for anyone who is serious about becoming the best tom chaser they can and it's written so well, you will lose yourself in it and you will feel like your hunkered down in the bush with each of these awesome hunter/writers.

It's author spends summers cruising the coastal waters of British Columbia with her 5 children, the youngest only 2 1/2. She is a delightful story-teller, and inpires me to stay connected with the child-like wonder with the natural world. I am also inspired by her steady self-confidence - extreme weather, engine troubles in remote regions, encounters with bears, and miscellaneous injuries never seem to rattle her. This is not a super-woman, adventure book however. She very matter-of-factly and imaginatively weaves her tales, reminding me a little bit of Peter Pan.

If you read the list of songs and love this kind of music this is a great CD for you. I love every song on this CD so I snapped up a copy right away. But when I got it home and listened to it I was so disappointed at the production quality. It sounds like they dubbed all these classic rock songs right off an 8-track player. It was so bad I started adjusting the knobs on my stereo thinking something had broken! I switched to another CD just to compare and verified the problem is in the recording. Also, they package this in a cheaper than usual jewel case there is no inside jacket and the cover is printed on cheap paper.

It included all of the birds of Europe and very few of the birds were native to England, where I was visiting. Also, the book is very difficult to use. You have to go to 3 places to look up one bird. The bird's image in one section, its description another section and its territory map another section. It is my own fault for not investigating its contents more thoroughly.

But, there's no reason to put it in continual rotation on your CD player.Listen to the samples - musically, they will remind you of a Childrens' record (lyrically, they'll remind you of a locker room).If you feel you must buy a Stew CD and you aren't already a fan, start out with the first CD - Guest Host, which I feel is a little more commercial and stands up better to repeat listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst singer/songwriter I've ever heard!","review":"Is it possible to give negative stars?

How dare they play This Ol' Cowboy, such an earthy, heart felt song, in such a disco manner and even add a bunch of notes to the main riff. But the big disappointment was they only played ONE song showing the original members from the old days (Can't You See). That Band always was, and always will be for me, not about Doug Gray or that flute, but Toy and Tommy Caldwell standing up there like honorable old cowboys, playing with their thumbs (literally) and jamming with a sound they created and nobody else has ever imitated. It is a crying shame that they are both gone, what wonderful minstrels they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love MTB ... this is NOT good.","review":"I have nothing against a good band carrying on even after it has lost some of its members - I still love Lynyrd Skynyrd, for example.Sadly (and unlike the current Skynyrd line up), the current Marshall Tucker Band isn't worth the trouble on dvd or in concert.This DVD was terribly disappointing.

She refused to succumb to the atonal fascists and said: music is head and heart, don't put unnecessary yokes on a composer. So, she used dissonance and atonality well, but never became one of the boys, never became a slave to style. She wrote good music and waited for the world to get ready to accept it.

Fischer-Dieskau sings a dark, potent Count and Janowitz's Countess is without match.

From those earlier experiences I had drawn a certain image of Janacek that these CDs have forced me to reimagine. \\"On The Overgrown Path\\" is performed with such simple warmth that it is overwhelming. \\"Reminiscence\\", according to the CD jacket, was Janacek's final work. It is an historic half a minute. The two movement sonata - the last movement to which Janacek apparently tore to pieces and hurled into a river - is a wonderful blend of Czech morbidity and intermittent promise.

Their introductory chapter helps to make clear why these works are \\"new\\" institutionalism, and how they do not take identical views. The importance of culture and symbolism is given much greater emphasis in all of the papers/chapters than will be found in more economic analyses of organizations. Like all collected works, variability in style and intended audiences (or targets of criticism) requires more effort from the reader. The time is well worth the effort.

I've had it about a year now. The other 4 X 24 belt sander that I have used is the Porter Cable 362, but it weighs 20 pounds and it's like sanding with a Buick. Don't even think about using the Porter Cable on a vertical surface. The makita weighs about 8 pounds I think. Only improvement would be to include a case, but none of the belt sanders that I looked at had a case. The 9404 is hard to find in stores, I had to order it from Tool Crib. You won't be dissapointed.

There's also a pretty clever piece of Alice Drama in \\"Love's A Loaded Gun.\\"The other interesting note is that, in \\"Wind Up Toy,\\" little Steven wanders back into the nightmare.

It accurately forecasts one global macro-trend after another, and does so in a very lucid and straightforward manner.

Contradictions in the system COULD be very dangerous, as the author pointed out. His main critic is that we know what we have to do is more than just GDP's and consumption, but nobody wants to take any risks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Read","review":"This book was not meant for rabble or light weights. Mr. Thurow is a serious scholar with a serious piece of work, though his explinations are questionable. How, after all, is the fall of communism going to force a 4 day work week? Does the information superhighway really mean fewer blue collar jobs? Japan as the next great trading bloc? I don't think so. While scholarly in parts, it's hokey in other parts, and by the end, loses all continuity. It seems as though Mr. Thurow relies more on his reputation as a heavyweight scholar then he does reliable scholarship in this book. It wouldn't surprise me if Mr. Thurow was one of the few leading academicians still clinging to Marxism, because that's what this tract amounts to.

He did a good research about World Globalization, he blamed old people all around the world for the crisis in the Welfare State, he gave empty clues for solving this problems. Anyway, it's good to know the real face of Capitalism, as Marx had predicted a long time ago, but that had been held at bay by the Welfare State politics post World War II.

Today the Soviet Union is a country whose economic achievements bear comparison with those of the United States.\\" This was in 1989, just shortly before the Societ Union collapsed.

All these things are demonstrated by highly-ranked Chinese practicians or by the German Grandmaster Keith Kernspecht and some students of him. I don't think that it is possible for anybody to learn Wing Tsun by him(or her!)self only by reading this book. So to learn Wing Tsun you must join the WT-Organization of your country and then it will be easy for you to buy this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beginners Bible","review":"As a student of WT I found the book to be best suited to a beginner with a lack of the advanced programs, the hints and bits shown just being a taster. A more advanced version to supplement class training would be nice, all round a very good introduction to WT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Collectors' Item!","review":"Is it the book that has the \\"Digital RE-Mastered\\" picture showing \\"Grandmaster\\" Leung with Yip Man? A must for all serious Photoshop users!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"If you are ordering a product of this nature - it is extremely important to make sure the product you're ordering is in the language you speak. My son was very disappointed when he tried to play his new game and it was in Spanish. Not only had I ordered the wrong item, I didn't even notice when I took the packaging off. So, needless to say, this was a useless purchase as no one in our family speaks Spanish! Because it is a Leapster product I am sure it is a quality item, but unfortunately it is of no use to us and is unreturnable now as well. It would have been nice if the Spanish part was in bigger print, as I had no idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't speak spanish","review":"i'm sure this is great for a spanish kid and since i can't read spanish i figured it was giving me the american and spanish title. it should be listed as the spanish version. on top of that the place i bought it from\\"s return policy sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Although a great performance it can't surpass Horenstein....","review":"This performance of \\"Titan\\" is surely on of the best in the market but it's sure that the one of Horenstein's for Unicorn is the best ever. Although not a digital recording the sound is full and Horenstein has cought the sence of power that the music gives you. As an alternative I would recommend Bernstein's performance for DG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brahms Choral Works","review":"I have not received the product yet and more than this I can write. After receiving it only. For this I cannot rate the product but I hope it can be wonderful. wll, I rat it, one star only... Eduardo Xavier, Brasil."},{"rating":"2","title":"fresh,naturally flowing Mahler.","review":"Firstly,i'd like to commend the writer below who draws attention to this horrible critic called Cassidy who contributed significantly to Kubelik's downfall in Chicago....a truly miserable affair.Why is there an arts centre named in her honour??!!!Kubelik's Mahler stands the test of time very well (the most recommendable complete cycle on the market by some margin):there's a freshness and lyricicsm minus that self pitying streak which grounds so many Mahler interpratations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"This isn't the Mahler 1st with the finest orchestral playing and it certainly isn't the best recorded, but I listen to Kubelik's version more than any other. The third movement is a particular highlight - its mixture of the rustic, the grotesque and the beautiful hasn't been bettered, not even by Bernstein (well, that's what I think). Kubelik's impulsive, open-air approach to Mahler certainly works better in the 1st and 4th, than in, say, the 6th. This classic recording deserves its near-legendary reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime","review":"As a mere classical enthusiast I can't speak to the technical achievements of this recording, the best I can say is that it transports me to another world; sometimes terrible, sometimes beautiful beyond words. It's my absolute favorite musical recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dream","review":"Being a baker and having a tile counter top, I've been searching for something to enable me to be able to knead and roll out dough on. I came across this and thought why not give it a try. When I received it I was so very surprised. It lays out nicely on the counter top with no slipping whats so ever. It's large enough for the biggest pie crusts. It's a dream to be able to kneed dough without slipping. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever Pastry Mat","review":"Every once in a while you run into something special and this silicone pastry mat is my special find. I was in need of a new one-old one just wore out. I had been wanting to try the silicone ones but just never got around to it. I saw this one advertised by Amazon.com and I thought the price was right and it looked like a good one so I ordered it. It arrived in just a few days and when I opened it and went to use it I was impressed. It works like a dream, the pie crust doesn't stick the clean up was nothing and it has the sizes printed right in the mat. Thank-You for making such a wonderful product and making my life so much easier when making pies or noodles anything that needs rolling out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Was okay!","review":"This product served my need to measure out rolled dough. It really saves a lot of guessing. I recommend this to any of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, easy","review":"After struggling for years with waxed paper, marble, and all the rest, this mat is the answer. One time rollout, easy transfer to pie plate, easy wash up with warm water and soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smokin","review":"I bought this tool 2 days ago and am now returning it. I read the posts that mention it gets hot, but I had no idea how hot. I was simply polishing aluminum and smoke started coming out of this thing. Even before that you had to wear gloves because it was too hot to hold onto. This tool does not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Recording, Early DSD recording","review":"This CD comes without any copy protection craps from Sony. It utilizes recent Sony DSD mastering technique (Direct SBM). Sonic quality is superb. About the singer herself: She's awesome! A little bit harsh voice characterizes Keiko's performance as one of the top notch Jazz Singer. Try Track 14 (We Will Rock You) and Track 1 (Imagine). Centre stage and depth are well defined. Piano, bass and drums are open and they sound natural. Performance Rating/Recording Rating: 4.5/4Note: there is no SACD layer on this disc. Pure CD layer. However I must say this is a good mastered CD thus resulting in very good sonics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired","review":"Karajan and company radiate affection in every bar of this glorious music. Despite the sophistication of the playing, the rustic, Germanic roots of Haydn's invention are not lost. The commitment of the singing erases any suspicions that this line-up of soloists is too high-powered. Janowitz sings with an innocent purity that is disarming and the male soloists make fervent contributions too. I can't comment on this latest remastering but the earlier \\"Galleria\\" reissue sounds marvellous. The orchestra glows in the spacious acoustic; the sound of the flutes, in particular, gives me great pleasure. The only possible reservation is that the choral focus is slightly less than ideal (a bit 'scattered' at times). No matter, consider this recording essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Performance of Hadyn's Choral Masterpiece","review":"Moving, dramatic rendition of \\"Paradise Lost\\" transformed into choral work by van Swieten and Hadyn that has been appreciated over the years by audiences everywhere.Here exhibited in one of essential recordings of this work by Berlin Philharmonic and Karajan supplemented by fine soloists and Viennese Choir make this a clean, exuberant effort.The sensitivity to \\"Chaos\\" and the wide range of dynamics of this piece force utmost sensitivities from composer, performer and conductor. Especially appreciated the decision concerning death of Wunderlich and subsequent addition of Fischer-Dieskau.Awe inspiring work of master performed magnificently and recorded with clarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I loved Pollini's Chopin. So I was very glad when I found Pollini's Beethoven in the shop. Those late sonata are among my favorites and it seems it'll be magnificent.Alas... I couldn't find any musical note in these recording. Tempos are usually too fast for my taste and worse it doesn't contain any deep emotion lies in this great music.Kempf is still my best. For 32nd(which I love to the death) I like Michelangelli, Pogorellichi(?... spelling is quite hard to remember). Backhaus isn't my cup of coffee either.Anyway, Pollini is not. This is the worst recording of great late sonata of Beethoven I ever heard of."},{"rating":"2","title":"very intense music","review":"This recording features very virtuosic playing of what is some of the most brilliant music ever by Beethoven who is one of the most gifted creative people in history. The music is so thick, compelling, fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent set. Pollini at his best.","review":"I am a Pollini fan. I had the luck to hear him live in Athens, Greece, 4 years ago and then I bought these CDs (then available separetely). The Hammerklavier is the best around, that's an apsolute fact. I really like Arrau's account but this one is amazing. The op.111 also belongs to a category of its' own.
