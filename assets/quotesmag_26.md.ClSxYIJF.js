Although sleek looking and extremely usable, the readings are terrible; shallow, short, and redundant. The book aims to incorporate multiple literacies into the composition classroom, an idea I like and still think potentially fruitful. But \\"Seeing and Writing\\" never goes beyond putting a photo next to and essay and saying \\"compare.\\" If the essays had any rhetorical or intellectual richness this might not be such a bad idea.

The plot is decent and the action comes in healthy doses. And, as one reviewer noted, what's not to like about Madeleine Stowe(?), although she looks lost during all of the action scenes.

The good man (Colonel Candy) had been raised in a time of chivalry to always do the right thing in the right way with respect for the valor of his enemy, and how that was totally at odds with the task now in front of England, which was an all out war with Germany's Third Reich.Winston Churchill hated the idea of this picture because is seemed to be poking fun at him and the conduct of the war to date.

The only thing holding the shelves in place are a sort of gromet on a string onto which the shelf slides via slits in each corner of the plastic.

The Grieg Quartet is tuneful and very much in the spirit of the Brahms string quartets. The Sibelius is much subtler music than I'm used to hearing from the Finnish master: one could say \\"more intimate\\", but since his quartet is sub-titled \\"Intimate Voices\\" that evaluation becomes somewhat superfluous. The Nielsen was too shot to make much of an impression on me, and I beleive that the inclusion of one of Nielsen's stringquartets (he wrote 4) would have balanced the disc better: 3 great Nordic masters---3 string quartets. A very fine disc (and well deserving of its recent Grammy award)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner from the Emerson String Quartet","review":"The classical Grammy Award carries prestige (those for other genres are moot) and performances by the Emerson String Quartet have earned 6 such honors (the albums of two earned additional awards). Among them is Intimate Voices, the string quartets of Sibelius and Grieg. The members of the group are indeed supurb musicians (their Shostakovich quartets...another winner...are awesome) and the sound engineering of this recording is also excellent. String quartets through the ages have a unique sound with complex interactive play; they present unique challenges to the composer. Sibelius and Grieg wrote only one each, and while Nieilsen wrote four, only his mature last quartet has lasting merit. The Scandinavian feel is pronounced in these passionate, melodious, yet serious works, with folk tunes emerging in the Grieg and the Sibelius quartet reflective of his symphonies. Intimate Voices is a recording to own and experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one string quartet?","review":"Mr. Levine is sorely mistaken in the above review that Sibelius only wrote one string quartet. He wrote many, as can be discovered by a simple search on Amazon.As for the music, this disc is among my favorites. The Grieg is exciting but doesn't reward multiple listenings as does the rest of the album. The Sibelius, in particular, is full of beauty and complexity to be uncovered with each revisitation. The movements are united in subtle ways that take familiarity to recognize. For instance, the close relationship between the main themes of the 3rd and 1st movements.

It was boring, but we persevered through to the end of the game because we kept hoping that it would get better. It didn't. The camera angles are tight and inflexible. The challenges take no imagination and the spells are awkward. All spells are controlled by a series of directional moves on the \\"R\\" directional button and many of the combat spells use the same moves as the non-combat moves which leads to some confusion. Having Ron and Hermione trailing after him throughout the entirety of the game leads to endless occasions of becoming stuck in tight places because you can't get past them. There is virtually no interaction between Harry and many of the major characters such as Dumbledore, Hagrid, Professor MacGonaghall, etc. We were VERY disappointed with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let-down","review":"I, like so many others, bought this game expecting something exciting. This is the most boring Potter game ever. All you do is walk around while Hermonie and Ron get in your way. The tasks were incredibly lame. Moving the analog stick for control of the wand was not an improvement. The room of reward was pointless and it drove me crazy everytime Moaning Mrytle showed up. Her voice is annoying.I think that HP 4 has been the best game so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"El \\"Puma\\" sigue cosechando exitos!","review":"When living in Southamerica, I used to have several LP's of Jose Luis Rodriguez.

Numerous errors throughout the book that anyone could easily pick up, both spelling and conceptual. The cover says \\"Foreword by Eric Gunnerson\\" but I have yet to see any foreword, much less anything written by Eric G. But aside from that, it was a pretty informative book. With only a minimal amount of knowledge on the C# language and .NET framework, I was able to learn quite a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm perplexed by the positive reviews","review":"I bought this book because of all the positive reviews. What a mistake.It has almost 1000 pages, and yet has nothing. Simply amazing. There's not a single useful chapter in this book. All the code snippets are pathetically simple. Not only that, they have no context - i.e. they won't compile if you copy them because they're incomplete. The MSDN Help gives you much more than this book. And the author has the nerve to call them \\"No Toy Code\\". On top of that, that phrase is actually trademarked. What a joke! I don't understand the positive reviews at all. The apps these people build have got to be simple if they find this book useful. I hardly ever buy technical books because the MSDN Help is usually plenty for me, so I was counting on the reviewers to know what they're talking about. But this now puts some serious doubts in my mind about the book reviews here. I'm leery of them now."},{"rating":"1","title":"C# ok, but where is the .NET part?","review":"The book is a fair introduction to the C# language but it helps little with the .NET platform and even less with using C# + .NET to get things done. There is just a hint of interesting questions in the last two chapters, but Web Services are presented in a rather vague nutshell and space is wasted digressing about VS toolbox widgets instead of code examples.It was somehow infuriating to read the comment that debugging ASP.NET with the new Visual Studio is \\"easy\\" compared with the old Visual Interdev. In fact it is just as IMPOSSIBLE and even Microsoft's own documentation doesn't help at all. I guess the Redmond dudes still cannot fix the bugs in their debugging process. Oh well... <sigh>"},{"rating":"1","title":"MSDN is better so save your money","review":"I find the information in the book not very useful. The book was probably rushed and does not contain enough detailed information to solve my programming issues. I have to go to MSDN to learn how to it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good reference","review":"I saw the spate of good reviews this book got and purchased the same. Unfortunately, I seldom get whatever information I'm looking for in this book. This book covers very little ground and is probably suitable for a developer who has little development experience.I was hoping for a \\"reference\\" sort of book and a book which covers a lot of ground and I found: \\"Professional C#\\" to be most helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of faults","review":"Yes, this I couldnt say same good things as others. I never seen code, typing or graph error on other book. Also this book isnt a reference or tutorial or case study.

Needs to be rev'ed up.","review":"I tend to agree with other reviewers. This book is great. Or should I say \\"was\\" great. I bought it with a sticker that hides the beta 2 compatibility and says instead: \\"Updates for final release available NOW online!\\" Thanks, better than nothing, but not enough. I use this book as a desktop companion while programming with .NET and when I am looking for something, I need to:1) look at the book and the deprecated examples.2) go online and correct the example with the new API.This is not once in a while. All the Windows form examples need an update. System.timer won't work at all, etc... Pretty irritating. When the 2nd edition comes out, I'll be more than happy to get it and review it accordingly. In the mean time, you should be aware of this if you plan on buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the BEST for sure","review":"I downloaded all free online chapters of 13 books about c#. After reading a chapter or more of each. I've made my choice to this book because it is pedagogic and has a good teaching methods. This book nearly covers everything about c# and answerd all my questions related to c# on .NET Framework.I read that this book is not for beginners but I think it is undeniable for beginners. I recomand it for all level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to get you started","review":"This is a good book to begin with. However, there is too much information about GUI programming and GDI+ and very concise coverage of the topics like multithreading, networking, building custom controls, etc. I think these topics are more important than drawing lines and circles for any programmer. Anyway, it's good to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent starter","review":"A great first or second .Net book. It gives a great overview of many of the .Net technologies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - Refer to it all the time","review":"When I first got the book I didn't think too much of it. It did a good job explaining the concepts, was well written, and covered most of the topics I was interested in but nothing to get overly excited about. The real value of the book came when I found myself referening to it on a regular basis. It was very easy to look up a specific topic and get a quick example on its use. There always seemed to be some coverage of almost every topic I was interested in. I keep the book at home for use there, but have been searching for a similiar title for use at work. I am about to give up and just buy a second copy of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference, but it could be better","review":"A major part of the book comprises all C# features in a clear way but I think the author could have gone deeper. The rest of the book is a rather general description of all the other features of .NET Framework that an experienced programmer would find inadequate in some parts. Chapters 6 to 15 are simply too superficial for a professional programmer. It's a hard task to give a complete outlook of .NET Framework in a single book even if it's made up of more than 1000 pages, but, in my opinion, there is at least one other book (Professional C#) on this subject that does it better. If you have space in your bookcase and you are looking for as much information as possible on C# then buy this book, it could come in useful; otherwise you can certainly find something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I'll give Microsoft there dues, they try. The entire book is on CD Rom for easy searching and comes with a DVD of Visual Studio Evaluation Edition. It provides a good overview of the C# & VB .net languages but doesn't go deep enough and has too many mistakes. I don't know how anyone could expect to pass a certification exam using this book alone. If you want to learn C# get Andrew Trolesen's C# and the .NET Platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good reference for C# and .NET","review":"This was the only good book I found that explains C# in the Visual Studio .NET paradigm. The author jumps right into the core features of the language and does not waste time comparing C++ and C#. There is also a good deal of explanation about ADO.NET, ASP.NET and Web Services. Concentrating on the advanced features of ASP.NET would have made it complete, but I guess that needs a separate book on its own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but...","review":"- No chapter on the .NET XML types. Too bad...- Weak chapter on ASP.NET...Other than this, go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost enough","review":"It should be noted that this book is written with the assumption that you are an experienced programmer unfamiliar with .NET. That having been noted - There's plenty of information in this book to get you \\"up and running\\". However, don't expect this book to be your definitive source for any specific topic. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is the inequity with the intro to ASP.NET. It seems that the information in that chapter could have done without an intro to Web servers and HTML formatting and more focus on some features completely left out such as security(Forms authentication), Web User Controls, etc. There is enough information in this book on any given topic to get started figuring out most things on your own but it rarely delves into any advanced features. I would recommend this book as a collection of \\"tutorials\\" on C# and .NET - for those roles, I feel the book does a wonderful job."},{"rating":"2","title":"C# And The .NET Platform","review":"This is the most complete book I have read on C#. It does a very good job of explaining the language of C# and how the language fits into the entire .NET framework. The book includes concepts and practical application of those concepts. The author's style is clear and easy to follow, yet not overly simplistic.C# and the .NET Platform are two large subjects. As a result, some of the topics seemed rushed. But by the end of each chapter, I felt that I had a good grasp on what the author was trying to communicate.The focus is on C# and the .NET Framework, not Visual Studio's implementation of C#. As a result, I got a really good understanding of what is going on underneath the covers of the Visual Studio IDE. This has made using Visual Studio easier for me.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New!","review":"This book has nothing to add to the original. It is a waste of money.

And instead of throwing dehydrated onions into some water, the recipes actually have you dicing onions. For me, if I see a recipe has over 5 ingredients or the ingredients & instructions take up 2 pages, that makes me hate to cook !Needless to say, I was disappointed in the book as a recipe book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, laughed out loud!","review":"I remember my Mother using this book in the early 1960's.

This book is a gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Hate to Cook Book","review":"This is a great book that I think every kitchen needs. Bracken is humorous and talented in the way she wrote and the recipes she devised. The recipes contain common ingredients that most will have in their kitchen and if not, they are easy to go to the local grocery and buy. The book contains recipes for all occassions and a good variety so that you will not get bored eating the same things over and over. I commute an hour to and from work each day and it seems that when I get home, I spend my time cooking dinner, I eat, and then it is time for bed. I can't wait to try all these recipes to make my day a little easier and so that I will have more time after work for things I enjoy.

Who does that? Normally we just read the recipes that caught our eye in the table of contents. However, this cookbook was actually rather entertaining! Not only did it contain some easy recipes that could be thrown together (in many cases, literally), but the writing in between the recipes had me grinning and at some times laughing. The only thing I wish was different was that it was spiral bound to make keeping open a page easier. Otherwise, this one's a keeper for my cookbook shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it, but you don't want to eat this food","review":"This book is interesting as a window on what American housewives were dealing with, 50 years ago, and it made me realize how much American food and health-awareness has changed for the better! (And women's roles.) I enjoyed reading it as a cultural artifact. But the thought of making a steady diet of this food is pretty appalling. Nearly all the recipes are very heavy on the fat, salt, red meat, and cans of condensed soup figure heavily. The vegetables are canned. They should have at least removed added salt when they updated the recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best products made for a child","review":"My son loves this dvd story.

Now I see in the description further down on the page that it is only a 4x4 package. The picture truly gives an optical illusion that everything is larger so I never thought to look for the size.

My baby loved it from the first second on. He couldn't even really grab the first time I gave it to him. This ball was so easy to hold for him. It helped him learn how to grab and hold things. It is very soft and the thing I love most about it, is that you can put it in the dishwasher, boil it, sanitize it, whatever you want.I bought a similar looking one from another company but it was way to heavy and hard and I could not sanitize it at all, it started to melt.

As of now I have it all in a random box just to keep it all together. Having had one of these jewelry boxes as a little girl, I thought my daughter should have one too. I know she will love it because it's silvery outside with pink inside and it's cute and girly and has fairies all over it. She will also get a kick out of the music and twirling dancer.

This is certainly a \\"work\\" book that will take the \\"playing\\" out of your guitar sessions"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Music is supposed to be fun. Based upon that premise, this book is entirely worthless. Buy this book if you want to become a music snob that breaks everything down until it becomes unbeautiful. If you'd rather learn music through experience instead of locking yourself at a table with a pen and pencil, then skip this book. All it really is, is empty pages with diagrams for you to fill in.

I feel sorry for Arnold's students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Easy, but a great learning tool.","review":"This book is great if you really want to learn music theory from the ground up.

I highly recommend this book over other \\"easy music theory\\" books if you are a serious student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've read the good reviews here and thought I'll give this book a try.First of all, the quality of the book is pretty bad. It's almost impossible to read some of the diagrams. I wouldn't mind if it was a $5 book, but for over $30 I expected something different and much better quality.In addition, the buyer should be aware that this book very dull. It explains music theory in a very boring, straightforward way and will not let you practice any tunes while using it. It's just a workbook with many writing exercises, nothing more.It's probably good to the most serious students out there, but for me it will never be a pleasure to use this book as other books which actually teach you how to play between one theory to the other.I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are a really serious musician that is willing to spend much time on writing exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mysic Theory Workbook for Guitar, Volume 1","review":"If you are looking for a good read and lots of information stay away from these books.

Fortunately something goes wrong and these bugs evolve into some infinitely more deadly.

This may be Mira Sorvino's best work & a must-see for people interested in B-Horror movies as an artform. This isn't Shakespeare, but it's paint-by-numbers at the highest level. I'm glad it was such a success with the sequels, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mimic- The Director's Cut on Blue-Ray","review":"The addition of footage in this Director's Cut, while not significantly changing the story of the mutated Roaches, does add more of a human interest story to Miro Sirvino's and Jeremy Northam's characters. The transfer to Blue-ray is outstanding and the extras were well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars- once you're past slow start up and tons of promo's","review":"A definite upgrade from the SD DVD. A full two minutes for start up. Might not seem long if you're working, or on the phone, but if you're sitting in front of your TV, having inserted the disc, waiting, it's a long time. I began to wonder if I had a problem disc. Then, you get 16 minutes of promo's. It's nice that this product is reasonably priced. I guess it's a trade. Just keep a finger on the chapter skip button during the promo blitz. PQ is quite a good upgrade, handling the dark scenes well. The audio is reference quality, I mean if you have a home theater surround system, you're in for a treat. The director's cut version is enjoyable as well, with added footage, and a smooth, flowing re-editing job. The SD DVD had no bonus features. This new blu-ray is well equipped with excellent bonus features. Highly recommended for fans of this movie, and priced so cheap, a worthy buy for first time viewers as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie.","review":"Nothing to add that hadn't been said.

That means that it is not hard scifi. Of course, monster movies can be good, but their need at least a spark of originality or at least details that enable the viewers to suspend their disbelief.Some awful, unexplained things are happening, so the smart, tough, beautiful chick decides to investigate. She finds the monster, but is it destroyed? Tune for the sequel if it sells well enough. This is fine as background, time-wasting filler, but nothing original comes out of this whatsoever. Maybe I am getting old, but I thought this was a complete bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER clichéd genetic mutant movie!","review":"Boy, I'm tired of these kinds of movies. Completely unoriginal. A hokey premiss about an impossible mutation. Actors whose only emotion is annoyance. All the characters's actions are wrong and stupid actions. Lots of impossible, unworkable coincidences. The romantic leads survive, everyone else dies, just like in every other disaster movie ever made. This is probably the most slime-filled movie I've ever seen (Ghostbusters 2 may have had more slime, but it was FUN slime!).

Although you can predict who is gonna die and so on the anticipation of how he is gonna die and how the other characters are doing keeps you scared. The part when Mira Sorvino's character says that the bugs mimic us gets a weird kind of phobia inside you. You tend to be extra careful at night because your thinking that anyone that walks into your room might just be a monster. That explosion at the end was awesome. The guy who set it off survived because the blast knocked him into the water. The cop was very funny especially in that seen where the $hit is hanging from the ceiling aand he starts rambling."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good to me","review":"This is where Hollywood movies started to go wrong. Mimic stinks.Dramatic music for every action scene intended to make the film seem more important than it really is, a bad storyline that tries to succeed by covering it up with special effects, and poor acting all around.The only part I liked was the predictable segment where the one woman was examining a baby roach (that was actually huge) and it jumped up and pinched her hand. Other scenes throughout the film just felt really exaggerated.It's not a scary movie, it's not gripping, and it's not particularly good either. It features a slow build-up type of suspense that misses the mark more than anything else. Perhaps a less exaggerated storyline could have saved it, but I have a feeling it *still* would have been boring because of the slow pacing in the beginning and the overly dramatic soundtrack. A perfect case of Hollywood special effect abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb creature feature","review":"I have reviewed \\"Mimic\\" before but here's the bluray review. \\"Mimic looks amazing on bluray. Filmic, light grain , and terrific color saturation. The SD version of the movie had the quality of a TV movie; artificiallly brightened and color timed...this is the definitive version, The \\"Director's Cut\\" mainly includes additional character bits and some bits of plot. These add texture to an already great film. The 1080p image is superb, but the sound is amazing...pulsing, ambient, and loud...this version is miles above the SD version. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgustingly boring","review":"I rented this movie one day, watched it, and absolutely hated it.This has to be the most predictable, poorly written \\"suspense\\" movie I've ever seen.

Hearing the plot before seeing the movie can make people assume it will not be any good, I mean, come one, cockroaches!? But one should never assume, because Mimic gives the chills, despite the somewhat unsatisfying ending. The scenes throughout the movie will make up for that.

It also works as an affecting lament for a new generation that wanly mimics the commitment of its predecessor, a commitment whose missteps led inexorably to the detachment and cynicism it decried.Incidentally, Jason's fixation on the Beach Boys is not a needless digression. It's a crucial link between his mother's past and his present. The Beach Boys represent a wide-eyed youth that serves as the vessel on which Jason negotiates between the Scylla of his mother's wrecked idealism and the Charybdis of the arch hipness of his peers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I bought this book because the NY Times recommended it.

I ended up being right and I got one packet, for which I seriously overpaid. When you can buy an actual box of 40 of these same warmers from another vendor here on Amazon and pay $37.50, it means I paid 5x the cost.

This book, set completely on Kelewan, delves into the matters of honor, clan and The Great Game, only touched upon in the Riftwar Saga.I know that some find this book boring. For some reasons many fantasy fans have trouble getting into books with female protagonists. However, garnering a better understanding of the Tsurani made me appreciate the Riftwar Saga even more.

OK, I lied, I am 30 now, so it was more than several...Anyhow, I absolutely loved the books. My only caveat- read them only AFTER you have read the Feist Riftwar saga, at least in part. There is much in this series that is explained in the Riftwar series that might be confusing otherwise.Other than that, I have to say I think this series was actually a better read than Feist's solo shot.The mix of fantasy with Eastern culture is fascinating, and the world-building was superbly done.All in all, a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Rather surprised at all the golden reviews - what's so good about it? There's only one main character, which is usually boring in itself, and Mara's as uninteresting as they come, while the rest of the characters are 2D in the extreme. There's not enough magic to be interesting, yet the whole thing is if anything TOO implausable. It bears more relation to one of my Gran's Catherine Cookson novels than Rift or Serpent War. Is co-authorship ever a good idea?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good attempt, but flawed.","review":"I must give this book credit. I'm a modest fan of Feist, and I think Wurts does bring a good perspective to his work and weaves in some intelligent politics into the story. I also enjoyed the three-dimensional characterization of the female protagonist, as too few fiction books have them.However, \\"Daughter\\" is not a great book as a whole. The politics, while decent, are nothing new, and theplot is a bit contrived in order to fit in all of the twists. Second, the \\"culture\\" is really just a mish-mash of other cultures and nothing unique. In fact, it's actually quite boring, and the book suffers for it. Finally, none of the characters are very likeable. The authors have done such a good job creating a dreary, harsh world, that none of the characters can get by without doing some very ugly things themselves.Ultimately the work is nowhere near as engaging or epic as it could have been, and ends up as a fairly weak novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous story that keeps you wanting more","review":"The first book in a great trilogy, at the end you really need to know where the story continues.

One book, thats fine, but THREE books on nothing but her judgements and decisions? And to make things even less disbelievable, she always makes the perfect judgement. She always knows what to say, and how to thwart her enemies. The all perfect ruler basically.It gets tiresome and tedious to read.

The culture and politics are all so well written and believable. You really feel like a part of the story.I first read this about 10 years ago, and recently re-read it, which is something I rarely do, and it was just as good the second time.

Where is the author who wrote Beloved Enemy one of the best romances I have ever read? I read The Bachelor List and started the Bride Hunt but couldn't get past the first few pages. The Duncan sisters are too unlikeable and the heros are 1 dimensional. How could Constance and Max from Bachelor List even like each other let alone fall in love. I can't overlook the dishonesty of the sisters who in today's world would be in jail for misrepresenting themselves as a charity! In the future I will be more wary of Ms. Feather's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Feather is no Jane Austen","review":"There were three story lines in this book, and none of them were very interesting. The story of the three sisters' relationship to each other and their matchmaking service had the potential to be amusing (as a similar story was done so well in Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice), but instead was lifeless and plodding. The second story about the civil suit and trial was trite and unrealistic. And the third story, the romance between Gideon and Prudence, suffered from a lack of development. They didn't spend much time together as a couple because Prudence was always with her sisters or working on the newspaper or trial.Altogether, this book put me off Jane Feather. I doubt that I'll try another one of Feather's books anytime soon, if at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAPTIVATING","review":"I have read all three in this triology (I love sequels)... This one was my favorite in the set but only because the secondary story was so very captivating! I couldn't wait to see what the outcome would be!! GREAT JOB!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Stephanie Laurens...","review":"One of the most boring book I've read this year. The story revolves around 3 sisters, who all seemed just uninteresting. People you wouldnt care to know and there was way too much interaction between these gossipy sisters.....This book was a bit like regency chic lit, except it was really boring and without a hint of humor.Meet a heroine who is a book-wormy type, who wears glasses and who prefers dull, serious clothing. How very dull. The hero seemed interesting enough, and yet again unexciting because I didn't believe in their chemistry.If you enjoy what Stephanie Laurens is writing these days, you might actually like this book. I grab her books to read when I am trying to fall asleep. Yes, its that engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bride Hunt","review":"This was part of a series. As I have read all three books and was pleased and had alot of laughs in the reading. if you have read any I would say read the rest if not read them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved this book! Prudence has to go to court to protect her father and the family newspaper, while at the same time keeping her identity a secret. The only part I didn't like ***SPOILER*** was when Gideon's ex showed up. I didn't really think that added to the plot at all. I would have been happier if it had been left out all together. Other than that, it was highly satisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't suggest this book","review":"I recently bought this book, and then promptly returned it. The opening line of the preface is an unclear, run-on sentence, which concerned me right from the start, and the book is generally overwritten, devoid of proper punctuation, and repetitive. As a result, I feel that using this book to teach writing might be like getting your cat to teach you how to swim. My family did have fun suggesting alternative titles before settling on \\"Any Child Can Write As Well As Me Do\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"no price","review":"I can't seem to find a price listed for this item. Is it FREE??? You might sell some if you listed the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I picked up this book, thinking it would be a fun to send my daughter who is in Europe on a student exchange, for Halloween.I was disappointed to see, not only that the vast majority of the book was about NYC, but that, in the one story about our city, the name was consistently spelled incorrectly (Binghamton does NOT have a P in it). This lent zero credibility to the rest of the book.Being a life long resident of the area, I still could not figure out where the stretch of highway the author was referring to was. After researching the local 'lore, I was able to figure the story out, but not from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The VERY Basics","review":"Do not buy this item unless you need to understand the very basics about relating. This would be good for someone who has no idea about how relationships work (and they are out there, but they likely have no desire to read a book like this, which is sad because they need it the most). But, if you do have some idea, you will get frustrated by the simplicity because it will be stuff you already know. So, go for something more complex and deeper. Give this to your cold, affectless partner who doesn't understand what you mean when you try to talk to him/her about your feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought this book would of been a good investment because I wanted to try a new publisher to the Cisco World. This book was disappointing, the authors did not seem to have any writing experience and the organization of this book was confusing. Oh sure it had errors, all books do but they seemed a bit to obvious so that was disappointing because basic concepts should be second nature by all CCIE candidates at this point. To bad the authors are not CCIE's or they would of know this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment","review":"I was at first heartened to see a newcomer to the Cisco Certification publishing arena so I immediately purchased this book. However I concerned when I realized all the authors it had and I was unimpressed when I started reading it. The 'voice' of the book is inconsistent from chapter to chapter so I never knew what to expect. That is *not* a feeling I want when preparing for a such an important like the CCIE test. I could deal with these issues however the technical inaccuracies remind me of the Giles CCIE Book from McGraw-Hill. If you can't get Proxy ARP correct..... I doubt everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brian X Barretto (CCNA,CCDA,CCNP,MCSE,MCSE+Internet)","review":"A total disappointment Cisco should ban these books for the following reasons 1)It just gives an overview just enough to pass a CCNA exam 2)The CD ROM does not contain challenging questions the CCNP exam had more challenging questions than the CD ROM 3)It gives you a false sense of achievement making you feel that reading this book is all that there is to Pass believe me I have done a number of cisco certifications and it is not that easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money!","review":"The book is a sketchy, high level overview. The CD test is the real reason I bought this book, and that proved to be very disappointing. Multiple obvious errors on simple topics, which means none of the test info can be relied upon.None of the authors names are displayed with their certifications - guess after turning out such a lousy product they are keeping a low profile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough","review":"Book covers all topics, but not in enough depth. Practice test on the CD is MUCH easier than the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"This was an ideal addition to the kitchen. The 5 inch size is perfect for smaller pans, when you want to fry smaller batches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the 7 Inch, not this one.","review":"I'll admit it, I wasn't paying attention to the size and reviews when I ordered. I thought it would be bigger and it's my fault for the 1 star rating. I hold myself accountable, not the product.Ignore all the reviews where everyone says, \\"I'm glad I didn't get the bigger one.\\" I can only assume they're speaking out of buyer's remorse too. Well, I'm not shy to admit I have remorse and wanted the bigger one.Look, if you you boil your pasta in 9.5\\"+ pot like most everyone in the modern world then the 7 Inch spider fits better. The whole purpose of this device is to get as much as possible with one scoop to supplicant the use of a strainer or Colander.The 5\\" spider is still a well made piece for the price. If you truly want a 5\\" spider then buy with confidence and in your mind my review can be that of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every cook's kitchen should have one","review":"This is FABULOUS! It's very well constructed ~ solid and sturdy. It's also dishwasher safe! What more can you ask for? The holes are small enough so your food doesn't drop through, yet large enough so oil quickly and easily drains. No kitchen should be without one of these! This is truly a quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this skimmer!","review":"A skimmer is the sort of handy tool to have in the kitchen that you don't think about until right at the moment when you need it, and then breathe a sigh of relief when you can immediately produce it. This is so cheap that it belies the quality of the piece. It works perfectly. The handle and basket are just the right size for...everything. I used it a few weeks ago to fry doughnuts. I've used it several other times but the examples aren't coming to mind. It really doesn't take up too much space in my utensil drawer because the handle isn't too big and other things just sort of tuck under the basket part."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 in Asian Style Spider/strainer","review":"I like the stainless steel webbing that seems to be very durable. Large enough when I am cooking YaKiMondo/dumplings in oil (deep frying) it works well and large enough to remove several items at a time when they are done."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't conceptualize dimensions well","review":"This product was exactly what I was looking for. I needed a good deep fry scoop and anything Alton Brown uses is good for me. But this is too big for the homestyle, stove top projects I do. The handle is very long and heavy, the basket is a bit large for maneuvering in a medium/large cooking pot.I can't read dimensions and conceptualize how big something really is, so the size part of the problem is my fault.This product is exactly what the description says it is.The wiring connecting the handle to the basket isn't easy to hand wash, and I figure if something breaks it will be at that joint. When it breaks I will buy another spider like this, but I'll make sure it is smaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality spider","review":"I needed a kitchen spider, and after shopping around in some grocery stores, I couldn't find one that had a sturdy enougy handle. This is pretty much exactly what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Made","review":"Quick shipping well packed good value. Most people in their reviews speak about frying but we got this for boiled pasta. We used it with medium shells and it worked well. I was concerned about cleaning it but it worked out OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Skimmer","review":"This skimmer is of sturdy construction and seems to be rugged enough to last for years with proper care. It's aesthetically pleasing in the way it's constructed the skimmer itself is stainless steel with bamboo handle. I would buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great spider!!","review":"this is a great product. I really like the size and craftmanship. It's put together well and cleans up nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and great","review":"it's great. I use it to remove noodles from boiling water or stuff from my deep fryer. I highly recommend this strainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 5 inch model is the way to go!","review":"While looking at this product, I came across other models that were larger. Based on some of the other reviews I decided to go with this model, and I was glad that I did.It really is the perfect size for its intended purpose - to remove items that have been frying in oil, OR to remove pasta from boiling water. It does a great job for both.The construction seems sturdy and well built, and I like the wooden handle because it stays cool to the touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kitchen value for money!","review":"I can't believe how often I use this thing!!! We started experimenting with cheese making this last year, and I got it because it was taking forever to get all the curds out. (We made big batches!!)Then we used it when canning green beans. And when making potatoes, or spaghetti sauce with meatballs... you name it. It is PERFECT when cooking a chicken until it falls apart. This tool gets out every bone, every time- leaving only the broth. The holes are substantial enough that the water drains off instantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I was taking an Italian cooking class and my instructor had this kitchen utensil. I had searched high and low for this in stores and couldn't find it so I placed the order on Amazon. To my luck, this tool is great for dipping out the pasta which includes some of the pasta water rather than rinsing with a strainer. This allows the sauce to stick a bit better on the pasta. To my enjoyment, this utensil is now everywhere I turn. The price is awesome on here and very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems funny locking","review":"Actually is funny looking but it serves the purpose like u wouldnt believe great for turning over deep fried foods and then strain them on the way out.. Would have preferred everything made of metal but for the price I understand.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kitchen tool","review":"I bought this when I saw Alton Brown use one on TV. You don't just have to use this for frying, I used it to scoop out boiling ravioli and it was a cinch to use. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally forgettable, Unfortunately","review":"I really liked Platypus' Ice Cycles (at least the first half). This one is, however, forgettable. It has a few good licks but nothing catchy tyhat I remember like \\"Better Left Unsaid\\" from Ice Cycles. I think I listened to this CD two times max."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWISH","review":"I'll buy anything Rod Morgenstein plays on. This time, he's with John Myung(Dream Theater) and Ty Tabor(King's X) and as you might guess, this is wonderful. Tabor did most of the writing, so you get that Beatle vocal feel with a lot of muscle.

Production is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contour Butterfly 3-in-1 Massage pillow","review":"For using just to keep your heels off the bed, it's great. However, the battery container has to be pulled out of its glued in posistion in order to insert batteries (bad design) and the battery connections fall out and/or disconnect every time you move the pillow to a different position. (bad design)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Junk","review":"This item is a piece of junk. I had a hard time opening the battery box. Once I did get it open and had put the batteries in, it was very hard to close. I gave it an extra push, and the batteries popped out, along with the springs, and the battery box itself got a crack in it. Thus, the massage is unusuable. The item is not worth the price. I have returned it for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy At All With This Contour Pillow - A Waste of Money","review":"I ordered 2 of these pillows for my husband and me. They were very hard and they almost felt like bricks. The motor would not work on the massager so my husband had to pull out his tool kit and it finally worked. It is so bulky that we couldn't use it at all. The only reason we didn't send it back was that we thought it would be unsanitary if they were to resell it later. So we threw them away."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"Very poor quality - definately not worth the cost. The massage function is as good as useless - pillow itself a good shape to use, but way overpriced for what it is"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD","review":"I bought this as a gift for my dad he has had surgery on both knees and will probably have more as well as his ankles, I seen this knee pillow and it had a built in massager and it opened up for support for both knees.

Good product for ANYONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contour Butterfly Massage Pillow","review":"I have arthritis and fibromyalgia, and this pillow helps with pain in my knees, upper legs, and lower back. The shape of the pillow helps it stay in place better than regular pillows do, and the massage action relieves some of the stiffness in my knee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I never thought I would say \\"boring\\" about a historical novel so well researched and based solidly on fact. The characters never come alive for me - there is no one I can \\"root\\" for. The detail is simply overwhelming - you can't see the forest for the trees. The graphic sex I could do without.I studied Latin many years ago and found the characters and setting quite familiar, and indeed, looked forward to reading more of Miss McCullough's books in this series.In my humble opinion, Miss McCullough should write either history, biography, or novels that are true literature. This one fails on all fronts.I read for escape, entertainment, education, enlightenment or elucidation. Time is short and there are so many readable good books yet to read. This book is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a soft core description of Caesar's private life","review":"If you realy want to know who was Caesar and what he accomplished in his life, dont waste your time on this book. However, if you like reading about love affairs in various setups, this book is not worse than others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too long!","review":"I found this book too long and sometimes difficult to understand. However McCullough has a very good style to recount historical facts and one can learn a lot from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad, but the series continues to decline","review":"I really enjoyed the First Man in Rome, and while I still follow the series and moderately enjoy reading the stuff, it's certainly not a patch on Robert Graves for quality of writing or Suetoneus, Plutarch, Asimov, or any of the many good histories of Rome as history. If you have a real enthusiasm for the period, the setting alone may well overcome the absurdly modern dialogue and the considerable obviousness of the plot development - and the book is by no means bad. However, in my opinion the imagination and the thoroghly researched historical setting, which were the hallmarks of the first book, have declined considerably in subsequent volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking in its Erudition","review":"As Regis Professor of Classics at Christ Church College, Oxford with special interst in the late republican period of Rome, I found this book, which may appear at first to be simply the ramblings of a lady novelist, to be a marvellous tome which demonstrates the author's great breath of knowledge about the period while infusing it with the passion and excitment which must have coursed through those tumultuous times. This book is quite simply breathtaking, and my colleges and I at Oxford look forward to her next edition. Floreat - May she Flouish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It's truly a master piece. Mrs McCullough made an extensive research and everything she writes is very accurate. Her interpretation of events is really witty and her style captures entirely the attention of the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magnificent addiction!","review":"The four books in the Masters of Rome series by colleen McCullough are insidious. You buy the Hard cover to read it as soon as it comes out...then you buy the paperbacks as well so you can have them as you travel...then you end up with the books on tape so you can listen in the car. Better history than the history I read for my degree. Better novels than most others. I literally cannot wait for the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very quick AF, but creeps","review":"Very practical zoom range for everyday use.Picture Quality:Very good picture quality in every aspect.Auto Focus:I must say the auto focus is amazingly quick. Of course, at poor contrast objects it might keep hunting nervously but not within long distance.Negative:Zoom is not internal, so it extends.

I am a nurse in a doctor's office and get my pressure taken there, but I have to find time for someone else to take it. Wanted a home one so I could also see if there is a difference when not stressed at work. It is very finicky about positioning. The most frequent reading is \\"Error\\".

So much so that if you pay attention to its readings you will end up with high blood pressure even if you don't start out that way. Unless you sit with the monitor exactly level with your heart or lie down while taking your reading, the monitor will almost certainly give you a high reading. Stand while you use it and the reading may convince you to call 911. Of course one should sit still, relax, all that good stuff while taking a blood pressure reading, but this monitor forces you to a degree of stillness that is almost mummy-like.I love the idea of the convenience and size of a wrist monitor but this model is just too fussy for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely inaccurate Blood Pressure Monitor","review":"The Blood Pressure Monitor is absolutely inaccurate.

Every time I have drank the tea, I get a pain in my diaphragm like I have to burp but can't. I thought it was something I ate so I tested the theory. I quit drinking the tea and felt okay, I have drank the tea every few days without changing anything else in my diet, and every time I have drank the tea the same thing occurs.Not sure if this has happened to anyone else while drinking this brand. I probably should buy some other Pu erh and try it but I'm a little hesitant now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pu-erh Tea","review":"I bought this tea because it supposably helps shrink fat tissue.

But....This story should have been shorter and more conclusive. I know the intent is to have a sequel, but a sequel is usually a second full story following the original. This reads more like a bad serial, one story stretched into two (or more) books just for the sake of money.Like most avid readers, I am looking for 1) a good read 2) a book length that suits the story 3) a story that can stand on its own. Remember, Dune had sequels (some very good) but the main story holds up even if you only read the first book.Sequels have gotten out of hand, so many books are now barely an outline when a sequel is already in the works. Writers are wasting time, paper, reader's money....nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis is back","review":"Fans familiar with the Star Trek movies will recognize the title of the book from events in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn. This book takes the Genesis Device to a whole new level. Someone has stolen the Genesis Device technology, and weaponized it! Along with the technology that was stolen Dr. Marcus is also taken from her secret Federation facility for unknown reasons. Terror reigns on the scale that no one ever dreamed, not just planetary but against entire solar systems. It seems that the Genesis Device works flawlessly, but who started it? And why?This book is thoroughly enjoyable and a blast to read. It ties in story lines from the original Star Trek and the Next Generation seamlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but gets basic facts wrong.","review":"The Genesis Wave Book 1 has a good story line but it has flaws.Firstly why the 6 month wait for book 2 to come out?Secondly I agree this could have been made into 1 book. the only reason for it to be a 2 parter is greed.Thirdly it makes mistakes with its description of the defiant class ships, for example it says the bridge is on deck 2 while it is on deck 1. The crew of a Defiant class ship is said to be 10 when it is approximatly 45-50 and these are just a couple of errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Unlikely","review":"John Vornholt forgets one of the most important aspects of Star Trek - you have to make the science believable. The problem with the Genesis Wave is that waves cannot travel faster than the speed of light. Vornholt nowhere explains how the wave travels at warp speed. Also, when it goes through a star system it seems to slow down (also unexplained). Lastly, it threatens earth but originates from a far corner of the Federation. It would take months (if not years) to travel that distance at the highest warp speeds. Vornholt does not offer an explanation for this either. This was one of the most disappointing series of Star Trek books that I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"More \\"Science\\" Than Fiction","review":"The Genesis technology and its creator, Dr. Carol Marcus, have been taken by unknown beings and the technology is being used to destroy a large part of the galaxy unless it can be stopped by the Enterprise crew. Geordi is part of a romantic triangle with his dream woman Leah Brahms & a very interesting geologist. Riker and Deanna are still a couple; she beams down to a soon-to-be-destroyed planet to rescue him. Worf does not appear, as he is probably on Deep Space Nine. However, there is just too much \\"science\\" and not as much plot as I would like, as there was in one of my least favorite Next Gen books, Dyson Sphere, which is why I have given this book four stars instead of five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch adventure","review":"John Vornholt is one of the best of the \\"Trek\\" writers. His earlier TNG novel, \\"Rogue Saucer\\" would have make a killer episode. Here he returns to the Genesis Device, the destroyer/creator from the \\"The Wrath of Kahn.\\" Try as the Federation might to erase it all, the technology exists, and someone has loosed it upon the galaxy. It's up to Picard and Co. to stop it before it kills billions more by destroying inhabited planets. The story plays out at a break-neck pace which makes it hard to put-down (and hard to wait until April 2001 to see how it finally ends). Discussions of the political effects of the Genesis Device's existence are clever, and the character dialogue rings true. And Geordi might even get a chance with his obsession, the lovely scientist Leah Brahms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Comp From An Underappreciated Label","review":"For the money (some vendors sell for under $10), the Solar Disco Box is an excellent bargain.

According to the Seven Mary Three site, Rock Crown is a personal favorite of the band, and by no doubt, it is highly creative. Every song has its own personal feel to it, although some songs may be too solemn, or too deep for the mainstream audience to fully appreciate, perhaps this is why Seven Mary Three isn't as acknowledged as they should be.As with solemnity, some songs are indeed very slow and filled with emotion that such slowness can accompany-- songs such as Oven and Lucky-- and this might not be accepted by listeners who prefer the more upbeat 7M3 songs reminiscent of hits like Cumbersome and Water's Edge from the previous album.Rock Crown is an album loaded with creativity and individuality. It definitely stands out from the other 7M3 albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Great As AMERICAN STANDARD!","review":"I don't understand why 7M3 is not more popular, as they are an outstanding band. Unlike the reviewer from Ontario, Canada, the singer's gravelly voice moves me to my very soul! It's almost unheard of these days for ANY CD to have more than two or three good songs (if you're are lucky). Both American Standard and Rock Crown more than surpasses that number (I haven't heard Orange Ave). No doubt about it, the best song on this CD is HONEY OF GENERATION ! ! ! The minor chords in the song is pleasantly haunting. May 7M3 keep on rocking for a long, long, time. Thanks 7M3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone away from the old, and got lucky","review":"Their second album was a BIG evolvment from \\"American Standard\\". Jason Ross uses his voice and lyric writting abilites in a much more suiting manor. The song that got this album atention, and one of my favortie 7M3 songs, \\"Lucky\\" is the perfect choice for the start of the album. It is a preveiw of what you'll be hearing. Emotinal ramblings would be the best way to discribe this album. The lyrics are witty and very honest to human spirit and nature. My only complant about the album would be some of the songs seem incompleate. Like \\"Gone Away\\" for instance. The emotion in that song is incredable. But it ends just as it draws you in. The songs that do leave you with a compleated feel, such as \\"Lucky\\", \\"Oven\\", and \\"Times Like These\\", are nothing short of amazing. With thier talents for song writting only improving in their third release \\"Orange Ave.\\", I look forward to their next album due late this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is a struggle to listen to","review":"Musically I guess some parts of the cd are alright but it just does not go together properly.

I make smoothies and salsa daily and replaced the Tribest with another personal blender. Initially, I was very impressed with the sharpness of the blades and the ease of how well everything blended. This blender, however did not last long, I assumed I had done something wrong and purchased another. The new one worked for only three weeks when things started to fall apart. Over the next 4 months I had multiple parts replaced (I will say the customer service was good and quick to send replacement parts). I followed the directions meticulously (not blending more than 60sec ect), however in less than one year the thing fell apart again. I will NOT purchase this one again, am going back to the Magic Bullet.

This is a phenomenal blender. It is compact, travels well and works perfectly. I love it for my pre-workout shake and also for my post workout shakes. It is fast and efficient and cleans up quickly. Great quality product that is redefining the blender world for people who are on the go and busy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the first one so much I bought a second.","review":"My 16 oz. cup is on my desk as I write this. After doing my research I settled on this little blender and it was the best purchase I've made twice this year. I bought one blender for home and a second one for work. Every few days I make a pot of coffee, add some sugar and freeze it in the ice cube tray. In the morning I fill my cup with as many cubes as possible and some milk and cap it. When I get to the office I blend it for a nice frappuccino. I also took my blender to the beach and made smoothies and pina coladas for my girlfriends. It is so easy to clean that I didn't mind making different flavors for each friend. With only 2 pieces to clean it is a dream among appliances!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold up","review":"I got this blender with high hopes of really having something with staying power. I got it about a year ago and it is already headed to the junkyard.

I wouldn't buy another Tribest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Personal Blender","review":"I am very disappointed in this product because it is not capable of performing the task of creating smoothies as described in the advertisements. I tried using it with fruits and greens but it left tiny pieces of the fruits and greens in the drink, and it was not enjoyable to drink.

I bought it to blend breakfast smoothies....nothing fancy....just some protein powder and soy milk. I even bought the larger cup. The unit is very, very under powered. Did NOT mix the ingredients. Had to transfer everything to my larger, more \\"industrial\\" blender. Would not recommend this unit for any serious blending. Save your money or put it towards a better unit. This product is a rip off. Does not even do the most basic blending of a liquid and a powder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description Misleading","review":"Be aware that the description of contents on Amazon's site describes the PB-200 which has 2 8oz chopping cups. If you look CAREFULLY at the ID number it mentions PB-100 which does not include these items. The only way you would know this is wrong is if you went to the MFG site and researched the product ID. So you will NOT receive the 2 smaller cups. Also, the 16 oz size is not as much of an issue as the poor narrow design which makes it difficult to make anything if you are adding ice. The ice will take up space before chopping and not allow as many liquids as 16 ozs should handle. If you want to make anything substantial you better plan on order the XL container."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT little blender","review":"This little guy is easy to use, easy to clean, and very powerful. Uses very little space on the countertop. If you have a fridge that can dispense chopped ice, use that in the blender--it'll be easier on it. If not, don't fill your mixing cup with cubes of ice. I chipped the base of the mixing blade doing that and had to get a replacement. Besides, the blender adds so much volume to your smoothie that you don't need much ice, anyway. I've had it for over a year, and I don't go a day without using it. Cleanup is SO SO VERY EASY!!! I'm very happy with this blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reimagining Christianity","review":"Bought this book for an after church discussion group.

If I have more than a couple applications open, firefox internet brower and an excel spreadsheet for example, the printer will not have enough memory to properly print the desired page. A solid black page results, of course you have no warning, that there will be a problem so its trial and error. I have wasted a vast amount of toner printing these solid black pages because of this. If you do buy this printer, you should close running applications before printing.

Similar to the other reviews, the printer worked okay when connected to my computer's USB port. However, the device will NOT work with a Linksys wireless print server. The Linksys does not detect that the 2400W is attached to it. Whether this is a 2400W or Linksys quirk, I don't know. (Linksys tech support confirmed that some printers are not compatible.) But they are both getting returned to the store. The 2400W manuals are horrible ... and the phone number listed for tech support connected to a wrong number. Bottom line: terrible documentation, poor construction, lousy design.

My problem is with the printer itself and the fact that once it has an error...consider your entire print job lost.You get what you pay for. With this printer, you'll quickly find that out once you lose a few important documents.This will be my last Konica/Minolta printer. I don't have the time or resources to see a document lost after going through all of the motions it takes to get this printer to operate.Caveat Emptor...Enough said by me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor engineered and designed","review":"Printer is extremely noisy. Like other oldies, it needs to warm up for a while before printing. During the warm up process, the printer clicks, clicks, ticks, ticks, and makes lound noise that could wake up your whole family during the night. Paper jam is constant due to poor engineering of the paper pick up mechanism. After dealing with paper jam problems for a while, you will get sick and tired of this printer. Frequent pulling of the jammed papers out of the roller, will damage the sensor and thus making the paper jam error becomes permanent. One last thing, the cartridge is insanely expensive. The cost of these toners is more than buying a new color laser printer of other brands. At this writing, this printer has been long discontinued. However, do not buy this printer if you find it somewhere else or you will regret it. (I guessed those engineers/ designers of this printer have also been fired)"},{"rating":"1","title":"20 lb paper and nothing else","review":"Decent color. Noisy, slow, and will NOT accept anything heavier than 20 lb paper. If that's all you use then it is an ok printer.

As a number of reviewers have mentioned, printing on any kind of quality paper confuses the Konica, which will go into \\"jam\\" mode and not feed the paper properly.

This is sporadic and I have not found a way to \\"jimmy\\" the way the paper feeds to correct it.The print color quality is very good.. but so what, since you can get it to feed decent paper (i.e. 24 lb or 28 lb stock)It is also the noisiest printer in existance.Fianlly, the paper tray is very flimsy and juts out..easy to snap or break.

I have called support twice and been told: you can't use it with non windows xp software (you can- I figured it out myself), you can't print on post office postcards, you can't print on laser checks, you can't print on most anything! I find it jams constantly (except that letter paper!) and it's brain scrambles every time envelopes are printed (which it mangles fairly well- and yes, I move the little buttons back to do it!)requiring that it and the computer be shut down before it will work again.

I HATE IT. Yes, it prints out pages rapidly and has been a \\"workhorse,\\" I suppose, but not a well-behaved one - and certainly not an inexpensive one. While the initial price tag was attractive, I have spent an average of $600-700 PER YEAR for print cartridges etc - the cost of supplies alone has exceeded the original value of the printer many, many times over. I have found that the lifetime of the cartidges is far less than advertised - even for the high capacity cartridges. The printer is loud, fussy, messy, and the print quality is just okay. I'm taking my useless piece of technology to the trash heap momentarily ... and believe me, I will be celebrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is being returned","review":"I did my homework and read many reviews. Not one mentioned that you can not share this printer. I didn't need network ready, but I do need to share with my home network. This is an important consideration and should be noted in the specifications.Also, no one mentioned that to print an envelope I would have to remove all the paper, open the cover, adjust 2 levers, close the cover, load the envelope, print and do it all again to replace the paper. What a hassle!One last complaint, and I read about that one. This is one very noisy printer. Don't expect to print while you are on the phone. Neither of you will be able to hear.On the plus side, the print quality was good.Overall, the negatives are not worth the cheap price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"After 40 different printer types, this is the worst","review":"The Minolta printers are on my never buy again list. Poor drivers, even poorer tech support. The cartridges cannot be refilled, there is a chip that turns off the entire system if it believes the number of pages printed are enough. Example. I purchased anothe new black cartridge. When the yellow ran out, the entire system shuts down. You don't have the option to dselect black only and continue. The cartridges are shut down when they still have 20% toner left. The replacements are above 100.00 and they are hard to find. The printer is very noisy and smells. The print is only adequate and the 4 pass system takes a year to cycle thru....eeeeccchhhh.... a miserable system."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this printer!","review":"I have had this printer a few years.

Strange, I bought new and they replaced it with a used unit.The printer is incredibly noisy and dirty - it spills a lot of toner inside the printer so you get to clean it frequently if you want clean printing. The toner is outrageously expensive. Replacing all four toner cartridges is more expensive than buying a new printer.Break downs and error messages are a fact of life with this printer. Konica Minolta's web page help site is of no help what so ever.

Hotspur. He is sent for two years at sea patrolling off Brest as part of the English blockade of French ports. Hotspur is a small vessel that can maneuver close inshore so our hero is supposed to sail close enough to peer into the harbor and report any suspicious activity. The large fleet is farther offshore so Hornblower has independence to sail where he thinks best. The rocks are tricky, the winter weather worse, but through it all the men of the sea navigate back and forth. Maybe out of boredom, Hornblower always manages to stir up some action. He harasses coastal shipping, and engages in \\"cutting out\\" invasions in the dead of winter.

She can't sing at all and people know it. If she can sing she wouldn't need modern technology and computer fixings on the microphone to cover up her terrible singing notes. Ask the 70,000+ people who attended the 2005 Orange Bowl halftime show where Ashlee performed at.2. The Saturday Night Live incident. Need we say more?3. Piss-poor lyrics.

You can either rock out to \\" Boyfriend\\" or calm down to \\" Catch Me When I Fall\\" which talks about her little incident last year at SNL which to me she will always rock!!!!!!! I like Ashlee a lot better then her sister Jessica,because when you hear her music you feel connected with her and her lyrics!!!!!!!

She will rock your collection!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Admit it, it's a good album","review":"OK, so Ashlee may not have an amazingly good voice. Maybe she IS famous only because of her sister.

Just listen to tracks like \\"Beautifully Broken\\" and say she has no talent. \\"Talent\\" doesn't necessarily mean an absolutely amazing voice.Give this CD a chance.

I even double checked the \\"I Am Me\\" CD, and let the Cd run at the end, to see if maybe it was a hidden track. The Song Does NOT exsist on this album!

Dancing AloneBut, if by any odd reason Ashlee Simpson is reading this(I mean why would she want to go on amazon to bye her album? she probably has a million copies)she should go back to her punk.

I hope this turns out the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sounds Familiar...","review":"This time, Ashlee has a new hair color, she wears more mascara to go with her goth-inspired outfit, and she is, er, \\"real\\". She really, really wants you and me to know this. After that unspeakable fiasco where her world fell from the sky and she cried more than she had ever cried before, she has managed to bounce back and present us with I Am Me. She's turned her negative into a positive, risen like a phoenix from the ashes, and kudos to the girl for milking it for all it's worth.The most contrived album of the year, perhaps...Scratch through the wafer-thin pseudo punk/rock chick veneer and you will find Autobiography, Part 2. Putting aside my sudden loss of respect for Ms Simpson, there is no denying there are some catchy tunes on I Am Me that are very radio friendly and bound to do well. But at the end of the day it's simply more of the same with Ashlee trying be to deep and failing miserably. Pretending to be something she's not.

Who knew she'd be preaching about satan in her 40's? Ashlee is a young lady experiencing life's ups and downs, and that's reflected in this album. I like most of the songs, they're catchy and cute.

All I can say is that after 2 full listens (as I tried my best to really like it), I have to say I am appalled on the angsty and tweenie songs that came out. Needless to say, I took the CD and thoroughly placed it near the end of my car, and \\"accidentally\\" ran it over.

She sounds like a sick horse. If you appreciate any sort of music whatsoever, DO NOT BUY THIS CD. Simpson's voice is shockingly raspy and hoarse in contrast to clueless sister Jessica's operatic (in comparision) shriek.And don't worry, she doesn't seem to have developed much as a songwriter, with lyrics such as: 'Well I'm sorry/That he called/ me/And that I answered the telephone'. But the worst song on the album has to be Hollaback Girl rip-off 'L.O.V.E.'. Simpson's vocals are more horrendous than ever, combined with a nightmare-ishly cheesy melody and goofy lyrics.I feel bad for Ashlee. No one will ever take her seriously as a performer and she is stuck with that grating voice for her whole life. She should stick to doing hoedowns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blonde again...but still talentless","review":"This 2nd album of hers is infact slightly better than her first. You can actually listen to this one without having blood run from your ears...or at least on some of the tracks.

Most of the tracks seem directed towards love and weather it be optimistic or pessimistic depends on the track.The first Track, Boyfriend is geting old quick. It's a nice bubbly pop rockish song that's being played on the radio 24/7.The other tracks are alot better than Boyfriend and can be played quite a bit. My favorite tracks are numbers two, three, four, eight, nine, and ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashlee rocks!","review":"To all you Ashlee bashers: shut the f*** up! What more do you want? She has proven that she CAN sing and you people still bash her. So she lip synched big flippin deal! My wife is a singer too and has had acid reflux like Ashlee. It can ruin your voice so unless you people think you can do better than her, go ahead! She'll sing you off the stage though! Ashlee has a great talent and does co write her own music unlike her bimbo sister. This album has catchy lyrics and great beats!

The music is drag, her voice sounds worse, if not better at ALL, and she doesn't have ANY talent whatsoever in the music business. Joe Simpson (the father) is more interested in the money aspect of it, and saw a HUGE dollar sign on Ashlee by making her success the same as her sister, THEN becoming her manager. Both should realize that they both need a new day job, because producers can ONLY do so much with a bad voice, and I give props to those producers for staying it out with Ashlee as she probably made you deaf; or worse, dead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One talented Cat!!","review":"Sounds like she had that acid reflux thingy again (yeah, we believe you Ashlee) and gave the mic to her cat!!!

Namely, that she has no talent, is famous because of her sister and father (oh, and because she WANTS to be famous), and that this album was manufactured like a cheap automobile, to be rushed into the stores by the holidays. Yet somebody is going to be suckered into buying it (you know who you are) instead of trying to discover something that isn't being marketing down their throats by MTV and Seventeen magazine.

Forget the SNL incident, the McDonalds incident, the Orange Bowl incident and whatever else. I like her music. It's good.

Is it better than her debut? Well...no, but there are some really good songs on this album.

Instead of naming off her good songs, i will list for you the live performances she has managed to screw up. 1.) SNL snafu, her performance is the only one to interrupt the show. 2.)

Ashlee's first album \\"Autobiography\\" was much better than this, it had some beautiful lyrics but \\"I Am Me\\" only had poor written lyrics only talking about stupid things there are only a couple of great songs on this album, in my opinion they are: \\"Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Catch me when i fall\\" the rest of the songs disappointed me. I hope that she does a better job the next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like her!","review":"Although I find it a bit ironic that Ashlee sings \\"I am me and I won't change for anyone\\" and then goes and gets plastic surgery, I like this album and I am not a kid. I have a wide range of taste in music. This album is much better than Autobiography. For those of you out there that may not like Ashlee's voice but like that new song Invisible, that song is the title track off an indie album by the band Jaded Era and they are very good. They have more of a modern rock feel and the singer can in fact sing. She has a Gwen Stefani sound at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"everytime I turn on the tv that boyfriend song is always on and that annoying whiny melody gets stuck in my head.

This album is not as bad as a lot of people are making it out to be. I thought it was a good effort from Ashlee. I think the songs are quite catchy (the best example is L.O.V.E., people need to lighten up on her spelling of it in the song and have some fun with it) Other notable tracks are Boyfriend (of course), Beautifully Broken, and Say Goodbye. I am not unhappy with my decision to purchase this album and I feel that a lot of people are not giving it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am ME","review":"I was very much looking forward to this CD, I did like her last album, She sounds much better on this album.

What is clear from the album is that Ashlee does not know who she is. This is an album where some celebrity's sister did what her producer's told her to do to make money for the corporate machine. So, the \\"artist\\" changed the color of her hair, threw in a few disco / rap / soulful somgs - something to try and please everyone - and the whole lot is thrown together and called an album. There may be some talented production here, but no trace of a performer, certainly not an artist. The cheap image on the cover is further proof of the marketing idea that drives this drivel pretending to be an album. - If Ashlee wasn't Jessica's sister, believe me, you would not be considering this purchase. Just because crap begets crap, doesn't mean you have to let yourself be suckered in to buying it. It's not the only album on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This girl is completely pathetic, her music is like listening to somebody scream into a microphone, she has no class and certainly no talent, and she's a lowlife living off her sisters success."},{"rating":"1","title":"REVIEW OF THE COVER","review":"For a pink bubblegum-infused pop star, who would've thought her cover would be so dark, only half her face is shown.

Did any female pop artists from 50, 40, 30, even 20 years ago have to emphasize her mammary glands on thier album cover? Only the filthiest ones. Her own lyrics stress that she feels \\"hot, hot, hot.\\" And Ashlee Simpson is in high school, portraying herself in such a sexualized light like a Hooters girl. Yecch. I feel like I need a shower now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not here to bash Ashlee.","review":"I'm not on this page to bash Ashlee. I've actually heard the CD - unlike some other people who just want to slate her - and I have to say, it is dissapointing.

Just look what one of her fans, who gave her a five star review, wrote previously (and I'm really hoping she wasn't serious, but sadly, I think she was):\\"I just loved her because she couldn't sing all that well (I'm not saying she couldn't I'm saying I thought she was ok) and I thought it was kind of cute.\\"Uh, yeah. That makes a lot of sense.As a final word of advice, simply take a look at the other reviews on here if you're even slightly considering buying this studio enhanced excretement. If it's an absolute must to own, then PLEASE download it.

I think fools are the only ones that will say \\"She's blonde..She's brunette\\". Does it matter what her hair color is?! That has NOTHING to do with her music. Also, people are dissing how L.O.V.E is more a club beat. Well guess what? Her title is I AM ME, that means that's what she wants to put on. That's who she is. And she never said \\"I'M GOING TO BE 100% ROCK\\", so leave her alone. Great songs inclue \\"I Am Me\\" and \\"Dancing Alone\\". Dancing Alone shows she can do more then rock out.I would definetly buy this album, if you are a real music lover, not someone that bases music off the color of someones hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a flop","review":"this is horrible. maybe for a teenage 13 yr. old girl it's alright, but barely compares to her sister jessica. at least Jess can sing.

The other tracks are instantly forgettable and your typical \\"pop/Rock\\" kind of songs.

I'm usually not the one to complain, but this album makes no sense at all. First, it's her voice. On the CD, it sounds really raw and smokey, but when seeing her singing life, her voice is way more girly and different. (She was caught lip-synching in 2005.) Then, it's the lyrics. Ashlee, if you aren't okay with how you look and want to have plastic surgery, that's okay with me. But then don't keep telling your fans \\"stay as you are\\" and stuff like that. Your CD is titled \\"I am me\\", and you do sing things like \\"I won't change for anyone\\". I am very disappointed with your CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashlee Simpson - I Am Me","review":"Huh? Why does people nowadays get so easy to become a singer? His father and sister is in the music industry, that doesn't mean she has to follow them. I Am Me? You won't change for anyone? Then why did you change your hairstyle totally and doing pop music when you said you only wanted to make rock music in the first place? This album is not bad, but when you realised that there are lots of touch ups being made in this album..or hear her sing live, you'll doubt her ability to sing immediately. However, you may like songs like Boyfriend, L.O.V.E and I Am Me. They are the only songs that worth listening. Forget about the touch ups, just enjoy the 'Music'. Haha! For that 3 catchy songs..i gave it 2 stars instead of 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down With Ashley","review":"This person is not a singer.

Ugh, please do not support this noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature and uninteresting","review":"Ashleeeee. Get out of the spotlight, you gotta butt chin. She's 23 and couldn't come up with anything better than \\"I am Me\\". This is bad enough, but its the follow up to \\"autobiography\\". Whats next, \\"who I am\\"?If her cleavage on the front + relation to other talentless ho sell this crap, I have to ask, \\"Do you people know about adult internet sites?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"Boyfriend was okay, with catchy guitar riffs but the rest of the album went downfall. LOVE is just a rendition of Hollaback Girl, Dancing Alone sounds the same after Love Makes the World go Round and Say Goodbye seems to sound like Lindsay Lohan's Over.When singing I Am Me, the verses are: I am me, and I won't change for anyone!It should be I am not Me! and I will change for someone for the sake of money.Ms. Simpson. tick tick tick.... your 15 minutes are up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metane gas will ignight","review":"Lets hope this CD turns into the joke it is.

I feel sorry for those who've bought the whole CD. I mean there songs (2) that are good ( Catch Me When I fall, Boyfriend...) But other then that Just another CD that is going to be in the USED CD bin sooner or later. Her First CD had more songs that I liked than this one ( by like 2 more) Both CDS are filled with Fillers. I guess nothing goes on in her little life. No wonder Jessice is the star in the family with Ashlee voice she should be the shadow. Hahaha I was listening to the radio and there like the TOP 10 butterheads ( everything looks good but her head) and she was #3 whoa! Jessice has talent,looks, and probaly brains. Ashlee what are you left with? Humiliation, Big Nose, and a horrible voice. I'm being nice giving her 2 stars because thats how many songs I bought from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am Crap...","review":"An insult to the many talented & unknown female singers trying to get a brake in this numbers driven business of music.

If she did not exist, there would be no void to fill."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Honkers","review":"I heard the last Jessica, wait, I mean Ashlee Simpson singing on Saturday Night Live. Well, actually she was not singing, but that is another story. Anyway, this is a completely different girl with no talent. The girl on SNL had a big old nose. This particular Ashlee Simpson looks like every other 18 year old girl I see: bleached blonde hair and fake tan. This Cd is an improvement over the other Ashlee Simpson cd in that I have never actually had to hear one of the songs yet. Kudos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"aarrgghh!!!","review":"For all those people who HATE Ashlee Simpson, get off!! She is one of those people who sound like they're actually having FUN while singing! PU-LEASE. And the result to that is that the people who listen to the album, in return, ALSO have fun and wanna sing along. She's got a wonderfully clear voice and the music is very upbeat and awesome.great cd.loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Do you know how pathetic it is that this CD debuted at #1? She was exposed as a fake on SNL, got booed at the Orange Bowl, and obviously got a record deal from her sister being a music star. (An equally crappy one.) People say, \\"Just listen to the MUSIC!\\" Okay I'll give it a try. All I heard were songs about not putting words \\"up in\\" my mouth and about my girls standing in a circle. Her voice sounds like nails on a chalk board especially when she tries to do ballads. Please, AVOID this CD at all costs. Unless you like lip synching, untalented, fake, headache inducing music, then go ahead and buy!! I'm sure you could find twenty copies at a used record store for about a dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank You 2005","review":"This isn't really all about Ashlee, but pop in general. I'm writing this to 2005. A thank you note. Why? Because, it seems our dreams have come true. Britney Spears is over, J. Lo is married slut, Jessica Simpson will not make anymore albums, Backstreet Boys's CD was a one hit wonder, Ricky Martin failed, and my personal favorite, Ashlee Simpson's 2nd attempt failed. Also, you've brought back Madonna, Alanis Morisette, Natasha Bedingfield, Toni Braxton, along with many other real singers and divas. But to top it all off A BEYONCE COMEBACK!!!!! but she's solo again :( AN RAP ISN'T THAT BIG ANYMORE. So, 2005, thank you.- HilaryDuffSucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Milli Vanilli is like totally got nothing on her!!!!","review":"Are people blind, deaf or retarded when it comes to Ashlee Simpson? She isnothing more than a female version of Milli Vanilli!!! The only recording I would have bought from her is a sextape and that was before she became like Joan River's plastic surgery nightmare.

Thats all she's really worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"ashlee simpson is not a good singer. her vocals are horrible and off! her songs have an okay beat, and the band is good, but she is just terrible. someone take her away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I present the worst album of 2005...","review":"This is the worst album of 2005. Ashlee Simpson sounds and looks like a howler monkey and has annoying as hell singles like \\"Boyfriend\\" and \\"L.O.V.E.\\". The best album of 2005 was Opeth's \\"Ghost Reveries\\". That album kicked ass. Ashlee Simpson is one of THE worst singers of all time. She's right up there with Chester Bennignton, Fred Durst, and Chingy as the worst excuses of vocals in history! Buy \\"Ghost Reveries\\" and avoid this infinate pile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HaHa this is pathetic","review":"It suprizes me that even after her little \\"acid reflex incident on SNL in whitch she did a little ho-down for us\\" she still is making albums.

Ashlee's first album \\"Autobiography\\" was much better than this, it had some beautiful lyrics but \\"I Am Me\\" only had poor written lyrics only talking about stupid things there are only a couple of great songs on this album, in my opinion they are: \\"In Another Life\\" and \\"Dancing Alone\\" the rest of the songs disappointed me. I hope that she does a better job the next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD","review":"What in the world has music come to these days, the record companies just never learn. As if a lip-syncing debacle on SNL wasn't enough, Ashlee then went on to actually attempt live singing at the Orange bowl half time show earlier this year in a performance so horrid, 70,000 football fans proceded to boo her out of the stadium. As for the record itself, does it even matter? its little more than standard pop fare, often below standards with Ashlees obviously deteriorating vocal chords, but hey it doesn't matter. I'm sure this album will go on to triple platinum and beyond just like her last release, just thought i'd throw my two cents in. Bottom line: Save your money and go buy a Pearl Jam record, your ears and brain will thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"L.O.V.E. for ASHLEE!","review":"Can I tell you that my friend and I hauled our behinds out to L.A. to get her cd at Virgin Records on Hollywood Dr. We had to wait in this looong line to get wristbands to see her this saturday. But anyway, my point is... this CD was WORTH THE LONG and WET (it was raining) DRIVE. I've always been a fan of Ashlee and I've always backed her up, even through her dismal SNL ordeal. But I forgave her and I sure hope you guys can do the same.I'm having such a hard time typing because I'm still soooo EXCITED about this disc. Its PROFOUND, MATURE, FUN, and just competely amazing. Her sound is a little different, too. \\"Autobiography\\" had a pop element, but \\"I AM ME\\" has ROCK and DAAAAAAAAAAANCE tracks. Can you believe it? dance? songs like, \\"burning up\\" and \\"l.o.v.e\\" are juuuuuuuust sooo catchy. reminds me of madonna.... really!get this album. i'm soooooooooooooo impressed that i can't even breathe. ashlee is just amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blech","review":"I actually liked the first album, \\"Autobiography.\\" This one flat out sucks.

I was wondering if it's possible to lip synch on your own CD. I think yes.I watched Ashlee of Larry King a few nights ago...like, uh, yeah, like, totally, like, you know, wow, like...totally vacant. Nobody home.At least if she looked cute it might have uses, but she's as nerdy and ditzy as she looks.Ashlee makes Britney look like a Rhodes Scholar. Take a pass on this one and buy some real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO TALENT","review":"A complete waste of time! It'll also be a waste of your money if you decide to purchase it! Let's face it. SHE AIN'T NO SINGER! I know it, the critics know it and you probably know it. Sooner or later, Simpson's going to wake up and find out that all of the boo's and jeers at her appearances are living proof of her inability to sing a worthy note of music without screaming like she's being attacked in Central Park!

PLEASE NO!!!!!","review":"attention Ashlee Simpson talentless fake bitch is back and she is singing.... we all know what that means run for the hills of you happen to hear any of her songs you must cut off your ears. How the hell does she keep going. She must be to stupid to realize how screwed she is. She is more mocked than Britney Spears. Her screeching must stop. I do not dare turn on even scroll by MTV anymore for fear of hearing that horrid video and i am even scared to turn on saturdat night live. She sure did outdo herself with her lip synching and not getting caught. I went through this suffering last year my sister wants to buy this cd oh god!!!!

Quite a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget about others opinions & Listen to what you like","review":"What difference does it make what happened on SNL, or whatever else is being said about Ashlee. It's got nothing to do with whether this is a good album or not. Find a stream online, and give it a listen. It's a solid album. It leans towards the rock side of rock/pop.

Ashlee doesn't know *who* she is or *what* she wants. Just keep on trying to be someone that you're not, living up to someone else's superficial standards. You'll just end up lost and confused like you are now, Ashlee. And *that* is what you are.I was invited to a house-warming \\"party\\" last Saturday, and this wack CD was being played. That's when I had to bounce because I already had enough of the lame \\"party\\" and the Ashlee Simpson music was the last straw. And the titles of the songs (ie: L.O.V.E, Boyfriend, Catch Me When I Fall, Dancing Alone) are, like, real intriguing. Look, it's like this, if you're going to pull a Milli Vanilli, make sure you overcompensate with other talents to make up for your lack of vocal ability, okay?

I will credit you for one thing, and one thing only, the ability to make a good music video, it has helped you get this far. However, you ride off your sister's success, and your music is below par, it just isn't enough to carry you through, you need to face the facts that your talent isn't in singing and just because a relative is famous(even if they shouldn't be) that doesn't mean you have to be.

I just saw her perform L.O.V.E. on David Letterman. Her \\"singing\\" over backing tracks and trying to look sassy shaking her growing hips courtesy McDonalds was pathetic. Speaking of McDonalds I wish I was at the one in Toronto where she tried to get a customer to kiss her feet for a picture so that I could have spat on her in a gesture of unity between the United States and Canada.

She tried to hard to prove that she wasn't Jessica and she failed in the process. Fast forward about a year or so later she releases a second album called I Am Me (couldn't she come up with a more authentic title like: I am who you want me to be to sell records). She dyes her hair back blonde and has a messed up cover which looks like she has implants. I always thought with a second album you mature more musically. It sounds just like the last album. I listened to this and it was so bad i was laughing. Most of the songs even use the same guitar riffs and have repetitive lyrics (maybe because her fans are too stupid to memmorize too many stuff at the time). \\"Who Will Catch me when i fall\\" sounds like a rip off of Jewels hit \\"Who Will Save You Soul\\". I can't believe people like this crap. She is an insult to all talent. And it doesn't help that she can't sing worth a crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry fans but it's horrible","review":"this CD is a horrible attempt at trying desperately to sing and songwrite cause ashlee so doesn't have talent. She may be doing interviews saying that music and writing means a lot to her but really how much of it does she do?

Of course, the word 'spiritual' has many different meanings and while I originally took it to mean 'religious,' the subject of this book would more aptly be called 'moral values' in Shakespeare as various moral qualities or defects are examined in the context of certain plays (jealousy:Othello, inhumanity:Merchant of Venice, indecision:Hamlet, etc.).

I had a long list of books to order but decided to try just one first and it happened to be this one and I am so glad that it was. It gives a great general view of what to expect, what to do, and what to feel. It mentioned something that I felt when my daughters teacher told me that she \\"may grow up to discover the cure for cancer\\", and that is the guilt! Instead of feeling only proud, which I do, I felt as tho maybe the teacher thought I wasn't a good enough parent for such a smart child and that having such an ignorant parent could ruin her intellect!

Because of the broad nature of the humanities test, you will have to find some additional material. If you plan on taking more than one of the general exams, I highly recommend REA's General CLEP exam study guide(which includes a CD-ROM), and CLEP Success 2004.

Even those who don't appreciate the classics will actually give this a good listen and respond to it positively, although it may offend the classical purists. My only problem with this CD is that it's so overpakaged! I'm beginning to wonder of the steep price tag is primarily due to the cumbersome packaging that makes removing and replacing the Cd back in ints case a test on motor dexterity.

Predictably, Sewell seizes this once in a lifetime opportunity and steals the mermaid and places it in a tank aboard a ship bound for America, but soon it becomes apparent that the creature is messing with Gugino's head, and the ships crew learn about the mermaid's diet preferences the hard way.SHE CREATURE has good performances by Sewell and Gugino, but the movie is a bit too talky for its own good and there's no real suspense to speak of, but there are a couple of gory scenes and a VERY low key sex scene in which sexy Gugino is briefly possessed by the She-Creature's savage libido."},{"rating":"1","title":"She Creature without Bite","review":"This had great potential to either be highly erotic, or very scary.The fascination between the two leads, Carla Gugino, & Rya Kihlstedt (the She Creature) could have made for a very erotic film, but nothing really happens.

IT just seemed like another one of those cheesy horror flicks (though it aint) it had some elements to it but all in all I was completely bored. Mermaids are cool, especially this one because she was hot and it was the only reason I watched it, but I watched the Peter Pan movie that came out in December of 2003 and it was a better acting version that Robin William's one. The mermaids in that movie were evil (because it is in the original book). This mermaid is evil too, but more sexy. It's not the worst and it certainly isnt the best.

After awhile, there is such a thing called 'CGI Overkill' and they stayed away from it as much as possible.Now the ending, with the creature, could have been a bit more planned, with something MORE extraordinary, but I forgive them that.Now I can't just wait for them to ACTUALLY do the sequels to the First because I can't believe they would leave us hanging.If they think some people won't be interested...well, they need to start reading reviews on Amazon.comfrom SP777"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT horror flick","review":"This is a remake of one of the cheesiest 1950's horror movies I've ever seen. A hypnotist has control of the she creature who rampages all over the beach front tearing up property and people willy-nilly. I fully expected the new She Creature to be of the same quality but in color. I was stunned at the new movie. The story is terrific and actually makes sense most of the time. The actors are excellent and their fear is palpable as they begin to realize that the mermaid is killing them off at will. Carla Gugino is really excellent as the female protagonist who bonds with the monster.

The young widow in the story is totally unsympathetic and I couldn't understand how she ended up in the life she has. Her daughter, age 9 supposedly, seemed more like 11 or 12.

Although the author writes well enough that you can visualize the scene with ease, there are some places where the plot appears to fall down. For example, when we are introduced to Einor one gets a feeling of cold winter approaching. Some chapters later, we find Jean mixing margaritas for a \\"cry in your drink session\\" with Nina in the backyard with feet cooling in a wading pool. Other characters such as Starla are downright strange. There is no real charactor development. Noone I could fall in love with.

Well, in the Museum Guard, he does. It takes seemingly unconnected bits of history, art, and plot and blends them togethor to form one of the most memorable books I've read in a long time. His genius takes the trials of everday people and makes the reader interested, if not obsessed with the strange twists and turns this imaginative, original plot takes. Don't read this book if you seek a story about right and wrong, a bad guy and a good guy. Norman is too brilliant to write a story like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is everyone in this book crazy?","review":"The Museum Guard had an unpredictable ending only because nothing any of its characters did was motivated even remotely by a logical reason.

Although it takes some patience, the unfolding of the intricate plot, the desire for the culmination, and the desire to allow it to unfold further -- since the outcome is predicted by the tone -- is well worth it. The rewards from this reading linger. I had to read the last pages three time. The author creates poignancy, sadness, empathy and enjoyment. All of the characters are accepted as authentic, alive and there is the haunting desire to wish for a follow-up. But, this reader is lead to believe it would be more painful to know. The plot is intricate, demands attention and its convolution is rewarding once one patiently appreciates how it unfolds.

Long, boring, trite plot that goes nowhere for almost an eternity and ends with a lackluster twist. The cover misleads the reader to believe that this will be a 'soul-chilling occult horror' story, but it is, in fact, a rather mundane murder mystery. The supernatural twist, which takes place only near the very end of the book, is rather cheap and unbelievable, though another paranormal event from which the book concludes itself is a nice touch, but not enough to redeem this trashy literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Organic mixes","review":"Like most Shop Natural products, this is organic and free of harmful chemicals.

I will admit, however, that the death of the Russian revolution and the nazi's as posited is plausible in \\"real\\" history, let alone this alternative. But the portrayal of people and place names, people especially... It is obvious who is being portrayed and the silly variations on names showcase apparently, third grade minds.

The premise of the book is badly under-researched, and the names of geographical locations are horribly mangled. The plot has no continuity, jumping from one scene to another without any bridges; it is a common occurence for the book to have actions that should have been different chapters separated by no more than a period.

The author even spells \\"Air Force\\" as \\"Airforce\\" and, sequentially, \\"Vladivostok\\" and \\"Valdivostok\\" There are even double spaces between sentences; a sure sign of a typewriter orientation, rather than a word processor.

The fish are merely adequate, not exciting. Truthfully, the Microsoft fish screensaver that came with my computer is more realistic.Loading the game is a little confusing... you have to load the basic screensaver (which has one tank and three fish) and then load the rest of the fish and the rest of the scenes.The box says 57 fish. Some of them are so hideous that I have turned them off. Some of the backgrounds are nice. The 3D backgrounds look silly, and computer generated.It was 20 bucks... you might want to wait until it goes down in price. I wish that I had. This might be a better deal if it were five bucks.

There are lots of deep grooves too that I can't even begin to clean. It is cumbersome and bulky. In addition food falls under the padding, so I have to disassemble the whole thing to get it clean.

With all the positions and accessories, I thought it would be wonderful to use from birth all the way through the toddler years. For the first 6 months it was great, mainly because all I used it for was a recliner for my daughter while I ate she could be close to me at the table. Once she started eating real food and feeding herself, that's when the nightmare began. The chair is VERY difficult to manuever mainly because the wheels have individual locks, and if one gets locked, the whole thing stops moving. Also, it is very hard to collapse and put back up. When it comes to feeding, my daughter is now 18 months old and 32 inches long; we can't put the tray on this highchair with her because she can't see over it. About 2 months ago, I finally went to K-Mart and bought a $16 off brand highchair and am 100% more satisfied than I could ever be with this horrible excuse for a highchair."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO YOU STOCK ENOUGH DIAPERS FOR THIS ONE??","review":"If you dont mind putting twelve diapers on at the same time to get that extra boost in height so your baby can see over the ridiculously high tray, then this chair is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this","review":"I bought this highchair 4 days ago and returned it today.

The tray on this highchair was at chin height. The seat didn't seem very sturdy. I would put her in it and it wold lean back. I wasn't able to remove the tray with one hand. And the toy even stunk. The only thing I did like about the highchair was the pattern and the cover, it wasn't plastic. Don't be fooled by all the bells and whistles.

It's frustrating to the both of us.This is the first time I've reviewed a product on amazon.com and I'm taking this step to alert other parents not to be dazzled by the appearance the way I was.

It can't be safe! The only good thing about the chair is the nice fabric cover.

I wish we had researched it first. The main problems with the chair are as many have mentioned: you can not sit the chair upright and the seat is too low in relation to the tray. We purchased the chair when our baby was about 4 months olds. You could only see her little head peaking over the tray. She is now 13 months old and tray is still at chest level. Several visiting children have used the chair and all have been too small. We purchased the Swing Tray Portable Booster Seat and love it. The portable booster seat is the chair we use everyday while the Evenflo sits useless in the closet.

My husband thought I had put it together incorrectly but after a quick visit to Babies R US last night, I realized that the chair's \\"upright\\" position is too reclined and indeed the chair was properly installed. All the other chairs I saw actually have an upright 90 degree option which makes sense once the babies are feeding themselves. I could not recommend this chair to anyone who wants their baby to feed on his/her own. We are still using our all in one booster seat and it works great. I wish I had not spent the $100 on this item. It's too bad because it is one of the only decent looking high chairs.

The overall concept is good. My daughter is 8 months old and of average height and she isn't able to reach the tray very well, her face bumps into the tray each time she reaches. She has to sit on a towel in order to use it correctly. The ability to fold is great seeming I do fold it down after each use due to small space but the seems where it folds gets food stuck in there and it is not easy to get out.

But now that she is 11 months old and in the 75th percentile for height, and still cannot reach if I put the larger tray on, I am deeply disappointed. Also she leans forward on her own, without support from the chair, because the damn thing won't sit straight up. I now know I'm not just imagining this after reading other reviews.

It does not sit upright, so your child is trying to eat while reclined, also the seat is very deep and tray is too high, so you can't use the tray.

If you chose to use it without the big tray be careful our baby caught her arm on 3 different ocassions. The seat seems to always be a little reclined, it never sat fully upright. I would never recommend this high chair to anyone. We did not want to pay an arm & a leg for a high chair, so we opted for this one, which was not cheap except in quality. I am not sure even if you pay alot more you will get better quality I think it is just trial & error. This was a big error.

I haven't used it yet because my daughter is only 2 months old, but I do read up on reviews of products I own and I've found that because this high chair has cloth cushions, it's difficult to clean. I will be exchanging this item for a high chair with vinyl cushions, and one that sits in a more upright position. Who cares about the toy tray? There are plenty of high chair toys with suction cup bottoms for easy attachment to ANY tray. What is my kid doing in a high chair anyway?? Oh yeah- eating!

The problem with this high chair is that the seat is slightly reclined even at it upmost position. Also, the tray is much too high. I have tried everything to make it usuable, including putting phone books under the cushion to raise my daughter up more. The chair worked OK for feeding smaller infants at the reclined position, however,it is certainly not suitable for self-feeding infants and toddlers. I am very disappointed with this product. My advise: DO NOT BUY THIS HIGH CHAIR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice for us","review":"After reading all the negative reviews on this highchair I was a little hesitant to purchase it but I'm very pleased with the chair. I can understand how someone could dislike how the seat doesn't sit completely straight up however it doesn't seem to recline as much as others have made it sound. Our 7 month old son sits very comfortably in the seat and he is an average size baby. The tray does seem a little on the high side but I have read reviews on other highchairs with the same issue.

She has been sitting on phone books since about 8 months when I finally got that brillent idea. She is now 17 months and still needs the phone books. I am so fed up with this high chair and that is why I am online right now-shopping for a new high chair.

It worked well when he was first starting to eat solid foods, but once he was able to sit up on his own and reach for finger foods, we realized three things: (1) the \\"fully upright\\" position anything BUT upright (it's ridiculous); (2) the large tray, when attached, is WAY too high for my now-10 month old son (who is extremely tall for his age); and (3) the \\"dishwasher-safe\\" tray is too tall to fit in normal-sized dishwashers.My advice? Don't buy this high chair. We are currently instead using his Fisher Price Easy-Care Booster Seat for all meals (which is a wonderful item, by the way). If we buy another high chair, it probably will be a basic wooden one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, buy something else!

There are a lot of design issues with this highchair and for the money, there are higher quality options. The tray is very, very high... I imagine it will fit her fine by her second birthday. Also, the fabric seat covers gaps hugely at the sides allowing food to fall under the seat cushion... its a pain to clean. The screws on the underside of the tray are rusting after just a couple of months use... not great since it does need to be washed off 3 times a day. Also the release button and mechanism stick often, requiring tugging on the tray to get it off of the chair.

Well, I will not be caught red handed buying another fantasy book, this is for sure (Lord of the Rings almost sent me in a sate of coma, blasphemous as it should sound, but what can I do? It's true.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"something different","review":"This was a present for my son, who has done sticker puzzles before on a smaller scale. He was really gung-ho to start this, but after putting 30 black stickers on, he got bored and wanted to stop. (he's 5) I think this will be good for older kids, or just to do in short incriments for smaller kids. I think it is great for dexterity and following directions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"My 6 yr old loved making a picture with the stickers - we would do it together actually. I highly recommend this toy for boys or girls whol like arts and crafts. It's a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the bunch","review":"I love this type of puzzle, and I've tried many of the variations that are available on this site. This one is by far the worst. The paper is unacceptable for a pencil puzzle. It's much too thin and gray, and the pencil marks don't show up well. The book is also too small, so it's hard to hold the pages open. The puzzles are too easy, and the pictures don't really look like anything.If you like this type of puzzle, there are better options available. My favorites are the two Pixel Puzzle books. (I wish they'd make more!) The paper is strong and white, the book is wire bound, the pictures are large and sharp-looking, and you'll get many more hours of puzzling fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good size for packing along.","review":"I just read the previous review and I find I like this book for all the opposite reasons. I like this size. It fits into my pocketbook ready to pull out any time I'm waiting. I don't use pencils for puzzles, but I did try a pencil and agree that the pencil does not show up well. I prefer a fine point ball point and this paper is good for it. I like a paperback like this because I tear out the puzzles when they're complete and toss them.As to the puzzles themselves: they a nice size -- most are 30x35. They're challenging without being impossible. Very few are easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I love these kinds of puzzles, but was very unhappy with this book. The paper is awful. If you're using a pencil you have to push down so hard it often tears through the paper. Also, the solutions in the back are difficult to see since the grid isn't visible. It's very hard to find where you've gone wrong if you make a mistake. For the price I think they could have used a better quality of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!","review":"This is one of the best songs on The Bucketheads album!

There was a few marks on the pages but acceptable. I put it on a table and 24 hrs later it warped in all directions.

I would have sent it back to the seller, but I didn't keep the address, thinking it was ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart way too easily","review":"My 6-year old wanted this toy for Christmas and I spent about an hour putting it together. Within 2 minutes blocks were popping off and it was falling apart. If you buy this toy, I suggest putting it on a shelf and \\"looking\\" at it. I also bought him the 2 ships and I am not even going to bother opening them. I am returning them for a more \\"durable\\" children's toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent information...","review":"I was excited to buy this book b/c it looked like a quick and easy guide for creating a web site in Flash. Unfortunately, I had to stop reading around page 49. There were inconsistencies throughout. For example, it instructs you to add 4 layers to the timeline in addition to the background layer...but in the next chapter, those 4 extra layers disappear from the graphics and explanations that follow. It doesn't tell you what happened to those layers. Very frustrating. So of course, I could not continue b/c the layers are the central and most important part of the project. I thought this book would help me understand Flash better, but it just confused me. I'm very disappointed that I wasted my money. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend it","review":"All words are written in large, childlike print, to give an impression that this book is easy to read and thus also easy to execute. But the execution instructions are not very well described. Some steps have missing photos. The book is also way too short for the kind of book it is supposed to be: visual introduction to flash for beginners. It also has no troubleshooting. I do not recommend starting learning flash from this book, it is for more advanced learners."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for tejano music fans.","review":"This cd contains 10 tracks made of 3 cumbias,4rancheras,2nortenas and 2 baldas which were the 2 hits in this cd(luna llena) and (amor eres tu).

The fabric is kind of satiny, so it's easy to clean, and the handles are coated with a laminate-type material so they won't get all grungy. The only reason I gave this bag a 4-star is because it kind of flops down if it isn't full. I wish the sides were a bit more sturdy to stand upright on their own. Other than that, it's perfect for what I need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Diaper Bag","review":"I use this bag for bringing stuff to and from daycare, and it serves its purpose very well. It has 5 bottle sized pockets (counting two on the outside), two additional exterior pockets (one zip and one velcro) and a lot of room inside for clothes, blankets, bibs, etc. It is a large bag, the outer material is rugged but attractive (I have the Maya bag), and the interior contrasting material allows you to find things easily. I believe that this bag comes in two sizes as evidenced by the photos, and I do have the larger sized bag, I think it would be plenty big enough for most diaper bag purposes! Very pleased with the purchase and would recommend for an affordable basic diaper bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surf's Up Trend Lab Diaper Bag","review":"I love this diaper bag as it has a lot of room, can be easily wiped down and matches my bedding. There are a lot of compartments inside to store bottles, diapers, wipes, paci's, blankets, and changing pad. However I do not like the straps. They constantly fall off my shoulder, even when it's completely full. Everything else is great except for the straps! I will be purchasing another one because it's hard enough to carry diaper bag, bottle bag and baby in car seat out of daycare and then to have the diaper bag fall off your shoulder...so annoying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag!","review":"I have been using this diaper bag for nine months, since the birth of my daughter. It is a great bag. The outside is easy to wipe clean, and is a nice color. The bag is not too big and bulky, and is just the right size to carry around, but still seems to have more room on the inside than you would guess by looking at the bag from the outside. There are plenty of pockets on the inside for wipes, diapers, pacifiers, toys, etc, including pockets on either side on the outside of the bag and on the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Braid of Feathers","review":"I like thin books with thick subject matter. I also like book titles that herald the contents. This book does both. In an essay of 200 pages, Frank Pommersheim, a Lakota tribal judge, artfully braids together the variegated feathers of tribal sovereignty. Experience, Culture, History, Language, Politics, and Law, not just Acts of Congress (treaties, statutes), decisions of the United States Supreme Court, and executive action (orders and regulations) shape, limit, and ultimately enhance or diminish tribal sovereignty. The author, sometimes poetically, sometimes polemically, but always pointedly argues that tribal courts are the fundamental institution of legitimate, authentic tribal self-determination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and a great story.....","review":"Lisa Fugard tells a fascinating story, while at the same time educating people on what it was like to live in Africa during the Apartheid years. She brings to life a story and a reality that many of us only read about third hand in newspapers of the day.She's not only a gifted author, but helps others in their quest to write as well. I look forward to her next novel. I hope she considers a second novel to Skinnner's Drift one day, and tells us what the characters got up to next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book is very disappointing.

I learned a great deal reading the 4th edition when I was in high school and its organization makes reading it a pleasure. It is an excellent introduction to the structure of our galaxy and stellar astronomy. The only caveat is its age and sadly the Boks are no longer around to update it. It is better than most of the textbooks I have read on its subject. I would also recommend Berendzen, Hart, and Seeley's _Man Discovers the Galaxies_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great author!","review":"You can find the same material in a bunch of books... but the exposition by Arveson is really superb. He actually EXPLAINS things, not just a list of theorems and proofs with no apparent reason.The book is 130p only, so it might be ideal for self study. Not everything is in the text but if you want to try the exercises (you might need further reading to do some of them) and you do the extra reading from other sources, you will end up getting a good understanding.The chapters are: 1. Spectral theory and Banach algebras, 2. Operators on Hilbert space, 3. Asymptotics: Compact perturbations and Fredholm theory and 4.

The stories are stupid and boring. The only reason you would want to read them is if you were into Sci-Fi history. I couldn't even finish the Return of Santhas. The last three chapters on hollow earth history were quite interesting though. They follow some quack and some reasonable theories about tunnels in South America and Asia.

So parts 1&2 (no stars), part 3 (4 stars)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're into the Occult Buy this book...","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be a good interesting read. It was for a couple chapters and I couldnt finish it for fear of being ill. He basically borrows theories and other tidbits from other books by Occult authors. It talks about \\"The Great White Brotherhood\\" but doesnt mention that this Brotherhood is the top echelon of the Illuminati Occultists who rule this world. The first story was good because it shows what mind control can do to a person and reminds me of what Philip K Dick once went through. This book has limited documentation if any and no definitive answers and just mystery and doesn't resolve much. If you want a good read with documentation pick up \\"Bloodlines Of The Illuminati\\" by Fritz Springmeier.

Well it's been two weeks and numerous trips to Toys R Us, Meijer, Target, etc., and still no battery pack. We check online five times a day to order one and they are always sold out. What kind of company would sell X amount of toys and not make sure that the only battery that makes the toy work would be readily available.The sad thing is that an employee of Toys R Us informed us that the exact same thing happens every year with Tyco's most popular new toy.

I even had the presence of mind to charge up the battery before giving the toy to my son, so it was ready to go the minute he opened the box. We DID have a problem after the first few times with the wings not morphing in sync. But, I called TYCO and they were very helpful -- it's just a matter of unscrewing the side that's open, lifting it up slightly and letting the wings flap down. When you screw it back on it's fine!

We've tried several others, but none measured up to the Rebound. I THOUGHT this one would be it. I had reservations about the $90 price tag ($60 for the vehicle and $30 for the battery...SHAME!). But this thing is TERRIBLE! Shame on Tyco! Initially, the movement was awkward, thanks to the hard plastic exterior (no rubber wheels) and the flopping \\"tail\\".

Now the toy will open and shut and the fins on both sides will work in the reverse mode, but the left side of the toy will not work at all in the forward direction. So all it does is turn in circles.

After waiting until the next day to try it outside, the battery needed charging again. So finally after another day's wait, it no longer worked. There had been no accident, no rough play, nothing other than brief indoor testing, and with a fully charged battery it only slowly blinked its lights (which apparently means charge the battery).

Then, my son has to turn it off, then on again. He's still down there playing for 3-5 second bursts and continually turning it off and on to get to it restart, but overall this is a horribly disappointing purchase. My advice to other parents is to explain to their kids that this is one of those (many) toys that looks better on TV and really doesn't work that way at all in real life.I will be trying to contact tyco to see if we can get a replacement, but thus far this toy has been quite disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible transfer from video source","review":"This is not high-def.

I don't know it's just not my kind of movie. My favorit chracter is Jeff Spicoli played by Sean Penn he remind me of one of my friend. The movie is realistic be cause today tenns are almost like that but it 's a little bit exagerated, like Spicoli who always take his shirt off and takes his vans with him where ever he goes !!!!

I could not find Eric Stoltz' scenes, for example. Apparently they were cut. Surely they could have included cut scenes as a menu option. Other DVD's have this feature. Also the sound is monaural and my SONY player experienced its infamous lipsync problem in parts of this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't the best movie!!!","review":"My english teacher present us this movie: \\"Fast times at Ridgemont high\\" it wasn't the best movie that I ever saw but it was ok. It wasn't my kind of movie, except that I laugh a lot in that movie. Also my favorite character is Jeff Spicoli because he's so cool and funny, he look like like all guys of this new geration, in 1999. Jeff Spicoli he's the best but not a good exemple for teenagers. They got a good sense of humor to make people laugh like me.But the subjet I realy didn't like it, it was so borring, I don't know why maybe because it was a classic movie, if they would do a new version of that movie maybe it would be more interesting and teenagers would like it if it is more recent 'cause school and life in 1999 isn't like before in 1980, they have big different. If you want to see a movie, who present teenagers in 1980 you can rent that movie but don't waste your time and don't rent it. I'm telling you. Anyway that's my opinion everybody have a different opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude movie","review":"I've seen the movie by my English teacher. I liked and disliked it. Some people were good, some were not that good. I think that Judge Reinhold (as Brad Halminton) is the best character. He made me laugh so much. In the movie, he is a very good brother. Stacey Halminton (Jenneifer Jason Leigh) is an irresponsible girl. She got pregnant with a stranger (stupid enough). Compared to today's life, 1982 was a \\"dude\\" life. It seems to be funny and also dangerous. People has sex with everybody, get pregnant. Do they care about VD? Sure, AIDS haven't existed yet, but still... That was the thing I hate about the movie. But I can say that it was a good movie. It reflects well the reality of that year. I would recommand this movie to all people who's 15 and up. If you're not yet, wait untill you're at least 15. (Some scenes may not concern you.) And if you don't like sex (or too young) stay home and rent a comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too 80s","review":"Too 80s.Was funny when I was that age.But not so much now.My memory was funnier than was in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"What a waste of celluloid. The jokes aren't funny. The film tries desperately hard to be funny (like the masterbatorial fantasy), then throws a supposed 'serious' situation (the abortion). It fails in both regards. The characters are flat and lifeless, except Ray Walston's Mr. Hand, and Sean Penn's Spicoli, but these characters are so overblown, they seem hokey. The film is a foul piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THE DVD!!!","review":"What a great movie. An 80's classic. However, for anyone with a home theater, the soundtrack will be a great disappointment. How can you call a DVD a \\"Collector's Edition\\" when it is in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono?!!! Yes, Mono. No stereo, no 5.1. Just mono. The extras also leave something to be desired. Don't waste your money on the DVD until Universal decides to release it with a decent audio track. And, why did they leave out the extra scenes that are on the TV version?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the deleted Scenes???","review":"Personally I have this DVD. My parents had me watch it one day and I enjoyed watching it so much that I had to go out and buy it. However, comparing this with the version that was released in the 80s and the version I usually see on TV...it lacks some much needed (and yet, hilarious) deleted scenes....To be honest, I think Universal should really try harder to release a DVD with these scenes restored into the film. Also, would it hurt to at least give us 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround? I also know that Universal has a habit of cutting scenes out of other VHS and DVD releases of films such as Weird Science. If anyone agrees that there Universal should put these scenes restored in their DVDs and VHS tapes, please contact them ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic DVD","review":"What can I say? I own this in VHS and had to get the DVD. It is a classic. I think school has not changed at all from this movie. Such a funny movie with so many then rising stars.

It's one of my favorite movies of all time and I thought the first dvd release was excellent. This dvd has the same exact special features as that one. So why do we need this \\"special edition\\"?

My favorite character is Jeff Spicoli.Their was a kind-of a sequel made 2 years later called \\"THE WILD LIFE\\", none of the orignal cast where in it except Eric Stolz, Chris Penn is in it too.

This results in a lot of scratched up discs...this was one of them. Others arrived in similar condition but wouldn't even play.

I really wanted to know more about choosing and raising a havanese puppy, but it was of little use as its main focus seemed to be for potential breeders.

In 355 pages there are 12 deaths. 12! That's an average of 1 death every 30 pages. There is a mysterious gang of Druids, a drug deal gone awry, stolen nuclear waste, a plot to blow up an air force base, and the mob. There's also Bob- poor dead Bob- who, as the protagonist puts it, is \\"a good kid, gay or not\\" (pg 344). Additionally, women in this novel are only mentioned in relation to their sexual relationships with men. Although the setting of the novel is a coed college (Hamilton College) and the protagonist does much of his detecting by talking with students and professors at the school, he never once encounters a female student or a female professor.

It tells the story of a group of gay friends who have their own amateur baseball team and who are always hanging out at the oldest member of their group, Jack's restaurant. The film is filled with great performances from a number of then relatively unknown actors who have since become much more famous. Its interesting to watch the film now, knowing what some of them have gone on to do in their careers.

To say that my enthusiasm was short lived would be an understatement! The characters are all so whiny,feeling sorry for themselves and chronic complainers that there is no one to root for during the whole 96 minute opus. While similar gay themed films like Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss,Jeffrey,The Object Of My Affection and Trick had characters to cheer for (or hate),this film elicted neither sympathy for nor empathy with any of the characters they were all so unlikable. And you got the impression that though these were supposed to be friends.....they were anything but. The story was thin to say the least and continuity was sadly lacking. The best performance came from veteran actor John Mahoney and his scenes were too few to carry and save this film. Hopefully a sequel is not planned for The Broken Hearts Club!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves an acrid after taste","review":"Underneath the chuckles, most of the characters in this film are disagreeable and unattractive, and after watching \\"The Broken Hearts Club\\" I wondered why so many gay people like the movie. Instead of being a pean to friendship or possitive gay attributes, the movie left me thinking \\"These people are not what I would consider friends.\\" Pettiness, neuroses, loneliness, bitchy-competitiveness, obsession with youth, sexual predation for conquest's sake----all of these things exist in real life, and the movie gives a reasonably accurate glympse of them.

Much more substantial than a movie of the week as some would have you believe. It's a romantic comedy and is as funny and moving as one would and should expect it to be. If you're tired of the heavy, depressing and gay themed movies - here's one that you will simply enjoy - a docudrama it doesn't pretend to be. The characters are all wonderful and at their present stage of life, their concerns, desires, hopes, fears etc. are true to who they are. In your lifetime you will have known atleast one if not all of these characters. For a comunity longing to see itself on the big screen, this may be a very small representation, but nonetheless a valid one. Does it provoke deep thoughts, well...no. Will you like it? Yes.

Well, that's not ENTIRELY true -- there is Dean Cain, and he actually can act."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I'm not into romantic comedies I only sit through one to rip it apart but this movie isn't like all the others. You also don't have to be flamboyantly gay to enjoy it either! I could definitely relate to all the characters because they showed the different stages in a relationship and I'm a straight woman. I thought it was so funny and it even made me cry which means a lot for someone who loves action movies. I loved the whole movie, it wasn't too long, it wasn't pointless and it had a great ending.

The cast seemed great, the context hit the spot, and so we pressed the button: \\"PLAY\\" - - - quick quips, one liners, boom, boom, boom - then came the story. In a word 'weak'. The comparison to 'Steel Magnolias' isn't remotely possible in a sain world. One never sees a true bond, a complete character, or any of that glue that would hold this bunch together. Something went 'amiss'. Everyone one did his best with what he got to do, there just wasn't enough there. When it ended, I was left wanting all the story I never got.

None of these characters would know love if it it them over the head with a shovel.Still, if your idea of a great film is a cast of mediocre actors who live at the gym and consider \\"rock, paper, scissors\\" a game of intellectual rigor, stumbling about without shirts in search of a story line, you'll love this movie.To my horror, it seems many people actually do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliches EVERYWHERE","review":"How very disappointing. I had really looked forward to seeing this film, but unfortunately, I should have passed. The script is FULL of cliches (Judy Garland references, over-the-top queens, etc.) and some of the most trite and forced dialogue I've heard in quite some time. Although I realize that most cliches BECOME cliches because they're true, it was very disheartening to watch this film and see the same tired old stereotypes play out before me. Dean Cain isn't bad in his role, but the rest of the cast is sub-par. Timothy Olyphant, who showed so much promise in \\"GO,\\" is without question the weakest actor onscreen. I'm surprised the writer hasn't found a home at Showtime's \\"Queer As Folk\\" -- the writing is just about as amateurish as that wretched show.

This well written story deals with the aftermath of this terrible tragedy in a unique way, focusing on a survivor who is lost, and suffering from amnesia. Stacy Coombs, a teenager who has recurring dreams about him plays a pivotal roll in trying to find him, and convince her parents, friends, and police of the truth of her visions.Mr. Neugroschel vividly portrays the horrors of that fateful day, while at the same time captures the nuances of a typical teenage girl coping not only with her split up family, but her fears that she is going crazy. This book is well suited for the young, as well as the adult. Though there are many stories and books related to the terrorist attacks, this one's unique and emotional look should be included in everyone's \\"to buy\\" list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Canon, and not as high a capacity","review":"Despite the item name, this is not a Canon battery, but an aftermarket battery. I didn't purchase it because its 500 mAh capacity is a lot less than the original Canon battery which is marked at 790 mAh, so it won't last as long. Of course it is a LOT cheaper than a Canon battery, but you might want to find a higher-capacity one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+ Designs","review":"Very realistic designs. The book has 18 projects including a 64 Mustang (my favorite), a 59 Cadillac (my second favorite), a 57 Chevrolet Bel Air, two VW Beetles, and a 57 Corvette (to name just a few). There are color photographs and detailed instructions on each project.I would classify the projects in this book as intermediate to advanced. The designs have lots of pieces (60+ in the 39' Packard Wagon), copper foil overlays, and wirework."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damon Medic Review","review":"The movie \\"Clifford\\" starring Martin Short as a teenage child, is perhaps the funniest movie ever made.

Clifford is extremely annoying to his uncle, who asks, \\"Why can't you act like a normal boy?\\" Clifford has a small toy dinosaur who he confides in as a sort of alter-ego. He calls the toy Stefan.

Charles Grodin as the foil is also far too stiff and monotone when compared with the performance he is ripping off: that of John Ritter in \\"Problem Child\\" which is infinitely funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clifford Movie","review":"This movie stars Martin Short who plays a very disruptive, evil 10 year old. His parents leave him with his uncle and things go bad when the uncle reneges on his promise to take him to dinosaur theme park. The movie had some funny parts although I found the movie a little unbelievable because Martin Short does not even come close (except his height) in looking 10 years old. The supporting actors were acceptable but not superb and the story seemed to move too fast. The plot seemed too simple or maybe just overdone, I knew how the movie would pan out from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard movies to find","review":"This is a very rare movie to find on the market!

Unlike a large fraction of the books published about extra-terrestrial, it jumps above the Drake equation and other classic idea and bring new reflexions and concepts. Very few books does that: Inteligente life in the Universe Shlovsky and Sagan, Cosmic Connection Sagan, Extraterrestrial Asimov and After Contact from Alan Harrison.

The arguments in this book are terrible. No conclusions logically follow and you can barely find a sentence without some large assumption. I was hoping for some analysis of the question of whether extraterrestrials exist, but this book is just an analysis of the Fermi Paradox and speaks only about our galaxy which I found to be incredibly disappointing.

There are page-consuming examples that don't add much, and yet key facts are missing. These facts do surface in the Exam Prep Questions, which at least informs the reader that they need to go research that topic, but those points should appear in the text. Questions are often badly worded; their intent is only explained by reading the answers.The authors should consider a re-write. Cut useless examples. Include code snippets with the minimum required context instead of the full \\"Create a new solution, add a page named blah, add these 5 controls...\\" Tighten up the prose; make it clear and concise for easy review.

I also bought Microsoft's MCAD book but i realised by now that buying only this book allows one to prepare for the exam. You simply code up the lesson examples whenever you are not sure and you will score above 90% on the practice tests. Considering that 70% is the pass mark, it is not too bad.It is also a compact book, so you do make progress in it too that cheers you up since time is limited for all of us i guess. The book also has 2 sample exams. The CDROM too, has practice exams and the complete book is in pdf as well on the book so once you sell the book, you will still have a perfectly organized pdf version of it too. All this for 34.99USD is way better then buying Microsoft's MCAD/70-316 book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Partly outdated","review":"The first edition of the book was published in 1987, and unfortunately this third edition published in 1998 contains parts that apparently have not been updated since the first edition.

However if you strictly only want a couple of songs maybe this is your thing. YES it does have that EVERYBODY MUST GET STONED song on it, it's the first track RAINY DAY WOMEN.I should warn you though, Dylan is infectious, and once you get a little into your brain, it gets deep in there and you want more and more.

If you don't really know Dylan, but are interested in him, you need to get this album. If you are a Dylan fanatic, you probably already own it like me or don't need it because you own all his other albums.

I went on to buy fifteen or so Bob Dylan records in my late teens and early twenties, so I had most of these songs already on vinyl disc. I still felt obliged to buy this CD. I like every song; I like how the songs are ordered. You see, the only Dylan albums that have withstood the ravages of time, I think, are \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" (especially), \\"New Morning\\", and \\"Desire\\".

These tunes are all great, absolutely essential listening, and a great way for the beginning Dylan fan to get their feet wet ... or ears tickled ... or mind blown.

The story involves a student who finds out that a student was killed in his room, and there is something sinister occurring with the schools faculty because no one will admit she is dead. There isn't a great deal of the book that stands out in my mind as a plot line to discuss here, so I wont bother.

Not only has the incident been kept out of the media, but no one at the school seems to know anything about it. Or at least, they're not talking. Cal takes on the mystery of the murdered girl as his pet project, but completing it may cost him more than he bargained for. He's bleeding again.This is an excellent, atmospheric mystery with full characters and a genuine feel for setting. There's something inherently creepy about a college campus in winter, and the author takes full advantage of that.

The wheels easily fall into the locked position (a little annoying) and food can easily fall under the seat, in to this practically unreachable crevice... but I can deal with these things.What I do not like about this high chair at all is that on one more than one occasion, my daughter has gotten her arm stuck in between the outside of the chair and elbow of where the legs of the chair come up and bend. If she leans over in the chair a certain way (and she's ALWAYS strapped in tight!) her arm can easily slip into this narrow spot. It's only happened a few times, and we can always get her arm out easily, but SHE can't get it out if she gets it stuck, which scares and upsets her, and it appears to hurt her as she tries to pull her arm out.

It doesn't look sturdy at all, and no matter how much I jiggled the seat back and tightened and readjusted the screws the seatback looked cockeyed. The reclining positions for the seat also seemed really unsafe- I was worried that my baby might lean back and have the seatback slip into a different position.I am returning this high chair to the store today and will be picking up a better one.

The seat back constantly snaps back into major recline mode when my son pushes against it. My biggest complaint is that a baby can take their foot and push the release bar and easily pop the tray off, despite a piece of plastic in front of the bar apparently put there to prevent this.

Putting it together was easy, but the so called \\"one hand\\" design tray is anything but, AND folding the chair for storage is next to impossible when doing it alone. The tabs on the sides are made for Schwarznegger thumbs, making it almost impossible to fold or unfold. The adjustable height is a good feature, but slides all over the place if transporting the chair folded.For the price, as the review states, it's a good back up chair, but next time I will definitely play with the in store models before purchasing a chair.

It was very hard to ever get the tray on and our daughter would get her feet caught underneath, so your not only looking for two yellow balls to line up, but your also trying to keep your child from getting injured!

The main problem with this high chair is that the food goes everywhere but the tray.

Food also goes between the cloth pad and the plastic chair, all over the buckle, on the main tray (instead of the removeable tray), etc. It's sometimes nice to have a removeable tray, but when food gets all over the main tray, there's no point.Buy a simpler high chair with less \\"features\\" you will never use."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst high chair EVER","review":"I wish I'd read the other reviews here before buying this chair. They are all accurate. We picked this chair because the features sounded nice and the price was good. Now we hate the chair and will be getting another one to replace it.

So I think I will sale these and go for the pricier ones next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The price does not justify the grief","review":"I completely agree with all the negative comments I've read regarding this high chair. We picked the 'Seamist' high chair because of the pattern and the price. My daughter is 11 months old and has only been using the chair for 5 months, yet it feels like an eternity. There is NOTHING redeeming about this chair. In addition to what others have complained about, I've also had difficulty cleaning the straps on the chair, which seem to attract sticky food. Spending the extra money on a higher priced chair is definitely worth it. My husband and I did not realize just how long our child would be in the 'cheap' chair; now we will be spending more money to replace this one. There are so many products that kids outgrow in only a few weeks; but the high chair is something that will be around for a lot longer.

The easiest way to clean it, is to take it outside and use the pressure washer.It is not bad, but would not recomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - CAPOEIRA AT ITS BEST","review":"I loved this video because It shows what the real capoeira is all about, weather you are a capoeirista or not, beginner or advanced! It has unique techniques never seen in any other capoeira tape out there....the music and girls are amazing too...a must watch"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware: it's not who you think it is.","review":"Jeez...the GALL. I, too, was hoodwinked into getting this book, thinking it was by the famous and familiar writer, Fran Lebowitz. I read the blurb on the back and the description of the protagonist's life was certainly not that of the more famous Fran but I was in a hurry and thought it might have been a comic novel, even though that's not been famous-Fran's genre. Two pages in and I knew I'd been baited-and-switched. Thank goodness I had found it in a remainder bin so it cost next to nothing, which is just about what it's worth. It's only mildly amusing and I find it reprehensible that its author would choose to write under that name, even if it's her own, in order to sell books to unwitting readers who would not have bought it in a million years otherwise. It's perfectly legal, of course, to use one's own name even if it's identical to that of someone much more famous and accomplished in the same field, but I wouldn't say it's exactly ethical, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"close call","review":"Isn't being a female humourist who is also called Fran Lebowitz a little like opening a store selling burgers called McDonalds with a logo that is a big golden M?

The fact that Fran Lebowitz HAS lost it is purely coincidental."},{"rating":"2","title":"clever","review":"fran has been a great writer for a long time. i enjoy everything she has done . this is one more."},{"rating":"1","title":"disaapointed that its not that Fran Lebowitz","review":"No insult intended to the author but I was very disappointed to order this book and find that it was not by the same author of the social satires \\"Metropolitan Life\\" and \\"Social Studies\\" but since there were no reviews I had no way to know.So wanted to post so others might not by it for the wrong reason as I did and be very disappointed. This is another writer named Fran Lebowitz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sassy and honest.","review":"I was intrigued by an author who knowingly could be taking on the readers/fans of the better known of same said name, as most would agree that this would be a tough audience and once the blood has been put into the water...well, you best deliver. And I feel she did. As a one-time expat, myself, I laughed my a@@ off. If you crossed Erma Bombeck & THE Fran Lebowitz, this author could be that love child. Sprinkled with extra neurosis, for flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great adventure under the seas.","review":"It was a pleasure finding this novel. I read it over twice. My two sons who are in college also read Captain Nemo and were very impressed by Mr. Xavier Carbajal's style of writing. Scenes in Captain Nemo move along fast and then suddenly there are these magnificent descriptions of underwater worlds inhabited by whales, sharks and giant sea creatures that communicate with Nemo and his crew. I don't think this is supposed to be the Jules Verne Captain Nemo; but I know Mr. Verne would loved to have a copy of this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool and exciting for kids!!!!!!","review":"My friends and I are doing a school project on books that were made into movies and we are comparing certain characters. My brothers read this Captain Nemo book and let me use the book on cassettes. My friends and I think this is a great story. We like the idea of the women in this story. We like the idea of the different people on Captain Nemos submarines from different countries and nationalities. We watched 20,000 Leagues under the sea and read the book. We liked the idea of Captain Nemos love for the oceans. I will be working with my school radio station next year and I will do more reviews of books, movies and tv shows. This Captain Nemo is liked by some boys and girls in my school who like science. We think this would be a good cartoon for Saturday mornings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Nemo was wonderful!","review":"This audiobook was very different from most bestselling, mass marketed books on tape. The storyteller used emotion and accents to get you to feel the confusion of the great genius Captain Nemo and the magic of the sea creatures, the submarines and the ocean. I was surprised when my children (who like all the Harry Potter stories) picked this audiobook. We all thought the music was fabulous, too. J. Harrison & family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic story-I give it ten stars","review":"A very wonderful world opens up to you as you read this story about a future with endangered oceans and a mad warrior. I like the mixture of characters on The Nautilus, The Trinity and The Avenger. This is a well thoughout continuation of the Jules Verne classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTER OF THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!","review":"Captain Nemo is a brilliant devil of the sea. To show him in total control throughout chapters like Sanctuary, The River of Styx and the Pit of Hermes was very well crafted. Then, to show him so vulnerable as he struggled to survive, bleeding, being pounded by storms, trapped in the chapter the Atoll, was pure genius. I've read this book several times, over and over and it always takes me away, out there with Captain Nemo. Thank you Mr. Carbajal, for a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Nemo is hot!!! It has everything!!!","review":"My friends and I picked up a copy of the Captain Nemo audiobook a few months ago at a comic book convention in Florida. Then my brother at UCLA sent me a copy of the novel. Captain Nemo is one of the most exciting books I have read in a long time. My brothers and my friends grew up on Star Wars, Star Trek and other great stories about far away places.But nothing like this secret world under the sea. The way Captain Nemo reads makes science and the adventure under the sea a great story. We noticed on the dustjacket there was going to be a Captain Nemo sequel to this novel. What happened? We want to know what happened to Uriah and Kronos? What's next with Captain Riley? What about Ari and Sonja? We also loved the giant sea creatures like Brutus and Hermes. I hope there are more of them in the next Captain Nemo novel. Also the audiobook had some cool music. It really took you out in the ocean."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC CAPTAIN NEMO!","review":"Captian Nemo is one of the best new additions to science fiction. I have the novel and just recently bought the audiobook. This Captain Nemo has something for everyone especially those of us who enjoy true science fiction with a great story. I am most impressed by the technology of Nemo's submarines the Trinity, Avenger and his New Nautilus. This story deserves to be recognized with Jules Verne, Frank Herbert, H.G.Wells and other great writers. I hope this author gives us a sequel soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Nemo is a terrific journey.","review":"When you start listening to this Captain Nemo book on tape you will find yourself absorbed into the mind and genius of Captain Nemo. This audiobook, as well as the novel, goes beyond Jules Verne to take you into the dangerous, dark and often wonderful world of Captain Nemo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Nemo is exciting!!!","review":"My freinds and family loved Captain Nemo. All of us travel a lot so we take audiobooks with us to relax on plane trips when we go away to conventions. About a dozen of us loved your Captain Nemo. The story was intriguing, fun and very mysterious. We all got a chuckle out of the part where Nemo and his crew were driving golf balls off the deck of the Nautilus. That seen was not only hilarious, it also showed the arrogance of Captain Nemos. This audiobook not only combines a classic style of Jules Verne or H.G.Wells for older listeners, it also makes it fun for younger listeners-my two teenage nephews loved the audiobook and hope someone makes a movie from Captain Nemo."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a super cool Sci-Fi book!","review":"Who wrote that dumb Publishers Weekly review? My friends and I read this Captain Nemo book and listened to the book-on-tape. This thing is GREAT!!! We loved the giant sea creatures like Goliath and Hermes. Very cool writing. We are doing book reports on Jules Verne and we have read 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea and Mysterious Island. We have to admit Captain Nemo has gotten tougher, smarter and his Super Submarines: The Nautilus, The Trinity and The Avenger are works of genius! Just like the mysterious Captain Nemo. We hope there will be a sequel. This would also make a great movie or comic book. A bunch of us are artists and we drew a bunch of scenes from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Nemo is a great audiobook!","review":"I like science fiction (Stars Wars, The Mummy, X Men, Digimon and X-Files stuff)and I picked Captain Nemo for a book report. My teacher said this Jules Verne captain and his story started back with 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Mysterious Island. My friends and I think this Captian Nemo is cool! We especially like how smart he is. I think it is important for heros or people who have power like Captain Nemo to be intelligent and fair. My dad read Jules Verne books when he was going to high school and college. He thinks Captain Nemo is also very cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"On it's way to a Classic","review":"Considering the amount of true scientific research afforded this novel, I am impressed how entertaining the plot is. A very amazing twist on good verses evil, verses an even greater evil. The prose regarding the ocean topographics and the communication with the sea creatures was good form. But this can't be Jules Vernes Captain Nemo? The characteristics are all different. A true warrior with insight and style. This Captain Nemo will become a treat for generations to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim is a superb storyteller","review":"In \\"Kettle Creek\\" Jim reveals his talent by making the reader cry, laugh out loud, then cry again. As the first in a series of books, this is the sort of story that leaves you eager to receive more. He brings the characters to life with such finesse you'd really believe it was written over a century ago! For those who love Michener and his historical fiction style, you won't be sorry if you give the writing of Jim Windwalker a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Dishonest and Self-Promotional Work","review":"Actually, if the reader can get beyond the Eckankar dogma and Twitchell's self-promotional tactics this book can be a good read! Just substitute your own Higher Self or God-soul in place of Rebarz. Twitchell created the character of Rebazar Tarzs in order to claim initiation into the order of Vairag Adepts (found in his previous spiritual path of Radha Soami Satsang). He was no longer a chela of Kirpal Singh (his real former Master) and thus created Eckankar and a lineage of Masters through plagiarism and lies. Twitchell claims his old Master was Sudar Singh, but why was Twitchell not appointed as mahanta/Master when Sudar died if this was true? Who took Sudar's place then? Thus, the need for the Tibetan... Rebazar Tarzs to take the place of the imaginary Sudar. Anyway, as you can see Twitchell's accounts of these meetings with the \\"Tibetan\\" now become suspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Classic","review":"This is wonderful book full of penetrating insights from both Paul Twitchell and his Tibetan Spiritual Mentor Rebazar Tarzs. Well written, it's in the class of Gibran's works, William Blakes works, and other great writers. It is full of love a great book to read daily for spiritual wisdom and insight. I conssider one of the best books I have read. I have read it cover to cover 5 or 6 times. I can't imagine ever not enjoying reading it. It's helped me become a more loving, compassionate human being. I really value what I have gotten from this book. I strongly recommend it to all Soul's looking for more love, insight and meaningfullness in their lives. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foucault and Social Dialogue : Beyond Fragmentation","review":"In this book, Australian philospher Chris Falzon very clearly lays out the Foucaultian rejection of the metaphysical subject, the God-like transcendental subject that is suppose to provide the ultimate grounds for knowledge and action. Falzon argues that such rejection does not automatically lead to fragmentation as Habermas claimed. Rather the true postmodern path is the notion of dialogue, an ongoing encounter with the other. A superb introduction to Foucault's philosophy and postmodernism in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"How one man learned the art","review":"This book was an autobiagraphical approach as to who one man learned.

For many years I've been searching for Daimajin, without knowing its name. I always remembered it in black and white.Seeing the first volume in color, and letterbox is a treat. Yes, it's a standard story of good vs. evil. Yes, the subtitles are not very sophicated. Even so, Daimajin ranks up there with the great monster films. It has its own style and flair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is the worst dvdbox i have bought. There picture quality is horrible, the picture is often full of blinking squares, it happens whenever small details with contrast show, i have never seen anything like it.The english credits interupts the movie with a grey background, the english credits are realy unnecessary and destroyes the feeling of the movies, the english credits should have been in the subtitle or at the very end of the movies.The writing style on the back of the dvdbox doesn't fit with the movies, it lokes like some emo writing or something.The movies themselves was also dissapointing, the movies begin with boring japanese acting where not much happens. The daimajin doesn't appear before the last 20-15 minutes of the films. There is about 1 hour of the 4 hours the trilogy lasts that are worth watching. It's obvious that Daimajin was made into a trilogy just for making more money.Maybe i had too big expectations after watching the awesome trailer for the trilogy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Box listed as Japanese with English Subtitles","review":"There are no English subtitles to any of the discs.

The cinamatography is excellent but unless you are fluent in Japanese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simultaneously boring and yet interesting","review":"This book by McKiernan is the first book in my life that I have ever found to be both interesting and insanely boring at the same time.While the plot is sound and you care about the outcome of the main characters, you constantly find your interest fading in his constant verbose passages about absolutely nothing. The first three hundred pages seem to be him setting the scene for something that never happens, and appears to just be taking up unnecessary space.Of most annoyance are plot hints that are dropped here and there as though no one would pick up on them, but easily give away the outcome of the book.I give it a solid 2 simply for the fact that the outcome was important enough to me for me to finish it. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend, however, as it is extremely heavy reading and difficult to push yourself through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant... apart for a couple of things","review":"This was overall a BRILLIANT book with many great parts and a couple of sad ones too. However as it came to a close i found myself still waiting for it to finish.

In any case, who cares, if you like those types of stories.In this, the adventure itself is not bad, though does drag out after a while.The worst part is the preaching that others here have mentioned. I found myself just flipping pages to get by the \\"Man is destroying the world, thourhg pollution, uncaring disregard\\" stuff, as well as the \\"Noah's Story is not logical\\" speech...Good grief! It would have been much better without the soapbox, but for me, that killed an otherwise OK story. The first half of the book was good then, you end up getting more and more \\"stories\\" being told with political views...I would spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grrreeaaat!!!","review":"This is a wonderful book that I loved from start to finish. Another definite triumph for McKiernan. I was so involved that when I accidentaly found out about Gwylly's death I didn't want to read on, but I couldn't put it down. This book is a much time-worn but still beloved addition to my shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe anyone would give this 5 stars.","review":"Not only is the plot stolen, this guy just doesn't know how to use language. The strained pretentiousness of the dialogue and the irritating misuse of what he barely gleaned of \\"Olde English\\" while reading the Cliffnotes to Beowulf, made me stop every 5 minutes and think, \\"What am I doing reading this tripe?\\"I really don't know. Don't waste your time. If you're looking for classic fantasy, read Tolkien. If you want something slightly more modern -- though still given to purple prose -- check out George Martin.

The directional antenna is just that.. but you need to aim it at the router with pinpoint accuracy to get a signal.. any deviation side to side and the signal drops. I used Netstumbler to test this card and you could watch the signal drop off as you moved the card around. Even from 10 feet away from my wireless router, I could never connect.

This card went right up on line and with the diagnostic utility it came with, I was able to tune right in on a hot signal and connect to the wireless network in the remote room where I am staying. I love it. The swivel antenna allows me to keep the laptop in one place.

Reading this little book not only changed the topic of my paper to the power of gratitude, it has helped me in changing my own attitudes (the only things I really can change about myself) to being more grateful.

First, the sound is so horrible, and the accents so thick, that you cannot understand a single word they are saying. Second, there is no explanation of anything they are doing (the name has been changed--when I bought it last month, it said \\"Capoeira for Beginners\\"--which sounds like it is instructional). Third, the picture/filming quality is annoying. There are no transitions, the picture just \\"skips\\" to the next move. The camera jumps around and makes illogical pans and close-ups. Fourth, this DVD is so short that even the content is not worth the money.So, no-budget recording + no content= a horrible viewing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrid","review":"This is NOT a good DVD for beginners..or anyone else. Like others have said,it's just a taped Capoeira class,with no explanation of how to do any of the techniques. I would be willing to buy a DVD of justa Capoeira demonstration if it was advertised that way,and if the camerawork was professional. Some of the Capoeristas on the program are very good,but it's not worth the money. I got this and the advanced Capoeria dvd for FREE with another order I placed, and I STILL feel ripped off! Avoid at all cost..unless that cost is free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch a class instead","review":"First of all, the tangible items are low quality; the DVD was not professionally made, but burned and labeled, probably at someone's house. The case insert is grainy and printed on regular paper. Next, the camerawork and audio on the DVD are poor: zoomed in too close to see the full movement in a lot of cases, no transition, and no explanations. The content on the other hand is acceptable. The DVD basically shows a Capoeira class (stretching, warm-up with basic moves, and a roda), which was long enough for you to see some good play. Then it finishes with an \\"advanced\\" moves section that started with boxing (?!) and has no dialogue until the end. If you don't have Capoeira in your area and you don't mind overpriced burned media, go for it. But, if you happen to live in a city where Capoeira is taught, ask your local instructor to sit in on a class. Most likely, you'll be invited to join the first class for free.

While the decription of warm-ups and instruments are passable, the rodas and demonstrations are singular and violent. This is not the dvd you want if you are a real Capoeira enhusiast. It is basically a taped class; All the games shown are a very violent regional style, Angola is not even mentioned, and \\"fighting techniques\\" are wrestling and boxing techniques that have nothing to do with Capoeira. Their music isn't very good, either.

This movie, though, shows me that he can't carry a movie on his own. This movie has an incredibly lame plot which is predictably boring. Normally Farley flipping and flopping around is funny, but in this movie, it is rather forced instead than his natural zanny stunts. Half way through this movie I asked my friend if we should stop watching... It's that bad! There are a few slightly funny moments in the movie, but they aren't worth the pain of sitting through the rest.Chris was a great comedian, but let's not fluff our reviews out of sympathy for the deceased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downright Silly, Not Funny","review":"Chris Farley plays the role of a clumsy ninja, ridiculous to the extent that I feel that it is an insult to ninjas.

I wonder what truly talented movie comedians would have done with some of the gags and setups here.

I thought his version of the history of the Illuminati was quite interesting. His final section provides a new view and twist to the plan of salavtion that is offered by God.

It does appear dated, especially the clothing, but, the themes of aging and marriage and lost opportunities are timeless and I like the vintage look of the series, it adds to the slow, gentle, lyrical feel of the writing and understated acting.Unfortunately series 3 and 4 are not available in NTSC Region 1, an oversight I hope BBC soon remedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this movie!","review":"I really loved this movie.

No, because the makers thought explosions were required for an action movie, so they HAD to drop the bomb, and the avalanche HAD to happen. What's more, they wanted emotional moments, so the characters were encouraged to develop a habbit of cutting ropes. The whole plot was totally forced and predictable, filled with cliche. Besides, we have seen the same avalanche scen being sampled on so many films. Vertical Limit is plain boring, but the bomb thing is simply hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdity Limit","review":"When you think a movie can't possibly get any more asinine, this one does. Amazingly bad script with totally ridiculous action scenes. What do you do when climbers are trapped on a mountain? You try to rescue them by carrying liquid nitro-glycerin up the mountain. And you take three different routes, including one which requires you to leap across a 30 foot span. And there's more idiocy - much, much more. On the positive side, the movie is quite funny (although unintentionally). The only reason I rate this film 2 stars instead of 1 is that the cinematography is actually quite good. The acting was not good, but no actor could have saved this script."},{"rating":"2","title":"A grate ride","review":"I really enjoyed this movie I thought it had a lot of action it it.

Gushing machismo and mussle flexing accompanied by syrupie \\"tear-jerker\\" scenes made this move almost a comedy.

Do the producers of this kind of crap not consult with anyone that has knowledge of ropecraft/climbing before making this junk? Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vertical Action","review":"This is a good mix of mountain climbing, action, and drama. If you like movies like Cliffhanger, K2, and Eiger Sanction you will probably enjoy it.

Good cast, great scenery, and good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"People get blowed up...blowed up real good!","review":"This film has its moments, though few. If any of you remember the yahoo film reviewers on the old SCTV comedy show, Big Bob McSomething and Billy Saul Hurrock, I think? They rated films highly based on the number of excrutiating explosions. Well those boys would have really liked Vertical Limit. And, yes, people do get blowed up, blowed up real good, with nitro.Not that it is a totally bad film. The scenery is beautiful, but then again it is the high Himaliyas. The characters are corny and caricatures of those EXTREME types you see all summer. You know, always running, biking, climbing, yada, yada, yada. Scott Glenn as the zen mountain man pondering savior of them all is almost comical. This all being said, Vertical Limit, will take up an evening if there is nothing else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good action","review":"Mountain climbing is pretty much a rich man's sport like expensive sailing boat races. Going to 26000 feet without oxygen isn't an old man's sport,so the gray haired climber in this movie is really the old man on the mountain. \\"Cutting the rope\\" is a metaphor that is given new meaning by this movie.The son \\"murders\\" the father in a climbing accident in order to keep himself and his sister alive.The movie is mostly about a rescue attempt in which 6 people try t\\\\o save 3 trapped in a crevice on K2: 9 people total: 3 return alive.Low pressure anoxia and exposure is not a pleasant way to die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"The action scenes were fun- but other than that this movie is not worth seeing.

At times, it's almost a parody of itself; it could almost be called innocent. Everything happens as it is supposed to, and it's kind of sweet, in a way that the familiar can sometimes be comforting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrilling Action/Adventure!","review":"When I first saw the commercial for Vertical Limit I said \\"Oh, is this one of those movies where a guy can go through impossible odds like in James Bond?\\" but after I saw the real trailer I was hooked. About a week later I saw the movie and I was on the edge of my seat! The basis of the movie was when National Geographic photographer Peter Garrett is climbing with his sister Annie, and his father, when Annie and her father were having a little argument about support ropes, when the 2 other climbers' ropes break and they fall. Peter, Annie, their father almost fall themselves. And the father is on the bottom of their support and instructs Peter to cut the rope so Annie and Peter can survive. ..... Filled with action, suspense, emotions, and the most important thing, adventure!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"how BAD is this film?!","review":"I have to agree with the majority of comments on here which say that this film is shockingly clichéd.Poor effects, obvious chroma-keying, laughable plot, etc. The opening sequence of this reminded me of the opening sequence of MI:2, except John Woo\`s was real - and MI:2 wasn\`t even a climbing movie! In that same opening section, there is the most blatantly fake \\"eagle\\" I have ever seen... feathers dangling of it, wings like planks of wood, etc.. I couldn\`t stop laughing when I saw it, and I actually though this movie was going to be a spoof.......!Don\`t buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst climbing movie I've ever seen","review":"I have some modest climbing experience. I took two schools of snow and ice techniques, climbed Mt. Rainier in WA and Cotopaxi in Ecuador. I read a lot about climbing. This movie is completely unrealistic. Who in the right mind would use nitro for crevasse rescue? I suppose they figured human drama is not enough and they need a lot of pirotechnics to keep people interested. How can you fly a chopper above 10,000 feet to rescue people off the face of the mounain? How can people not wear snow goggles and take off their gloves at those conditions? I reckon so that we can see the actors' pretty faces. I gave the movie 2 stars because some actors tried hard. If you want a better climbing movie see \\"K2\\". You will see real Pakistan, learn about pulmonary edema, the reality of flying helicopters at high altitude, the reality of mounting an expedition. Want a true drama see \\"Everest\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could barely watch whole movie","review":"I hate to write a bad review, but I thought this movie was awful. I couldn't stand Bill Paxton's performance. And I love Chris O'Donnell, but he couldn't save this movie with his life. I literally could barely keep the movie turned on, but I decided to give it a shot and see if it got better. It didn't. The whole movie was very cheesey and I just couldn't believe the entire plot. It seemed as if everyone was over-acting or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brain Candy","review":"A mildly entertaining film (usually only when someone dies, which the writers have found funny and creative ways of doing). The acting is less than spectacular, but not horrid. I really never cared for any of the characters, however, and only wanted to see them die in more humorous ways. The ending is overly predictable. If you want to give up 2 hours of your life and be mildly entertained for about 10 minutes of that, then see the movie. My verdict: Definately not worth going to the theatre and paying for it, nor buying it on DVD. Hell, I wouldn't rent it. However, I'd watch it if someone else rented it (which is what I did)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"I saw this movie at the theater a long time ago and remembered it as fairly entertaining so I picked it up. I really enjoyed the movie with the concurrent threads of tension between the brother and sister mountain climbers dating back to the death of their father and the history of Paxton's adventurer/entrepreneur/billionaire character with the grizzled bitter guide played by Scott Glenn. Though it was not supposed to be funny, watch for the horribly overacted coughing in the ice cave scene. Cracks me up every time. Overall the movie was very well done and well worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This movie is just not a good movie at all.

You'll regret the money (and even time) spent. The special effects are mostly adequate, and there is some great mountain scenery. I might of given it 2 stars to acknowledge that, but I want to bring down the average if I can, so that others may avoid this movie. It's the plot. Pointless, unbelievable, contrived challenge followed by dramatic skin-of-the-teeth resolution. Repeat a dozen times.

Ed Viesturs should dissacoiate himself from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I have read several books about Everest including Into Thin Air.

Well I was wrong! Occasionaly I would check on the movie to see how it was but I had no idea how graphicaly violent it was! My 15 year old will never watch it again! I thought it was a little strong on the reality side! I suggest anyone with children age 13 should view it before they do. I wish I had with my son. It really supprised me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Climbing to the top","review":"I hate to break it to all the people who thought that this movie was bad because it seemed so unbelievable, but this movie is very realistic. Take it from a climber, everything that happened in that movie, CAN AND DOES HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE. Granted, the idea that those things all happening all at once in a sequence of a day is not common. But the realism of the movie to any real climber is strong.As for the acting, I agree, there were some short-comings on that front. I wasn't too impressed with Chris O'Donnell, though I did think that Scott Glen did a wonderful job. Then again, how may real good actors are out there today...If you are looking for a wild ride that is based on the REALITY of climbing and the danger that climbers face, this is a great movie. If you are looking for a movie that has superb acting and a super story line, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non Stop Thrills","review":"OK this movie has a lull about a quarter of the way thru but it's just a building the characters thingy but when disaster strikes it is relentless suspense all the rest of the way and where else to find better action than on K2 the most treachorous mountain man can climb. I am an Aussie but was a bit embarressed the way the two Australian brothers in the film were portrayed as total morons and silently wished they would be bumped off early in the piece. The 5.1 surround sound made u feel u were up there battling against a monster too awesome to imagine. Take the ride but hold on and tread carefully!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very stupid movie!","review":"I have to save my stupid sister because she was stupid enough to go up a mountain when she was warned not to. This is what Chris O'Donnell's character should have said in the movie, it would have been more entertaining! I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen in this movie and finally some stuff did. The helicopter scene and an avalanche scene are the reason for the two stars. If you like absolutely mindless action, there is not that much you would probably like this movie, this is a movie for you. The acting is horrible and the story is even worse. I saw this movie for $... and it was worth $...! After the movie was over I asked my two buddies what they thought and one said,\\" It was the worst.\\" and the other said, \\"It was all right\\".

Hello?!!! It's not supposed to be authentic! It's supposed to be exciting, which it is. It's supposed to have thrills, chills and spills, which it does. If they made this film with total authenticity do you know who'd be in the theater? You and 4 other mountain climbers. It's a Hollywood thriller, not a National Geographic documentary. So relax, put your brain in neutral and enjoy this for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgrace To Climbing","review":"I was quite excited to watch this movie at first, but after about 30 minutes, if that. I was disgusted. This movie lacks every aspect of real-life climbing. As a fellow mountaineer I found this movie to be a disgrace. Using explosives, too much dramma, a helicopter at 20,000 plus feet, and poor ridiculous mistakes clearly gives anyone who truely knows climbing a sense that the producers knew nothing of the sort. For example, when Chris O'Donnell jumps from one cliff to the other. That particular jump would have ripped his arms right off, nonetheless, running in crampons. Very poor, put together movie. This movie gives viewers a false image of what true climbing entails. \\"Don't watch it/Don't waste your time.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood invades the Mountain","review":"I love mountain climbing movies. I watch them all. I was charged for the release of this movie, and watched it with anticipation. In short, it was absolutely the WORST movie I have ever seen! The plot was thin, the concept ridiculous, and the acting poor.As a climber, I found the only accurate part of this movie was the credits. For an excellent review of the making of the movie you might look in Rock and Ice magazine, where a real climber was on board for the filming.Imagine, climbing with nitro on your back for hours, and then all of a sudden it is a big emergency that the sun will cause it to explode. Good thing they found that out just in the knick of time!!! Golly gee!!Perhaps the worst travesty was they made Ed Viesturs look bad, which is unforgiveable. He truly is a hero, and a superb mountain man. Shame on the producers of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...I don't think this movie was meant to be funny","review":"I enjoyed this movie tremendously. My friends and I were rolling on the floor laughing our heads off! However, since it was supposed to be a thriller, I think that maybe the director should be locked in a box and NOT allowed to make any more adventure films.The plot went something like this:Pretty boy Peter Garret has to lead a rescue mission to save his estranged sister and her team who have been trapped by an avalanche.The 'rescuers' plan to climb up the mountain where Peter's sister' team is trapped carrying Nitro they have obtained from the Pakistani military to blast them out of the ice cave they're stuck in. This involves jumping out of a moving helicopter with Nitro strapped to their legs and some how not getting blown up.If you want a good laugh, buy this movie. If you want a real adventure film, don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Packed Movie!","review":"This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.

A much better film actually.), and unbelievable (As in foolish!) stunts! The hero jumps off one side of a cliff, drops to the other with two ice axes in his fists and we are supposed to believe he can not only leap that far, but hang on to the axes while they somehow, dig into the sides of the stone cliff!

How could I not like this movie, right?This movie makes Cliffhanger look like a masterpiece. Yeah, cliffhanger, the one where Slyvester Stallone carries a rope through most of the movie and never, ever uses it. The special effects are relatively good, but the plot is the most nonsensical I have seen. I hate to give away the plot (though I use the word plot very loosely here), but I would think even a ... kindergartener would think twice before they backpacked nitroglycerin up a mountain that is avalanche prone. If you want a halfway decent climbing movie go see the old movie \\"K2\\", or the Eiger Sanction. Or heck, even Cliffhanger with all its flaws. The IMAX Everest films are spectacular also, though perhaps a bit too realistic for some."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for a laugh","review":"funny movie to watch with your friends. horrible horrible movie that takes itself WAAYYYYYYY to seriously. but again, some people find that kind of thing funny, as i do.

Even the beautiful actors (well-cast for the most part) can't save it because the dialogue is so laughably bad.Plot twists? If anything unexpected does happen it simply doesn't make any sense. Continuity problems abound as well as some serious ethnic and religious stereo-typing.If you want a better movie that captures loyalty and survival in the mountains, rent or buy \\"Alive\\" -- it's actually based on a true story.If you want cliches filmed at 10,000 feet, watch this disappointing flick.

The totally improbable twists of plot invented soleley for the purpose of squeezing in another, and another, and another, and another, impossible cliffhanger suspense buildup, are an insult to real mountain climbers and ridiculous beyond imagination. The characterization is impossibly amateurish, the screen writing unbelievably ridiculous, and even the emotional tensions are so unrelated to reality, that I cannot understand how anyone could have spent good money to film this abortion...I really don't want to know.

All the really interesting parts, you know the ones where people are slidding and falling off of the mountain sides, are all shown during the trailer. If you were fortunate enough to see the trailer for this movie before it was released, you are saving yourself a grueling 2 hours. Because that's all this movie basically is. A test for wether or not Hollywood can make slidding of mountains look cool.I gave it a 2, because the action scenes were well done. (See above concerning trailers however.) The story was mediocre, and the acting and directing was hilarious. However, I'm sure that wasn't the intention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't climb K2 without nitro glycerin","review":"The intensity of high altitude mountaineering is obviously not exciting enough for the Hollywood mentality, so the plot needed to be thickened.

On that note I could go on and on using vulgarities to belittle the movie. Instead I will do my best to explain to you what it is like to view Vertical Limit.

I thought the director had learned this on Goldeneye, one of the best Bond movies. The DVD looks great, sounds great, has valuable extras.

I feel insulted that this was put in front of my eyeballs. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen I wish I could give it 1/4 of a star. It almost seemed like they were trying to make it a cult classic on purpose it was so bad. My wife and I laughed out loud through the entire thing, especially when it showed the peak and then the climbers walking near the top on a completely flat surface the size of 3 football fields. Also, hilarious was each climber carrying nitroglycern in their packs?

The opening climbing scenes in the desert - which look like they shot on a SOUNDSTAGE - ends with a hilarious cliffhanger. When Pops hits the ground, for one minute I couldn't stop laughing, it was SO badly timed. Later, Chris O'Donnell tries to make cute with Robin Tunney and it is painful to watch. I always love watching nature's splendor on the big screen but NOT in service to a shoddily written production such as this.

This is definitely not worth the money I paid nor the time I spent installing it. Prior to mounting this antenna, I was using the antenna included with the STH2 home kit and could get fair reception using it INSIDE my garage on a clear day. I thought the SIR6 antenna would be better since it offered better adjustment and easier mounting. This antenna doesn't get good, uninterrupted reception on a clear day. As recommended for those in Tennessee, I mounted this antenna on an outside, west-facing wall and pointed the antenna north-northwesterly with absolutely no obstructions between the sky and the antenna. I get intermittent reception and usually no more than one bar as indicated on my Starmate Replay receiver. Needless to say, I have gone back to using my home kit antenna.

The cable is heavier duty and the connection is waterproofed.As to whether it works better than Directed Electronics 14240 I cannot say.Things to consider between the 2 outdoor antennas (besides the price): Is the greater extension of the Terk antenna important for your mounting consideration (for example to reach out from under eves)? and, Is the color important?"},{"rating":"2","title":"sirius outdoor antenna","review":"Before purchasing the Terk outdoor antenna, I had been using the smaller antenna that came with the Sirius home kit. Until a few months ago, I had been having no problem, the antenna right outside one of my windows. Then I started experiencing drop-offs, where I went from three bars to none and loss of signal. Since I put the Terk antenna on an elevated deck post, I have been having perfect reception. I did take time to aim the antenna properly, speaking to my wife on a cell phone, until she indicated to me that I had obtained the best position. I have this antenna attached to a Terk extension cable, as well. I could not be happier with both products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for new home installation","review":"I am an avid Sirius listener and wanted something permanent in my house. I purchased a Sirius home tuner and didn't want to mount the antenna in a northwest facing window. I found this antenna and mounted it several years ago (probably 3 or 4) and have had no problems with it. I was renovating my house at the time and had the walls opened up so installation was a breeze. I can imagine if you didn't have this luxury fishing the wire down the walls would be a bit more difficult.Reception is great, it is small and unnoticeable from the street. My only issue is that the cable is smaller than standard cable and no one that I found made a wall jack so I had to run the cable through an opening in a wall plate.

The hi-hat sounds also pretty harsh at times and you can hear some distortion. The rest is ok, but nothing impressive.Conclusion - Its a shame that the artistic director tried to be fancy in a MUSIC DVD. Seriously, this hurts the performance way more than it enhances it.

So many mysteries are fun fluff. Redmann manages to weave a tale that is so much more than just a mystery.

We have a police detective, an assistant DA and a doctor all linked to Mickey in some way and very important to the plot. Redmann knows New Orleans and shares it with us, albeit the seamier side. The story moves and takes the reader with it. We care what happens to our PI and her friends and the people who get pulled into the criminal happenings. Watch what happens with Cordelia James and her involvement with the happenings. And then read Deaths of Jocasta, The Intersection of Law and Desire, and Lost Daughters.It's time for another Micky Knight book. Top drawer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl has got it!","review":"J.M. Redmann can write. With her detective Micky Knight, she gives us a portrait of a very sexy, complex woman who finds herself in all kinds of trouble, especially with her friends. I first read \\"The Intersection of Law and Desire,\\" the third in the series, while I was vacationing in New Orleans, then greedily devoured the first, \\"Death by the Riverside.\\" More, more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading","review":"I found that this book held my attention and left you wanting more and not able to put it down for long periods. A good author for those who are not true book worms like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved all three of her novels. fun, witty and fun!","review":"Please j.m. redmann get another book to us soon! Best quality writing in this genre i've read so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should be","review":"Nice idea, but like others have said, unless you're traveling on very smooth roads, the vibration makes the sound cut off and on. Plus it's not loud enough when the ambient noise is higher. When you turn up the input volume, it overloads and cuts out completely. The vibrations broke the base of mine last weekend, so it's life is over. Still looking for better."},{"rating":"1","title":"ITEM DID NOT WORK","review":"The whole idea of this item was great but the sound was warbled and I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but poor quality holder broke immediately","review":"I got this for my wife to attach to our double jogging stroller. The sound quality is decent for a battery-powered set of speakers for the iPod. However, the plastic holder for the device broke immediately upon installation. I attached it to the stroller and tested the speakers and then folded up the stroller and the holder snapped immediately. Hardly any pressure on it. Really annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you paid for.","review":"It's ok for the price - sound quality is not great, but about what I expected. Distorts audio badly on higher volume input, especially if batteries are getting weak.Worst part - battery cover is not very secure (for something that is designed for a bike ride) and loses connection frequently, I have to adjust it (actually loosen it) to make good contact."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute---junk","review":"save your hard earned money, this item offers terrible sound quality and fortunately it is barely loud enough to hear....."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed, but taken care of","review":"the paints in this were dry, but when i wrote the company, they reimbursed me. I wish they wouldn't have been, my niece was very excited about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family/Familia","review":"This is the second beautifully illustrated picture book yet again in both English and Spanish by Amada Irma Perez which paints a very interesting point of view about the differences between boys and girls. Boys find excitement in every aspect of moving to the USA while Amada worries about money, a place to live, her friends and whether she will be able to learn English.She worries about everything and remembers all details because she is diligently writing it all down in her journals. She writes about a brief mention in a letter her father wrote about Caesar Chavez which means a lot more in this day and age because who knew then what we know now about this wonderful man.This book made me want to know more about this wonderful family and how everything turned out for them. This book is not just for Spanish speaking readers but a wonderful book for all new immigrants. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent \\"advanced\\" photography","review":"Although this book is not for everyone, I found it to be the best explanation and reference for many aspects of photography. Unlike other books, this goes into depth to explain the technology well. It is the kind of book that explains Density vs. Exposure curves, color balance and white point temperature (even mireds), lens, cameras, studio lights, etc, etc. It doesn't go into great depth of how to actually compose and capture a great picture, but it does go a long way to explaining how the tools work at a level that engineers or technology-savy people will appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical details","review":"This book (5th edition) provided a few good, new tips and explainations, but my overall impression is one of incredibly technical detail on the practical aspects of equipment and processes. I feel like it's important enough to have a general understanding of \\"how things work\\" to stick with this book, but it does not give much advice on how to think about or approach photography. My eyes often glaze as they pass over how to read manufacturers' charts and graphs, how calculate focal length and color balance, etc., but if you're into that kind of information, you might be interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to learn Conga not Cooking","review":"I just don't get it. This book has ONE line (pp15) on how to tune your Drums and six half-pages of cooking recipe. How about give us some real recording music of Conga Drum? Instead, this book has all piecemeals of beats that the Author expects the readers to learn. I appreciate all the beautiful pictures of the Author and his son, but frankly speaking, I am not interested in his autobiography; I just want to learn CONGA."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"Great book, for all kind of experienced musicians, begginers or advanced. the only thing is that you should know every hand drum beat, such as slap, open an heel/tip tones.GREAT GROOVES IN IT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Coverage of Afro Cuban Rythms","review":"First, although there is a cursory presentation of 6/8 rhythmic exercises, there is no specific coverage of Guagancó, Rumba, Columbia, Songo, etc. This lack of attention to Eastern Cuban folklore (for example, in the Matanzas region) is troubling. There is not even coverage of the simple yet fundamental Cumbia pattern (yes, Cumbia is from Colombia, South America; however, merengue is from the Dominican Republic and not Cuba, yet it is included in this book and in most \\"Afro Cuban\\" topics), and the merengue section is merely two pages. The teaching quality of the material in this book is very poor also. If you want to really learn to play congas and Afro Cuban rhythms then get Tomás Cruz's Volume II - it doesn't have \\"filler\\" material on cooking and other trivia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and to the Point","review":"this is the type of book that takes about an hour to read and is good to do so once a month as a refresher. Not only do you send better messages but you feel better about your communications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item Misrepresented!","review":"Since this was my first xm radio purchase, I'm a little green as to the correct antenna to buy. I ordered this because the picture showed a antenna, my fellow truck driver bought that was the right one, the antenna I recived does not look anything like this one, It's not the same! Also a customer review I read said it could be mounted two ways, mirror, or air dam. What I got was an antenna that ONLY mounts on the air dam (I needed the mirror mount type for now),and as I found out latter, was some old type technology, that requires two antenna (in) ports on your radio. My NEW skydock only axcepts one. Because I waited too long to exchange this, I am now stuck with a worthless piece of old technology. Have a Great day!.."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Non-Stick about this?","review":"I bought this basket to replace a different basket I'd used for years. Thought the lid would be great for easy shaking and welcomed the non-stick. What's non-stick about it? It has to be washed by hand and immediately dried and occasionally covered with mineral oil to prevent sticking. I just sprayed non-stick spray on my old one and put it in the dishwasher after use. This one has a non-detachable rosewood handle that can't go in the dishwasher or obviously over flames. I couldn't shake it making fajitas because the onions, green pepper and meat was slipping through the basket weave and I ended up stirring carefully with tongs. This is going in a garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more spilled veggies","review":"Finally, we've got something that allows us to grill our veggies without dropping half of them in the fire when turning them.

He is very pleased to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strap","review":"I was looking for a non neoprene knee strap, as the neoprene irritates my skin. This is a great strap with a large velcro area for a solid fit that does not come loose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cho-pat knee strap","review":"I found this product was good to begin with but as soon as I wore it a few times it became really loose & wouldn't hold in the correct position. I find myself having to adjust it every 15mins to ensure it stays tight. My previous straps have all held shape for a lot longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best to get at a local store","review":"These knee straps work fine but there is a lot of package information that you need to read BEFORE you purchase this, such as: do not use if you have poor circulation, etc. Also, at the time I purchased this, the sizing information was not available so the strap did not fit; I was allowed to exchange it or refund but I had to pay shipping and handling to receive it and to send it back and I was charged too much for the \\"handling\\". I have since noticed that these are available at most drug stores and you can avaoid all of the problems that I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for unstable knees","review":"Helps me do things that had become uncomforable or painful, especially requiring flexing my left knee.

Just don't get one that is near the end of the adjustment when new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough compression","review":"The strap didn't provide enough adjustable compression. I ended up going with a Nike that gave much stronger velcro for adjustability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware of this shop","review":"Anyone buying from the store should read the info carefully. This cho-pat is for only ONE, not two, which is how I purchased mine in the past. I realized there was only one when it arrived and when I returned it, I was only given 5 dollars and some change back out of 15 since they deducted the free shipping \\"deal\\" that the store was offering. So, I payed 10 dollars for a product I sent back. Bad deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"Get the Nike knee strap. These suck. The huge area on the back of the knee has velcro sticking out that scratches. Bought two of these and both had this issue. These other reviews are a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work with tile","review":"can't believe this has good reviews, it is garbage, it doesn't work with my tile shower. The suction cups aren't lined up, the small one has leveraged weight pulling on it the whole time and has never lasted more than 48 hours without falling, don't buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well but sometimes slips down.","review":"I like this 2 tiered basket design. It is a very handy basket. However, once in a while I clean the walls and I have some difficulty getting it to stick back without slipping. In addition, the suction cups lose their grip after about 2 years of use. The basket stays in great shape and can be washed in the dishwasher. The suction cups should be replaceable.I have also used some of the products at Bed Bath & Beyond with better suction cups. These seem to do a marginally better job staying on. However, the suction cups are protected and last for years. They even cost a little less. They just don't have the 2 tier basket shape that I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best One I've Tried","review":"This is the third suction-cup shower basket I've tried. The other two would not stay up on the shower wall. This one not only stays up, but has more features than the others. There is a section for bottles, where I keep two bottles (shampoo and conditioner), but which has room for more than just two. It has another section for soap, which is far superior to the usual kind of soap dish, because the open wire design doesn't accumulate soap gunk on the bottom, the way the others do. And it has two hooks for hanging a shower pouf, washcloth, or whatever. A keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect shower caddy","review":"I have this shower caddy in the main bath shower. It has enough storage for my needs. It does not rust. The suction cups are strong enough to hold a full basket on the wall until I choose to remove it for cleaning. I purchased this one for the second/ hall bath. Replaces one of those crummy baskets that hang off the shower head. I'm happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"does what it says","review":"Fit my need perfectly. At first I was a little unsure if the suction cups would really keep the basket on the wall of my shower, but it's been there for a couple weeks now and still holding strong with all of my items in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"Been using it for almost a year, suction cups only came loose once.

He also loves motion, sounds and lights and this had even more than expected.

At the end it was aiming to be \\"daughter-of-Basic-Instinct\\" - and missing that particular target by about a zillion miles. This isn't even good B-movie fare. It is very bad maybe Z-movie fare.

I liked the idea of a homemade album that was all natural. That is exactly what you are going to get with this album. It is a piece of art all by itself. The photo doesn't do the actual album justice. The actual album is so much more than the picture conveys. Sturdy pages, well bound, and unexpected accents make this album ideal for gift giving, scrap booking, or creating your very own family treasure. Since the company offers several different designs, I am looking forward to future purchases, and emptying that photo drawer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Handmade Album","review":"I purchased two albums for myself and was very pleased.

For me, I enjoyed the movie even though it was only 1 episode long and concept of the story is probably rampantly found in other anime parodies.Seriously, I'm not sure why everyone is getting this title low marks, people have to realize, this is not intended to be a serious anime unlike its story that is it base off. Sure, the plot sounds corny, guy goes to anime convention, gets sucked into a anime inspired world where the jets are portrayed as girls and they tell him that they will be erased from existence once the anime fans go to another show.Like I said, its corny but very humorous and light-hearted. As most anime fans would say, give it a try you may like it. If you don't want to spend the money on it, get a netflix account and rent it before you buy it.Until next time, peace out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Knee Saver","review":"Since having my meniscus transplant in 2001, I have relied on Cho-pats to help stabilize my knee. The product is great and allows me to run pain free. I have recommended it to many other runners with the hope that it will prevent future pains and injury. I had tried other, less expensive products, but came away unsatisfied, so its Cho-pats for me forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read, hard to digest","review":"I don't disagree with other reviewers on the contents of this book. It's comprehensive. My complaint is with the format and layout of the book. Dozens of UPPERCASE and italicized sections on every page make it hard to read and hard to follow. I am frustrated every time I pick it up. Speaking of systems, a book of this type is a system for delivery of information. A basic understanding of how people absorb that information should have led to a more readable layout without the formatting distractions that this book has. Thumbs down if you want to enjoy learning more about SE."},{"rating":"1","title":"such poor writing!","review":"It is an interesting story, and in the hands of someone like Ann Rule, it would have been amazing.The poor writing is such a distraction, it is hard to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I wish I could have given this book a rating of NO stars. Through the tragedy of Ashley and Miranda's death, Child Welfare and Law Enforcement Agencies now cross report. I wanted to find out the history that brought about this monumental policy. Boy was I disappointed. The author and her husband claim they are the \\"step-grandparents\\" of Ashley Pond, however according to the lineage they have no legal relation to Ashley.This book was written to allow Linda O'Neal a tool to brag about her role in the investigation for Ashley and Miranda. It seems the author forgets that the memories of Ashley and Miranda and how their killer was brought to justice should be the most important part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Let Down!!!","review":"The author of this book needs not only to understand what it is to write true crime, but also to learn the basic mechanics of writing. There was so much unnecessary ego on her part. It felt as though the only reason she wrote this book was to toot her own horn as to what a great investigator she is. She, unlike what the book tells us, is not the one who finally broke the case. Too much was glossed over. I cannot tell how unsatisfied I was with this book. If I read the words 'he/she sauntered' one more time, uhg! Apparently people in her world don't just walk. And I have to agree...porta-potty? Who cares! That shows her need to be recogonized and adds nothing to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK !!","review":"After much publicity of this story over the past few years and after watching the Dateline program into thin air recently I felt compelled to read this book. As a parent of two teenage girls it really hit home. I am not a usual reader of true crime stories but I found the book an easy read and found it hard to put down once I started reading and have read the book a number of times now. I really felt the frustration during the investigation and applaud the author and independent investigator Linda O'Neal for sticking to her guns and helping the FBI finally solve the case. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, especially parents of teenagers and those who like true crime stories. Well Done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boz the Bear","review":"This video is perfect! In a world where everything is either suggestive or inappropriate, this video teaches kids and captivates them at the same time in a wholesome, Godly manner. Teaching them about God's world and loving every second of it. My two kids are in love with Boz the Bear! The songs are catchy and sweet and after watching the movie, my kids will teach me something about God's world hours or days later because of what they learned in the movie. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"My daughter (who's 2 1/2 and has been watching them since about 18 months) absolutely LOVES these videos. She was hooked on Shapes and Colors and now is hooked on B-O-Zs and 1-2-3s! These videos convey healthy family relationships while teaching practical, everyday lessons. WithThank You God for Colors and Shapes, and with reinforcement from us as parents, my daughter has truly learned to see shapes everywhere and in every object...and on her own initiative. This particular video,BOZ the Bear Boz: B-o-zs and 1-2-3s,is great at reinforcing numbers and letters in a fun way. I even gave my daughter foam letters of her own name in an envelope (just like they do for the characters) so she could engage and learn on a more personal level. She constantly asks for this video by name. Because the characters are so loving and kind, it seems to have had an impact on her attitude as well. Two thumbs up for Boz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It depend on what you are looking for .....","review":"This is a great book, if you want your child to think of all kinds of great things you can do with your hands.but..If you are looking for a book to teach your child WHY you should not hit or anything about feeling and emotions involve in hitting than this is NOT the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked for us","review":"I bought this book because my 2-year-old little girl was hitting me on occasion. We read it together, and she loved it right away. We read it a few times a day for several days, and I noticed a difference in her behavior from the get-go. If she hit or if she looked like she was going to, I would just tell her, \\"Hands are not for hitting\\" just like the book says. I would say her hitting decreased by well over 90% within a few days. Now, months later, she very seldom hits. When she does we pull this book out again and read it together. Anyone with a small child who hits should try this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am happy with this printer","review":"I have hed this for about a month. I have it hooked into my router. At first there was a glitch in the system where I could only do one print job, then the printer would not print, and I had to get it back online by turning it off then on.I called tech support, and true to their great reputation, they helped me out. Turns out the printer was not having a fixed ISP, so my computer kept 'losing' it. Tech support talked me through setting a fixed ISP on the printer menu, and since then it has worked wonderfully, and I am very satisfied.Only gripe with this printer is that is can sometimes be 'too smart'. It does not like to take smaller sizes of paper like 4 x 6 labels. If I use full size labels, there is no problem.

It was clunky and temperamental. I only used the printer for research topics off the internet. I think I got around 3000 pages when it started with, 'No [name your color] cartridge installed' when in fact the tone was still half full, then the page misfeeds, and the leaking toner (probably from the vibration caused by the carousel toner cartridge dock), and the page smudging and the streaks on the print outs and; I can go on and on.

In the past couple of years, I kept getting the \\"front cover open\\" which according to fixya.com is an indication that some type of pin which gets triggered when the cover closes, got broken somehow. I would end up having to open/close the cover multiple times before the message went away and would be allowed to print. Now the problem is that the paper isn't getting picked up. I didn't use this printer that much so it can't be a problem with worn out parts. I'm really, really ticked about this as I have in the past year and half replaced the toner for all four cartridges and obviously it wasn't cheap. I suspect this brand is just shoddy - I was counting on the Minolta part being better, but would have been better off with a Canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst printer I've ever owned","review":"I have a small business. Over the years I've owned over 30 printers.. starting with dot matrix. I bought 2 Konica Minolta printers from Sam's Club. The first broke 1 month out of warrenty.

Well, we quickly found out that the 2430DL speaks no standard. It's a \\"GDI Printer\\" which are also dubbed \\"winprinter\\", as it implements the windows GDI on the drivers. There are some linux drivers for \\"GDI\\" but they're experimental at best. And Microsoft gets a piece of the action for the GDI code in the printer. So they win both ways... the printer manufacturer pays them, and the consumer gets a piece of junk guaranteed to work perfectly only in windows.We traded this printer back to a 2350EN model which is a true laser, doing PCL5 and color postscript, and as such, instantly compatible with almost every operating system on Earth, and certainly all in our office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, but don't buy it","review":"We bought this printer because of the lower price and smaller footprint compared to similar printers. When we tried to print documents, they came out with shadows and smudges. Color printed beautifully however. Thinking we had a bad b/w cartridge, we returned it for another unit. This one did the same thing, but it smudged the color, too. All sorts of fixes were tried: reinstalling the drivers; changing the port. Nothing worked. The clunks and noises were bothersome, too. This unit was returned for another model printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real Seagal stinker","review":"From the amateurish opening scene car chase, with Seagal's chubby mug filling the entire screen (and the green screen backgrounds from the car) to the really hokey ending - ugh!The budget was very low, as the special effects of Seagal shooting down a helicopter gunship with his .45 really sucked And the insipid Kung-fooey school of students. Just can't say enough for this bad movie.I think he has a double standing in some scenes showing him in the shadows or of his back (as in Belly Of The Beast) because he's really put on some oink-oink pounds. And he has terrible pancake make-up applied to his aging mug.

This is one of his better action movies. I'm giving this movie 5 stars based on the action alone. There is an explosion at the start of the movie which was done very well. This is not the type of special effects I expect in a direct-to-video release. This was more of a big budget movie explosion. A bomb in a car explodes causing a huge fire ball, and the shock of the explosion shatters windows. The second reason this movie gets 5 stars is the action was great. The car chase was excellent. There were many gun fights. The martial arts fights were good. The third reason for 5 stars is the supporting cast was very good. The person who plays the CIA officer and the person who plays the local police chief were exceptionally well acted parts. This movie gets a R for lots of violence and nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Stuff","review":"Steven Seagal was never a great actor, even in his prime. He was a good action star though. I've always had some respect for him as he's a 7th Dan in Akido and a respected martial arts practioner. However this is a sadly unconvincing film that does him no credit at all.Now rapidly approaching the age of 56, Seagal has put on a lot of weight and his acting and delivery is even more wooden than it was. Sure the fight scenes are good, close-up its obvious he knows his stuff and you wouldn't want to mess with him, but as an action star his time has passed. The plot such that there is really isn't worth describing, and the only redeeming element was Imelda Staunton's performance as the American Ambassador, which is a class above the rest of the cast.My recommendation rent don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT THAT BAD","review":"People should give Seagal some credit. He actually did most of the fighting except the beginning sequence. Some of the moves actually reminded me of some of his old stuff. Hats off and I hope he does more films like this one! Great action fights. Yes he's a little slower, but so is Jackie Chan. It called aging people so you morons cut him some slack."},{"rating":"1","title":"super size shadow man","review":"well not much to say about this movie or the performance.seens like all the newer seagal movie have no substance.all the story line does is jump from one scene to another,with no flow like some of the earlier movies.i would say,watch it on tv.and spend your money on a good older seagal movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!!!!

You go deep into the belly of the black experience before, during and after the Civil War. The cast of characters Jim meets along the travels of his showbiz life are rich and varied. The book will remind many readers of the adventures of Huck Finn. However, it takes a dark Puddinhead Wilson twist. This hurts it slightly, in my opinion, but still doesn't knock the novel off its lofty perch as a very funny, deeply moving and totally rewarding book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, given its premise, but I was extremely disappointed from page one. I read a lot of books and don't not recall ever reading one so poorly done as this one. The author did not even bother to edit it--on every page there are typos, missing words and misused words. (He tries to impress with his vocabulary but uses \\"demised\\" for \\"surmised\\" for instance.) He obviously never took a writing course to understand things like how boring long narrative summaries are or that changing points of view within a chapter, let alone a paragraph, is confusing. I like books that \\"I couldn't put down\\"--but try as I might, I could not pick this one up again after struggling through the first few chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Boring book. I returned it. There was nothing in this book that inspired me to knit. I was expecting cute, unusual, colorful sweaters for adults similar to her childrens patterns. No such luck. If you have one or two books of basic adult sweater patterns you don't need this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some nice ideas, but ...","review":"Easy: good. Simple: good. So far, so good. But Eaton dispenses with too many really basic techniques -- for simplicity, I suppose -- for reliably good results. For example: you simply MUST use a smaller needle for a rib edging; otherwise it flares. And although three-needle bindoffs are neat and stylish, most adult sizes need a little shoulder shaping to look anything but terribly bulky and boxy. Finally, IMO no design calling for 60% seed stitch quit qualifies as a \\"quick knit,\\" even in a largish gauge.The photographs don't really display the designs well; the garments of the grownups squatting behind children are really hard to evaluate. Intentionally obscured? Maybe because the patterns are really too squared-off to look good on anyone over age six...?I got partway through one little sweater and stopped to regroup with a different pattern from another source.I wanted to like this book, but won't trust my investments of time and yarn to such oversimplified directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"not MinnowKnits","review":"I love the patterns in the MinnowKnits series and have made several of them but was disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading, great patterns","review":"This book is an inspiration for those learning to knit -- and for those rediscovering the joy of knitting.

I am in the midst of the first project (furry cardigan for a child) and so far it took 4 tries to get the right gauge (she says size 13, I ended up on a 10.5 even though on all other projects I've done my gauge is accurate), and she specifically states that the pattern done with Furz won't curl, which it definitely is doing.

Although it is an obvious off shoot of Tolkien it keeps you entertained. The main characters are well thought out and the story line keeps you turning the pages to find out what happens next. The story introduces the little people called Warrows. They are excellent bowmen and fierce and brave fighters. This new race of little people is still treated like a childlike race but quickly earns respect that the kenders of Dragonlance never do and they prove themselves more than simple folks like hobbits and halflings. Give this book a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable. In a bad way.","review":"It's ok to rip of Tolkien. Really, it is. Everyone's doing it, it's been going on for forty years. AD&D; rips off Tolkien, and the rest of the fantasy world rips off AD&D.; His literary DNA is everywhere inside and outside of the genre. Still, if you are going to rip someone off, at least change something. Anything. Or at least don't ruin what was there. This series is a \\"reskinned\\" LOTR, but it lacks everything that made that series great. This series (at least, the initial trilogy) has no merit even as junk fantasy, and I LIKE junk fantasy. This is what you should do instead:1. Find and download a text file of LOTR.2. Open it in your favorite text editor3. Use the replace command. (EX: find:\\"hobbit\\" replace with:\\"warrow\\")4. Enjoy.But hey, a lot of people prefer half-frozen fishsticks to fresh sushi; read some of the five-star reviews to meet them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"Many words spring to mind in reading this ( not that I finished) - dull, lifeless, no sense of passion, no sense of epic, predictable, cliched, plagerised, not a shard of orginality, terrible songs, poorly sketched villians- and the writing -eerrk!- to quote:\\" \\" Slath\\" lashed out a command from behind her, the hissing voice hideous, and Lauralin felt as if vipers slithered over her spine\\" *cringe*No."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have any respect for JRR Tolkien ...","review":"... please do not buy these books.The Iron Tower series is a shameless (underscore shameless) copy of the Lord of the Rings. In and of itself this is not a complete crime - after all Lord of the Rings was derived from Norse Mythology. However, these books are so poorly written that they are almost a parody.When Terry Brooks wrote the Stones of Shanarra, he was critized for copying Lord of the Rings. However, the Shanarra books were at least well written and made some attempt to interject original elements.Dennis McKiernan has only changed (some) of the names."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had so much promise...","review":"To date this is the most blatent copy of Tolkiens work. However, Mckiernan does admit this in the opening pages. Still if you are going to copy the master at least do it in a way that would honor his memory. This novels characters were shallow and very unrealistic in their interactions with each other and their enviroment. I was very dissapointed. The only way this novel recieved the two stars that it did was because of the ending. This at least showed some originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored","review":"I started reading the iron tower and right from the first chapter the story it very familiar. I only got a quarter of the way in and then I stopped because I did not like the very obvious copying of the lord of the rings.However, I have a comment to one of the other reviewers who claimed that Jordan's and Brook's series were nock offs of Tolkien's work and I want to know what he was thinking to make such a comparison. Personally, I got bored with the lord of the rings, I read them but nothing in them remotely apeals to me. However, I loved both of Brooks and Jordan's novels and I can not see where the comparison is made.However, although I did not enjoy the lord of the rings I will say that anyone who wants to read the iron tower should first read the lord of the rings and then try the iron tower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Writing","review":"I loved Dennis McKeirnan's Iron Tower. It is a beautifully writen book. The characters seemed wonderfully real and had a tangible feel to them. The story is much like J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Ring series."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pizzaz.","review":"This book starts out fairly promising, interesting characters, nice background, good detail. There's even a large siege battle about a third of the way into the book that is fairly well written. But then its almost like the writer got tired, perhaps a ghost writer or student took over? Your interest fades rather rapidly, but you continue on vainly hoping the spark will be re-ignited. For me, it never was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Listen to Fools","review":"These books are quite excellent if you appreciate less soap-opera and more action. You have to recognize that these are some of the books, along with the likes of Robert Jordan's Conan novels, which helped define the old school/hardcore fantasy. Back when epic violence with only just enough frills was in vogue. This series is short, bloody, and well written. I wish it had been made longer, but the well written and bloody aspects more than make up for that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Dissolve the Doubts of others","review":"To dissolbe the doubts of others, I would like to say that this book is a tribute to LoR. But if you think about it, arent' most books or movies a tribute to something. Every type of writing has a basic idea that most books follow.This book is a non-stop page turner, unlike LoR (no disrespect to J.R.R. Tolkien) Also the underdog hero is much different in background and otherwise.Besides that I find that the only part that slightly resemble LoR are Moria and mountains names the grimwall. The more I think about it the less the two books resemble each other. The idea that this book is even slightly plagaristic sounds crazy to me.I hope that my review has undone some of the damage done by a barrage of falsity."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding, right?","review":"I found a copy of \\"The Iron Tower\\" in a shoebox of books I bought at a yard sale recently. I read the back cover and was greeted with the line, \\"Dennis L. McKiernan's Mithgar books are among the most beloved in all of fantasy fiction.\\" Well this book is a must read then, right? Right??Don't believe everything you read.I struggled about a third of the way into the 600 page novel before I realized this was one of the worst fantasy novels I had ever read. Never mind the derivative story; the novel itself is badly written. One of the most glaring problems is the excessive use of passive voice. While it is not techincally wrong, it comes off as amateur and hackneyed. Also, any time an author uses \\"lo!\\" in the course of his writing, and is attempting a serious tone, I cringe. I cringed a lot while reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolkien one more time . . . or","review":"Before you pick up Tolkien and read it for the tenth time, give this series a chance! If the Iron Tower was a stand alone novel it would certainly lack enough depth to warrant a second glance. But it is not a stand alone novel. McKiernan has developed a depth and richness to Mithgar that goes beyond the bounds of being just a Tolkien rip-off.I can see how anyone who comes to this book comparing it to Tolkien would be disappointed, but why not read it for the enjoyment of fantasy. I have every book about Mithgar that McKiernan has written, and I have been greatly engrossed in the world he has developed.In some ways, Mithgar is what I wish Middle Earth could have been. If only Tolkien had been around long enough to complete some of the other tales of history . . .McKiernan has developed Mithgar and his writing has grown over time (like Tolkien's did). I wouldn't judge the LOTR by the Hobbit, anymore than I would judge all the tales of Mithgar by the IRON TOWER."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most blatant copy of Lord of the Rings ever","review":"This is the most blatant copy of The Lord of the Rings of any fantasy trilogy I've ever read. For instance, the names of the Warrows are so much like Hobbit names they could be Hobbit names, and the plot is practically identical. Still, if you hunger for more Tolkien and have read all his works, this will satisfy the hunger a little. It's \\"cram\\" to Tolkien's \\"lembas\\", though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone who says this is a pale copy of Tolkien is absolutely right","review":"This book was originally written as a sequel to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels, or so the Wikipedia page on Dennis McKiernan says. Then McKiernan could not get the rights to create a sequel, so he messed with the names of people and species and published the books anyway. It's easy to see that this is the case because the book is a completely slavish imitation of Tolkien's story and Tolkien's world, only altered in not-at-all-subtle ways that only serve to diminish the original LOTR story into a pale and unsatisfying imitation.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot like Tolkien, but still different.","review":"I actually read this series before I ever read any of Tolkiens books.

I find my Yers incredibly impatient about getting training and having more responsibility. It seems like they all expect to go from college grad to CEO in their first year! On top of it all, I have several that are pains in the neck about all kinds of things--pay, dress code, scheduling, you name it, they want to change it. I bought this book to see if I could find a way to rein my Yers into our work culture. Martin and Tulgan showed me that I was thinking about all these things as problems, when they're really solutions. In the book, they give fourteen ways of being a better Gen Y manager, along with tons of ideas on how to achieve each one. Some of the ideas are better for me in my position in my company than others, but there's something there for everyone at every level in every company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic","review":"A much too simplistic look at a complex issue- intergenerational-management. To read this book, you'd think that Gen X and Baby Boomers are dinasaurs with attitude problems and that Gen Y comes to the work place with nothing but exceptional skills and enthusiasm. It would have been much more valuable to compare positive work styles and philosophies of these different generations, rather than using the extremes of one generation representing the nightmarish boss and the other representing the bright young professional.

Although this book and its message takes real effort and commitment, it really worked for me! I am now 12 days into the program and have not binged for the entire 12 days. It hasn't always been easy, but this book offers great, practical advice (such as \\"things to do instead of binging\\" sections for each day). I like that the authors really focus on trying to accept your body and self the way it is, understanding that, for the bulimic, food is not really the problem.

This is one of the movies that you might show someone and have them look at you quizzically afterward - so why did you like that one so much? - but it's worth seeing. For me it's one of the oddball keepers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Warren Zanes readily admits that the book is not specifically about the album, \\"Dusty in Memphis\\", but I never did figure out what it was supposed to be about. It seems to be a rambling dissertation about what a non-Southerner thinks the South is or what it should be or what it could be if it wasn't what it is or, oh, I don't know. Whatever it is, it's just not all that interesting. There is hardly any mention of Dusty Springfield, and little more about any of the music, the production, or the players.

Not every reader wants to know the intricacies of the Dorian scale (\\"Aja\\"), but this title virtually ignores the album.

I bought this book thinking that it would actually be about the album. It's not. Don't get me wrong -- it's actually an interesting little read. But it's more about the author and his opinions on the American south. There's very little in the book about the album itself.

False advertising, if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing treatment of a great album","review":"This is a disappointing treatment of a great album. \\"Dusty in Memphis\\" is not only Dusty Sprignfield's best piece of work, it's one of the best albums ever, a true soul classic. Sadly, Zane doesn't do his homework, failing to discuss how the album was actually put together--why Dusty chose the songs she did, who played on what track, the musical context of the time, etc. He commits the worst sin of a critic in that he talks more about himself (i.e., the fact that he once saw a southern woman take off her clothes in front of window!) than the work he is reviewing. Zane really doesn't seem to know much about this album or the South. Much of what he says would get flagged in your average college essay. Unfortunately, rock criticism can sometimes be some of the worst writing you can find. \\"Dusty in Memphis\\" deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good update of RoboCop","review":"I followed this miniseries very closely when it was first broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel, and I am really impressed with it.

Then in the past, Alex Murphy looks like he's in his 60s, wasn't he about 40 when he transfered in Detroit in Robocop? I rather watch Robocop 3 which they also screwed up on.

The first plate out of the box was so poorly printed out of line that single branch tips were double branch tips. In looking over the dishes the picture quality was very coarse and looked and felt like a decal. We didn't even open the second box because we knew we were sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish there were better quality control","review":"This is a beautiful and elegant pattern. I only wish Corelle had better quality control. Both luncheon and dinner plates were badly misprinted; the various layers of printing were out of alignment, resulting in an extremely blurry, unusably defective double image. I sent mine back for return instead of replacement because I don't have any confidence that the next batch would be any different. I've been using Corelle for 30 years now, and while the designs are getting much, much better, the quality control has really dropped.As to the extra thickness of the Corelle \\"Ultra\\" dinnerware (which this pattern is), yes it is thicker, but the difference is not that noticeable compared with other square patterns. The square design is definitely interesting, and a nice change."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot.","review":"I'm sure these dishes are durable and practical, as are all corelle dishes-- the problem is the quality of the decoration.

When the box came, i looked first at the bottom of the plates, looking for the Ultra sign. As Corelle Ultra are more thicker and they are break and chip resistant. What I got are thin plates that looks very cheap. They are made in China and not USA. Look at the other reviews with low ratings, they are 100% correct with the design. they have dull and blurred colors.

Nice sturdy dishes. Don't break when normal ceramic dishes would (and I know because I had Corelle, then ceramic, now going back to Corelle). I love the square design. But the print itself... not great. The pattern is gorgeous, but I don't think a single plate is printed correctly. They all look kind of double-printed and dotted or pixelated. It's too bad cuz I had my last Corelle for 12 years and I will probably have to keep these for another 12 - my hubby likes them and he suprised me with them, so I won't complain to him. Overall, the sturdiness of the dishes is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally an aesthetically pleasing set that doesn't break!","review":"We are a family with kids. We've been using this set for some years now. Got it after half of our previous set (great design, but not Corelle!) went into pieces within a few months after purchase. We were determined to get something that doesn't break so easily. When this turned out true we got two more sets; three is enough for us and any guests.We were (and still are) pleased with the appearance of this set. The design could perhaps be more detailed, but it is pleasing enough as it is, and doesn't fade with heave usage. More importantly, after 3 or 4 years of constant use we only have one damaged edge on one of the plates. Few cups have broken, but Corelle doesn't claim that these are unbreakable. I wish we could get more cups, but unfortunately they are not sold separately on Amazon anymore.Overall, very happy we went for this option.

Holds the reader's hand as they run the wizards and add a couple lines here and there. The various controls and Windows components are only used in the simplest of situations, and the reader is left to deal with any pragmatic use of the control. This is a book to read if you have NO experience at all with MFC, and even then I would strongly suggest having a copy of \\"Programming Windows95\\" by Petzold on the table next to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"MFC examples are helpful but........","review":"This book is packed with a lot of examples of using controls, and lists the hierarchy of the MFC.But I was unable to open the project examples from the CD with VC++ 6 standard.

The biggest problem is the directions, which are so vague and confusing that we basically had to make up our own rules (in terms of board movement, etc.) Incidentally, the board itself that came with the game I bought is very different from the one in the picture above. Another problem is that the questions are often much too difficult - the majority of the time, neither the men nor the women would know the answer. It's mildly entertaining, but if you're looking for a way to pit the men against the women, just buy Cranium and play with gender-based teams. You'll have considerably more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I thought I should review this game. I thought it might be fun, so I had mentioned it to my mother as something I might like to get for Christmas. She thought it sounded great, so she got it for me. It was not that fun though. The rules are confusing. The questions are dumb. I swear it seemed like half of the questions for women were about fishing. How many men even know that much about fishing? The questions for the men were also about stupid stuff. The women didn't even know most of the answers. I suppose this game might be more fun for older people who like fishing and sewing, but it is definitly not a game for people in their 20's and 30's."},{"rating":"1","title":"See if the store will give you an exchange!","review":"Oops... Sounds like a great idea for a game, but boy did University Games blow it on this one.The questions simply aren't very difficult nor interesting for the opposite gender players, and the rules for moving around the board make it possible to virtually skip to the end at times.Simply not much fun.Note: the durable score of five stars is due to the fact that this game is unlikely to be taken out of its box more than one or two times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle of the sexes is good clean fun...","review":"We spend the holidays with our big family.

In this day and age where gender lines are softened, there are few \\"male only\\" and \\"female only\\" questions.If you're looking for a guys vs. girls type of game, I would recommend taking a game you already think is fun and dividing up the teams rather than spending your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair for men","review":"My husband and I were excited to play this game. However, right when we opened it up we realized the answers/questions are something a man would never guess. The concept is boys vs. girls, but a woman could win the game VERY easily.

The \\"male\\" questions are mostly about fishing or sports while the \\"female\\" questions are mostly about cooking, cleaning and soap operas.The idea of the game is horribly simplistic as well, just advance up the board until you win. The model of the game is [bad] as well. You advance up the board until you hit the Wild Card section where you either have to go back to start, move back three spaces or lose a turn. The only way to win the game is to keep going returning and returning and returning to the wild card section until you get a random miss a turn card (about two in the deck) after which you can miss the turn but then can advance past the wild card section.The rules are horribly written and hard to understand.

The females had a much eaiser time anwsering the questions the males were asking. The males however had the worst time answering the questions the females asked. Even the females didnt know the answers to some of the questions they were asking us. All in all this game was really boring and all it incited was complaints from the males because we couldnt answer ANYTHING correctly. Maybe we are just stupid...but im sorry, the average male does not know who the first female cosmetic company was..or what Creme Ferechashsadh (something French..i didnt see the spelling) is...final verdict...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!

Better games are Cranium or Personalitease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely painfully awful!","review":"I realize that this game is supposed to be about knowledge that one sex has and the other doesn't, but why did it seem to us that all the questions for women were about clothes and make-up/perfume?

Horribly sexist game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair Questions","review":"The concept for this game is great, however, the questions that they ask are unfair and one sided. Most of the male questions (that the females must answer) are about fishing. The female questions are easier, and tend to lean more towards common sense.

The questions the men have to answer are primarily random survey questions that NOBODY knows exactly, such as, \\"What PERCENTAGE of women say they enjoy romantic movie comedies more than romance novels?\\" Of course the women kicked our butts with us having to answer questions like those, but we tested our theory...We switched the questions. Men answer the men questions and women answer the women questions. We beat them worse than they had beaten us (and by a long shot). Why?

The younger players got more questions right. The older players fell into the stereo typical questions. This is really designed for an older group of adults that follow the gender rules of their society. I think the younger you are, the more you will not enjoy this game. We did have a lot of fun - but then again, we didn't follow the rules. One comment said the questions were stupid - yes, they are if you are a young adult. \\"What color is the positive terminal on a car battery?\\" That was for the women and I was surprised that they got it wrong - then again the leader of their group was in her late 50's.

Maybe it is just the men I know, who watch foodtv or watched VH1s fashion show, but the men always seem to know the answers. The questions aren't balanced well from male to female. Some are just so obvious that a child could get them. And many seem to be very stereotypical of the ideals of the 50s household of husband and wife.

The only other explanation is that the women we played against are twice as smart about the opposite sex as we gents (perish the thought!).Despite getting pulverized by the gentler sex, the whole group had a great time, with lots of laughs and high-fives all around.

This is a collection of essays from quite a number of people ranging from anthropologists to professors on mythology. There are in depths looks at perception and myth-influences as well as scientific looks at tracks, fecal matter, hair samples, and vocal recordings in relation to these creatures.If you just want some stories on sightings, this is not the book for you.

I promptly returned the printer and purchased the cannon mp600. Hp's used to be so good what happened.P.S. For all the people who complain about printers.

Actually, third in 10 months.My family got the first one in December of 2006, mainly to scan photos. I took it with me back to grad school, thinking having my very own scanner would be beneficial. For the 14 weeks it worked, it was great. One day, it just refused to turn off unless unplugged. It also refused to complete the turn-on process, staying in printer limbo. HP, after over 3 hours on the customer service line, finally decided to send me a replacement.Three weeks ago, the scanner/copier option failed on that model. So they have since sent me another.

I have had it since Dec 2006. It scans well and prints well. The pictures that I have printed are great--especially using HP paper. So why do I rate this as a 2 star? Because of the ink cartridge. They are less expensive. A black cartridge will run you $14, the color maybe $17. Sounds great, right? Wrong--there is only 5 ml of ink in the cartridges. Folks that is a teaspoon worth of ink!

It helped me understand and appreciate all the nuances of this performance. Plus, it's kinda cool to hear a British guy talk about music for about an hour.This recording of Mahler's 9th ranks among my favorites. Why? First the sound. Telarc is celebrated for its beautiful sound, and this CD does not fail to achieve just that. Second, the performance is incredible. A definite must-hear for anyone wishing to explore Mahler in general or specifically his 9th symphony. You may need to never buy another version again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A landmark in Mahler discography","review":"The sound on this Telarc recording is brilliantly clear and yet warmly atmospheric. The interpretation pays close attention to Mahler's markings in the score and achieves a level of transparency and faithfulness to the densely polyphonic structure that can only be marvelled at.Zander's brilliantly instructive comments on the score contained on the accompanying CD alone justify the price of this recording. I found his description greatly enhanced my appreciation of this symphony, especially the 'difficult' second and third movements and their relation to the whole.This CD sets a new benchmark for recordings of Mahler's ninth.Congratulations to all involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Musical Experience","review":"This is one of the best Mahler Ninths in my collection of eight or so. Zander is an outstanding Mahler conductor. Besides this, the recording includes an amazingly illuminating discussion record. This highlight is a note by note traversal of the first two pages of the score, which are included in the recording. It's a great bonus to anyone not a musician themselves who like to look under the hood and see what makes the wheels go round. Highly recommended to all Mahlerites."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap quality","review":"I bought this belt for a halloween costume, and it didn't even survive the first try on.

The item seems great because of its versatility but there are so many negatives to this toy, that I would not recommend it. The wheels don't roll - they often get stuck so my toddler has difficulty pushing it around and the engineering of converting stroller to grocery cart is flimsy and often the front tabs of the bottom basket come off the rods to just dangle to the floor and the same happens to the bottom front of the stroller - it often doesn't stay put on the rods to form the stroller seat so it turns into more of a pouch than a seat.

She never had any problems with the wheels not rolling or it being difficult tochange from stroller to shopping cart. The extra little fabric infant carrier is useless and we threw it away the first daybecause it was frustrating for her and us and just did not work at all. Not a big deal.

The baby carrier doesn't support a doll and velcro doesn't stay on my daughters very well, but they still attempt to use it. We've ended up buying a sturdier Chicco one that will last much longer.

On the very first page i noticed an error. The author said that Phoebe's fiance was named Cole Porter not Cole Turner and all the Charmed viewers should know that cole's name is not Cole Porter! Then later on in the book the author talks about phoebe throwing energy balls...but that, like most of us know, is an upper level demonic power. I just wanted to point this out to some people and this is a nice place to do it. I thought this was a good book despite these errors. But still the writer should look into what she is writing next time! Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"So not Charmed","review":"has carla jablonski ever even seen the show charmed?! she would know that they cant throw energy balls.

It was the worst of the charmed books that I have read.First off how come Phoebe can throw energy balls and Paige trying to when she's in cat form.

In the show she got over it along time of go.Third the book would be okay if there wasn't so many holes in the story.

Thats the whole point of them having specific powers, so they have to make it interesting.I also saw alot of typos like when one sister was supposed to say something but it had \\"Paige said\\" but it really as someone else.

To say that FDR wanted Pearl Harbor to happen for the US to enter the war on the side of England is ridiculous. Japan did not have any signed treaty, let alone a handshake with the Axis powers. The real question is why Hitler decided 3 days later to declare war against the US, the answer to that is still unknown; Hitler may have figured since the US was fighting Japan he could fight the US as part of his world conquest. But still, the Japanese do not call it WWII, the call it the Great Pacific War, and look at the war in Europe as something different, which it was.

His reasearch efforts are prodigious, and this may be the definitive word on this subject, but it is 'dry' reading.

I mean, it's what... $6 after shipping? Pretty darn cheap. And surprisingly, as far as the sound quality goes, it is great, much better than the $20 cassette adapter I bought at Best Buy years ago. Unfortunately the diameter of the male end headphone plug is too narrow. It freely spins around in my ipod, and the tiniest budge causes all sorts of static and often cuts the sound out of the left side of my car. On top of that, a while back I had dropped my ipod right on the headphone jack, which actually made the hole tighter, so any other pair of headphones I've used is difficult to put in the ipod.Consensus: Don't buy this product, spend an extra dollar on something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal...........Works Fine","review":"Works fine.

There is evidence for this in the subject matter of the poems: Pindar covers enormous depth in small space.There are notes at the end of every poem, which, for me, are preferable to endnotes.

I'm sort of glad the swearing & nudity are gone so that I can show this sad piece to my son.

When I read that Ginger had a new solo record out, I had to get it (despite the hefty import price tag). Let me just say it's worth the price & then some.You just don't get better melodic hard rock pop songs than the tunes on here. Some of my favorites include \\"Yeah Yeah Yeah,\\" \\"Ten Flaws Down\\" and \\"The Man Who Cheated Death.\\" These songs have a modern feel & sound.

Through her book and workshop I realized that while all of the world may be a stage, and everybody may be a star, few comprehend the reality of either statement. Lena Nozizwe believed the words and became a star--in her own life. She then took the time to let the rest of us in on the secret.

The first volume introduces probability from the discrete viewpoint. This volume is filled with interesting applications of the theory and has hundreds of doable, informative and fun problems. Having taught several post-calculus probability courses, I often found myself looking to Feller's volumes for ideas and examples. It is a good introduction for a sophisticated undergraduate to discrete probability. The second volume looks at the measure-theoretic side of the subject. Were I to only own one reference on probability, it would be Feller's book. Feller was a significant player in the probability field in his lifetime and he is also an excellent expositor."},{"rating":"2","title":"20 Tons Of FUN!","review":"Great game for the whole family.

The first red flag was that I couild not find this model listed on Grundigs website although it is marketed as Grundig by Eton. Whatever that means. I read reviews that said the radio suffers from station drift but I also read that the problem was supposed to be fixed on the deluxe model. Well I experienced the same drifting problem as many other people did. I hate to rate anything as a one star but the radio is pretty much useless to me and I went through the process of ordering and now returning the item.To be specific the problem I have experienced is that once a radio station is tuned in it would randomly jump to playing static and the LCD readout began displaying numbere erratically."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal","review":"I got the radio in time and the product is in good condition as described in ads, and had pleasant experiences to work with the seller.

The speaker gives excellent sound. The FM Stereo is also quite good with your own quality headphones. Makes an excellent bedside radio... the tuning knob being much too loose for outdoor adventures. Also, the RF Gain knob doesn't seem to function. I benefit from a 100 foot indoor long wire antenna. As I've indicated, I'm very happy with the overall quality of the radio, with excellent reception on all bands. Why spend $45 more on another radio?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grundig S350","review":"I purchased this radio because it was supposed to have an outstanding tuner that picked up weak FM stations. The tuner is no better than the tuners in the other 6 radios in my house and in fact is far worse. When you tune in a station the Grundig drifts up and down off the selected station requiring almost constant retuning. It might be great on SW and/or AM but I bought it for weak FM stations and it is terrible. I would have given it no stars but that was not an option.Volume is also a problem. At maximum volume is not very loud at all.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Radio","review":"Much has been improved in the DL verison. The sleep timer can be turned off. Signal lock reduces drifting. After about 30 min. inside I get almost no drift at all. AM is powerful. I live in Peoria,IL and I get stations from New York, California, Florida, and Minnisota and they sound like they're comming from Peoria. The tunning dial on mine is not sloppy like other reviewers have mentioned. Short wave reception is very good and with an external long wire it is excellent. The drawbacks are No SSB, and the wall wart adapter adds quite a bit of noise on the SW bands. I have been very happy with this radio. It reminds me of the old Panasonic Rf-2200"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grundig S350 Deluxe AM/FM/Shortwave Radio","review":"The Grundig S350 has great sound quality. It offers many features like bass/treble, narrow and wide band width and gain control, just to name a few.I find its compact design and superior sound not to mention the great reception is well worth the price. Amazon.com offered great shipping at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frequency drifting","review":"This radio will not stay on frequency once a station is tuned in. It drifts away sometimes right away, sometimes after a minute or two. When searching up or down using the tuning knob at some points (random) the led frequency readout starts spuriously jumping around and ends up at a completely different frequency. This makes this radio completely useless to me. I have read other reviews since purchasing this Grundig radio and the reviewers report the same problem. This problem is no reflection on Amazon, it is a shortcoming of this particular Grundig model. I do NOT recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Failed","review":"The radio was larger than I expected. So be clear about the size of the radio you want before you order it. When the radio arrived, I put in batteries. It did not work. I then used the AC adapter, pluged it in and turned it on. The radio started to smoke and I pulled the plug. The radio never did work and I have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless piece of junk","review":"AM stations that are clear and clean on my car radio do not come in at all.

It came in today and I just sent it back. I always thought Grundig was a great name in electronics. When I tried to tune in a nearby FM station that I listen to regularly, I could not get it clearly. There was a lot of static and hissing or whatever. The speaker was very poor quality and certainly would NOT fill a room with sound. I have a little Sony ICF-SW7600GR radio that I bought from Amazon a year or so ago for more money than this one cost. It works far better, has far better sound even though it is very small compared to this Grundig. Some people seem to have had good luck with this radio so perhaps I got a lemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat, quality","review":"Of course Grundig was a reason I considered this radio, and quality seems inherent.

In NZ we are 240v. You would think someone would check the country of destination. Went out and bought one. Then found that the mini-jack is wired the other way around so had to cut and reverse-wire it.AM/SW bandswitch is intermittent/faulty, may have something to do with the fact that the knob had come off in transit.Finally, the tuning is hopeless - there's so much 'free-play' in the mechanical part of it that it takes pot luck to land exactly on frequency.I feel ripped off, and I wouldn't buy it again. I'm too busy to mess around returning it to Amazon (I can't just 'take it back to the store'!) so I guess I'll just have to live with it.What a shame - especially with the Grundig name attached to it.

If you like radios that specialize in front end overloads and false images (birdies) this is the set for you. If you're a beginner and have never gone into short wave listening, get into another receiver so your first impressions are good ones. I have managed to question other users in various newsgroups on the Internet and they have the same thing to say about the set. Maybe they're more tolerant of the poor performance and noise this thing generates. I've owned this thing for almost one week only because it took me six days to bring it back.

It has long battery life and allows you to choose AA or D size batteries with the ease of a selector switch. The radio has a 90 minute timer which is useful, but if you want it to stay on indefinitely, the power button needs to be held down for 3 seconds.

I gave this book a fair trial (188/360 pages) and simply could not read any more and threw it out. The author tries to be cynical about people (and People, the magazine) who drop others' names, but does the same thing herself. Don't be fooled by the Clinton connection trumpeted by the promoters; it's just made up and has little, if anything, to do with this book.

For now, though, the birds are enjoying it and the squirrels have been kept away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite squirrel proof","review":"Perhaps here in western NC we have a few very determined squirrels that refuse to understand what squirrel proof means. This feeder has cut down tremendously on who visits it, but there are two who can get up there no matter where I place it. I can foil them for a day or two (rubbing the tallest pole I could buy with Vaseline really helped.) I feel like the crazy lady on a U Tube video (running out and yelling at squirrels all morning) My next step is to add something to the feed. I tried the pepper but they never even noticed they were supposed to hate it. Another disadvantage is the only birds that seem to enjoy it are the smallest ones. Cardinals, jays, doves etc don't seem to be able to eat from it. That said, it really cut down a whole lot of squirrels gobbling up the food and swarming in my yard in a disgusting manner. It has gone down to just two squirrels from what seemed like a pack that could empty a feeder in 48 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grear feeder","review":"This feeder seems a little expensive at first but, after looking at competing devises, this feedeer is strongly built and, with just a little upkeep, should last for years. Others I've had in the past were always breaking and needing replacement. Easily removable top to refill feeder. Squirrels have tried to get in but have failed every time. Adjustable arms can support all but the heaviest birds. Have only one big bluejay that sets down arms. Always had problems with birds scooping out unwanted seed onto the ground. Built in baffles at the feeding location prevent this and help seed last longer, another savings! Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not squirrel proof","review":"I chose this feeder, not for its looks, but in the hope that it would be squirrel proof. It's not.I have hung this feeder from a pole and my squirrels have learned to either 1) jam their face or fist under the trap while they balance on the pole or 2) take flying leaps from the top of the pole and spread seed on the ground to hoover up later. It may work if it is hanging from a tree branch with nothing to launch off or balance on, but we don't have low lying branches so can't try to see.I am going to try one with a built in squirrel baffle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smarter Squirrels","review":"I have two of these feeders. All I can say is that my squirrels must be smarter than the squirrels the manufacturer tested this feeder with (or should I say \\"the squirrels with which the manufacturer tested this feeder\\"). My squirrels sit on one side (closing that side to the seed) and reach around to the other side and help themselves. The manufacturer might consider connecting the two side closing mechanisms with a gear so if one side closes, the other closes with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"squirrel proof birdfeeder","review":"Very nice bird feeder. Not quite squirrel-proof if you have it hanging from a stand where the squirrel can reach it from on top of the stand, going upside-down.

Has a lot of room for bird seed, so will be nice in the winter if you have lots of birds and don't feel like going out a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squirrel Proof? Not really...","review":"I have been using this bird feeder for almost a year. It works great and is easy to fill and maintain, however it is not totally squirrel proof. The squirrel's have figured out how to hang from the metal bar with their hind feet and get to the seed without depressing the panel that is suppose to keep them from the seed. It just goes to show you that squirrel's are smarter than we give them credit.Over all I have been happy with the feeder, it would be more squirrel proof if it were taller so that they couldn't hang upside down and get to the seed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only baby squirrels!","review":"This feeder is so easy to fill and the top replaces and fits well. I enjoy watching the squirrels jump on it from the top only to have it tip slightly and they fall to the ground. They aren't hurt.

I do get lots of birds coming for seed every day at different feeders. Maybe mine was a lemon, but when the sparrows landed on it, they could no longer see the opening to the seed tray, and finally, fewer and fewer birds bothered with it. I wrote to Heritage Farms (well, Kay Home Products) and sent them photos of the birds being confused, but they had nothing to say except that I should return it. So I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several issues","review":"Feeder arrived from the supplier without the necessary parts to hold the hanger on. I emailed the company and told them that I was using a couple of safety pins to make it work. They emailed me back and said they were happy I could make it work.... I was really looking for some parts to be sent to me. One side of the perch for the birds fell apart within four months - yes it could have been the raccoon hanging on it. And then every time it would rain the slightest little bit, the seed would get wet, turn into a sticky mess and no longer come out. I recently just threw it away......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Squirrels away","review":"Thus far I love this bird feeder.

Smaller birds - finches, nuthatches, chickadees and sparrows - have no problem.It's not squirrel proof as they figured out on the second day how to hang from the bottom, avoiding the perch, and eat seed out of the trough. It's not easy for them though and has slowed down the amount of seed I was going through. Also, the top of the feeder slides up easily and they can get inside it by just pushing the top up. My husband put a clamp on one side to fix that problem.I'm disappointed that the cardinals can't get into this feeder and will keep my platform feeder up for them.

I have used it for nearly a year and the seed gets damp in heavy rain and SC high humidity. Once the seed has fermented though emptied and washed in clear water birds keep away and those who do land do not feed. I want to return the product but do not known or if.

My total price was still less than the purchase price at store.I am very Happy with the product and the price!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing to birds","review":"I got this feeder so that larger birds such as cardinals could feed at my feeders. This is hanging alongside a tube feeder. The birds hop over to this feeder and first try to peck at the food they see through the plastic side. Then they must smell the food at their feet and try to peck at that. The bar that they stand on is so close to the food they have a hard time getting their heads under the little protective lid without slipping back. It does keep the food dry and it is amusing to watch our resident squirrel try to get at the food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Squirrel Proof","review":"Don't be fooled, a hungry squirrel is much smarter than you Heritage Farms! As I stand here looking out the window, we see a fat squirrel hanging from the top of the feeder upside down, working the feeder mechanism to get his grubby claws on the food, with much success and what appears to be little effort. Later, we see him actually inside the container!

She ended up buying one for me as a gift too. At first I put it on a Shepard's hook. The squirrels just hung on the the post and ate. That was not the fault of the feeder, but of the placement. I realized that I would need to put it where they would be forced to step on the perch to close it off. After a few tries I found a good placement on a tree branch that worked perfectly. This feeder works great as long as you place it properly. Make sure the squirrels can't eat from it without having to support their weight on the perch. Once they realize it closes up every time they try to get the seed, they quickly learn to ignore it. I am very happy with this feeder and would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I have found yet","review":"Squirrels do learn how to hang from the sides without touching rail.

The Ten Commandments here precede by far the crossing of the Red Sea. But as Grand Opera it is wonderful. And Muti conducts the entire piece in French including the Ballet making is quite special. Other than Frittoli I am unfamiliar with the singers but they are all up to their task. The unit set centers on an organ and although that doesn't seem promising director Ronconi uses it to good effect. Taste has switched to the earlier Mose in Egitto. But isn't there room for both these operas? I certainly wouldn't want to forgo the new music for Paris.

It's hard to locate specific info on each model year because the author will switch from discussing a 122s to a 544 model made 20 years before it in the same paragraph. The pictures aren't that good either, most are of modified cars, not stock. It's missing important information such as prices, which years & models were best, buying tips, etc. I guess this book would be an OK addition to other books on the P1800 and 120 series, but it fails miserably as a single source and that's what most people (like me) want.

Everyone really got into character right from the get-go. When people arrived, they arrived in character. Each of us enjoyed this game.The only drawback I see to this type of game is that once you have played it, it's done. That is, you know who committed the crime, how and why. Maybe they could come up with a way to have multiple endings. Or, maybe someone could set up a game exchange, where once a person had played the game, they could exchange it with someone else for a game they hadn't played.

My husband didn't understand my insistence in driving all over looking for this seat but once we sat my son in it he was sold. It was the only seat we found in stock that offered real side impact protection plus the weight range that allows us to use this seat longer than the two we've previously invested in. Should have bought one from the start! I do have drawbacks, however. 1: My son has a long torso so it's not a perfect fit. 2: It's a little bulky; just barely fits the backseat of our F150 when reclined. My 16 month old son (26 lbs, 34 inches)has no complaints about being in the seat though, which makes it the best investment we could have made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat","review":"I just bought this carseat because my baby is outgrowing her britax companion.

A saint is NOT a sinner. A sinner is a sinner. A saint is a child of God. If a saint falls into a sin, you can rest assured that he/she will repent immediately and TURN away from that sin and commit it to more. A sinner will continuously commit the same sin.Another young man has been deceived by Satan is the song, GOD STILL HEARS A SINNER'S PRAYER. Satan knows that God does NOT hear a sinners prayer. His song may sound nice and fancy and make you want to clap your hands and snap your fingers, but the words are deceptive.Please people, for the sake of your own soul, you must be careful what you allow into your spiritual ears and into your soul.

I was to the point that I thought I was going to have to purchase new carpet. I saw this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I was AMAZED at the results. I sprayed it on, worked it into the stain with my fingertip for a few seconds. Then, I dabbed it with a paper towel. On the stains that were just minimal and on the surface, they were gone within less than 30 seconds. The bigger, deeper stains took longer.

It instantly cleaned up pop stains, greasy looking stains, stains from my dogs, and most importantly NAIL POLISH! When it got the dark nail polish out of my cream colored carpet, I knew I was in heaven with this product! First time using it and I was having fun watching it instantly clean up the stains without all the hard scrubbing. You literally spray, rub a little, dab it to soak it up, and the stain is gone. There are no harsh chemical smells and little to no skin agitation!

I'm normally very level-headed and skeptical but after trying Folex, I truly believe in the supernatural! ***It really IS magic!*** It was just like a sorcerer, what with the way it conjured up large, blotchy discolorations where before there were only tiny, barely noticeable spots. Much like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, Folex pulled my security deposit right out of my account once my landlord saw the half bleached/half discolored circles. Obviously this product was created by some sort of Super Wizard because the Folex stains not only remained after shampooing (which happened to remove every single mark on the carpets not touched by this stuff) but the Folex stains actually got worse with time!

Old urine spots, a strawberry milk stain, chocolate... Even random old spots from before I moved in.. It hasn't seemed to effect any of them. Certainly didn't disappear before my eyes.

The next day we received a bunch of comments on Facebook letting us know how much they enjoyed the party. We have hosted the New Years party every year for the last 4 years and had never received so many compliments.

THIS IS NOT WHAT I INTENDED AT ALL. I LIKE THE SLEEK DESIGN, BUT THE MATERIAL USED IS NOT OF THE QUALITY I WAS EXPECTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Release?","review":"I was looking for a toilet seat that had a substantial feel, was well constructed and of good quality. I trusted the Kohler name and expected that the higher price would indicate a better product. Not so. This particular model has a ketchy feature that we didn't expect to find: Quick Release. It's hinges snap into place, and supposedly snap out of place for cleaning. I really wasn't in the market for a removeable toilet seat.Now that I have one, I feel compelled to snap it off for cleaning, only I can't. The \\"quick release\\" hinges are just loose enough to allow for seat shifting room (feeling like you're falling off the throne when you sit down) but not loose enough to easily remove. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.I recommend avoiding this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware!","review":"This product has been redesigned by Kohler. It is not the same as the original toilet seat. Called Kohler because there was a defective nut and they are sending a replacement. However, I told them we were not happy with the seat as the ring surface is more rounded (original was more flat), but more importantly the lid can not open far enough to rest on the toilet back, therefore it will likely snap, if someone leans back too far. Kohler apologized, admitted they redesigned the seat, and gave me two suppliers to call, to see if they have any \\"old stock\\". Seriously, this toilet seat cost a fortune, Kohler needs to do better, particularly when they make a toilet that has a proprietary seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"So not worth the money","review":"This toilet seat is a replacement for the original. The original is 13 yrs old, not bad. On the new one they changed the way it attaches to the bowl. Plastic screws go into plastic nuts and then a plastic cap is snapped over the top to hold the seat on and in place. The plastic snap on covers that are suppose to hold everything in place do not stay snapped on. Therefore the toilet seat moves and does not stay in place. $88.00 is alot of money for a piece of crap for a craper.

This seat works, supports the body, and is simple to install. The price on Amazon is better than from Kohler.It's not padded, it's not warm, it isn't slow to close, but it covers the bowel and this one isn't cracked like the one it replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Toilet Seat! Much Better Than Included Seats.","review":"This seat is a nice, solid plastic. It fits my elongated Cimarron (K-3609-0, 4 Stars) and Wellworth (K-3574-0, 5 Stars!) toilets nicely. Definitely worth the ~$50 at HD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change in design needed","review":"I have had this style Kohler toilet seat before, but have been disappointed with this batch. I ordered seat replacements for 2 toilets and one seems to be satisfactory and the other is problematic. For some unknown reason, Kohler designers felt compelled to change the attaching \\"hardware\\" to a sub-standard design using plastic bolts and plastic wing nuts. One of the bolts will not tighten properly and the seat loosens constantly. In this case, spending this kind of money on a Kohler product was not worth it at all. I am very frustrated with this change of design."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books!","review":"Although many people believe that any book pertaining to animals must be for children, this book is definitely for adults. It is a wonderful account of a dog's daily life (Smith really gets inside Thor's head), along with a new take on the traditional werewolf story (another of my favorite subjects). Smith's prose is sharp and insightful, and the story rockets right along. Don't pass over this book just because it seems like it's for kids! I assure you, it's not! (And aren't we all overdue for a story about animals? I mean, come on, it's not like animals have to be featured only in kiddie stories. I applaud you, Wayne Smith, for writing an insightful and adult novel about a dog and his loyalty to his family. Great job!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ff","review":"Not great. Don't waste your time unless you really really love dogsIn which case you'll love it so go for it"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"I discovered Thor several years ago in my local library and have recommended it ever since to friends and family. Thor entered my heart and took up residence in a place usually reserved for \\"real\\" pets. Other reviewers have eloquently mentioned plot and character, so I will only say this: if I had to go to a desert island with a limited number of books, Thor would be on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling tale of duty and love","review":"When I first read this novel, I had rented from the library because I had nothing else to read. I was expecting a silly, possibly fun read (not the author's fault, but the publishers - the cover makes it seem like a cheap horror flick.) I was suprised to find I was wrong. Thor is a exciting and rewarding story that is at times thought provoking, funny, and sad. Thor and his relationship with \\"The Pack\\" is deep and moving, as is his torn emotions when he descovers the secret of Uncle Ted. Though the werewolf subplot is a bit hokey, it also provides the novel with the right conflict for drama to flower. An undiscovered gem, right up there with the James Herbert classic, Fluke. Perhaps even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Definitely a book that is a bit different. The protagonist is a dog, but all the other characters are human. The story is mostly told from the dog's point of view.A mother and her son are living modestly, out of the way, when their Uncle Ted comes to visit. Only Thor, their loyal pack leader, as he sees himself, knows there is something strange and wrong about this man.This leads to werewolf versus German shepherd conflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dog book!","review":"This is a very good novel for anyone who has a dog as a companion or who is interested in considering a different perspective on the ordinary details of life we usually take for granted. The author obviously knows a lot about dog behavior and effectively leads us to accept that the dog, Thor, is thinking as portrayed. The story is also an interesting take on the werewolf concept, and the interactions between Thor and the werewolf in his human form are particularly interesting. This book is definitely worth more than its 99 cents Kindle price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would read again","review":"I not much for mysteries. I can't seem to wait for the story to unfold. However, I did read this book cover to cover with a minimum of flipping to the back cover. I liked that Ms Thornton did not try to solve everything at the end, but tied up loose ends through out the book. I also liked that the Heroine was willing to marry the man she loves without the a declaration of love from him, even though it hurt her. She is smart, gutsy, and charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE THAN CHARMING","review":"A good sexy love story and mystery. This is the second book I've read by Ms. Thornton. Even though I liked this one slightly less than the first, I am anxious to read more by her. Good writing style, original plot and, if you buy this book, I don't think you will be disappointed with your purchase. Try Liz Carlton (all of her books, but especially \\"A Virtuous Woman\\") and Karyn Monk (\\"The Prisoner\\") if you like Ms. Thornton's writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book lacked sizzle and substance.","review":"The story was okay...the plot was way too intense for my liking, but it was readable. I skipped over most of the blather that didn't have anything to do with the romance.There was no romantic sizzle in this book whatsoever. The love scenes were brief and absolutely no description of any kind took place.I cannot even bring myself to read another Elizabeth Thornton book. I cannot recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"no chemistry","review":"There was not chemistry between the two main characters.

As another reviewer said (and I should have listened) the authors simply leave out far too many details. Keep looking ... there are better books out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many missing details","review":"The content of this book is very disappointing. Too many details are missing. In many cases, the authors describe implementations without getting into the details of how they reached it. Because of these missing details, it is hard to understand the reasonning behind some of the trade-offs described in the book. It lacks clarity in several areas. Even with some experience in the area, I was left too many times trying to figure out what the authors meant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and overlooked","review":"With a style and physical appearance bearing more than a passing resemblance to that of Terence Trent D'Arby, Dupont is not nearly as musically gifted as TTD, but still lays down a solid set of groovy, funky R&B that has more of an \\"organic\\" feel to it than much of the black popular music of the period. Always positive and optimistic, with uplifting subject matter set against fresh, earthy beats, Dupont deserves some respect and certainly some rediscovery for this mature effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"When are you going to send me this book?","review":"I have been waiting since July 5 for you to send me this book.I'll be glad to review it if you ever send it !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Pedantic","review":"I ordered this book based on some of the reviews, but then returned it.

Don't let the cat on the cover and the publisher's description of the book fool you. This book is no cozy mystery. The main character is totally unlikable and this small town a little slice of hell. If the people of the real village of Waterville, NY, want to scare away strangers, this is the book that will do it. The author also seems to have some sort of annoying ax to grind by stating more than once that the only literate 19th century women in upstate New York were two or three gangster's molls in spite of the existence of hundreds of well-known well-educated 19th century upstate New York women including Dr. Mary Walker, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B.

She doesn't have the patience for it, though she said she wanted it. However, children don't like every toy, and I can accept that.However, one very legitimate gripe is that it only addresses writing capital letters. How to write lower case letters? Not even covered.

The video was good but it would've been better if it was more of a story. GOOD SINGLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but good enough?","review":"Okay - Too Little Too Late is a great song filled with reverb. Record companies shouldn't make singles with only 2 songs. They should have at least four. The cost of buying this isn't worth it. As of now, it's $4.99 new. If the album is what, maybe 12 dollars, that means 2 1/2 of these cost about the same amount as the album. That's only 6 tracks, when you can get (I think it's) 13 tracks on the album. \\"Get it poppin\\" is a r&b track, that sounds like it came from her first album.

Not to deminish the importance of a good narrative, goodness knows they have there time and place, but I hope this particular piece of work is used for nothing more than the 8th grade. At the undergrad or graduate level, it would be better served as a placemat for that steaming bowl of Top Ramen or as a wedge to even out that table with the short leg. On a lesser note, the title is as transparent as the acting on some reality shows. Sadly, it futily grasps at some small niche of notoriety. It sounds too much like Weigley's \\"American Way of War\\". To that I'll add, I knew Weigley. Weigley was a friend of mine (not really but it makes for a good point).

On the next attempt Grenier should at least try to join the party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant work","review":"This is an excellent scholarly work that discusses how Americans waged war against Native Americans on the frontier from 1609 until 1814. The author contends that the early Americans developed a way of war that targeted non-combatants by attacking villages and destroying crops and deliberately targeting women and children. The author does not pull any punches and takes a harsh look at the practice of paying bounties for scalps and the effect that had on the conduct of frontier warfare. He also traces the development of the rangers and discusses how they did or did not integrate with regular forces.

I found that the 5.1 mix and the stereo mix were nearly the same, as the 5.1 mix did not use the center channel at all, and barely used the surrounds & LFE.

I am very disappointed with the 5.1 audio of this DVD, both the mix and the audio quality.

The questions are very obscure and not challenging, just frustrating.The rules aren't clear as to whether players can shout out answers or commit to specific guesses. If two teams are playing, you'll need an extra non-player to read the questions since both teams get a shot at the questions.

I thought it was wonderful! The music was powerful. The parts of Werther and Charlotte were sung beautifully and passionately by both Marcelo Alvarez and Elina Garanca. The acting was perfect. All the singers were good.I was sort of surprised to see the 50s setting and costumes, but this is a timeless story, so...what does it matter? The staging with the gigantic tree was quite cleverly done, I thought. The changing colors of the leaves showed the passage of time. It was odd to have Charlotte's living space appear beneath the tree in Act III, but this is opera. By Act IV, the tree looked like a monstrous spider, and there lay Werther, bullet hole to the chest, dripping with blood. It took the entire act for him to die! With Albert lurking in the background and Charlotte mashing herself into Werther's bloody body...weird? Yes. Opera? Yes. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Hodge-Podge","review":"This book is a compendium of wonderful information on almost every aspect of raising pastured poultry. Ideas and information on feeds, breeding, housing, processing, and even the business and insurance side of poultry farming are covered. It's well worth the money for any small-scale poultry farmer. The one downside is that, since it is a collection of articles published over several years, the information is sometimes incomplete, duplicated, or slightly disorganized. Don't expect it to be an easy reference book on any topic, but if you approach it as a wealth of great ideas from experienced farmers you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helps deep cracks!","review":"I developed some severe cracks in my heels over the summer and was looking for something to help out- enter Nexcare Cracked Heel Care! It works really well. You MUST use it daily to see results, but you WILL see them. It's almost like nu-skin or something- sealing together the cracks and helping them get better. Be sure to clean your feet really well before applying the stuff (it's on a small lipgloss-like wand) and pumice them as well. After letting the Nexcare dry, put lotion and cotton socks on over your feet before going to bed. It will definitely help!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fasinating 1st person accounts of the 4th & 7th crusades.","review":"Got this at goodwill. This is an incredible account of the crusades by 2 individuals who were there. Jean De Joinville joined the 7th crusade, & Geoffroy De Villehardouin joined the 4th crusade. The accounts are very easy to read & follow. A lot of coverage in the account of the 4th crusade is about the conquest of Constantinople, who by the way had asked for help in the orginal crusade. The account of the 7th crusade goes more direct to the holy land than the 4th one did. I love it. Fantastic accounts about a bloody time in history that still plagues us to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable translation - recommended","review":"I highly recommend this translation of Joinville and Villehardouin.The translator has taken care to translate these works into lucid, contemporary language without dumbing down the writing.

The book is intact, however because of age, all the pages are yellowed and feel \\"old.\\" It is my guess that the book will not hold up as well due to age. Even more frustrating is that I was charged $8.98, and the back cover clearly states a suggested retail price of $6.95."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"It was in the shape it described and arrived on time.

The band has a great, unique sort of sound that can't really be categorized. Paul Fried really busts out some amazing basslines, and the rest of the players show their best as well. I'd reccomend this EP/DVD set to almost anyone; the music that Agent Sparks plays should please a large audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"If you're familiar with the level of acting and production value that come with soft-core porn, you'll get all that without the prurient titillation in this movie that was obviously rewritten right up to the point of stamping out the DVDs.

I've tried to like the \\"new\\" Lynyrd Skynyrd, but sorry, Jack...no can do. I'll stick to the tried and true. The original Lynyrd Skynyrd had heart and I can tell that the current band is playing the music for the money, not for the joy of it. Lynyrd Skynyrd, in essence, died on October 20, 1977.

The fabric is stiff, almost rough rather than supple. The crotch has a 2 - 2 1/2\\" inset that is unsightly and the seam in the back is folded over at the waistband, and sewn down. Poor workmanship.

While it lasted.","review":"I finally bought this computer 4 months ago for college, after sampling and returning two different compaqs. Overall, I was very happy with it. I am not a gamer, but I had few problems with it. Occasionally the feature intended to run a DVD without turning on the hard drive (very handy) would freeze up, but other than that, wonderful! Good battery life, good graphics, nice screen, handy remote, pretty good speakers, nice keyboard, held up well when transported, and not too heavy. However, 4 months after purchase, it died. The monitor turned off in the middle of operation, and it would not turn back on for longer than 30 seconds. Still under factory warranty, I sent it in to Hp, but despite numerous phonecalls, no one even got back to me to give me a time estimate for its return for over two and a half weeks. Overall, I would recommend a more reliable brand of computer. (I had ZERO problems with my last laptop, a dell, in 3 years of heavy use.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great computer","review":"I just purchased this computer and i really like it. The screen quality is excellent and the sound system is also above average for a laptop. I love the remote control feature for watching movies and dvd's. The only problem I have encountered in the week that I've had it is that sometimes it will freeze-up when I try to start a game or even when I start up the computer. I am really happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept but fragile and HP support is terrible","review":"If these machines would work consistently as promised they would be great. It's very fragile and best used as a small desk top.Worse, if you have to deal with HP support, you will end up with a poor VOIP connection to India and may have support denied because HP tracks it's warranties based on when they sent the machine to the retailer, not when you bought it.Even then HP support is, in a word, terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophomore Album Jinx?? NO WAY!","review":"This is the one CD I was waiting for at the store when they put it on the shelf. Jay starts out like gangbusters with the hit \\"Ven A Mi\\". The music store only had the cassette version and I literally wore out two cassettes before the CD came in. \\"Corazon\\", \\"Amar Asi\\" and \\"Si Te Portas Mal\\" are the best tracks on the cd.

One of the few shows I actually stopped and got in front of a TV when it was to be on.geez, Nathan Fillion and at least 3/4 of the cast pick good roles.

If you're here considering buying it, it's probably because you're a Joss Whedon fan, and noticed that it stars Mal and Fred from Firefly and Angel. Don't be fooled: this is NOTHING like those shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost, But Not Quite....","review":"I purchased this from Amazon about a month ago. Due to a neuromuscular disease I am mostly wheelchair bound and was concerned about muscular deterioration in my arms and legs. This review is mostly positive because the Oxycycle has worked flawlessly for me and I use it for exercising my arms or legs most days. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is it's lack of resistence when you \\"bicycle\\" with it. You have to do it continuously for hours to make it into an aerobic workout. Another small aggravation - the motor automatically \\"times out\\" after 15 minutes requiring you to turn it off then on to restart the internal timer. So far I've found no way to alter this. But for \\"range of motion\\" exercises it is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic?","review":"While a very entertaining read, I find a lack of solid \\"Here is what you should do for this\\" advice turns this book into more of a fact based novel than a book on how to actually \\"get the most out of life with attention deficit disorder.\\"I also struggle with a bit of a credibility issue when it comes to these authors. They claim to both have ADD themselves yet they both somehow managed to make it all the way through medical school and become very successful yet they don't write about how they did that. I sure would love to see a book written by these two that details exactly what strategies they used to get through medical school, how difficult it actually was, what were the difficult parts and what were the easy parts, the times they thought they weren't going to make it, and then some.

Within the first chapter, I already felt a lifetime of weight lifted away. It's uncanny how Dr. Hallowell is able to explain the intricacies of ADHD in a manner that sounds as if he's actually describing my life from birth to age 34.

After having two different professionals ask me if I've ever considered ADD as a possible condition I figured it was time to learn some more.

The author's...seemed to go and on before getting to the point. They also recommend a lot of tests which I am sure is very expensive. They also want you to see a number of people to help diagnose you. They seem to be into taking a lot of supplements. Some I agree but for the most part not. The part about piles is called not add but hoarders disorder. People who have ADD should not write books. The book was very general. I got very little out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better books out there","review":"As a fellow psychiatrist that specializes in adult ADHD I am indebted to the authors for putting ADHD on the map with their first book Driven to Distraction. I was expecting more of the same but came away very disappointed. The authors describe theories of causation and nutritional remedies that have either no evidence to support them or have been debunked a long time ago. This disorder is difficult enough to suffer with and treat to take such a reckless approach. Even worse is the writers are held (rightfully so) in such high regard by people with ADHD. I would recommendAttention Deficit Disorder: The Unfocused Mind in Children and Adults (Yale University Press Health & Wellness)by Thomas Brown, PhD. It is a much more scientifically accurate book written for ordinary people that makes understanding this disorder much easier than any other book I've found."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for parents that think their kids do not live up to their potential","review":"This book is an eye oppener for not only those affected by ADD, but also to every parent and sibling.It gives very practical advice on how to live with ADD and how to counter ADD's impact on someones life.Especially, as a parent, I appreciated the chapter dealing with adjustment to college life. If I only had that book three years ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book really made me feel normal again","review":"I loved this book of course I didn't read it all in one sitting but like you I have ADD. It validated my feeling about myself and a diagnosis of ADD. I gave it to my mom and she looks at me and goes \\"ok, that explains so much.\\" I really feel like she understands how my brain works. This book is for you and anyone who loves you and anyone you want to understand you. I'm giving it to my sister who is very opposite of me type A, my way is the best way, now she will try understand how I work.

I bought the CD since I knew I would start the book and never finish it. The information I learned comforted me since so many traits that I had spent years making myself wrong for, can now be linked to ADD. I was able to cut myself some slack. I was also able to see how many things I had successfully overcame throughout my life, and how determined I was to succeed in spite of what I thought were self defeating charecteristics.I have been working with children with ADD and ADHD for over 10 years and was thrilled to find a tool that I can use with anyone. I love the way the author describes ADD to children and I will use that same explanation myself.

I know that the unicorns were really horses and all, but wouldn't it be great if, just for once, we could all just believe and not have to pick everything apart until no one believes it? This book is truly beautiful, to say the least, and I think that it really makes you WANT to believe in unicorns. in a world like ours, sometimes life becomes more of a dull tragedy than something to be thankful for.

I am of the older generation who believe in Unicorns. Each morning as I awake I see a large painting of a beautiful Unicorn. I even moved to the horse capital of Florida knowing one day a beautiful Unicorn would step out from behind a tree to nod hello. The pictures in this book are so vivid you can smell the flowers, hear the sound of the sea, the cool of the snow or the rustle of the trees.

This book is full of them. I have met average man-on-the-street Christians that do a better job of supporting the unsupportable than Dr. Kennedy does.His arguments consist primarily of unsubstantiated assertions, the use of analogy as fact, wishful thinking, arguments from authority, and the god of the gaps. One look at his science know-how in which he claims that solid materials (i.e. stones) are able to record all the conversations held in their presence should give you a clue as to the intellect at work here.The only purpose this book should serve in a Christian educational setting is to help boost the shorter kids up in their seats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogical, irrational, poorly argued","review":"I am not a Christian, but I read this book at a time when I was very openmindedly searching for answers.

If you already \\"believe\\", then you'll probably love this book and give it five stars. If you approach it with relatively little bias, an open mind, but with a strong capacity for critical thought, then you will find yourself wanting to put it through a paper shredder.

Oh, yes it does cover dive sites for each area, but not nearly as many sites as other dive books on these locations. The book is full of beautiful photographs, and some good travel tips. The section on diving Cenotes is informative and covers 10 of the most popular sites. My biggest complaint is the print and design format of the book. On most pages light colored print copy is printed on top of soft pastel colored boxes and half moon designs. This makes the print differcult to see and I found myself straining to read it. The waterproof fish and invertebrates indentification card that comes with the book is useless. The pictures on the card are not sharp and hard to see.

This DVD, on the other hand, seems to be a single live performance - the last show of the tour, judging from some of what McLachlan says to the audience. Sarah and her band are in top form, as they cover practically the full range of her work. I can't think of a single song you'd want to hear in a Sarah McLachlan live concert that isn't on this disc. And that's the real selling point for this DVD. The DVD version of Mirrorball features some 23 songs - 9 more than the original CD!

That doesn't mean that the performances are fake. And as for the editing, maybe a few fades would have been nice, but overall I find it very enjoyable (love the close-ups of Sarah!) Of my current collection, this is the DVD I watch most often, and I haven't even been a fan of hers for very long.As for the picture quality, it is fantastic. I can't rate the 5.1 channel mix because I do not yet have a Dolby Digital receiver, but I am very happy with the quality of the stereo mix, and I think that's all you need for a music program anyway.

As a result the synching problem bothered me so much that I had to back off 10 feet from the monitor so it was less noticable.

La calidad es muy buena, pero desgraciadamente no representa ni por mucho lo que es un \\"verdadero concierto\\" de Sarah y su banda en vivo. No hay contacto visual, ni se siente la energía de la gente durante la interpretación del mismo. Creo que para apreciar su música está muy bien, puesto que deja escucharla. Los paneos son muy suaves, pero no se ve la potencia de interpretación, puesto que ni gota de sudor aparece en las caras de los músicos ni de la misma Sarah. Es por todo esto que le doy 4 estrellas.

Having owned all of her previous works on CD, I was most anxious to have a live performance with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound.The video itself is adequate and the choice of songs is excellent. Unfortunately the sound quality is the worst I have heard on a DVD. It almost seems as if the music is an overdub on top of the video. I tried changing processor settings to make up for the poor quality, but never could come close to making it work.

Unfortunately, the DVD is beyond horrible, mostly because of the editing. Every few seconds they change the camera angle, with never a fade-in or fade-out. After the first few songs it literally became hard to watch. Many of the songs seem lip-synched, though it could just be a poor match-up of the video and audio portions. Even the interview with Sarah was tough to watch, with the camera person zooming in and out and bouncing around.

In fact, it's quite lazy. It doesn't really try to justify the contradictions, it merely says \\"you know in your heart that God is a nice guy and you see that there are nasty things attributed to God so just go with your heart on this one\\".As far as quality of writing goes it's a total mess.

Several things left me saying \\"huh?\\", not the least of which were his numerous references to \\"other\\" information he had, but preferred not to share in this tome (saving it for another book, perhaps?). These pieces of information were related to his experience \\"there\\" and suspicious activity \\"here\\" after he was returned home.For being gone,and usually conscious, for a period of 10 days on another planet (and/or in another time)the book is very short, only 193 pages.This book may be superb for the neophyte, but those with a lot of UFO reading under their belt may very well be left feeling as I did: \\"Huh?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Alec is honest, and this can be easily discerned immediately. This is the first book he's ever written, but it is pleasure to read. Why? It's not about \\"style\\". It's about honesty. He has succeeded in applying the simple principle of honesty in relating the FACTS about what he experienced and his own reaction to it. And what AMAZING facts. I will not go into any details, I will simply say this: I am so glad I found this book, and read it, because I now know things I never knew before, about a subject which our \\"leaders\\" don't want us to know anything about. This is perhaps among the top 2 of, say the 25 books I have read in this field. Thanks Alec, you lucky son of a gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a change","review":"Well I've read a few of these types of books, this one is different mostly because the author does not make to many judgement calls, does not pretend to be an expert or know what this is all about, I like that about the book. If the terrestrial after events really did happen, and I'm sure it would not take to much work by someone to prove that part one way or the other, if they did happen, it makes for great back up to an amazing event. Makes you wonder if the author knows more than he's telling! I think the last part about future technology is an eye opener and not a bad guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Abduction (Iho hum)","review":"Since abduction books became so common, they almost deserve a genre of their own. Newald's book, while it seems to fit squarely within the tradition, is also one of the most ambitious, and the most disappointing, I have read.Coevolution relates events purported to have occurred in 1989, in New Zealand. While driving to Auckland from Rotorua, Newald is abducted by beings from a planet which once orbited earth. (Ever hear of Heaven or Nirvana? Yep, same place.) Firesign Theater used to have a routine satirizing revivalist-ET-New Age fervor, called Everything You Thought You Knew Is Wrong. And that's as good a description of Newald's bag as you'll find: those who like that sort of thing will dig it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what the doctor ordered","review":"Headache and Your Child is \\"just what the doctor ordered.\\"In searching for information on abdominal migraines I kept coming across the name, Dr. Seymour Diamond. This book has helped us understand migraines and their causes as well as inform us about current treatment options that are available, everything from medication to biofeedback. Through the use of case studies, Dr. Diamond discusses up-to-date diagnostic tools and treatments. He reassures parents that while there are sometimes very serious underlying conditions, not every headache is an indicator of a brain tumor.I highly recommend this as a \\"must have\\" book for the parent of any child that suffers from headaches, not just migraines. It can help in identifying the type of headache your child experiences and offer suggestions of appropriate treatments. If your child has already been diagnosed with migraines, it is still a wonderful reference book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Isn't Worth More Than One Cent","review":"Yep, that's what the previous seller foisted the book on me for. And I wouldn't pay more. Only two poems I found pleasure in: 1) \\"The Butterfly Jar,\\" page 1; 2) \\"Hi, How are You Today?\\" page 23.I suppose many of the poems that rhyme or not are an attempt at juvenile humor--or humor for juveniles. I consider the book a terrible knock-off of poems by Shel Silverstein and Jack Prelutsky.So, I'm going to foist the same book--for one cent--onto other people who, like most former reviewers, like this stuff.The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better known as the Amalgamation EP","review":"This features RSVP, Ich Bin Ein Auslander and Familius Horribilis from the Dos Dedos album (although the last two have and extra bar put into the song for some reason). There are remixes of Ich Bin and RSVP that also appear on the Two Fingers remix album. Ich Bin has been very radically reworked (Fun-Da-Mental added their own vocals), while Rsvp really only has some extra production done to it. Intense is an 11-minute fairly sinister sounding song (and appears edited by about 40 seconds on the Two Fingers bonus disc). C.P.I.#2 is another creepy sounding instrumental, but is made up almost enitrely of parts from Ich Bin, and sounds completely different from it (it appears about 10 seconds shorter on the bonus disc version of Two Fingers, and is titled C.P.#2). If you can't find the bonus disc, get this for the instrumentals. They're very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get enough?","review":"If you have listend to \\"Dos Dedos...\\" and want to hear more, there are a couple of cool remixes to be found here.

There's a definite twist as you discover who the real murderer is and the only bad feelings I have toward this book is that there isn't a sequal! If you ask me, there's definitely room left for a sequal. But that's what I always say. Anyway . . . if you like mystery, suspense, and romance this is definitely a book you want to check out along with the rest of the Dark Secrets series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I lost my copy of No Time To Die so I was extremely happy to find this one only.

It prints photographs well, but they came out dark.I received it free from Apple with purchase of an iBook.I believe the reason HP 3180 is free is because it runs through ink at an alarming rate, one will end up paying for the 'free' printer in above average ink cartridge purchases.When trying to set the print quality to 'Gray Tone' in the 'Color Sync' setting, the blacks print so dark that they are visibly wet when they come out of the printer. I was unable through many different tries to get this printer to slow down on the ink output.I also had trouble with the printer 'communicating' forever with the computer. Finally, I had to unplug the printer to start over. This happened too many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: you will need to edit the registry if you use MS Office 2007 and XP/Vista","review":"MS Office 2007 will not work properly in XP or Vista if this printer is selected as the default unless the registry is edited. Contact HP for help with this. HP says the problem was created by an Office 97 update. They were slow to acknowledge this problem, but they did eventually develop a fix, though I was unable to find it on the HP Website and had to contact Tech Support to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Mine's just stopped working, after 13 months of fairly light usage. It seems mechanically unreliable. I've had problems with it for some time - after I replaced the first printer cartridges, it began occasionally leaving lines with too little ink across the paper, requiring me to re-print documents. Now, after I just replaced another cartridge, the cartridge carrier is jammed, and the printer is completely unable to function. I didn't expect much out of this device, but I was hoping for something that would remain minimally usable for more than a month after the warranty ran out. Doesn't seem too much to ask.A lesser problem I've had for a longer time is with the scan software. It's slow, and doesn't have a particularly intuitive user interface. It's automatic selection of a page area to scan is pretty terrible, it's difficult to save scan preferences, and there's no way to scan a multipage document as one file."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great print quality, but crazy expensive ink","review":"The print quality is excellent; we have even printed pictures on picture paper that we felt were worthy of framing. However, the ink goes fast. Actually, make that SUPER fast. With ink costing as much as $15/200 pages, the cost of the printer increases by $100/year if you print a moderate amount of documents. Think about it, if I print a 40 page document for work, it costs me $3 bucks to print! That's crazy. This printer is NOT recommended for moderate to heavy users. It is recommended for occasional printers and picture lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"tiny cartridge size (5ml) means this is not for people who print much at all","review":"The cartridges for this printer are only 5mls - this is much smaller than many inkjet printers. This means that you will have to buy 5 cartridges while a person with a 25ml cartridge in their printer would only buy one. Although the cartridges are not expensive, 5 of them is definitely expensive! Unless you are a very light user of printers i would strongly recommend another printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be prepared to change ink cartridges a lot","review":"It's a nice little device that works great for scanning but forget about printing many pages, since the ink cartridge will not last past 50 pages.I am now refilling my ink cartridge for color prints and getting a black and white non-HP laser printer that will actually last more than 50 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maddening software!","review":"Besides not allowing me to choose the inkjet paper option when printing [!!!], I also cannot choose Custom, for printing non-standard sizes. I tried very time-consuming headache-producing work-arounds which sort of got the job done, when suddenly today it no longer centers the image as shown in the preview box. It's a case of What You See Is What You DON\\"T Get.My list of complaints goes on and on AND ON, but they all center around software that is beyond quirky and unfathomable.What a waste of money. And there are no updates or fixes for this software on HP's website either!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it but does not work with Windows 7","review":"Love this printer, bought a few back when I used only Windows XP and 2000, but when I upgraded to Windows 7 and tried to install in on new pc it froze my new pc and got a blue screen, had to do some fancy footwork to get pc running again. My fault, I should have known better. Still, I love it when used with XP or earlier and that's why I give it 5 stars (it was not made to be compatible with Windows 7). Also, wish HP would lower the price on their inks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this printer","review":"Of all the great features, only scanning actually works. Trying to print is always a hassle. With new toner cartriges, I have to clean the printheads 3 times first. If the cartriges are 1/2 used, I can't get anything to print. I dont know if there is an iniate problem with the printheads, toner, or what!! But I have NEVER had a printer give me such a headache!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST printer I have ever owned!","review":"This is by far, the worst printer I have ever owned!The ink is overpriced and fades. I use premium photo paper and the ink still fades in a very short amount of time!The print quality is the worse I have ever seen! The pictures have visibly \\"lines\\" going through them and this remains the same after you clean the print heads as well.The paper feeder NEVER works!! I have to hand feed each sheet, then it prints half the picture before the Paper even reaches the print heads!Its a waste of money and time! Im going to spend the money on a brother printer and throw this one in the garbage asap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Trouble","review":"Trying to use this printer on a Mac with anything but standard ink jet paper is a nightmare. It gets confused and prints blank pages, or sucks up the sheet halfway and won't let it go. Never had any kind of problems like this using Canon or Epson printers. Definitely stay away from HP products if you are trying to print on label paper or thin/non-standard papers with a Mac!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Owned for 3 years, big mistake since day 1","review":"I debated whether or not to even write this review, as printer models change as fast as mobile phone models and nobody would probably even buy this one anymore. However, this printer has clearly made me regret purchasing it. As other reviewers have pointed out, just about every feature is problematic. The software take up an amazing amount of space, the controls are unituitive, it grabs multiple sheets of paper when printing causing jams and even when you remove the jam it still says that it exists; it does not always scan when you hit the scan buttom; and it absolutely loves to regularly print \\"test pages.\\" Definitely suggest avoiding this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great When it Worked","review":"I've only had my printer for maybe 3 years...everything has worked wonderfully with the exception of the printing function (the most important!). It never really handled photo paper very well and now it just won't print! It keeps saying that there is a paper jam and that the ink cradle can't move. Super annoying...I would not recommend this printer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you like to buy ink?","review":"Do you like to buy expensive ink all the time? Do you enjoy extremely water-soluble inks (even a slight amount of humidity or perspiration on your hands will easily cause your printed work to smudge away)?This product is deceptive. On the outside it looks nice, it is loaded with useful features such as a high-quality scanner and nice looking prints at an affordable every day low price. However do not be deceived. This product is inferior to previous HP printers I have owned, it seems they are abandoning their commitment to high quality for high profits through the use of cheap water-soluble inks (e.g. rubs off extremely easily) provided to the consumer at low amounts and high prices.You were warned from one unhappy HP customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"I only had this a few months and it stopped working. The first thing I noticed was that no matter what, I could only put in one piece of paper at a time or it would grab all the paper at once. Now recently it has started printing only one page at a time then saying the paper is jammed or the roller is stuck. I would have to turn the printer off then back on, AND restart my computer for it to print one page and then go through the whole nonsense again. We could find nothing causing a jam or keeping the roller from moving. What a complete waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good prints when it wants, many quirks, guzzles ink: I hate it","review":"I'll simply add my second to many of the negative comments here. Bought it because I trust HP, I liked the size and appearance, I liked the price. And for the first few days I like what it did with both photos and documents.For office use, it's driving us nuts. Constantly feeding it ink, throwing out prints that it decides to miscolor (seems fond of pink smears). A couple of odd usability quirks, such as -- when it runs out of paper, and you feed it more, how do you get it to go again? Hit the cancel button (!?!?).Sucks. Can't wait to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy HP. HP-small ink cartridge constantly needs refilling.","review":"This printer works ok, but it runs out of ink too quickly.It uses the HP 92 cartridge, which HP builds at half capacity.....it could hold twice as much ink except HP builds it soonly half the cartridge holds ink. The other half is empty...full of hot air.And to make matters worse, my cartridge store says HPis now building more and more printers with smallink cartridges, so they can sell twice as many cartridges.This is a total waste. This means HP is making me buynew cartridges twice as often. More trips in my car.Or more trips for the FedEx guy.Find a printer that prints many more pages per cartridge.Spread the word, don't buy HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"I made the stupid mistake of replacing my first one with a second one of the same make, namely this model.Within a year I have gone through two of these printers and they are simply the worst printer out there.I have a friend with the same printer with the same problems.If you're in the market for a printer, avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"fair at best","review":"I got this printer recently for very little when I bought a Mac. That is about what it is worth. It gobbles ink like no tomorrow. The paper jams frequently. You have replace all the colored ink even if only one color is depleted. And it insists on printing a test page every time I change a cartridge, using up even more of its limited ink supply. It copies and prints decently, but I find the scanning software unweildly. I long for my old Epson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst printer I've ever used","review":"This is probably one of the most difficult units I've ever worked with and I worked in the computer industry for years.

Plus anytime you change a cartridge, it prints a test page that uses up a lot of ink. It's loud, and would wake my roommate up in the mornings.The best thing about this printer is that it can provide great stress relief. At the end of the second year, I took it outside and beat it to a pulp with a hammer, along with a friend of mine who had problems with her printer, also an HP.Bottom line. HP printers are NOT worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this printer","review":"I bought this printer to replace my HP PSC 2175 that broke. Before that I had an HP 882C. My level of satisfaction has gone down with both purchases.I bought the C3180 and took it home, hooked it up, and it won't print magenta... strange. I took it back and exchanged for another one. The second one won't print magenta. Very strange. I tried making 10 copies of a red book to see if it just needed to warm up... I got 10 copies of a yellow book. Very frustrating? Then I checked the ink level with the toolbox and the HP software reported that I had used 20% of the color cartridge... with 10 full color pages? That is absurd. Even if I get this fixed, it will cost me a fortune to keep this printer full of ink. It's going back to the store and I'm coming home with a different brand. I used to be a loyal HP customer, but the quality of the printers seems to have degraded quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Printer!","review":"This is a great printer for the bucks.

Intially the printer worked, but within a couple of weeks it would print strange characters or give error messages while printing, messing up the document.

Sometimes the PC will install another copy so there may be 3 copies of your printer and you got to pick which one is in the \\"ready\\" mode.When I go through the Solution Center to try to get it to scan I get a prompt saying to check the connections........which are fine. Have been fighting with it for 80 minutes trying to get it to scan. I think its time to bring it in the alley for a little game comedian Gallahgher called SLEDGE-A-MATIC.Time to junk it and buy something that will actually work.Have had no compliants for printing out documents or address labels, nor has it used ink like others have posted.

My 5-year-old $100 flatbed did a better job and had more features. The ink cartridges last for 70-90 pages.

I'm talking about documents, not photos or anything requiring loads of ink. Then I started getting a message that the ink cartridges were empty even if I just replaced them.

Starting with the most popular chords used in music, and then moving to other chords in open in barre position. Interspersed here and there are some tips on playing guitar. Not much more than that, and not very well organized.I would consider this most beneficial as a companion to lessons or to a complete method found elsewhere. There just isn't much to it. It's 80 pages, but each page generally contains two 4-chord progressions. I also found that several of the chords listed are inaccurate -- or at least inconsistent with several other sources I checked them against.I've used about 6 different books and software on learning the guitar, and I found this to be the least helpful.

I have learned so much and now enjoy having my guitar and so do my friends...they get to listen to me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners.","review":"This book is mostly page after page of chords and chord progression. If you've never played before, all it will teach you is finger positions for different chords. There are no songs to practice on, and it moves quickly from easy basic chords to complicated explanations and musical techniques that won't help beginners at all.

I would have returned it, but there was a shipping fee to get the tiny container (4.6\\" x 2.8\\" x 1.3\\") and would have been another to return it. I used it to wipe my computer screen & it smeared. I had to redo it, wiping it with a dry cloth afterwards to prevent this. I didn't realize that alcohol-free products just spread the dirt around. This is mostly my fault for not paying attention to dimensions, but the picture is deceiving; it makes the product appear much larger.

The reader meets old friends like Rincewind, Cohen or the Council of Wizards, and has (like in all of the other novels by Pratchett) the opportunity to laugh and think at the same time throughout the book.Definately a book to buy for any Pratchett- fan or anybody who likes humorous fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"the first TP to disappoint me","review":"They can't all be great, I guess. Interesting Times let me down. It's disjointed and repetitive, thus boring. Where other TPs contain several story threads each entertaining in its own right, Interesting Times seems to have a few storylines whose relationship is muddled. The vividness of the other novels (distinctive names, smell and texture of The River Ankh, etc.) is lacking in this one. Interesting Times is just a political hammer over the reader's head. Not enough creativity here.Interesting Times is not up to the standards of Wyrd Sisters, Lords and Ladies, Equal Rites, Feet of Clay, and others."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Pratchett","review":"I've read six Discworld novels, and this was my least favorite.

Rincewind","review":"Revolution is afoot in Hunghung, capital of the Counterweight Continent. However, no plan ever survives contact with Rincewind, the Disc's most inept wizard.

One of the funnier Discworld books I've read--it had me laughing out loud several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong with discworld","review":"This is just the kindle version and a re-read anyway. The story is smack dab in the middle of the pack which means that a lot of other discworld fans hate it while others love it. There is never much consensus on these things. My only quibble was that I bought this and The Fifth Elephant and the footnotes on the Fifth Elephant were much easier to access on the kindle than Interesting times. I don't know why there is a difference but I found that you had to press the down arrow after scrolling over to the asterisk to bring it up. If you're at all familiar with Pratchett you should know that the footnotes are some of the best parts and its distressing to be unable to read them as they come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing his touch","review":"I have enjoyed several of Terry Pratchett's discworld novels, most notably \\"Guards!Guards!\\" and \\"Small Gods\\", but I have found that his most recent books, particularly \\"Interesting Times\\", are not in the same class. Rather than being humourous, his latest novels, including this one, seem to be plain ridiculous instead. I hope Pratchett will raise the standard of humour in his novels in the future, as I'm still a fan. However, I would like to say, at the risk of sounding arrogant or presumptuous, that Pratchett needs to recognize that fantasy of this nature is based upon it's humour, not on how wacky it is, particularly when the line of the plot is so thin. I advise any readers thinking of picking up a Pratchett novel to stick with the older ones"},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting times (discworld)","review":"I really love this author's work, but this copy was not his complete novel, but theatrical script version.

I like Rincewind. We get to see the High Energy Magic geeks at U.U. in action again. Even better. Twoflower comes back...I liked Twoflower...but this isn't good.

I like Rincewind's talent for languages; given that Chinese is a tonal language, it takes him three or four tries to correctly pronounce each new word he learns. Includes Cohen the Barbarian, and the various attempts to teach the Silver Horde to be civilized are very funny, if not exactly the stuff of serious fiction. I read this out of order, and was not familiar with Twoflower from previous books so some of the characters are not familiar; if you're going to read it, it would help to have read at least The Light Fantastic first (but I just can't recommend that book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Time, rather!","review":"Interesting, and strange!, times indeed.

I have made mix cds, and everytime without fail when Magnolia is playing, people wil ask who the artist is. They will ask to hear Magnolia played over again (and again and again!). I gladly play over as many times as I am asked to. I wore out at least a half dozen copies of this album (which was by then out of print in the 1980's) I looked for YEARS to find a replacement copy, and was really glad to find it finally issued on CD. I would have given this CD 5 stars, but it only got 4 because it was a rather short CD. All of the songs are memorable and rock!

I've never found his subsequent offerings to be as compelling -- too bad he didn't stick with the MXR Phase 90, wah-wah, Marshall set-up that this recording showcases, as well as the whack rhythm changes . Check out the grinding tone of the main guitar track on \\"Makes No Difference\\", especially at the end of the tune. The other showcase track is \\"Feelin' Right,\\" especially the funky bridge in the middle. His songwriting was a great foil for Mars Cowlings phenomenal, archetype P-Bass style. The cover songs were a distraction for me, as they seemed to confine Pat's real style. And that's the only reason I rate this one with 4/5 stars.The CD version of \\"Pat Travers\\" could have been US$50 and I still would have bought it.

I love it. There are verbs in here I did not know existed! The print is clear and the style easy to read. It's a great resource book. I did not see it available in hard cover or spiral. I find those kinds of bindings last longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comics can be fun in a galaxy far, far away!","review":"Stan Lee has done it again! Marvel Comics takes a classic tale (Star Wars, Episode VI - Return of the Jedi) and brings it to life in this comic version of the blockbuster movie.Here's a description of RETURN OF THE JEDI, in case you've been living in a hole and didn't see the 1983 movie:It was a dark time for the rebel alliance...Han Solo, frozen in carbonite, had been delivered into the hands of the vile gangster Jabba the Hutt. Determined to rescue him, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Lando Calrissian launched a hazardous mission against Jabba's Tatooine stronghold.The Rebel commanders gathered all the warships of the Rebel fleet into a single giant armada. And Darth Vader and the Emperor, who had ordered construction to begin on a new and even more powerful Death Star, were making plans to crush the Rebel Alliance once and for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"Not to be mistaken for an introduction to philosophy, this little book is instead an entertaining primer on how to take a philosophical approach to life. Alain de Botton takes six human experiences or conditions (unpopularity, poverty, frustration, inadequacy, brokenheartedness and despair) and examines each from the point of view of a different philosopher (Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche). His writing is engaging and witty (\\"Few philosophers have thought highly of feeling wretched. A wise life has traditionally been associated with an attempt to reduce suffering.... Then again, pointed out Friedrich Nietzsche, the majority of philosophers have always been 'cabbage heads'\\"), yet de Botton never \\"dumbs down\\" the subject matter. THE CONSOLATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY is a light enough read for the subway, but substantial enough to provoke thought. Highly recommended; not for neophytes only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professors of Philosophy might just be wrong!","review":"What I love about this book is just how mad it seems to make philosophy professors. There they go jumping up and down saying - it's trivial, it's not philosophy, listen to me, buy my books instead etc (for the latest example of this check out Andrew Carpenter's review below). And yet, speaking as someone who did FOUR years of philosophy at college/PhD level, I can say that De Botton's book is a triumph, capturing the essence of what philosophy is about, detailing it in a human way, and what is more, writing like a dream. Let's not quibble about whether this book tells you everything you ever wanted to know about philosophy; of course it doesn't, but it's a wonderful portrait of a few great philosophers and why they matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audience?","review":"If you recognize that the title of this book is taken from Boethius then the book is not for you. I can't remember where I heard about this book (NPR I think). I got on Amazon and ordered it without thinking twice. I was mislead.This is not a book for people with any significant background in philosophy. It is clearly a self help book first and foremost. It belongs next to Chicken Soup for ______, not the original Consolations of Philosophy.If you are looking for self help wrapped in a pop introduction to an interesting group of philosophers this is the book for you. If you are looking for a philosophy book then I've got to agree with the reviewer who commented \\"no clothes on this emperor.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was full of good advice for many of life's common problems as given by a selection of great philosophers made easy to grasp by Alain. Some of it is funny. The book is easy ro read and can be read in less than a week. Some memorable advice presented is that pain in life is useful and should be use as a stimulus for accomplishments instead of being disregarded. Be ready for any disconfort since anything bad is possible. We should examine common held beliefs for their validity and not take something as true just because many people believe in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to six philosophers","review":"A good introduction to a number of philosophers (Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche) but definitely one for those just delving into philosophy for the first time.Having read a lot of Socrates, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche I did find myself occasionally drifting. After all, there are only so many times you can read about the fate of Socrates' and definitely a finite amount of times you can read Schopenhauer without wanting to commit suicide.However, de Botton is quite passionate about the philosophy of Montaigne and this shines through in a great, lengthy chapter on the consolations of inadequacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and Inspiring","review":"Alain De Botton's book \\"The Consolation of Philosophy\\" is excellent. It is easy to read because of De Botton's lucid style, droll sense of humor and useful illustrations. But his gifts as a writer should not be underestimated. He takes the great philosophers, who are often difficult to understand, and brings them to life. For example, his chapter on frustration and the philosopher Seneca is brilliant. What's more, De Botton's work is not only edifying; it is humanizing. So, the book is inspiring as well as informative. De Botton's work is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"One of the BEST books I have read. Your a great author Mr. Botton! I also really enjoyed Status Anxiety and How Proust Can Change Your Life. These three books are part of my PERMANENT library to be reread again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Living Thought Philosophy","review":"Better living thought, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Montaigne, Socrates, Epicurus, and Seneca. Alain de Botton accounts of six great philosophers, and what they bring to an individual in modern times. Good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy for everyone","review":"The companion piece to the British television series is a joy. The author knows a great deal of pleasure in explaining philosophy with delightful biographies of each philosopher. And each section has sage advice on differing aspects of life. His enthusiam for Nietzsche may put some people off, but then we often confuse the impact of a philospher with his actual writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"De Botton is a terrifc, fun writer, to my mind. Serious topics, intelligent and illuminating, but still the sense that here is a writer and thinker unafraid to speak simply."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overall good read","review":"I would recommend that you read Consolations of Philosophy on the train/bus or anywhere you might catch a bit of quiet.The book is slim and extremely well written - the author has taken great care to ensure that the main points of each view are thoughtfully highlight to the reader in understandable and concise prose. Unlike other works on \\"ground-breaking\\" philosophy you will not have to reference pages 110 to 300 to understand a point made in page 411 or plough through 10 pages of dialectics to outline a point of view. An understated good read, highly recommended for the fainthearted and the frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but not overpowering","review":"This work is not as original or as interesting as his first. But it does contain the combination of entertaining and insightful personal anecdote with philosophical reflection. DeBotton manages to provide a certain depth and simplicity combined. It is not clear to me that the kind of ' consolations' he gives in this work will have great and lasting effect, but it seems to me momentary relief may be provided . It is after all at times consoling to know that those greater and more important and more profound than us have suffered in much the same ways that we do."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree...","review":"...with the former review. I saw the book displayed in a bookstore and checked it out at the university library where I work. The illustrations act as fillers and quite frankly the book is aimed at a very basic overview of philosophical thought. Each chapter reads like the pretentious term-paper of a bright university/high school student. This would be adequate for the \\"Young Adult\\" or \\"Juvenile\\" section of the book store. If you are a habitual reader you might be disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I found this book very dull to read. This book is filled with stories about different philosophers under a number of general topics. Consolations for unpopularity, not having enough money, frustration, inadequacy, a broken heart, and difficulties are all explored.The problem that I found with this book is that De Botton approaches each of these topics in an extremely cursory manner. I got the impression that De Botton was simply telling stories and felt disappointed that a more critical approach wasn't taken to each of these topics.If you're looking for a surface level exploration of some popular topics and want to be entertained by some stories about philosophers this may be a good book for you-- the book is full of illustrations and does contain some entertaining stories. However, if you're looking for a more critical text, that considers multiple viewpoints, and doesn't have the fluff of a popular book I'd recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable and very profound","review":"This is a brilliant piece of writing and thinking. Within the first 10 pages I knew that I was to embark on a wonderful journey of common sense and philosophy with De Botton. The author has his finger on the pulse of modern humanity. He understands the kind of questions we secretly ponder in the backs of our minds, and presents intelligent responses to them. This is just a wonderful book. Trust me: read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling philosophy that really is about wisdom","review":"The author goes back to the beginning and approaches philosophy as the search for the answer to the question: \\"How shall I live? How find happiness?I found the depiction of the Epicureans especially to be welcome news."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to the world of philosophy","review":"This is a great book for anyone who seeks an easy-going well-written introduction into the world of western philosophy. In six essays de Botton, chronologically spans Socrates to Nietzsche. I expected an academic type book with academic speak but it is simply and clearly written. Its audience is the general public who may or may not have had any exposure to philosophy. The best part about the essays are their unconventional nature. Interspersed in all of them are photos, personal anecdotes, and stories that support the philosophy of the subject. Anyone interesting in human nature, our motivations, our thoughts should buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Starting Point","review":"If anyone is contemplating delving into the daunting world of Philosophy for the first time, I suggest that you start by reading \`The Consolations Of Philosophy'.Similarly, if you looking for a way to enhance the happiness in your life, then I suggest that you start by reading \`The Consolations Of Philosophy'.De Botton approaches the subject in a straight forward and decisive manner and he leaves you wanting to grow a great big beard in respect and honour to all the great philosophers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read of Practicality of Philosophy","review":"Most entertaining read of taking philosophy to the lives of people. Each word and quote is well selected in a dense, tight-knit but easy flowing manner, illustrated with delightful snipits of all kinds of topics being discussed, from moles to mountain climbing to furniture to art.The intent is to provide advise from five great thinkers (Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer and Montaigne) on five common tensions: unpopularity, not having enough money, frustration, inadequacy, a broken heart and difficulties.Interesting that the Christian Bible addresses these issues and more, and even addresses several of the philosophies addressed in this work (see 1 Corinthians 1:17;3:22,23; 4:3-5; 6:12; 7:3-5;and Proverbs 1.Fascinating read for those searching for guidance, but this reviewer will trust more reliable and experienced source in the revelation of the One True God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"Anyone with a passing knowledge of philosophy will find de Botton's pick'n'mix style superficial in the extreme. Wild exagerations, lazy generalizations, and improbable connections are offered up like solemn pronouncements from on high. The New York Times wrote a damming review of this book, and I can see why. De Botton thinks he is cleverer than his audience and lets us know on every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy according to Alain De Botton!","review":"Alain De Botton has proven again and again that he is a keen observant and a genius. Having read On Love and How Proust Can Change Your Life, I was curious about Botton's views on Western Philosophy. His views are both amusing and intelligent. He introduced the of work Nietzsche and Seneca (my favorite philosopher) in a great way. The chapters and illustrations are amusing and intense at the same time. I know of people who have absolutely no knowledge on philosophy and this book could teach the basics of this interesting subject. The great thing is that Botton does so with a great deal of wit and originality. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extension of de Botton's genius","review":"I couldn't disagree more with the last reviewer. I too much enjoyed de Botton's novels (though my favourite novel was actually his first, ON LOVE). But I'm also enjoying the essayistic turn he has taken in the last two books. What we get in them is an extension of his analysis, which always formed a part of his novels. So it's not so much a change of direction as an evolution of direction. And while this book is not a novel, it has certain features in common with novels; namely, a concern with language, with pace, in simple terms; with keeping the reader entertained. De Botton has written a wonderfully personal yet urgent essay on the great philosophers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A neat intro to ethics and moral phylosophy","review":"What a treat! Everyone who enjoys independent thinking and has a self-depreciative sense of humor will enjoy this read. In addition, being a parent of a high-school student who is, sort of, like, into phylosophy, I am going to buy this book for my son because it is a very engaging way to introduce him to several important thinkers. And I believe that De Botton's quirky lexicon can stimulate my son's vocabulary growth. My only reservation is De Botton's baroque-like excessiveness, which, of course, makes his prose immensely flavorful but, at times, it gets difficult to stay focused and not get swayed by his verbal ornamentals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"One of the best expositions of the philosophy of some (6) great Western philosophers. Superb English prose and perhaps the best I ever read. Given that Botton is hardly more than 30 years old, he has a great future, and I expect from him similar expositions of the philosophy of other philosophers.However, compared to the first 4 chapters, I found the last 2 (on Schpenhauer and Nietzsche) are less well structured. I found that both philosophers are a bit boring to read. Surprised that Plato and Aristotle are missing. Perhaps Botton may consider my comments if he revises this book. I want to stress that I am not a trained philosopher, but someone with interest in Western philosophical thought and the need for the Orient to learn from the West some of its philosophy, although the Orient has a great tradition of its own philosophy.I wish all the best to the author and highly recommend this book. It is a book which will be read many times by its admirers like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condition","review":"The book arrived and I did order used but the overall condition was poor .

I am now 24 and am in treatment. Hall and Ostroff's book helped me to understand that I was not alone, and that I was in charge. Most importantly, and the most difficult issue to deal with is that anorexia teaches you things about yourself. I strongly recommend this book to someone who does not know where to start. No, once you read it, you will not be cured but at least you will have explored what you are most afraid of--letting go of the control and the selfdestructive coping strategies. I read the book within the first week of group therapy and came the next week with photocopies of certain sections that were very helpful for the rest of the members. This book helps you want to get rid of the anorexic thoughts. You will be much happier while on the road of recovery. Letting go of the obsessive thoughts that come with anorexia was the best thing I have ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"rock ballad","review":"Great choice for the third single off their fourth album. This song revisits Brian's musings on relationships from previous albums, and it has a traditional Placebo feel to it. The piano and distortion, surprisingly, work very well together. Backed by an energetic remix of 'English Summer Rain', and an interesting version of 'Plasticine', it's another quality release from Placebo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Horse Manure","review":"I found the author to be obsessed with his own visions of the album, taking page after page to outline his personal theories, leaving little of this thin book to describe the actual album. The best quotes in the book were lifted from the excellent Waiting On the Sun book on the LA music scene of the '60s. While the author's takes on the lyrics and Arthur's mindset when writing the album have some validity, it comes off more as a late night dormitory bull session between people trying to show off their intellect. So if you want to connect Marat/Sade and Gnosticism to Forever Changes, have a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I always enjoyed Arthur Lee and \\"Love\\" but...","review":"This volume reads like something someone wrote as a literary disertation for some type of graduate work in music studies. It wasn't anything I could become interested in, because the bulk of the writer's narrative takes an exciting, groundbreaking recording and evaluates the music and lyrics in antisceptic, academic terms. What research in the way of first-hand interviews with band members or other methods of information-gathering for this project was unclear to me. Although the writer was able to string his thoughts into a coherent analysis, I was very disappointed with the overall content. It did not tell me anything about the album \\"Forever Changes\\" that I didn't already know or couldn't have imagined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love's Forever Changes (33 1/3 series)","review":"I was excited to get this book, to learn a bit about the album and it's making. What I got was someone's (at least it reads like) doctoral thesis. This is an intellectual analysis, guesswork in many instances, some fact thrown in. When someone tries so hard to have a heady read, over the head of many indeed, it is usually, in my experience, a lot of maybe this did happen..and maybe some of it didn't, but it is just very boring and it is taking far to long to read this little book that offers little about the group, and guesses much about the mental state of Arthur Lee."},{"rating":"1","title":"LoVE's Forever Changes - 33 1/3 book","review":"Length:: 1:55 MinsNot a very good bookCouldn't he just write about the album, talk about the sessions, how the group was replaced on the Wrecking Crew on the first couple of songs?Its a mess.

Good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Sandwich","review":"Andrew Hultkran's book reads like an undergraduate thesis, a thesis that's aiming to impress a professor who may have been a member of the Black Panthers/Merry Pranksters/Weather Underground. It's not about how the 60's were, it's all about how they are meant to be remembered. In order to achieve that goal, Hultkran required a bulk of historical revisionism to connect Arthur Lee to unrelated events/subjects. How the editor of Continuum's 33-1/3 series never rejected this manuscript is astounding, and should have told Hultkran to find another publisher for his rubbish. If you want to know more about this release, you would be better served by reading the CD liner notes from previous Rhino re-issues of 'Forever Changes', which reveal more then this book will ever muster."},{"rating":"1","title":"good music, interesting lyrics, strange book","review":"\\"The gnomic interiority of its lyrics invites the type of deep exegesis usually reserved for...\\" is not a really atypical sentence opening in Hultkrans' book.

Muddy is very lively and the audience is very into the show. He really has the crowd going on \\"Got my mojo working\\". The songs and Muddy's way of playing has the folks greatly appreciative. The third concert has a fabulous harmonica player named Jerry Cortney. He does some really great playing and out does many other of his mouth harp competitors such as James Cotton who was also excellent in the first set. There are some very nice solo piano playing by two great piano players, Otis Span and Pine Top Perkins. Muddy plays live in 1960, in 1968, and in 1977. Each one is worth the price of the dvd. I give this dvd a 4 star to 5 star recommendation. This is one of Muddy's best live performance on dvd.

In fact, there is NOTHING about Proctor that's admirable. Book after book, he sits around as murky events unfold (note to author--do you purposely muddle your stories to make them sound cool?). Then, when there's no one left to kill, Proctor lights out for the anatagonist--whom is unguessable owing to Grant's lousy style--and deftly deals out death.Forget this noise!

If I wanted to know about two lesbian that lived until they were 70-something years old I would of watched \\"If These Walls Could Talk\\" on HBO. Stupid story, very stupid story.Movie Lover, all it did was talk about what the title suggest, the love of movies. No sex really to speak of though.White Girl Blues, a black man that loves having sex with a white female that has a black virgin as a girlfriend. This story to me goes a little deeper than sex.

After all, my point is to make better relationship not build a wall between us. If you feel this way you will enjoy reading this book of today's good manners. While I may not agree with everything exactly because I still believe in many of the good old fashioned manners, this book offeres some etiquette that I hadn't been exposed to; like, snoring! and fighting fair...I think anyone interested in improving his/her manners or learning about what good manners even are today, this is a very good book. It even covers the 'art of listening' which too many don't do now-a-days.

Besides being able to weave an amazing plot with plenty of twists like Ludlum, Wolstencroft's best achievement is his being able to break the mold from previous previous previous Cold War spy novel writers and their archetype of characters and scenarios. For example, the characters possess a sense of realistic wit and use modern technology such as text messaging.Good news? It was an amazing read. Bad news? It had to end. Good news?

It was as if Wolstencroft decided, \\"Ahh, right then, I've grown tired of this one, let's finish it up and then off to the pub.\\" The story is outlandish, the characters stop being believable, and the ridiculous subplot involving a character who turns out to be mentally unstable just pushes that suspension of disbelief too far. If you're looking for something action-packed, try one of Ian Fleming's excellent James Bond novels (Casino Royale, Moonraker, and Dr. No top my list), and if you want an intricately woven storyline, you can't lose with John le Carre's The Spy Who Came in From the Cold or Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.

In addition to this, I work for a transportation engineering firm and all three offices have upgraded to WordPerfect Office 12. One of the main reasons is that we need to convert many files and reports to Adobe PDF format. This now can be accomplished quickly and easily within WordPerfect (although our company continues to use Adobe Acrobat). Also, we need compatibility with Microsoft software.

If you use regular headphones you need 2 kinds of adaptors. The charger is hard to plug in. Alert for low battery is not loud at all.

The series really should have never gone past III, but I admired the way they were able to keep it interesting afterwards, even if they were grasping at straws by VI. VII is the final chapter and thankfully so because the acting and special effects are the worst yet by far. What story there was, was ruined by poor acting. On top of that the special effects, especially in the first trap we see at the beginning of the movie, are cheesy at best. The blood for whatever reason looked pink, which made it totally unrealistic looking. I really wanted this to end well, but sadly it didn't.

After five films, it devolved into gruesome acts of violence without any purpose, only that people wanted to see what interesting ways Jason could eviscerate his victims.

With great acting plus new dilemas.Video quality is at his best on the BluRay on both 2D and 3D, but to really enjoy it I recommend the 3D version of it, the enclosed DVD covers the movie perfect.

A lot of loose ends are tied up. All the pieces now fit together. The final chapter has everything you could ask for in a Saw film. It did seem a little rushed, but it was very suspenseful. I loved all the new traps and twists. The only flaw is that Tobin Bell didn't have enough screen-time as Jigsaw, but you may not notice because of all the new games being played. It was good to see Cary Elwes back as the infamous Dr. Gordon. Hoffman has become more of a serial killer this time and tries to find Jill. An author named Bobby Dagen has written a book about how he survived a Jigsaw trap, but it's all a lie. When Bobby is really thrust into a game, he has sixty minutes to save his wife, or she will die. The Saw franchise has had a good run. I'll miss seeing them at the theater every year.

Makes you imagine yourself in the victims' places and wonder if you could past their tests (-shudder-). What amazes me most is the collaborative effort that went into making all 7 films work (writing, directing, acting, visual effects, etc). I'm sad to see this franchise end...

I'd never read about what the future might be like.Ally and Brian provide uproariously funny conversations that will have you on your back. The ending is so sweet, I had tears in my eyes. If you want to read something weird about going back in time, here you are. The unicorn thing is BIZARRE. I liked all the secondary characters as well, like Jupe and the Old One(Yes in capital letters). The slight Mystery about the \\"curse\\" on the castle is solved near the end, and it turns out so unlike you'd expect. This is one book I recommend highly to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as stated and good price","review":"The y adpater seems to be working well and have not had any issuse with the 2 that I purchased.

It was written in a terse, indigestible style; contained very few worked problems; left many important derivations or steps of derivations to the reader; had impossibly hard end-of-chapter problems - without solutions; and contained many typographical errors. Perhaps, as other reviewers have suggested, it would have been more helpful as a research reference, or as a textbook for students with a very strong background in undergraduate statistical thermodynamics.

Matisyahu broke through in a major way, but two of the most interesting new Jewish acts also released albums this year: Balkan Beat Box and Latino-Jewish collective Hip Hop Hoodios.Gone are the schmaltzy, lame stereotype acts like 2 Live Jews and 50 Shekel. In their place have arrived new acts that represent the true cultural tapestry of Jewish culture. I really enjoy the Balkan Beat Box concept - it's all over the place, and they put on an amazing live show (especially the one at Irving Plaza). Likewise, I discovered Hip Hop Hoodios through their video \\"Gorrito Cosmico\\" on MTV Espanol - never did I think an openly Jewish act could make it in the Latino community.So let me say, if you are an open-minded Amazon shopper, pick up the Balkan Beat Box album and also grab Hip Hop Hoodios \\"Agua Pa' La Gente\\" while you're at it.

Although the details may be different, we have all experienced what these characters have to some degree. It was reassuring to know that these feelings about gay life, relationships and friendships are not unique.What really made the book interesting was the fact that it was written in first person from the points of view of three characters: Jeff, Henry and Lloyd. It's obvious that these are much more than fictional characters, but characters based on people that the author has actually known.It's interesting how the three points of view fill in the missing gaps in each character's narrative, or give a different spins on a single event, much like the characters in a Maeve Binchy novel.With Where the Boys Are and its prequel, The Men from the Boys, our generation may have actually found its literary voice in William J. Mann."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I have to say is.......","review":"What an excellent book!!!

I wish I could meet Mann and thank him for such a wonderful book =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Therapy and a Good Read","review":"Seems like many authors writing primarily for a specialized audience can rely upon that audience, and don't have to mind things like quality. That is hardly the case with William Mann and this book. Like its predecessor, Men from the Boys, this book is extremely well-written, with believable, human characters, with attributes and flaws. The book offers that rarest thing in modern novels -- something that both makes you think AND that you enjoy reading. Topics such as monogamy, forgiveness, hate crimes, and gay men-women relationships are addresses seriously, but without lecturing, politics, or stereotypes. Finally, one grows by reading these books -- it is an ally against much pain and depression and uncertainty. In short, it is a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relatable, Intelligent, Affirming, and Compelling","review":"These are just a few of the many words I could use to describe this excellent sequel to Mann's THE MEN FROM THE BOYS. It covers the complexities of urban gay life in a way that blasts through stereotypes by creating multi-dimentional characters who leap from the page with genuine humanity. Even more impressive is the \\"page turner\\" nature of the narrative. I couldn't put it down and have recommended it to all my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"A screenplay for a TV series more than a novel","review":"If you are looking for a real novel with interesting characters, I'd look elsewhere. I found \\"Where the Boys Are\\" incredibly predictable and cliche-ridden. The answer to the central mystery is too clearly telegraphed early on in the book, and it just gets worse towards the end. The protagonist must have done a LOT of X and K to not have come to the obvious and clumsy answer before the very end of the novel.If you are looking for a mindless read that you can zip through in one day on the beach, this book is OK. If you want a real novel, try something by Alan Hollinghurst or Mark Merlis. They can write creative fiction that gives you something to chew on... somehting a bit more substantial than the dialog of \\"Queer as Folk\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Touched Me","review":"After reading this book in one sitting I was left with the feeling of being understood. To often in my life I have been misunderstood, to often I have been placed in stereotypes that did not quite fit who I was. The characters in this book are not stereotypical, the dialogue is not stereotypical. William J Mann has a mastery of dialogue that brings forth seven very different very unique characters. I have since purchased copies for my mother, and other good friends telling them \\"This is the world I belong to!\\" They too have been surprised at how enjoyable this book is to read. This is a definate must in anyone's library gay, straight, bi, transgender, or questioning.

I turned the resistance all the way up too. Also, the DVD that comes with it is a joke as well. Where did they dig up this George Pou guy? Terrible.

The adjustment of the fit is easy. I like the driver side, inside the cover latch release. If you have a locking tailgate, this is really nice because you can only unroll the cover by releasing the latch from inside the bed with the tail gate down, so it adds a bit more security than snap style covers.Material is made of very good quality.

The writer of the cookbook, Boehm (?), seems to have done slapdash work in the testing department: the translation of a restaurant-level preparation to that of the home cook is poor.

I'd seen the more negative reviews here, especially regarding the editing, but after looking at it in a brick-n-mortar store (and then purchased here, since it was cheaper...yay, discounts!), it occurred to me that Ming's editor may be British-trained, which could account for some differences in style.Since I'm not a cook/chef/etc., I can't really judge it comparatively to others in its field (hence, only 4 stars), but my husband definitely liked the Fusion style greatly, even the recipes in the back calling for really expensive ingredients.

The party planner's book gives great suggestions for props, music and food. We checked out a 50's CD from the library and played it all night long. We also had a hula hoop, 50's book and a 57 Chevy prop to go with the theme. The end had quite a twist, which made it fun and interesting. Overall, a fun game! Requires about three hours to play game. Note to Party Planner: Read through the first dialogue of the part you play to better understand how the dialogue should go. This will help you better explain to others. Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great!","review":"We played this for New Year's Eve. It was fun until we got to the end and found out who the murderer was. There was no way of finding out ourselves. It was a convoluted ending. Very disappointing. This is our 3rd year doing this and only 1 of 3 games were we able to actually figure out the murderer ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun- but has problems","review":"This is my first murder mystery (as well as all of my guests first) and we had a lot of fun. We will definitely have another murder mystery but I don't plan on buying it from the same company. As others have wrote try not to have 8 people, as it complicates the game. Maybe our group wasn't paying enough attention, but people kept missing their opportunity to ask questions and their was no guide on who should ask who in an exact order. The storyline was very humorous, and as I've said we had fun, but if you are thinking about buying this product I may try to find another one if your group can get off topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Fun for Everyone!!!","review":"Many thanks to the many helpful reviews on here. They all said it; I'll just add some notes:The recipes were delicious. I'm not much of a lamb guy, so I substituted baby back ribs, still using the rub and homemade sauce the recipe called for, and it was WONDERFUL!I took others' advice and only invited 2 other couples, and looking at the non-suspect character books, I can see how those guests would have been seriously disappointed, but for 6 people, it was perfect.Some are complaining about the ending - we LOVED it, and though none of us got the correct suspect for the correct reason, it was there in the clues all along. Just pay attention to the seemingly minor details and you can nail it.Super fun, and we're doing Pasta Passion and Pistols this weekend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for grown ups!","review":"I have done 3 of these murder mystery dinners and I must say this one was the most fun!!

The level of detail that goes into the characters, places, and events is excellent. Specifically, the focus on character development is very deep, and you'll know each of the characters well by the conclusion of the book. The buildup of the plot is very traditional and follows an ever-growing band of heroes on an epic quest - any fans of epic fantasy and/or anime will probably enjoy SOEV.I know James and have read the beyond the second book.

Looking for \\"Top Banana\\" (which means big boss, chief), the book shows \\"see also big cheese, head honcho, and top dog\\".

It sounds exactly like what it was. A bunch of unfocussed, disparate, directionless tracks recorded with different producers over 3-4 years . John Squire tries to cover up the paucity of songwriting ideas or inspiration with tedious bluesy guitar workouts. The classy songwriting and tight fluid playing of their debut album is circumspect by its absence although Ten Storey Love Song shows they still have the magic. Its just boring coked up r***ish on every level.The drumming is immense but the other 3 should still feel ashamed by their contributions. What a waste of a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"very understated","review":"This is a great album. There is no reason to compare the debut with this album, because they are very different. The Stone Roses could not record for some 4 years, and it is amazing how well they play here. I look at this album as a maturing phase in their career, and it is too bad they did not stay together. I would say there are 5 great songs on par with the debut: Ten Storey Love Song, Tears, How Do You Sleep?, and Your Star Will Shine., along with several other quality cuts of great guitar.

Whilst the first album was great, I found that the second album is just so much more energetic and \\"rocks\\". I can't believe that this album has been maligned by critics and fans alike. Then again, this album is very different to their first and represents a changing direction.

This book has potential, and that is both the meanest and nicest thing I can say about it. Gage likes giving the last scene as the first chapter, and having you guess at the ending, but it is usually a surprise because all the characters have the motivation to do as was detailed. In this book, however, it seemed as if she was just slapping in a character to make it surprising (I won't go into more detail than that).This book, had it been a few hundred pages longer and involved more insight, would have been good. Unfortunately, she seems to have gotten tired of the plotline (with some good reason), and dropped it before it was quite done. If you really want a book that will stay with you (instead of just a quick read), get her early works instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Elizabeth","review":"I am an avid fan of Elizabeth Gage's first popular books: Pandora's Box, A Glimpse of Stocking, and The Master Stroke. I also was captivated by her novel Intimate. However, Taboo was just so-so. This novel, Confession, was a huge disappointment. The first two thirds of the novel dragged by and was hard for me to read!! I assure you that if you read any of the first three titles I mentioned, you will not be able to put them down! This, on the other hand, started to make me yawn! The last third of the novel picked up and was much more readable than the first two thirds! If you want my advice, read Ms. Gage's other books first, but skip this one! Confession is not a good representation of Elizabeth Gage's talent as a writer. Also, judging by the reviews, avoid her other novel, Against All Odds! Go for her early works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, if not that memorable","review":"For those expecting the same, repetitive lush orchestration that Horner is both praised for, and criticized for as self-plagiarizing, you won't find any of that here. The score is a blend of minimalist orchestra ensembles, samples and electronics. Often droning, and a bit dark or harsh at times.So, on the plus side, it's quite original. The closest score he's done perhaps being Flightplan, which was more active and even more dissonant, so that's good. The negative is that you're likely to listen to the CD once or twice, not have a mental place or time you'll listen to it again, and find it sitting on the shelf as nothing memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pleased","review":"the DVD is quite boring and very boring.

I read a lot of romance, and after a while, they all start to sound the same. This book surprised and thrilled me. The characters are fresh and different, and their romance is really touching and kept me hooked the whole time. The action is exciting and kept me guessing. After I'd finished it, I felt like I'd really been to India, and that I'd shared in their adventures. The hero is to die for! And the heroine is strong and sassy, but I felt like I'd really known her.

Any truths in this book, and there are but a handful, have been obtained by outside sources, not by her own \\"research.\\" I lived in El Salvador when she came in to gather info for her story. It is an outrage that she so flippantly used the sufferings of the Salvadorans to effect personal gain. If you want to read fiction, go ahead. She's a good storyteller. As a service to yourself, however, keep in mind that the author has almost zero first hand knowledge of what she writes. The only reason I have the book at all is that my father gave it to me.

The title song is a wonderful, melodic mid-tempo track, produced by Emilio Estefan, followed by another great track \\"No será fácil\\", contributed by his sister Gloria. On \\"Hay que saber perder\\", they mix flamenco and latin rhythms superbly with an irresistible chorus. Raúl Orellana & Jaime Stinus - the people behind Azúcar Moreno's breakthrough hit \\"Bandido\\" - also contributed two tracks: \\"No tendré piedad\\" and \\"A galope\\", but the producer of their first five albums, Julio Palacios, did the remaining material which is not particularly minded for the dance floor, it's more relaxed, very melodic and enjoyable, you'll get the feel of a hot tropical night while listening to this gorgeous album.

If you have not read book one, \\"Storm Front\\", and are looking for a good new series to curl up with, I encourage you to buy these two books now and get in on the fun. I wish Mr. Butcher all success, and hope we get to enjoy his wonderful world for a long time to come. Looking forward to book three in the \\"Dresden Files\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another success for Jim Butcher","review":"The second book in the series about Harry Dresden is a resounding success. (IMHO) Despite the backlash of the events of the first novel, (Storm Front) Harry presses on to discover who is repsonsible for a series of gruesome murders that appear to have been committed by a werewolf.This story gives us a little more detail on Harry's background and opens many a question and line of investigation for Harry. (Its all about the parents...) This book was a pleasure to read and will remain with the 'keepers' of my library. Mr. Butcher has produced a well plotted and tightly written yarn that is sure to delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better than the first book!","review":"Harry Dresden returns in this gripping fantasy thriller! This time Dresden must help the police to stop werewolf who is terrorizing Chicago with some gruesome murders.Once again our wizard gumshoe finds himself in a deadly squeeze play between cops, trigger-happy FBI agents, shape-shifting motorcycle gang members and his old enemy, the ruthless mobster john Marcone.Butcher is very good in throwing you tidbits of the earlier life of Harry and his plot twists are quite ingenious.I also loved the bloody action sequences as you watch as the werewolf decimates the chicago Police department and final and gripping showdown in Marcone's estate.But beware this novel is twice as violent as the first one.Once again he gives us some memorable characters who help or hinder Dresden in his case.Tera- the sexy and mysterious shapeshifter. Denton-sinister FBI agent and Susan-a reporter who falls for Harry. Bring on the next Dresden adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These books just keep getting better","review":"Another great book in this series. I can't recommend Jim Butcher enough. Terrific stories and fantastic writing. It's rare that an author can make me laugh like these books do, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 round up to 4 for entertainment value","review":"3.5 stars rounded up to 4 because I was really entertained.It would be a 4 because it made me turn page after page and I didn't want to put it down. It would be a 3 because I saw no clear character development if compared with the previous book and I didn't have the impression my vision of Harry's world expanded. I expect some sort of progression in a series, things getting more complicated, getting to know more about the characters and their world, but I didn't get it in this book. I had the impression characters were keeping their cards too close to their chests, it was difficult to find my way in. As in the previous book, I like Harry more when he's talking about his lost family. There's something dark in Harry, let's find it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done","review":"Again I found myself drawn into the world of the book.

Still as witty as ever. He'll muttle through and get the job done, because HE has to, know one else can.Very enjoyable book, lots of action."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"Mr Butcher is an excellent storyteller, and as the series evolves, he makes you care more and more about the characters, and you get sucked deeper into the fantasy world that he creates. I bought the first one because of the tv show. Then I bought 7 more and read them in six days. I can't get enough and I can't wait until the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Butcher does it again!!","review":"Well, I have loved the first book on Dresden Files and, you know, a sequel ei not mormaly as good as the first one.

Definitively, a great book, better than the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hrmmm...","review":"As a werewolf fan, I had to give the Harry Dresden series one more chance and picked up the second book. Not as hard to push through as book one, but in the end I was not satisfied with the read.I'll give it two stars for the interesting take on werewolf types, but that's about it. The content had me grinding my teeth as FBI agents and Police acted so outrageously unrealistic the suspension of disbelief couldn't hold.Spoiler --In one part, the plucky female police detective has hostile words with a female FBI agent, and the FBI agent draws a gun on the police detective, at a busy crime scene no less. Ooookay.... right. Then, the plucky, but stubborn police detective only reaction to the whole event is act tough and tell our hero Harry that she can take care of herself. This scene alone killed the story for me.I enjoyed minute parts scattered through the book, but it's like picking the chocolate sprinkles out of an otherwised soured dessert."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stupid book","review":"This has to one of the worst books I ever tried to read. Its not the strange mix of magic with inconsistent rules that bothers me. I could suspend my disbelief for that. It's the fact that Harry Dresden is an idiot. I know that can be said for other fictional detectives, but Dresden goes way beyond the rest. He gets his friends killed, he makes enemies of every powerful person of group that he can find, and constantly walks into situations that he admits he knows enough to avoid. It doesn't help that most of his enemies, and supposed friends, don't grasp how dumb he is, and mistake his stupidity for malice. If you need to find out how bad this book really is barrow a copy. Don't waste your money by buying one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap. Garbage. Waste of time.","review":"There was so many stupid parts. For one, there's too many different types of werewolves including one that transforms with a aid of a magic fur belt. Just place your hand down your pants, touch it and tada! OoOoh how about a wolf that becomes a person? or a person that becomes a wolf? and for the traditional werewolf lets throw a full moon in the sky five nights in a row. Also Harry meets himself in a dream who sorts out everything and scowls himself for not getting laid enough.I really enjoyed Storm Front but this just sucked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Fool Moon is the second in the Harry Dresden series by Jim Butcher. I'm a bit late to this series and there are numerous other detailed reviews for this book so I won't rehash it all again.Suffice it to say, I love Harry Dresden. He's a great wizard, but the author allows him to make mistakes and do stupid things. That's what makes him so likeable. In this book, Harry gets beat up a lot - way more than the average person can stand in 24 hours and that's my only complaint about this book. I know Harry is a wizard and all, but he was shot and beat way too much for even him to be able to pull off what he did. I love the internal dialogue and I especially love Bob, the skull. He's such a good sidekick. I hope Mr. Butcher includes him more in future books.This was a fun and entertaining book and I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ideas, terrible execution","review":"A friend recommended this series to me, and the way she described it sounded amazing. When she tells me about the things that happen over the course of the series I'm fascinated, but the writing is really terrible and remarkably boring. I found I couldn't connect with any of the characters and had to give up on the book entirely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"I really liked this book & can hardly wait to read the next book in the series. I could hardly put the book down because I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next, I would think I would know what was going to happen, but was surprised at every twist & turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irreverently interesting","review":"This book is greatly challenging and very interesting. The slightly irreverent nature of Butchers writing style keeps me foucsed and involved in the book. I love this series and will continue to read his work with abandon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling it quits, not quite","review":"Just when Harry is thinking of calling it quits because of all the business he's not getting, he gets a case he really doesn't want - a mutilated body and bloody paw prints on the edge of a full moon. Worse yet, the Feds want to take the case from local PD.Harry gets called in to consult, because he's teamed up with the Spook Squad of Chicago PD, and looks at the pawprint, then decides he doesn't want to quit, he wants to leave town. Unfortunately, he's already involved in the matter more than he knows, and it's going to get worse for him and others as the moon gets more full."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entry to a great series.","review":"While Fool Moon isn't quite as developed as the previous book in the series, it is still a great addition to The Dresden Files. A fantastic yarn of wolves, lust, and losing humanity.This book, and series, gets a solid recommend to any supernatural, fantasy lover of mystery and the dark arts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I am really enjoying this series of books by Jim Butcher. He writes in such a way that you feel that you can relate to Harry. Harry is an ordinary guy, he just happens to be a wizard as well. Well written book, good humor, a little racy just for fun, and the fantasy side is well represented. Whether you like detective novels or fantasy, The Dresden Files series of books will keep you entertained. Give them a go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied, Thank you","review":"I have not had a chance to read my new books,but they arrived in excellent condition as always.Thank you, K"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to read, bad to listen to.","review":"I thought it would be impossible to get bored with a book in which there are wizards, werewolves, magic, demons and all other kinds of creatures that I normally get excited about. And it may be very entertaining when read in an actual book, but as an audio book, this one is a killer. The narrator is Harry Dresden, Chicago's only wizard for hire, as he likes to remind us, and throughout the whole narrative, his voice does not change much. The plot revolves around a series of crimes committed by a werewolf, and the local police, helped my Dresden, is trying to solve the mystery of the killer, but not believing in werewolves is a major barrier in this process. The book is read by James Marsters (Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer & Angel) who, I have to say, should have kept his delightful British accent. He kept putting me to sleep with his melodic but somewhat monotonous voice. So the bottom line is - buy the book, not the audio book. Or else beware.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"This book really could have used some editing. It seemed like there were good ideas behind it, but they weren't well executed. Some of the mechanisms the author used to move the story along made me roll my eyes and put the book down for a while (the worst would be the chapter of talking to the subconscious in a dream because he can't seem to figure things out any other way). I want to like these books, but they have so many problems that they make me cringe. He gets the second star only because I find the ideas interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolf, Wolf and Wolf","review":"This is a new twist on werewolves.

This time, the body has been shredded and torn apart by something that is not human. That is why Harry is called in, to find out what is causing all the chaos. Again, this story is a quick read, and very entertaining. You do not have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this book. If you like a good murder mystery, who-dun-it sort of thing, give this book a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good installment","review":"I usually don't expect much in sequels or additional installments in series. Mostly the first book is the strongest, but I have to say I really like how all the elements were amped up in this one. There was a little more to the odd relationship between Dresden and Murphy, lots more action, and some good twists. Looking forward to reading more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine adventure with the unsinkable Harry Dresden.","review":"Harry's insistence on being on the side of good, while refusing to label himself as “good\\", is a wonderful example of a great hero's self perception. Harry is easy to cheer for, fun to laugh with, and a great friend to have along for travel or lonely weekends.Fool Moon isn't the very best of the Dresden Files, but it is still very good. It also gives much character development and back story for later novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Loved it a definite must read!

The main character all the way down to the minor are so entertaining. There is some really good tidbits of back story that find their way into the narrative. It feels like this series is really building a mythology. Taking its time building it up.I didn't believe this was perfect. What I loved about the first one was the witty dialogue would lead into an action scene. The plot twist and turned. Fool Moon just has to much action where the characters spend multiple pages not talking. This is the only real flaw I could sense in this superb book.Dresden Files is a great read. I can't wait to see what comes next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fool Moon ... Fantastic (:)","review":"I believe in Harry Dresden. I hope there are more of his kind fighting the evil in the world.

Casting Montgomery Clift certainly helped to burn this movie into my brain but the story was a perfect introduction into the world of ulterior motives, followed shortly by my initiation to the works of Agatha Christie. When I was 10, the strongest message I got was that people who don't want to work will marry other people for their money. I didn't even notice the damage done by the father or the disloyalty of the aunt. Thirty years later, the thing I noticed most was that neither of the lovers can NOT live without being with the other. There's no real love lost nor destroyed only ego. This is such a great movie and I don't feel ill-served for having seen it at the possibly too young age of 10. I don't need to rewatch this movie for it to be buzzing behind my brain all these years. It's a classic but even more rare, it's perfect storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heiress","review":"Widely hailed as a masterpiece, and boasting an Oscar-winning performance from Olivia De Havilland, Wyler's powerful and haunting drama was adapted from Henry James's novel, \\"Washington Square.\\" De Havilland's transformation from dutiful and docile daughter into a grown-up who thinks for herself is one of the great rewards of seeing this film; Richardson shines, too, as an overbearing man who nevertheless feels conflicted about blocking Catherine's right to decide her own future. With a splendid score by Aaron Copland, majestic costumes by Edith Head, and Wyler's mastery of psychological tension, \\"The Heiress\\" is a Hollywood treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favourite film","review":"THE HEIRESS is now my all-time favourite film, surpassing THE GHOST AND MRS MUIR, which was the top of my list for many years. For me, everything about this film is perfection: the acting, the superb screenplay, the wonderful score, the direction, the attention to detail... THE HEIRESS gets better and better with each viewing. But the best aspect of this film is Olivia deHavilland's portrayal of the tragic, pitiful Catherine Sloper who, denied a life of being loved by her resentful father, falls in love with the first man who shows her kindness.

I finally had to have my husband build a frame out of plastic to fit inside of the carrier so that I could continue using it. The plastic frame helps the carrier hold it's shape. At first I thought it was because Amazon packaged it wrong and if I continued to use it it would eventually hold it's shape but that was not the case at all and after a month of use it was worse than when I first received it.

The highway is unique in that it cuts around the mountain, and the side of cliffs, rather than over the mountain. The Red Sand Beach is also beautiful, but you only get a very brief shot which is a shame.The video highlights and cycles from aerial views of 'cloud' forests to rain forests and back to the sea - lush valleys as well as spectacular shots of Hawaii's volcanos.

I'm there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was The Point, Really?","review":"I liked the first (couple) of Bourne movies and I really like Jeremy Renner and although it had been pretty much panned, I thought I'd give this movie a whirl. Sometimes, too much whirling leads to hurling, as in this case. It wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't good. The motive of the bad guys (my favorite bad guys, the guvnment) was muddy, the process ill-defined and the ending just tacked on without any closure (and without leaving us open for another movie to straighten the whole mess out).Save your time -- pass this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Legacy would be a better name","review":"You should consideer this movie as a very long trailer for the next in the series.

I would have to place it as my second favorite out of the entire Bourne series. I thought the acting by everyone, including supporting actors with small roles was very good to excellent. This lacked that elusive fifth star because the final action seen was only so so and unfortunately Rachel Weise saves the day. The movie of course left room for a sequal but we did not get much closure at the end of the movie.All that said, this is a good movie that I personally added to my collection and will probably find myself watching again from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachel Weisz makes the movie","review":"Renner is really good, but have to give it to Weisz for making the movie work.

There were some other questionable casting decisions too. For example, the Doctor on the run with Renner's character was awful! The Bourne formula is getting old.

Gilroy better get Damon back or this franchise is in the toilet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is it so expensive to rent?","review":"$5 to rent this movie? New movies go for $4. Why the premium?

Lots of action and a fast paced movie. The movie itself didn't really offer up much of a back fill and didn't give any secrets away but was entertaining anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Bourne film","review":"A good movie overall. What you'd expect from this series, action suspense etc. The ending did leave a bit to be desired, however I suppose they're leaving it open for another movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strikingly good movie in many ways","review":"Oddly enough for an action movie the relationship between the two main characters was the most original and refreshing part. It was a very subdued and was limited to touching of the hands. Which I really liked this in contrast to the typical \\"mid film he bangs the sexy girl\\" scenes that are so typical. Everything else was richly done but this was the most striking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story","review":"While the film has some good acting and decent action sequences, the story is a muddled mess that not only fails to advance the Bourne franchise, but manages to diminish the saga.The ending in particular is weak and unsatisfying. The producers were obviously hoping to set up another series, forgetting that audiences need to enjoy the first movie before they'll buy a ticket for the sequel.

If you liked them, I think you will like this movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good addition to the series","review":"Some of us thought the beginning was a bit slow, being mostly non-dialog Renner-doping-in-the-wilderness. The backstory was handled well though (this movie is set about a week after the end of Ultimatum). Renner's character (Aaron Cross) is a bit more contemplative and likable that Jason Bourne (played by Matt Damon who basically does not appear in this movie). Viewers are left completely hanging at the end, there will obviously be another sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See","review":"Jeremy Renner does a great job in this action packed movie. His acting is superior, as well or better than Matt Damon did in the previous Bourne movies. It's a nail biter from the beginning. The scenery throughout is beautiful.

I highly recommend this movie if you are a \\"Bourne\\" fan!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly bad.","review":"I love the Bourne series, and was SUPER excited to see who was going to be replacing Matt Damon. GREAT casting, TERRIBLE script. It amounts to little more than a (very badass) junkie, looking for a fix. Essentially two hours of \\"where can I find these drugs?\\" I can see how this was more of a bridge film so that it could break away from Jason Bourne's story, but they did a shoddy job of it, as they broadly reference Jason Bourne in snippets for no real reason. It was an awkward film, and with as much as i love the Bourne franchise, I was surprised at how bored I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"This movie had misguided direction, no character development, and a very poor script.

THe first few were ok but it's getting really old that hollywood can't make a movie where spies actually fight people other than americans! zzzzzzzzzzz. Really? with evil terrorists and out of control communist and rogue states out there all we can get is bad americans? Fighting the cia? Actually there may have been no real cia on cia battles ever in history. Or days of the condor. Or whatever. BUt hollywood can't get away from this type of thing. There is a new movie based on real cia people called 'zero dark thirty' coming out at the theaters soon. NOone in the cia tries to kill each other though. how wierd is that? Please avoid this movie so that they will stop making movies where a betrayed agent fights the cia. It's really old and a waste of time. Although the first 2 borne movies were great.

That being said the movie wasn't terrible, but it was lacking to some extent on a few things.The movie proved difficult to follow at times, and was extremely fragmented with regard to the storyline.

I am a huge fan of the Bourne series but this one killed it for me. The story was stupid. The dialogue was bad. The concept was poor.

I said then that if I invest 3 hrs to watch a movie, it better end, never watched the others, Will treat the new bourne series the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really Bourne","review":"While it has Bourne in the title and throws numerous references to Jason Bourne and has many of the same cast it falls far short of the Bourne Trilogy. The movie starts out exciting and fast paced, but eventually somewhere along the way it just falls flat. it has a horrible ending and the plot of the movie made little to no sense at all. If you're familiar with Anime just imagine Dragonball Z with villains that just keep getting more ridiculously powerful it is absurd what they come up with at times. That is how I felt about this movie as halfway through they basically release a Wolverine type clone from the X-men movies to chase down Jeremy Renner's character."},{"rating":"2","title":"legacy","review":"i love this movie. action from beginning to end. just as good as all the other movies in the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, shut down the Bourne series.","review":"This series needs to be sent to its grave.

I wasn't sure what to expect but I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Entertainment","review":"I saw bad reviews for this movie, and those reviews made me want to see \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" because they were along the lines of, \\"It's too slow, too much character development.\\" And that's exactly what I want in a movie like this! Jeremy Renner is excellent as the lead character, and ably supported by the wonderful Rachel Weisz. Then you throw Ed Norton in the mix and you have a riveting and intriguing action/spy/thriller that raises a lot of question about boundaries, both political and philosophical, and leaves you longing for more.It's very much a Bourne movie, but with better camera work (yes, the last two Matt Damon ones left me a little nauseous from the \\"realistic\\" camera shake). Thoroughly recommended, and waiting for the follow-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"The plot was derivative of past Bournes. Further, it never grabs you. I never found myself wondering what would happen next. Basically, it lacked any real tension. While it was good that they tried to tie in the previous Bourne plots, they didn't clearly delineate early whether this was a replacement, like Bond, or a new character. I would recommend that you should wait and watch it on free TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Escapist Entertainment","review":"Good acting helped get through a somewhat confusing plot during first 20% of the film.

It was good and the acting was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I was, like probably most people, a little worried about how a Bourne movie could possibly work without Jason Bourne in it. However! Be not afraid! It turned out wonderfully. A good addition to the franchise even if it was Matt Damon-less. I was hoping maybe for a cameo but I guess it would have been hard to have him pop up without having to give him a more significant role. I still prefer the original 3 but I would not complain at all if they made more with Jeremy Renner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourne Legacy","review":"Bourne Legacy but NOT Bourne!I just finished watching the latest from the Bourne-franchise and I finished with mixed emotions. Does it have a great cast? Sure! Is the story-line even passable? Absolutely! Is the action well-made? Certainly! Is it high-paced? You bet! Is this a great Action-flick or isn't it? Oh yes!But a Bourne-movie its not. First of all it doesn't ad anything to the Bourne-universe but merely retells the story from the original movie - Bourne Identity - and even worse: How the h... is it ever going to be a Bourne-movie without Jason Bourne? I thought I could see past that, but I can't.In the end I have to conclude: Great Action-flick which unfortunately is missing the essence of Bourne. If you can look past this you are in for a treat. If you can't you will be disappointed. I was!So where does that leave the Bourne-franchise? That remains to be seen! Right now however it looks DEAD.

The directing by Gilroy is 1/20th of what Greengrass did on previous Bourne movies. This was a forced studio script to capitalize on the excellent acting by Damon. Renner is not convincing as someone remotely capable of being a super-assassin/agent. Weiss' acting is as flaccid as a pancake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despite the name and the effects, not engaging","review":"It had lots of the ingredients of the first Bourne movies save Matt Damon but it just wasn't as good. The story was also not written by Robert Ludlum. They slapped the Bourne name on it and did seem to put quite a bit of money into chase scenes and effects but the story was disjoint and I found it hard to get too invested in any of the characters. I kind of followed the story but at times, it just wasn't well glued together. I watched it at home and found my attention straying. My wife left mid-movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Science Fiction for an Action movie","review":"One of the reasons I like the first 3 Bourne movies was that they were, with a few exceptions, plausible to realistic.

At first I had trouble figuring out what the movie was about until I realized how simplistic the plot was - the \\"program\\" had to be shut down, and all program participants had to be killed off. That's it. Jeremy Renner spent the entire movie avoiding extermination. Boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"The movie is really good. The cast did a great job. I wasn't a big fan of the shaky camera effect, which seemed almost worse in this movie than the other Bourne movies, but since it was in the other movies, I kind of expected it. My only big complaint is the ending. As soon as it ended, I was left with the \\"that's it?\\" feeling. I was expecting there to be more. At least with the other movies there was an actual mission that you can pinpoint, but this one didn't really have any resolution or even a hint at the story continuing on in the rest of the trilogy since this was a prequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourne for the next generation","review":"I loved all the Matt Damon Bourne movies, so Jeremy Renner had big shoes to fill in my books.

Aside from the traditional car chases, fist fights, and shooting, the first part of the movie jumps around enough to keep you guessing about how all the disparate scenes tie together. By mid-movie, you have a pretty good idea of the plot and how it will unfold. By the end, you wish the plot had developed much further. The movie does a great job of setting up the next few movies from the Bourne franchise by leaving you with more questions than answers. If you liked the first three movies, you'll love this one.

If it was a stand alone move it would have been a 5 star movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"give it a shot","review":"following matt damon as the lead in a Bourne movie is a tough act to follow but Jeremy Renner does a great job in Bourne Legacy. Intense action film, good fight and chase scenes. If you like action films you will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great until the end","review":"I really enjoyed this movie and the fact that it expanded on the Treadstone story line, while introducing new characters. I was all set to give it 5 stars until the very end when it was left rather open-ended and clearly inviting another sequel to be made. Still a great movie and well-enjoyed by men and women alike. But I wish that the movie had been more self contained with the bad government guys getting what's coming to them in the end. Guess I'll have to wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho hum","review":"same old story. Now with medications. Good diversion, but easy to forget. No good hand to hand combat that was in the other ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Although not as good as the original the action was well done. I do think reusing and intertwining the previous movies footage in this one sort of lessened the impact ( you really had to understand and keep up with the plot in the previous movies).This one did not meet the intellectual standards set before."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie in the series","review":"loved the integration from the first 3 with this movie! The scenery of the film as well as setup was great"},{"rating":"1","title":"I is nothing like the original Bourne series.","review":"I bought the movie for my husband and I did not watch it myself. He said that if he hadn't previously read the book, he would not have understood the movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the crown jewel of the Bourne anthology","review":"To give it some bonus points, the Bourne Legacy had some very successful action sequences. But that's about all. Jeremy Renner was unconvincing, and Rachel Weis was just as forced. Edward Norton tried to make the most of his contribution to the film, but with a story line as contrived and hard to follow as the Bourne Legacy was, he couldn't lift this film out of its poorly thought out plot. It is an unfortunate follow up to a fairly successful trilogy of entertaining films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"The plot thickens. Blackbriar is just the tip of the iceberg. I like the way they include current technology like the effectiveness of drones and the applications of \\"viral weaponry\\". Bourne gets a mention, but Jason does not make an appearance. You can tell there will be more sequels. Great movie to buy because you will want to watch it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"New character in a great story.","review":"Should see the first three Bourne stories to enjoy as much as me. I look forward to Aaron Cross' continuation."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good movie","review":"nicely produced and executed, still closely tied with Bourne franchise. It could benefit from a better profiling of the new story."},{"rating":"2","title":"just as good as the other ones","review":"They found a way to continue the series while changing our main character. I compare them to the series of James Bond films..where there is a new actor playing our hero every 3 film's with no explanation as to how or why this happened. The Bourne series is about our own government making kill squads and the politics and actions of covering them up when they go south. excellent series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Do Movie Writers Think They Are Smarter Than Novel Writers?","review":"Pro: Awesome Alberta posing as Alaska winter scenery.Con: Everything else about this derivative, pointless rip-off.The only thing \\"Bourne\\" about this movie is the promoter's desire to ride Ludlum's coat tails. Yes, I know, the Bourne movie trilogy wasn't true to the original novels, but at least it had some resemblance to the story line. The 4th \\"reboot\\" is something else, and that something is no part of Ludlum's Legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but long to develop","review":"lots of action but it took a while for the story to unfold but once it got going it was pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting twist","review":"Not going to spoil it. Was fun to watch. Glad it wasnt a replacement of jason bourne Im not fond of remakes.. rarely does remakes ever work.. with rare exceptions. This was fun to watch if you into conspiracies and secret organizations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interestingly edited","review":"The move is filled with back and forths, laying the foundation for another government conspiracy while the hero assassin is suffering while the government program is being shut down to prevent disclosure. Enter the innocent scientist who did what she was told and neglects responsibility for the effects on the humans being tested. Jeremy Renner kidnaps here to \\"save\\" her and to get the formula needed to save his own life.......The themes seem old, though the acting was good. Rachael Weiz was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"great continuation of the genre. Renner is a good choice to continue this tradition. I would like to see more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie.. I had to have the Blu-ray","review":"Sure, it's not Jason Bourne, but Jeremy Renner is so refreshing as Aaron Cross. You might miss Bourne for a few minutes and then you forget all about him for awhile as they've developed this wonderfully exciting character. I haven't met anyone that watched BOURNE LEGACY that wasn't extremely impressed and most of us that are major BOURNE fans were very skeptical at first. You have to give it a chance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful...","review":"The prior movies had a story that had a plot that unfolded and in some fashion mostly wrapped up but left an option for additional, this one is a character study, building a foundation for other installments. Objective is clearly to share some back story and create all sorts of options for additional stories, but this one is a snoozer if you are looking for the same caliber as the priors. Well acted by Renner, Weisz, and Norton, just not much to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Need to watch the other Bourne movies before watching this one. It references them quite often though out the movie. But great action and fantastic continuation of the story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"Not worth the money. Simply not as good as the previous episodes. Truly a waste of money. Needs to be reevaluated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Can't compare to the first Three. All action and no story. Would not watch this movie again if it was free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourne Legacy...eh, it's a rental","review":"The movie started off slow, which I understand because they were developing the characters; however, as soon as the movie started to pick up pace and get interesting...it ends. It's like watching a TV show and plot starts to unfold and then all of sudden it ends with saying \\"tune in next week for the dramatic conclusion!\\" The movie felt unfinished and the movie as a whole was not strong to begin with to have an ending like this movie had.The \\"Bourne Identity\\" introduced and developed characters, but movie ended very well, you knew there was going to be sequel, but at the same time you felt good about the conclusion of the first movie.Overall this movie is 2 star and worth rental, but definitely not worth buying on DVD or Blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was the point?","review":"Was the point here just to add an installment to the \\"Bourne\\" movies? I didn't get the sense that they were doing a switch of main characters, or anything really. At the end I was surprised it was over and was just left wondering what the heck the point of the movie was. It was decent action and could entertain for a few hours, but I don't think it comes close to as good as the previous films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like the Book which would have been fine if it would have been good","review":"This was simply not interesting at all. I won't give any spoilers, but I can tell you if you are a Bourne fan from the Ludlem days and then with the new series, this just did not cut it. This had nothing to do with the book or Bourne. The Bourne Legacy book was still all about Bourne, but this movie had nothing to do with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up series","review":"Like many series of movies, some gain strength and some lose the momentum...in my opinion the Bourne series has been fading and this last installment is at the bottom...I hope this was the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow that was not good","review":"Wow what a let down.Good premise but it just never came together.The acting was pretty good but the story just laid there waiting to be revived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of...everything","review":"Looks like a Legacy is not a good thing to leave after all, just another Hollywood lazy attempt to extort money and provide nothing in return."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst of all the Bourne movies","review":"The fact that they had to use the \\"pills\\" to enhance the subjects was lame. Other than that thought the movie was ok until the ending which sunk it for me. How do you activate the guy from the Larx program and the don't even have a badass fight? The girl kicked him off his motorcycle! Really?!? Disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be kidding !!!","review":"That was was the worst movie of the year, nothing at all of the first three a joke and then I paid 4.99 on top of it. Very boring and I had rented with family over too it shouldn't even be put into the category of action, it was about being dependent on pills seems the only way they need to live,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourne fans....don't waste your money","review":"I saw this movie in the theaters and refuse to add it to my collection. This is the worst movie of the 4. The story appears to only be a bridge to launch the new character....and that bridge is poorly built.Suggestion...wait for the movie to show up on USA Network in a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Z Z Z Z Z","review":"I'll be generous and give it 2 stars, mainly for some great senic shots. The movie plods along with references to Treadstone and other previous Bourne movie anchor points. There is a wild motorcycle chase sequence at the end but by that time I was already playing around with my Kindle, having lost interest somewhat earlier. Jeremy Renner is not remotely believeable, too bad an actor couldn't have been hired for that part. I admire Edward Norton greatly but his talents are wasted in this one. Casting him as an upper level CIA boss doen't fly. Wait for Red Box availability on this one, that way you'll only waste a dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Jeremy Renner is hot. There is good chemistry between the two co-stars but the plot sucks!Four more words required."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"The movie was a huge let down. Thought it was going to better.

That's it. But it couldn't be over, could it?? I sat staring at the screen, seeing that there were only a few minutes left, and I thought, \\"Please let something MAJOR happen now\\". And it didn't.Jeremy Renner is perfect for this role. He's believable, maybe even more so that Damon. I loved watching HIM. I didn't like the story line (if there was one). I hope Jeremy continues this role, but I hope that everyone else associated with making this movie are asked to step aside.I can't believe it ended the way it did. How did this movie get approved for release?? Didn't ANYONE view it before sending it out to the theaters? So sad that such great potential was crumpled up and thrown away, leaving a very talented actor to sit around and look foolish for picking this role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"It was a nice change up from Matt Damon. Great story line and it worked well without him. Nice surprise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing film can't hold candle to the other Bourne movies.","review":"I saw this movie on a plane for free, and I still paid too much. Save yourself the $5 and more importantly save your time. The other Bourne movies are significantly better than this one in plot, acting, and high-flying spy thriller action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"To me this is the best Bourne movie yet. The plot was more interesting than any of the previous versions and wasn't dominated by special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"The Bourne Legacy had a surprising ending. I imagine the producers are allowing room for a continuation of this wonderful series. Jeremy Renner did a fabulous job. I did miss Matt Damon in the movie though. Hope he comes back if the series continues."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's okay","review":"I guess we just love Matt Damon too much to really get into this Bourne movie. Jeremy Renner is excellent but it's a little confusing. You really have to watch it a couple of times to get it. Not bad. Good action sequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"fits right into the original trilogy","review":"this movie picks up where Jason Bourne left off, but it explains the idea behind the creation of the assassin \\"assets\\" in more detailgreat entertainment....."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Direction","review":"Aaron Cross did not have the same moral compass as Jason Bourne - Jason would fight people and let those that were incidental to his real issues survive. Think of the Russian police that he left alone. Aaron, in contrast, basically killed everyone in his path. Think of the Filipino guards. Finally, Aaron's motives were selfish - he was desperate to get meds so he would not become stupid again. In contrast, Jason was trying to figure out, and rectify, his past. That is much more morally compelling.Very much an action movie, but left me empty inside at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Meh.Gives a bad name to the others in the series.

My goodness with all that money available, you would think that Hollywood could come up with a few new ideas, Apparently this is not possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Improvement","review":"I chose this movie because I like Jeremy Renner's work and since he was in this, I wanted to see it. I thought it was a big improvement over other Bourne movies, because it seemed more believable, although the wolf fight scene was a bit extreme, I still loved it. Also things in the movie seemed to flow better from one scene to the next. It was entertaining and kept my interest through the entire movie. I liked the chemistry between the characters and the sets in the Phillipines were great, especially the motorcycle chase scene. Loved it and look forward to next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"bad ending","review":"excellent view, played well, ending sucked / wonder how they will incorparte Damon into the sequel?Can't wait to see how they work it out while its still a hot flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the bourne series.","review":"Superbly intertwined into the existing trilogy. Great performances by the main cast. I can't wait for the next chapter of this fan fulfilling series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bourne Legacy","review":"Overall I would give this movie two thumbs up. My only issue is the story is a bit slow and disjointed for the first maybe 30 minutes. The action scenes are great with some great back drops. I personally see this movie as a build up to continue the series using the Aaron Cross character giving him a foot hold into the series and introduction. With the ending so wide open a follow up is in the works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good","review":"I was not impressed. Makes the first 3 shine even brighter.

Seriously? What in the world? I was never this mad about losing five dollars...They should have never called it Bourne Legacy, it is not doing justice to Bourne at all, and Matt if invited should never act in the sequel and should stay away from this total fiasco.There is no story, nothing new, no creativity, it almost feels like a bad version of the Hangover II.Go do something else instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"forgettable","review":"Quoted in a review as the movie you will be sorry you watched in the morning.

Even giving Jeremy Renner credit for trying to follow up such a incredible series of films, this film was weak. The story line was a little confusing and the performers all seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles. All-in-all, leave this one for when it comes on TV for free, or as part of an existing streaming subscription you may have (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc), where you won't have to pay anything for it......like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie sets up for more Borne legacy movies","review":"Not a bad action movie.

This movie tries to give viewers a feel of Bourne movies but the only things it does is show movie clips from previous ones. The beginning of the movie is slow and predictable and once the whole plot comes \\"into\\" light you are left hanging. This was like watching an episode of your favorite TV show and told to tune in next week to see what other crazy things may come up. Renner and Weisz were good but not real chemistry between them.

Its an effective move you can use IF YOU DO NOT OVERUSE IT. The Bourne movies are best example of the worst level of overuse. Rendering amazing and what must have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in choreography, rehearsed action, stunts and special effects almost UNWATCHABLE.

The need to cash in on previous Bourne movies made the whole experience rather cheesy, and interesting ideas about genetic engineering were lost in the shuffle. Abrupt ending, and a waste of good talent from Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, and Ed Norton. Renner and Wiesz had little chemistry, a likely outcome of the questionable film making. Fairly pointless character development just to have an action sequence or explosion.

A very ho hum movie, saad that I spent the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourne without Matt Damon is not Bourne","review":"Nice attempt to reproduce a Bourne movie. However, without Matt Damon is a failure. The movie end is open, makes me think there will be a following.If you don't want to be boring (since would be the 5th) is better to have Matt Damon in it and a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent new addition to the Bourne series and looks like there will be even more to come :)","review":"Great new story line to the Bourne series. I have read all the books and these are always non stop action and intrigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourne series","review":"I thought the movie was great, the wife commented about some of the action scenes as being impossible and way out there and I agreed, but I reminded her that it is just a movie and made to entertain not be factual. The govt. scenes reminded me of just how slimy ours has become. Over all great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Real disappointment","review":"The trailers made it look like it would be exciting and a fun move to watch, but it wasn't, the first 3 were much better and I can watch them over and over, this is a one and done !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like fast and the furious","review":"This movie is a 45 minute motorcycle chase. It has nothing to do with the prior \\"Bourne\\" movies. It was a waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"let's hope this is one legacy that is finally over","review":"ack...had high hopes for this one, but was disappointed...cardboard acting and a plot that kept taking sharp left and right turns made this movie difficult to sit through...let's just say we didn't bother hitting 'pause' when needing a snack or bathroom break..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential for so much more","review":"I hope the sequel, if there is one, will be better. I'm a Bourne fan, and this fell flat. So much potential...I hope it was setting the stage because all of a sudden, it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Boo! This is just chase scenes. No content at all. Very disappointing. Not a good move for the Bourne Franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourne Movie","review":"Horrible movie. Could not stand to watch it. A waste of 6$ Deleted it after 15 minutes.Don't bother renting it. A total waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad...","review":"Confusing, chase, blow something up, chase, zzzz. What a sad legacy to the Bourne movies. And the ending is really stupid. Go buy the trilogy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I think I was expecting The Bourne Legacy to be like the other sequels but was soon disappoint and mad at the end of the movie so I am lead to believe there is another sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of action as usual.","review":"It took a little doing to get my head into another \\"Bourne\\" movie without Bourne but Jeremy Renner does a good job and I hope he comes back with another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously a prequel","review":"The industry seems to generate stuff like this to keep a franchise going. The plot is unresolved and there is no significant chemistry between the romantic leads. My guess is, Matt Damon refused to sign on for a worn-out concept so they introduced a (flimsily) related character to keep whipping the dead horse."},{"rating":"1","title":"it just didn't live up to the legacy","review":"This movie was nothing more than a bad copy of the original series. The action was dull and the drama and mystery surrounding the main character was absent. They didn't even try to maintain any level of intrigue; they laid it all out for you each step of the way. What made the original series so good was the fact that you were following Jason Bourne on an intense journey to find out who he really was. Nothing about this movie seemed original and it completely lacked any intensity. I was bored by the time the big cookie cutter chase scene occurred. If the movie were titled anything else I would probably give it 3 stars since it was watchable but it just didn't live up to the legacy of Bourne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"It does not has enough action, follow to story, and connection. The them left wondering if he was better than Bourne at the end. Does not like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero acting","review":"The plot (what plot), was poorly presented. The chase scenes were chopped to impossible bits. The ending didn't ever come, it just stopped. Teenage fare at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourne Legacy","review":"Too many and too long chaces. Story with no conclusion.Charaxcers weve never seen before. Too much time spent on wondering plot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good action scenes but that's about it","review":"Disappointed in this movie. Just glad I didn't pay movie theater prices to see it. The action scenes were kind of fun but the plot was tired and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great action but NO story","review":"This movie jumps around in time a lot, grabbing sequences from the last Jason Bourne movie, but nothing ties it all together, unless they are laying open-ended groundwork for a sequel. But why bother, when the first movie is so awful.Even for a \\"Bourne\\" movie, the ending is a stretch. Overall a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"Total waste of time. Really. If you see it on Netflix, don't watch it. It's not good - at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the other.","review":"This one was weak. lots of jerking around the fight senes. This one was weak. lots of jerking around the fight senes.View tips and guide lines"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Action!","review":"I enjoyed the Bourne sequels and this one is just as good. Is this the end ... who knows, but I enjoyed the ride. However, we kept wondering if Jason would make a cameo somewhere, which would have been nice just to see that he was watching, but no one saw him kinda thing. If you liked the other films you will like this one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good or better than the orhers in the seris","review":"Well done, I was reprehensive at first. No Matt Dameon, who else could possibly be Jason Bourne?I throughley enjoyed it. Plenty of action a role played with excellence.Highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Flick","review":"Went with my husband to view this film, and found it worth a second viewing. We will probably add it to our DVD library"},{"rating":"2","title":"Done in the style of the series...","review":"But something seemed to be off in post production. The reused scenes from the previous movie were either filmed using different cameras or were processed differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bourne Leacy","review":"I am disappointed in this movie. The actor is good but the story is confusing, takes a while to understand just what the theme is and I am disappointed that Matt Damon wasn't the star in this. I watch the other Bourne movies quite a bit and enjoy them but this is a throw-away!!!!! Sorry but that is my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not impressed","review":"This is nothing like the other Bourne movies. It's long, there's barely any plot, and barely any action. It was definitely a waste of $5 and 2 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tittle has nothing to do with the movie","review":"I'm not a fan of movies without an ending, but this one should be a movie by itself. Enough is enough the Bourne movies are over. The movie is a disappointment for a sequel, unless it's free. Not worth paying!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst of the bourne series.","review":"this was the worst of the bourne series. couldnt figure out were this one belonged. story started out nowhere and went nowhere. very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much \\"Bourne\\" about the movie!","review":"I was expecting a \\"Bourne\\" movie and that is not what this movie is. They talk about Jason Bourne but that is about it and only a little of that even. This was an entirely different movie. Very disappointing as I love the Bourne movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"good addition to the Bourne series","review":"Very good movie with decent action sequences . The motorcycle chase was the highlight of the movie.Some of attempts to interweave the Jason Bourne storyline were choppy and detracted from the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's was ok","review":"It was ok and merging the jason bourne to this one was good however .....the idea behind it to get a virus and them being chased.I didn't get the same intensity as the other bournes. Good but average good."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have stopped where the books ended....","review":"Neither my husband or I enjoyed this movie, and we loved the first three of the series. The storyline was not cohesive and seemed much more 'evil' than the previous movies. I've talked to others who enjoyed it but we did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was a let down.","review":"I didn't think it lived up to the Bourne Series. I like both of the actors but I think the script was poorly written. Jumping on rooftops was on the Bourne Ultimatum. Not very original. I actually found it a little boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really that good","review":"This was a typical bond style movie, or worse. It's plot twists were predicable, the action senses were below average, but wait there's more he has two genes altered so he can do anything. Let the adventure begin, wow. How is it that you can shoot rockets, machine guns, grenades, etc and they never seem to die.We need new writers in Hollywood.It is a good movie for a time waster so rentable, but not buyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital copy trouble","review":"I loved the movie, so this is not a review of content, but form: I've been trying for an hour to redeem the digital copy for Amazon Instant Video, and the Universal site absolutely is not working. Disappointing, because I stream movies more often than not - use discs for extras. Much prefer the physical digital copy we used to get in combo packs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"The Bourne Knockoff\\"","review":"The movie literally was like watching a lame Chinese copy of Bourne. The pacing was extremely off. Tony Gilroy, the same person that directed Michael Clayton, directed this film. Trust me, it felt like you are watching Michael Clayton, if you've ever seen it. As typical with indie directors that cannot make action films, the action scenes were very amateur and poorly executed. I'm quite sure this was not the movie Universal was expecting. It honestly felt like an arthouse film. It could have been saved with massive editing. Honestly, I can't ever recommend watching this film. The acting was superb, I will let that be clear. However, this should have had the Bourne name taken off. It's a disgrace to the franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was way too long","review":"This movie was a huge disappointment. It was just a rip off of the earlier Jason Bourne movies which I enjoyed. There wasn't much plot or suspense, but plenty of ridiculous chase scenes. The motorcycle chase at the end lasted forever. So did the movie which ran two and a half hours.Jason Bourne is referred to, but this plot had nothing whatsoever to do with him. A new agent Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner) is introduced. When the scientific research supporting genetic testing on agents is discontinued, everyone on the project must be eliminated.I guess they tied this movie to the popular Bourne movies to pull people in. That's not a good idea if they ever intend to do another real Jason Bourne film."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(i(!0),a(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(i(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),a("span",M,"Loading...")):(i(),a("span",N,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(B,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-e2e46ff7"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/26.md","filePath":"quotesmag/26.md"}'),R={name:"quotesmag/26.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(i(),a("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
