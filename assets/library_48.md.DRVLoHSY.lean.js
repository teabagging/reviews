Marlena and Winston prove that love does indeed light the way home. I was drawn into this story from the first page, and by the last, I was wiping tears from my eyes. Marlena and Winston are a dynamic, engaging, very real couple who faced real problems (a snob of a mother being only one of them). I especially enjoyed the fact that Winston and Marlena weren't described as classically good-looking; all their attractiveness and love for each other came from who they were inside and from the obstacles they overcame to be together.What I loved best about this story was the central couple's interaction with Cheryl and Marty, as well as with Patrice and Raymond. I hope that Ms. Benson is planning another story so that I can find out what happened with them. The genuine caring and concern among the three couples was something I don't often see in romance novels.Excellent job, Ms. Benson! I look forward to your next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll come home to Winston!","review":"This was my first book by Benson and it was great! I enjoyed the story a lot.

I bought this item at a great price just as they were being marked down (waited for two years for the price to come down). Albeit Barcana makes a great product, Amazon can only seem to be able to deliver half a tree (ships in two boxes due to size/weight). I called customer service and the nice gentleman courteously explained that he would re-submit my order, and sure enough another box arrives with half a tree. Seems logical that I would be content now, but all I have is the bottom half of two expensive trees without a stand or the top. Called customer service again and they gave me a refund. Customer service was really courteous, but the guys in the warehouse see a product number on a box and send it....

To be realistic anything bigger than this keyboard keys is an old type computer and i dont know how you could fit it to keyboard trays. For me size of the keys are perfect. One bad thing about the keyboard is the Caps Lock and Function lock indicators are not on the keyboard but instead on the IR Receiver station. And hence mouse dont have a docking station for recharging. Quite acceptable due to lower series compared to LX 700. Overall keyboard is very nicely build and as always superb 0 degrees tilt.

What i do like about it, is the application switch button between the primary and secondary buttons, it's customizable so you can use it as any shortcut with ease.The main selling point of this combo however is the keyboard. It's comfy and all the shortcut keys make life really easy. I love the fact that you can customize every key so that's a major plus. On the other hand though, because there are a ton of shortcuts it may take some time to actually remember them all. i really like the media controls, previous keyboards i've had they seem to only work with Windows Media Player, however i've customized it so that i can use it for Winamp so it fast and effient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cordless keyboard LX500","review":"I had worried about mouse response time as well as battery lasting time in placing an order on this item.But quite satisfied with both on my worries.Greater keyboard with mouse than what I have ever used.I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This is a good combo.

After receiving no replies to our contacts to Rival (2 to the 800 number and 1 via email), we tossed it and replaced it with another, more expensive brand.

Imagine that!This is a must-have book for all current Defenders of the Christian Faith. Though we have evolved into a more organized movement now within the hispanic community, this book will give us all an impression of Dr. Winrod's legacy.From it's early imceptions into the Creation vs. Evolution debate, to our now thriving movement, many have been at the forefront of this tremendous movement.

For new readers they could care less because there is no backstory or build-up to this momentous event. I myself know very little of Gwen, only that she is Peter's first love and got this book because I was curious how she died from reading Loeb's Blue which is the way that should've been done - build-up, and then emotional moment. The art is dated, but it's nice to see the way comics looked back then. I actually prefer it over the new glossed up, gradient treatments of today's comics. These drawings are masterfully drawn, and not so complicated that it still allows some imagination to what they would look if they were human. Also, reading this book, you will see where Spider-Man, the movie, based a lot of its scenes from - almost frame by frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marvel at its lowest","review":"Awful. Such a waste! The story is stupid, tragic for tragic's sake, nothing makes sense, Gwen get killed and the reader is made to feel he couldn't care less. To make matters worse, this is not a complete sequence run, there are episodes missing in the middle, which makes it all look even more childish. At first, I thought I was reading a spoof. On top of that, the color printing is terrible: They took the original colors, a very good idea by itself. But by printing them heavely on this totally different type of paper than the original comic-book paper, they made a garish crying pizza of tints.Did the other reviewers who gave more stars to this disaster ever read other, good Marvel comics? how such a fine and clever artist like Gil Kane landed in such a mess?

It goes on pretty easily once you get used to how much you have to stretch it (basically the whole camera goes in thru the opening for the LCD display). With a little adjusting, the openings in the skin perfectly match the lens, flash, and other spots on the camera. It really does make the camera easier to hold onto, and although it covers the buttons, they're still easy enough to operate.Minuses: It gets a little annoying if you often change the battery (as we did on a recent vacation -- each day we swapped batteries between the camera and the charger) or memory card. A nice thing about a waterproof camera -- you can just keep it in your pocket while swimming, but the skin makes it harder to slip in and out of a pocket (which could be a plus, also).

PIA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Luscious pictures","review":"This is to rebut the previous review. Based on that review, I scanned our library copy carefully before checking it out. I found the book delightful and immediately shared it with my children. Some of the \\"objectionable\\" pictures are subjectively interepreted--for instance, where the previous reviewer saw an insane man dressed as batman, I merely saw as Batman himself (supported by the fact that if one looks carefully at the pictures, you can also find Little Red Riding Hood and Mary Poppins). I found the nude beach (less than one inch square) but completely missed the \\"children spying on naked people.\\" The ghosts are teeny and cute. And so on. My children loved looking for the common elements in each beautiful picture. As in any book, look it over yourself and decide if you want your kids to see it. There ARE three or four impaled men in one scene, though, like every other element they are very small. I felt that these tiny images did not detract from a beautiful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favourite baby book!!!","review":"this book is my favorite book to watch with my one and a half year old daughter. everytime we turn the page she points at the yellow ballon and makes a funny sound. she can also show many other things like vulcano, plane ... many more. with this book you can teach your child the whole world and explain a lot of things about the earth. it's fun to watch for adults as well. GREAT JOB done by the artist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely inappropriate for young children.","review":"I would strongly urge any parent not to let your child read this book. I took my 5 year old son to the library today and found this in his pile when we got home. Looking very innocent at first I had fun finding the yellow balloon until I took a closer look. There ARE witches flying around and then burning something, images of a person lying in the street injured after falling off his bike, a funeral happening where people are carrying the casket, a medieval fight happening where one man is lying on the ground bleeding, not to mention the nude beach scene where you can see nipples and pubic hair drawn in. So many injured people (a plane crash with no help in sight), scary ghosts, and people being chased by wild animals is enough to make me take this book back to the library and never check it out again. This is the first review I've written on a book but I felt so strongly about it that I wanted to deter any parent from getting this for a child of any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drunks, Prostitutes, and Naked People?","review":"I too was at first charmed by the lovely style of painting, and the joy my 3-year-old takes in searching for things in pictures. Then I started to REALLY LOOK. I don't mind Batmen and fairy tale characters (including witches, etc.), but this book really crossed the line of (not so) common decency. This is the first time I've been moved to write a review (and we've read a LOT of books!!). I wouldn't even buy this book for a grownup!!!!

There were only about 12 people there, but they played like it was a packed stadium. The CD is great. The combination between the bass, sax, guitar, and drums is awe-inspiring--they truly deserve more press than they get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to modern settings!","review":"I read this book because I've read other works by Patricia Cabot (who also writes under the names of Meg Cabot, Meggin Cabot, and Jenny Carroll). I like most of her other work but this book irritated me because the historical detail was just so poorly researched. No one in England (particularly in the nineteenth century) would say \\"school\\" when they meant \\"university\\" (for Oxford, \\"college\\" would be the only appropriate term). Nor would an English person talk about \\"fall\\" when they meant \\"autumn\\". Nitpicky perhaps but these and dozens of other errors really spoilt my enjoyment of the book. If Ms Cabot is going to write in historical settings she should do some research - or stick to modern settings, where she does shine. If you like historical accuracy in your historical romance, try someone else, like Barbara Hambly."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Man's Meat ...","review":"There had been a struggle inside me before I wrote this review. I thought I couldn't misss when I saw so many people raving about it. I'm actually afraid to state my own view after reading. Is there something wrong with me or what?

When she discovers her fiance in a compromising position with another woman, she is at a loss to understand what this other woman has that she doesn't. Not wanting to be the kind of wife that drives her husband to have a mistress, she hatches a scheme to hire Braden Granville to teach her \\"how to make love.\\" She means these lessons to be rather theoretical, which is evidenced by her intention to take notes. However, Braden decides to teach her through a more hands-on technique.The characters are quickly drawn and lively. The first scene will quickly give you a sense of the logical way that Caroline's mind works. Braden is a bit more gossipy with his lower class companions than I would have expected, but it's a minor flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad digital copy.","review":"I am not very far into the Kindle version of this book and it is not good.

I found this book to be repetitive and boring - essentially the message is \\"Don't push too hard and let your children have fun.\\" and that is all that is contained in the book. This message is repeated over and over with slightly different wording. No specific information such as pitch counts by age, expected specific sports skills by age, differences between recreational, club, and elite sports, etc. Also, the author is a distributor of Juice Plus, which he (subtly) uses his book to sell. I purchased my copy from the American Academy of Pediatrics and am thinking of demanding a refund.

She needs to be carefull, because a couple of art dealers also want this bible and a group of four friends have a sixty year old bill to settle with Clara's grandfather.A great book about archeology, religion, war, art smuggle, greed and revenge. A look in the simple and everyday life in Irak and the luxury life of millionaires in the United States and Egypt. On the one hand you have the simple people who want to find the Bible for religious and archeological causes, on the other hand the terrifying, bloodthirsty criminals who will do everything to get their hands in the Bible. An incredible page turner !"},{"rating":"1","title":"mmm....","review":"I expected so much more from this book, especially after the Author previous one \\"The Brotherhood of the holy shroud\\".

I did thaqt with only 3 movies as a kid, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Beetlejuice. When I bought this album, I originally bought it just for the songs by Harry Belafonte, but the more and more I listen to this album, the more I begin to listen to the expertise of conductor Danny Elfman. While listening, you can't help but replay the movie in your head. This album is just one of many great compositions by the genius Danny Elfman. This is an album for those who love the movie, who love Danny Elfman, and/or people who have had some kind of crazy messed up childhood memories like my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elfman at his best, plus Belefonte!","review":"Great compositions by one of the best in the business, Danny Elfman when he was fresh out of his band \\"Oingo Boingo.\\" All the interesting and dark twists and turns you'd expect from Elfman.

This bouncy theme for the dead is undeniably outstanding. Dark and fun all at once, which is the thing that makes most of his themes so great. Haunting and curious are words that describe \\"Beetlejuice\\". Elfman's score fits the prankish spook like an old pair of jeans. If you are a fan of \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" or \\"Mars Attacks!\\" this soundtrack is for you.

It's interesting to see her making the transition from her sultry and nuanced \\"Saxuality\\" to the straight-up dance jazz of \\"What Does It Take\\". This CD lacks the coherence of her earlier and later albums, as if Candy were suffering from artistic growing pains. Happily, all turned out well in the end for her, but this particular album is too unfocused to really make an impression. Furthermore, some of the songs were jarring and gave me headaches.You won't be sorry buying any of Ms. Dulfer's other work, but I just don't have it in me to recommend this one, even to diehard fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Candy's Best Studio CD","review":"This is probably Candy Dulfer's best studio recordings. My personal favorite is \\"Gititon\\", a very funky composition. However, to truly appreciate Candy, you need to see/hear her live. Unfortunately, her best CD, \\"Live in Amsterdam\\", is not (yet) available in the U.S. Listening to her playing live shows that she is more than just a (very) pretty face. For instance, the studio recording of \\"For the Love of You\\" is good, but the live version featuring Angie Stone is outstanding.

It uses NICD batteries which should have been a red flag, but thank God I purchased the extended warranty from Best Buy. After trying to live with it for about a year, I have exchanged it for an AT&T; 5.8, of course made by VTECH, but I have not problem with that.In my opinion,Panasonic rushed to the market with 5.8, and really turned out a crappy product.

Even worse, the missing parts can be ordered only from Panasonic (Radio Shack will not know what you are talking about) for $30+ including shipping and handling. In early May, 2004 they are BACK ORDERED for over a month!The problem is that the base unit only has two ports for telephone cords. If you have two two-line telephone jacks in the wall, you are ok. If you have four wall jacks you will need two KX-J24 T-Adaptors plus two 2 wire telephone line cords. The T adaptors are available only from Panasonic. On May 3,2004 these were back ordered until June 6, 2004.This phone looks nice sitting on my desk, but until the parts arrive, it is only a two line phone.This is unacceptable -- a $500 piece of equipment that requires unusual adaptors that are not readily available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I bought this phone after reading all the reviews including someone who used it in their barn.

I have 2 older Panasonic 900Mhz cordless phones, a KX-TCS970 (6 years old) and a KX-TC1801 (3 years old). Both of these older models are better cordless telephones in terms of general reception quality and the distance you can travel from the base and maintain acceptable sound quality and contact. I called Panasonic, and all they suggested is changing the 'Line Mode' from 'B' to 'A' (whatever that means!) ... unfortunately, it made no discernable difference. Other concerns include bulky handsets, and the handset 'Booster' feature must be turned on each time you picked up the remote handset."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for less than a year?!","review":"I like how the phone functions, it was working lovely...

This started to occur almost simultaneously on both handsets after about 6 to 8 months. I'm finding the range to be poor. As soon as I go outside my house and turn a corner away from the base unit, the call drops. The volume is also rather low...people I'm talking to wonder if I'm talking into the phone or not (I guess this is a mic and not volume problem?) and even at max volume, it's not really does not get as loud as one would expect.

Secondly (and it seems most people are having this problem) the batteries seem dead and calls cut out after about 1 min from both my handsets.....we had a Sony cordless for 9 years prior to that and the battery life was still fine.

I get a maximum 1.5 hours talk time now. Batteries are very expensive and not carried by my local retailers (Fry's, Circuit City, etc.) except for batteries plus ($18 each). Anyway after about 3 months batteries really start getting weak and deep discharging with long recharges does nothing, within about 4 months, you're down to 5-6 minutes of talk time.

That or they're throwing the handsets around, these are pieces of electronic equipment. And if you got a bad battery go to radio shack and get a new phone pack for $5.00, then complain to Panny and see if you get a refund.

Zebus and sisal rather than lemurs seem more relevant to her tale, until Prince Philip arrives and appears to shock an uncaring government that the country is committing ecological suicide.

I have showed it to a variety of people who all have different tastes in music, and everyone loves it. There is no way for me to describe how excellent this CD is. I have had it for 5 months now, listen to it faithfully, and am still not sick of it. To anyone who has come across this disc and is reading this review, BUY IT. You will not be sorry.

There is no redeeming value that I can find in this story. It was over 400 pages of filth, as far as I'm concerned. Though B. Keith Jones does have quite a way with words, and I must admit, one heck of a sense of humor, his attack on people of faith, and his attitudes on race were appalling to me. The 1 star I give this book is because the author does have a talent for writing, but he should choose his subject matter more wisely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive Kindle Pricing","review":"I would like to add this item to my library of information on Curacao, but %92.00 for a Kindle eBook is not only excessive, it's offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit boring","review":"This book bored me. It had too much politics in it and not enough passion. There wasn't enough dialogue between the two main characters. The main characters seemed wooden and there were too many family members which got really confusing, too many names had me going back to see which child belonged to who.Romance novels are supposed to centre around the main characters and to develope their relationship. This book centred around politics. A romance novel should make us want to be one of the characters. The reason I think we read these sorts of books is to escape reality for a few hours, to dream a little. This book depressed me. I would have hated to have been one of the characters. This book lacked humour, passion and emotion between the main characters and gave me a tension headache!Give this one a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good listen","review":"Wow - some mixed reviews here. Have to say if you are a fan of \\"the voice\\" you will be a fan of this. Great music to sing along to and a smooth voice singing it. If you want the originals, buy the originals! If you want a nice grouping with a superb voice, this is it.Look for a new group of R&B; covers with 3 new originals from Michael 3/11/8. \\"Soul Speak\\" has already charted 3 songs simultaneously on Billboard the first week of singles release so once again - you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rate!","review":"Michael McDonald has done good service to those artists whose songs he covered in this collection.

Michael has found a way. Use drum machines and bass sequencing so the music called soul has none at all. Michael, what were you thinking?

A BIG disapointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard better than this","review":"I bought the cd and played several times. It is already back to the cd cover.

If he had nothing but an empty coffee can as an accompaniment, the sound of this man's voice would still transport you. Magical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael McDonald Is A Mumbler!","review":"I do NOT understand why anyone would want to buy a Michael McDonald album. He claims to sing \\"blue eyed soul\\" but this album is without soul. The songs sound horrendous and seriously lack the heart that Benny Benjamin (original Motown drummer) and Jamie Jamerson (orginal Motown bassist)possessed as they have been replaced by sterile, souless drum and bass programming. What's worse is that Michael McDonald ALWAYS sings like he has cotton in his mouth, regardless of what album he records. His words are mumbled and NEVER clearly enunciated. This even goes back to his Doobie Brother days, a terrific rock and roll band he tried to push under the bus by trying to make it a R&B band. He was a square peg in a round hole. No wonder why Tom Johnston left. Michael McDonald does NOT sing, he mumbles and whoever gave him vocal lessons/coaching should be fired and spanked asap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motown memories!","review":"Michel McDonald has made a praising tribute respect three generations of the musical outburst from the middle sixties until the late seventies.Recorded in 2003, McDonald is very well aware the creative crisis that surrounds the musical ambiance since the last fifteen years at least.The fabulous arrangements, chorus and accompaniments make justice those pages who inflamed our emotive memory.Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Motown's Best","review":"Michael McDonald did justice to the great songs of the Motown era.

Then I heard he was touring and I had to see him. Well I saw him a few weeks ago at the Apollo Theater in Harlem..IT WAS THE BEST SHOW I HAVE EVER SEEN!! Did almost all the songs on the Motwon CD and his Doobie Brothers and solos hits, he was on stge about 2.5 hours and did three encours..the last song was White Christmas. When he sang \\"You are Everything\\" I had the chills run right through my body...you must see him live. As for the cd....I haven't taken it out of my cd player since the show>>> I'll be catching him in AC in March for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok ,but...","review":"Who mixed this thing?The bass mix is so bloated and overwhelming that it feels as if were mixed especially for those idiots with the $200 dollar cars and the $2000 dollar car dollar stereos.Less is more on these classics and whoever engineered and mixed this album should be buggered with a hot poker.If you want to listen to a great remake of those Motown classics ,try the soundtrack from The Commitments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mcdonald does not know Motown","review":"I have never been as disappointed in a CD as I am with this one.

It simply bears no resemblance to Motown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soul-Free.","review":"I'm a long time fan of McDonald - ever since he sang with Patrick Simmons on Little Feat's \\"Red Streamliner.\\" A big Motown fan, too. So why is this album so disappointing? It's inexcusably bland and soul-free; the cook has left the building. The exceptions? The songs that are not arranged by Climie and Baker. McDonald does a nice job arranging \\"Since I Lost My Baby.\\" \\"I'm Too High\\" is vibrant, with a tasty guitar solo by Larry Carlton and arranged by Bob James. Nicky Shaw relieves Climies' Lite-Rock-Less-Talk sensibility on \\"How Sweet It Is.\\" I can't believe that brilliant stylist McDonald can utterly waste such good material. Not worth it for a very few goodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"No soul nostalgia","review":"I guess that this had to come out.

I have always been a Michael McDonald fan but this just does nothing for me. I think maybe Clay has ruined it for me. I can no longer listen to singing that I can not hear the words to.

I would recommend Clay's single over this one any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This Really Necessary?","review":"Does the world really need Michael McDonald crooning songs that were already tired 20 years ago?

On \\"Motown\\", Michael McDonald pays tribute to these great songs with updated, yet true to the original arrangements and vocals. Standouts include \\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\\", \\"You Are Everything\\", \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered\\", and \\"Since I Lost My Baby\\". Production on this album is excellent as well. If your a fan of McDonald or Motown, or just want to hear great heartfelt music, pick this one up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ain't nothin' like the real thing","review":"the material covered in this album includes some of the greatest pop songs ever written, sung by a performer who is usually quite engaging. However, despite the slick production, this is an uninspired effort by michael mcdonald which lacks much of the emotion of the original songs. in addition, Mr. McDonald appears to have lost more than a few notes off the upper part of his vocal range. as a result, it is downright painful listening to him try to reach the upper registers on some of these songs. the idea behind this collection of songs is great so the poor execution is particularly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motown, Michael Mcdonald","review":"A bone chilling, one of a kind voice that takes me down memory lane.

Michael McDonald chose to go back to his roots. Having been a long time admire of Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye as well as other artists he seems to top the originals.Despite the fact that following the release of this album he had been ridiculed on TV (Family Guy), moviesThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (Unrated Full Screen Edition)and the popular Internet series Yacht Rock he doesn't seem to mind at all and that's why he did a second one. Don't let the cover fool you, there is an earlier American pressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dismal Disappointment","review":"I was so looking forward to hearing this CD, that is why I found it so disappointing. The vocals are contrived and the back up singing is so awful as to be amusing. The producer was trying his darndest to make this singer sound like he had a little soul. The whole thing reminds me of when they tried to \\"whiten up\\" Ray Charles in the 50's/60's with back-up singers and strings, only in the reverse. If you really want to enjoy this genre of music, buy a Marvin Gaye CD cause \\"A'int nothin' like the real thing, baby\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!!!!!!","review":"This is by far the worst album I have ever heard--period!!!!

I can't wait to hear a Volume II!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY???","review":"Wow, first Michael McDonald ruins the Doobie Brothers, and now he's ruining Motown. HE MUST BE STOPPED! It's one thing to try and cover classics songs, but if you're going to do it in such a generic way as Michael Mcdonald has, then you sir deserve to be drawn and quartered. I mean, C'MON! If you can listen to his \\"version\\" of the classic, \\"I Heard Through The Grapevine,\\" and NOT want to soil yourself, then it is time to consult your physician and drop the lithium dosage in half. I am so abhorred by this album, that it takes a concerted effort to not revert to personal attacks, because I'm THAT angry. I'd rather hear Ronald McDonald attempt to sing Motown before ever having to hear one note of Michael McDonald's elevator/Muzak cocktail ever, ever again. I give up. If you want to buy this album, no one can stop you, but I think we may have found the new Darwinian line-in-the-sand."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst albums I've ever heard","review":"How did this album, sorry, CD - showing my age - get nominated for two, count them two, Grammy's? This is an awful record.The songs are classics, even the musical arrangements are passable, but Michael's vocal stylings are horrendous. His voice has aged, and not well.I never thought these songs could be sung so poorly by what was once a decent singer. He seems to sound like a bad mix of Michael Bolton and Barry White with a bit of Tom Waits thrown in as a growl. A horrible mix for these wonderful sould sounds.Even my 6 year old daugter hated it.Please, don't submit to the temptation to buy this album it is simply awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't Nothin' Like the Real Thing!","review":"Why would anyone want to hear Michael McDonald sing Motown?Nothing compares to the performances of Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, etc.Motown is Funky.

Berry Gordy has achieved the ultimate goal. Motown has truly been assimilated into the collective consciousness of the pop music fans everywhere. The success of Mike's record irrefutably proves this. Instead of over-the-hill recording artists doing remakes of classic tunes like 'Misty', 'Girl from Ipanaema', and 'Autumn Leaves', now they're doing(or undoing, depending on your point of view) Motown standards. And just as they hacked-up and otherwise massacred those classic tunes, they'll surely do likewise to songs like 'My Girl' and 'Superstition'. Watered-down and devoid of any inkling of emotion, soulfullness or funkativity. Elevator-ready, if you will. But of course, in the eyes of the music industry big-wigs, its really more about money than art, isn't it? Long live Motown. Look out Hip-Hop! 'Rapper's Delight' and 'The Message' are next on the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Soul","review":"Terrible remakes of Motown Classics. The band sounds terrible and the Mix is amaturish.

And then Michael Mcdonald came on a telephone commercial one day singing a few of these songs and I was automatically hooked to his style. Once I saw on the bottom of the screen that he had an album out, I knew I had to get it. His voice is so unique that its insane. It's nice to hear a singer who isn't like all of the American Idol type voices out there. This type of music wouldnt usually be something that I would listen to, but Michael Mcdonald has changed all of that with this amazing album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A NEW GENERATION OF CLASS","review":"I BOUGHT THE CD AND I LOVE EVERY THING ABOUT IT. HE IS A MASTER AT HIS CRAFT. I LOVE HIS VOICE, THE WAY HE LOOKS, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. FOR THE REVIEWER THAT PLAYED THE \\"RACE CARD\\", I THINK HE IS A RACIST HIMSELF. NO ONE SAYS A THING WHEN BLACKS COVER SONGS THAT HAVE BEEN TRADITIONALLY DONE BY NON BLACKS. I THINK THE MAN HAS JUST AS MUCH SOUL AS ANY OF THE ORIGINAL ARTIST.

He definately puts his own touch to each song to give it a whole new sound. This is the type of music that needs to be played and promoted on the radio instead of the \\"GARBAGE\\" that we now call music.

Motown also shares blame for this disaster, as now NO mountain is high enough to keep \\"Coors\\" or \\"MCI\\" or whomever chooses to soil Marvin and Tammi's...or Ashford and Simpson's...or even my memories, from doing so. Having had to sit and listen to this in a car in which I was a passenger, I can now say that Michael holds a place in my heart along with Kenny G, Rod Stewart, and Astrud.

In Florida, you get a lot of trails with sugar sand, and when you ride on the sides of the trails to avoid them, there are usually thorny plants. It's a lose/lose situation. There was a period where I would average at least one flat tire after a training session or race event. Then I tried these tire liners. They added weight to my wheels, but it wasn't significant, since most of my riding was off-road, where the terrain was the number one factor in slowing you down. It probably cut down my flat tires by half. I still had them because the thorns were still able to get to the areas that were not covered by these liners. These liners aren't very wide to cover a tire that is rated to be 2.35\\". They do the job, no doubt, but it still was not the solution to all flats. I'm currently trying a set of kevlar tires, which have been holding up without a flat so far (crosses fingers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far, So Good... ;-)","review":"I've been riding on these tire liners for about two weeks now.

Also, the price that this is offered at is high, but this may be because the light uses an expensive li-ion battery.

Within that distance the book (a joint effort published by the Garrett County Historical Society) lists and describes about 30 coal towns, most of which are ghosts or barely still in existence. A few places such as Kitzmiller and Bayard are still very much alive and even support post offices yet. The most interesting feature of the book is the inclusion of a large number of photographs and postcards of most of the towns - some of them taken shortly after one or another of the numerous floods that occur along this mountainous stretch of Potomac River. These coal towns seem gritty and fragile places, though stubborn in their existence: many of them could only be entered or left via the railroad.

I loaded maps from Utah, Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming into approximately 25 mb. Using a 12 volt power cable from a previous IIPlus, the unit performed exceptionally. The ability to customize most of the screens and then change the display order of these screens allows the user to have complete control of the display.

It's absolutely amazing, and it's fast. No complaints about the hardware at all, and that was the end of the story I'd give this a 5 star rating. Unfortunately, I have to deduct one major point since Garmin units still are not compatible with the Mac / Mac OS X. There's no way to interface with the GPS units and upload maps on a Mac. You can try to use VirtualPC, but it's very flakey, and it only works if you can boot your old Mac into OS 9. On OS X, the connection doesn't work for more than a few seconds. Using a serial to USB converter cable with VirtualPC on OS 9 will work most of the time, however, the transfer speeds are horribly low. It can take 3-10 *hours* to upload map data to your unit, and half of the time it'll get an error a few hours into it, causing you to have to start over.

The 4-way toggle button is a welcome improvement over the Vista click-stick, being both easier to operate and more precise.

I live in Costa Rica, and I have uploaded all Costa Rica's standard 1:50.000 base maps. The amount of memory is enough, unless you want to upload bigger areas.Most of the time I use it with an external antenna, especially if I'm in the car, so the gps can be anywhere and still receive a good siganl.I use this unit not only for geocaching and driving, but also for working purposes, good and simple data collection, with proper configuration the download of waypoints and POIs is acceptable.Finally, I recommend this unit for the Serious GPS enthusiast or for the hard working geographer whos requirements are meet by this units capabilities (WAAS, waterproof, altimeter, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"GPS Review","review":"I received the Garmin GPSMap 60CS about a week before leaving for a short vacation trip to Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Michelle Tumes has more talent in her pinky than most of the pre-packaged artists with albums on Billboard's top 200 list, but few people will hear this album and it won't get mainstream airplay because it deals with spiritual issues.

Even with a focus on keyboards, piano and strings, pianist and vocalist Michelle Tumes' debut album is pop radio ready, but not overtly so. \\"Feel\\" is a masterful call to accept your feelings, not to think that being Holy Spirit filled means being stoic. And the Chronicles of Narnia inspired \\"Untamed Lion\\" presents a very different picture of Christ. The first radio single \\"Please Come Back\\" is very unusual in its instrumentation, yet quite accessible. I think my favorite song would be \\"Life is Beautiful\\" a piano and cello ballad that focuses on the important things in life, love and friendship, and how life really is beautiful.Bottom Line: A heartfelt, ballad filled, Enya-channeling, beautiful debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Enya Fans","review":"For lovers of the ethereal Northern European sound. Michelle Tumes seems to have has two musical personalities, this earlier one which seems mainly inspired by Enya and her later rock style which seems to owe a good deal to Rebecca St. James. Good of its kind, lushly arranged, and definitely Christian which is why I bought it, yet this collection lacks strong lyrics. I heartily recommend \\"Listen\\" as background music for reading, meditating, prayer -- very mellow and serene -- but the lyrics are not strong enough for close listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how music sounds in Heaven.","review":"Michelle Tumes has spent time with God. Only He could give her the ability to produce such breath taking music. Fans of Enya will really enjoy this CD.

If you need a Concrete Blonde fix, but own all the other stuff, you'd do much better to pick up Pretty & Twisted(A Johnette project that is very worthwhile). I tried this one out for a while, but could never get into it. I ended up givimg it away. Johnette is too talented to give up on, but who among us is perfect? I don't know if she's lost the passion or if it just took a holiday on this one. I strongly suspect the latteer. It's not just the vocals; the music is flat too.

They came in a heavy-duty card-board box. The box was a tad beaten up when they arrived, but the rotors are not easy to damage. It took me about 2hrs to do the job myself, not having any prior experience.

How great most of them were, filled with passion, suspense, drama and glitz? Well, after watching this first adaption in ten years, I sure felt nostalgic for THOSE days! Melissa Gilbert, looking like she has had way too much plastic surgery, tries to act and sound (not even close) like a Frenchwoman mourning the loss of her husband and son. All she has left is an annoying daughter named \\"Pip\\" (no comment) and a dog called Mousse (double no comment). Well, she ends up meeting a bland guy (Brad Johnson) and they fall in love, against all odds. End of story. Really, because the acting, good pacing, spark and emotion are all non-existent. Plot devices thrown in for no good reason. Zero chemistry between any of the actors. And the intro by Danielle Steel was really odd. A huge disappointment, obviously slapped together in about 5 minutes.

When her daughter befriends a divorced artist, they form an unlikely friendship which turns to romance.I had a difficult time refraining from wincing from Glbert's atrocious accent, which brings the film down a notch or two. The performances overall are okay, but the story is entirely too predictable. There was more chemistry between the daughter and the love interest - I just didn't get the feel that these two suddenly became soul mates. Gilbert's accent was just so distracting and annoying; the only actress to pull off a worse accent is perhaps Jennifer Love Hewitt in \\"The Truth About Love\\" which is another must miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, this is a waste of time & effort","review":"I like Melissa Gilbert, but who in their right mind had her do a French accent in this movie, which does not have a bad storyline (typical Danielle Steele, though, someone has died........) but this movie is a waste of time and not at all worth the money. I will be selling mine or giving it to someone who wants to watch a dull romance story. Melissa is such a great actress, Michael Landon would be a bit nauseated watching this, after all the wonderful coaching he did when Little House was in production. What a shame, this could have been a better movie with a little effort, but falls so short. I would recommend Danielle's PALOMINO or THE PROMISE , both great novels and pretty good romance movies.

At one point poor Bianca points out that the queen is the strongest piece, and Fritz makes a comment about his mother chewing out his father. The tone and context are extremely anti-woman, in my opinion. He also counters by saying that boys are smarter.It seems like the makers of this game were really threatened by the fact that you have to call the most powerful piece \\"she\\". To take the queen down a notch, they refer to a group or queens as a harem. To demonstrate how this powerful piece moves they have the queen run around picking flowers as fast as she can.

The book is thick with atmosphere and envelopes the reader in another age showing what it must have felt like to live with a genius, at the time of the Plague, and submerged in religious bigotry. It also artfully weaves into the story the feelings of a good woman as she copes with her love, her passions, people, misunderstanding, prayer and fears.

Woods is, among other things, a researcher. This is not apparent from reading this book.I was not expecting a literary classic but at least some accuracy would have been nice.Much of the book reads like bad fanfiction. The author introduces a Jason Voorhees who is willing to follow the requests of someone other than his mother. Jason also uses a hunting rifle as a hunting rifle rather than a club or spear. The poor mischaracterization of the main character stands as the most glaring error in the book.This is not the only error in the book however. The author also introduces a laser pointer with the ability to burn flesh, a .48 caliber handgun, and a pump-action double-barreled shotgun.The ending of the book is forced and makes little sense. It reads as though the author was told to hurry and decided to kill several characters out of spite.Waste of money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"What lerks below the lake?","review":"Paul A.

I used a third and tried it once again, grabbing the neck of the bottle for better leverage and pressed slooooowly this time and just bent the metal. The force you need to apply to get these things to seal is too much for what ever metal they used. I have 3 of the older style ones called \\"Zyliss leak-proof bottle stopper\\" and they work great.

Everything about my personality,abilities and temperment run up against the writers narrow view of what a woman \\"should\\" be. If you are a woman with a strong personality,a sexual being and able to do higher maths..you might not want to read this book because it is sure to make you want to hate every fundamentalist you have ever met.I don't go around hating people but this group of Christian sect is so sexist and generalistic that it makes one want to become anything they don't want you to be!

I know that I had every means of pursuing and achieving what most women of this age strive for, but I chose not to. I never felt comfortable with it bc I never felt it was God's role for me in His perfect plan for creation. This book has been incredible in reinforcing in me the importance and JOY of biblical femininity. Role are NOT unequal, both sexes are equally precious in God's eyes, but God has made us DIFFERENT for a REASON. If this was not the case, why would God have needed to make us different at all? Why would Adam need a 'helper suitable for Him'? This book was amazing and uncompromising in the message that is sorely needed in the world today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning to be woman of God...","review":"The book \\"Let me be a Woman\\" by Elisabeth Elliot is a biblical revelation for Christian woman. The author states, very humbly, her convictions which are scripturally correct and completely in-line with the word of God. It exposes the lies woman of the Church have allowed the world fool them with. The book explains how woman are to be submissive first unto God and secondly unto to their husbands.It is not demeaning towards woman or in any way old-fashioned. Elliot herself is an example of proverbs 31 woman. She is not a weak woman, but rather a strong outspoken Christian woman. She admonishes woman with tenderness and love behind each word.I cannot recommend a better book for woman who are truly seeking God, and honestly wiling to give him their all."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a whole lot better than legion 1.06b","review":"dont waste you time or money on this. wait for TOTAL WAR: ROMEto come out.

As a native San Diegan that recently relocated to Texas, I was starved not only for the sand, the sea air, the water and the waves, but also for the entire experience of sitting on the beach and absorbing the sights around me. Farber's book perfectly captures the entire experience with exquisite photography complemented by a collection of thoughts and reflections on \\"the sea\\" by various famous people of our time. With this book, I felt that I was sitting on the seashore and sharing my impressions and thoughts with another person who held the same admiration for the sea and the beach.

Beyond Repair and then the two EPS afterwards were NOTHING like the music scene at the time. Pure Originality. The production was heavy, the screaming was ridiculously crazy, and the shows were killer. NOW, with Haymaker I rate them as the worst band on the planet. They are a modern day Metallica, hungry for money and publicity. They even had an interview with Hot Topic. MTV is next!!! The new cd is not heavy at all compared to their older stuff. The bass is turned down, the drums are slowed to a crawl...Oh yeah, and the new vocals suck. Cliche. Hatebreed anyone? Bring back the old singer. Is there anything not wrong with this album? THeir live shows are awesome. It still can't hide the fact their music now sucks.

It seemed like every other word in the songs are F$%*. It sounded like they tried to damn hard to impress the youth by doing this. The cd held nothing speical at all, not what I really wanted to hear in a metal cd. If you want really inspiring music go and listen to a Hatebreed cd. This cd is alright, but the swearing was so stupid and out of place. HA! Thats what I meant to say, the swearing just seemed random and out of place. Thats what the problem with the cd was.

Rather, it was intended to be a teaching aide for those trying to become more Christ-like. If you are a secularist looking for an academic perspective on Paul, you should look somewhere else for info. That is not the author's aim because it does not further one's effort to become more in God's image. What you get in this book is glimpses into Paul's life and how they can be applied to the struggles the reader is dealing with on a daily basis. With that in mind, you should get the book for what it is and not what you hope. It is simply unfair to apply standards to a product when the item was not intended to that group.

However, getting it on the bike is too time-consuming to be useful to me. You have to remove both straps with a tool to be able to attach it to the clip on your handlebars. When you're ready to run again, you have to reattach the watch straps again. It took me about a minute to do this each time. I had assumed I could just attach the watch without removing the straps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forerunner Quick Release Kit","review":"I purchased this kit to allow me to transfer my garmin from run to bike during Triathlon training and race. It works great much easier that the runner band that comes on the watch by default. Easy to snap in and out.

The product comes with a sprung plastic holder which is then sewn into a velcro strap. The main issue I have is that the Velcro strap is too rigid and too small for a mans wrist (unless you are a skinny guy!). The other thing that I don't like is the mounting option to go on the bicycle as the clip can possibly spring the watch out of it's cradle if one goes over a bump. I have a Polar HRM and they have a simpler and better solution. They used the watch's strap (the normal strap that you use around your wrist) and add a cradle to the bicycle that makes the circumference adequate that one can secure the strap as normal. Very simple, very effective and cheap. No 'over engineered' solutions! It looks like Garmin didn't allow someone to do a reality check before commissioning this product and allowed Engineering to design whatever they thought was cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"It did exactly what I needed - allowed me to connect my Forerunner to my bike. It installs fairly easily and the Forerunner clips in/out fairly nicely. Even after a 25 mph crash in a race, it held tight. It's nice that it comes with extra pins in case some are lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it just to get rid of the cheesey plastic strap that came on your Forerunner","review":"If I had known how much better I'd like the flexible velcro strap than the cheesey plastic strap that comes on the Forerunner, I'd have bought this product long before I ever decided to try the Forerunner on my bike. The plastic strap that comes with the Forerunner was always a little too loose or a little too tight, and when you sweat on it it gets slimey and slides around all over the place. But this velcro strap is infinitely adjustable and sits nicely against the skin without chaffing or sliding. I just used it for a marathon and it \\"disappeared\\" in use and became invisible to me, just as you want your equipment to do in that situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"I thought the quick release was a great idea-- easy to move my GPS from bike to wrist. But I lost my GPS receiver the second time I used the wrist strap. It just fell off from the strap, and I didn't realize it. As soon as I did, I went back to find it, but it was gone. Garmin wasn't sympathetic, not that I expected much from them, and I had to buy my forerunner again. $300 down the drain, all because a faulty quick release design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not secure enough!!","review":"I bought this kit after reading positive reviews about it, and in fact was happilly using it for 6 months. That is until my Garmin FELL OFF the wristrap during a city run. I didn't notice it until a while later, so have clearly lost the unit. Good idea, but in my experience the mount is not secure enough to use with a $200+ piece of equipment!!! An expensive mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very expensive wrist band with no watch - get the mount instead","review":"I loved this for about 3 months of Ironman training until I was running in the Houston marathon and realized my expensive GPS and Heart Rate training device had suddenly and silently transformed into a VERY expensive piece of plastic and velcro. Needless to say, my Garmin was gone. I highly recommend buying the bike mount instead of this. Takes about 10 seconds during your T2 to get it off and then I just strap it to my wrist once I start running. (The time it takes to put on the bike doesn't matter because even the 310's aren't good in the water, so my Garmin starts out on the bike and a $20 watch from target times my swim and then gets left in T1) Avoid losing your Garmin and don't buy the quick release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works OK, but not on rough roads","review":"I got the quick release kit several months ago, and have been using it with no problems until today. I found out that even if the GPS is securely attached to the mounting bracket, it can come loose on rough roads. I hit a bump on my ride today, and my $200 GPS went sailing. I checked before I left to ensure that the unit was securely fastened in the bracket, and it was. Luckily I found my GPS and it survived, but others may not be so lucky. That's a lot of money to trust to a bracket that's not 100% secure. Keep on the bike paths or smooth roads, and you may be alright, but I no longer trust my kit and have removed it from my bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs as advertised","review":"Liked the product so much that I bought two, one for my road bike and one for my mountain bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works For Me","review":"I like the Velcro strap and how easy it was to install it on my bike.Some small downsides: Sometimes it takes me a little while to get the Garmin out of the clips and I lost my first pin after 2 weeks.

I guess they know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Efficient","review":"I ordered this product with the FR305 and the speed cadence sensor : it is just simply working fine. I gave only 4 stars because the strap is too short to wrap around a ski/snowboard suit. So I dismounted the whole thing, and sewed the clip to a longer strap I had kept from an old backpack. The result is not looking professional made, but it works, and now I know my snowboard speed is around 55 km/h in the first tests (after Sport tracks corrections : 62 became 55!)Then I ordered another one so I shall have one long and one short!Jocelyn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and easy","review":"The strap conversion was quick and easy.

It is real nice and the watch mounts to the wrist strap and the bike easily and securely.PROS:- It is more comfortable than the band that ships with the 305- The watch can be removed and added to the bike mount in seconds.CONS:- I can not slip the band around my hand with the strap in the buckle, so I have to feed it through which takes a few seconds. Triathletes may want to have it on prior to the race to avoid the few seconds it takes to put it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Accessory","review":"This is a great little accessory for the cost.

Looks like others were not so fortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a secure mount","review":"The mount is not a secure way to hold the GPS onto a bike.

The included wrist strap is comfortable, and I've had no problems running with it. I was a little worried at first that the Garmin could become dislodged from the plastic housing, but it's a very firm fit. The mount for the bike is a little flimsy and is only held on with zip ties. There's nothing from preventing it from rotating on the handlebar mount, so if you hit a bump you have to adjust it occasionally. This has been my only real complaint, and is the only thing keeping this product from getting 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin 205/305 quick release kit","review":"This product is a great add on to my Garmin 305.

All great.Except... when you look down to check your Garmin and IT ISN'T THERE!I had one issue with it popping out during a cyclocross race, but it was after a jump and I couldn't really fault it for that. On my last road ride, looked down during a hill sprint and it was just gone.My impression is that it bailed a little earlier when I hit a pothole.When all is said and done, this mount should be able to withstand a bump without the computer committing suicide.Don't buy if you want to keep your watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not perfected","review":"I use the 305 for off-road running/hiking, cycling and for paddling. The ability to quickly move from bike to foot and have the 305 on the handlebar is great. However, I was standing near the water and threw something. I didn't throw it very hard, but the 305 came off the mount and flew into the water. Since the 305 does not float, no more GPS. I have also had it come off from bumping into things, but for most people who probably just use it on the road, that may not be a big deal, so I am giving it 3 stars, even though for me I don't think the product will work at all.I am going to contact the manufacturer and if their response warrants it, I will amend this review.Edit -- no response whatsoever. Disappointing. Reduced my rating from 3 to 2 stars.2nd Edit -- After continued lack of response from manufacturer (not even courtesy of acknowledgement, let alone offer of assistance in replacing the gps unit), despite NUMEROUS others reporting the same fault, down to 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Accurate!

I found it extremely hard to relate to any of these guys, and didn't find any of their lives extremely interesting. I would hope that not too many young people just coming out really expect life to be like this. Every guy in this book is a beautiful, musclebound man who hops in and out of bed with different partners. *Yawn* The subplot with the mother and son (just coming out... and also a fabulous stripper) dating the same guy seems either ripped off or an homage to Gordon Merrick. Either way, it doesn't really work. The guy they both lust after is a creep of the highest degree.

Mr. Leddick should do more research and try to imbue his characters with more dimensions and distinct voices. I would suggest that he write porn instead, but even the sex scenes in the book are unrewarding, unerotic and unarousing. On the plus side, the guy on the cover is quite tasty and fortunately legal. Someone should just put together a coffee table book of covers of gay novels. I am sure that it would be more stimulating than a great deal of the novels themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Worst\\" Says It All","review":"I'm shocked by some of the praise reflected above and below for this extremely disappointing novel.The characters are wholly unbelievable, the plot strains for credibility from page 1, andworst of all-the dialogue is hopelessly dated. Teens use language that no '90s teen would ever use. \\"Humpy?\\" That sounds like mid-'70s gay queen (it's okay for me to say that, I'm gay!).This is a real downer of a book, all the way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"The perfect description of what the world thinks of gays","review":"Reading this book was a difficult experience. Being gay I have expereicned the huge amount of narcisism that is prevelant in the gay community. This book is the embodiment of that and even pushes the envelope even further.The story to me is entirely unbelievable. A man that is having sex with his mother's boyfriend? A boy that strips at 17? That get's picked up by a relative at the club? Please...One chapter began with a sequence I had to read twice. It involved ctiricism of people that are fat -- \\"fatties\\" -- Ugh. It is literature like this that gives people the reason to think that gay people really are like this.Avoid this book -- unless you are interested in soft erotica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, sexy, and too smart to be credible","review":"Perhaps there are 16-year-olds in Miami Beach who are as knowing and wise as Hugo (and his best male and female friends). It is pleasant to think so and to admire Hugo's management of family and future, despite playing with fire in the love and sex department. When does he have time to read Muriel Spark, Jean Rhys, and M. F. K. Fisher? Or to know of such 40s film stars as Betty Grable, Ray Milland, and Miriam Hopkins (but not Robert Taylor? )? (Hhis friends who are also supposed to be born around 1970 allude to Donna Reed and Dorothy Lamour!)The wrong (far older) universe of cultural allusions strains credulity, but the voice (Hugo's) is delightful, and the plot may be improbable but is not impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most accurate depiction of South Beach","review":"I came to Amazon to buy a copy of this book for a gift, and read some AWFUL reviews about it, and yet to MY view, there's no question that this is ABSOLUTELY the best book ever written about South Beach. OK, our main character Hugo is a bit \\"wise\\" for a 16-year-old, and his references, allusions, etc., are over the head of most kids his age today (or in '93 when this was written), but for quality of tone, an on-the-mark conceit about South Beach and characters that ring true for South Beach, no book written before or after this one comes close to capturing what the environment (and the people) are really like down here. And who says you have to \\"like the characters\\" to have a \\"good book\\"? Any of these reviewers ever read a guy named Shakespeare? I'll stick with Hugo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious treats","review":"This book is loaded with recipes for all kinds of baking, from hardtack to fancy layer cakes. It covers all the classics recipes from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Anyone familiar with baking from those countries will find thier favorites, and for those who are new to this region's baking plenty of delectable new discoveries are in store.Many recipes come with little stories and explanations about the traitions. The only thing I miss are photos, which make any cookbook even more tempting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great baking book","review":"I just picked this book up a few weeks ago and have already made several of the recipes in it. I'm impressed with everything. Clearly written, and I haven't had any recipe problems at all. Like other reviewers, I also enjoy and appreciate the short background she provides with the recipes - it's so enjoyable to think of these baked goods in context.I love the organization of the book - breads, sweet roll/coffee breads, cookies, savory things (filled pockets and pies, etc). It's a long, full book, with lots of recipes - it feels like a basic and yet comprehensive survey. There must be huge numbers of recipes and variations for all of these things, but at the same time, you feel that she hasn't probably left out anything that's important or commonly eaten. At any rate, I'm thrilled with the things I've made so far and look forward to trying even more of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very basic book","review":"There are much better books on buttrerfly gardening out there than this one - I recommend Butterfly Gardening by the Xerces Society. Its got not only the plants that butterflies like but also the lifecycle of butterflies. Creating A Butterfly Garden is like the hummingbird gardening book by the same author - very very basic with listings of plants and drawings of gardens but little more. You can get what's offered in these books off the internet. I ended up spending a little more to get a decent book that got me further below the surface and have a great butterfly garden going - variety is the key. The more kinds of flowers, the more kinds of butterflies. Its important to recognize that to have butterflies you need to have caterpillars too and they are fun to provide for and watch develop as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"WANT YOUR MONEY'S WORTH OUT OF YOUR GAME?

The template of his is always character-centered stories based on interesting dialogue and adventure. One will notice that he avoids dwelling into too much combat action where he could, most of his battles are fought before and after the actual bloodshed (which is in fact reality).However, the same format means BY NO MEANS the same book. In the Sapphire Rose he again introduces a new set of settings and satiric jokes.For those that like these types of books, they would enjoy every one of Eddings' books, for those that feel his books duplicate themselves (which I feel is really untrue), at least read a few of his works, and the Elenium + the Tamuli is a nice option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm","review":"What can i say, its a captivating story, it has humor. But i dont find the charakters welldone. The humor is in all the right places, AND all the wrong places, its everywhere. Because of this i got bloody tired of the book after reading half of it. And the humor never changes, therefor you dont get to experience feelings and emotions that are there. I cannot recomend this book. Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"It seems to be the same things as the other books...awesome!","review":"This book was really good. David Eddings' writing continues to impress my young mind. The only problem that I see with this is if you compare it to the Belgariad,then they're pretty much along the same lines. This book itself showed no hints of it being anything the same. Even though this was the first book I think it was the best one for the series since it showed no hint of similarities. As I sit in Sunday school I'm realizing what Eddings is REALLY doing though. In a subtle way he's adding speculations about religion. I noticed this during Sunday school when my teacher was talking to us"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much (supposedly) witty dialouge","review":"I really was looking forward to joining all the old characters from the Elenium and I brought this book the second it came onto the shelf. I was extremely dissapointed to find out that all the characters I had grown to love were gone. All replaced by a single person with a too sarcastic wit who was playing all of the main characters at the same time. There was never any tension in the story as it was always clear that our hero(s) would always outwit the stupid enemy while making fun of him at the same time. Sadly, I have not even considered picking up a David Eddings book since that day, and I would reccomend that if you like Eddings don't read this book; it may change your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same boring story, different land","review":"The first book of tamuli, already when I checked out the cover I had the strangest feeling that this wasn't going to be a great reading experience, and I was right. The hero group meet a few new friendly people which are the dullest characters since.....They crack a few EXTREMELY lame \\"jokes\\". And so on and so on. I think this is the strongest book of the tamuli, it is quite thrilling when you don't know how strong the enemy is, but that feeling didn't last long. I can only recommend this book to the fanatic Eddings fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Images....Old Fashioned","review":"Inspiring pages with lots of creative clip art and images. Definitely not contemporary though. The pages are very old fashioned and antique looking.

The release of the \\"Dream Factory\\" collection is a fine example. These films could have been photographed yesterday (\\"Summer Stock\\" is a pure delight to watch in terms of picture quality). \\"Barkleys of B'way\\" unfortnately does not live of to the exceptional quality acheived on other films of this genre.The DVD picture quality is very poor and dull and the sound is very muted. I was so dissappointed in this treatment. The DVD appears to have simply transfered the Video to DVD. No restoration to the picture is at all apparent. Even the trailer looks better than the movie.The extras are fine and I can't complain here but hey Warners, what were you thinking when you tackled this gem. Someone must have been taking a sickie!Sorry Fred and Ginger."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Those looking for the beautiful melodies and light-hearted gaity of the earlier Astiare/Rogers films will be disappointed with this glum reunion.

Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great musical!","review":"I highly recommend this musical. Fred Astaire andGinger Rogers are great in it.

In posters the word vintage can very well be a vanishing vista that cannotes something from the past. However, a very bad reproduction is a poor excuse to pretend that such classic posters be sold. Adding more insult is an enormous shipping and handling charge that adds $16 to a $3.99 purchase. As an accredited member of the Circus Historical Society I know very well what the originals look like. Furthermore, the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wisconsin have the original size authentic posters on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightly Delectably Citrus","review":"There is something luxuriously comforting about a fragrance that has felt personally yours for decades. I first bought this delicious fragrance for my man so many years ago, but like a \`boyfriend's jacket' or your \`hubby's shirts', began wearing it far more than he did. Absolutely citrus, strangely hypnotic, this men's gift from the Nina Ricci company has long been my own personal \`crème de la crème' choice. Even with so many other favorites, from especially France, this Italian delight to the senses has happily haunted my memory, so much so that it has always managed to find it's gentlemanly way to the top of the cologne bottle heap. Thanks to Amazon for making this usually impossibly hard to find decadent necessity so reasonably priced and easy to bring home (without going to Europe!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"***Possible spoilers***Probably the most confusing harlequin I've ever read. Neither character seem to know what they want, why they are doing what they are doing, and their emotions go from one extreme to the other in the span of a period. Christos started out making Alysia marry him for one reason, then seemed to do it for another and then changed, added in another reason all the while she's repeatedly told him she wouldn't have his babies and at one point towards the end he asks her how long she would have led him on before she told him that she was on bc and that she didn't want his baby...I like Jane Porter's book usually, but this seemed like she was writing two separate stories and accidentally mushed them together."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Romance Junkie","review":"This storyline was really great but it went flat fast. I liked Christo but I truly couldn't deal with Alysia and all of her crazy long winded thoughts. It went on for pages and pages. I was turning my kindle pages at the speed of light.

While the Beat Hustlerz mix is pure mainstream, club bliss, the killer Offer Nissim Mix #2 makes that version sound like slow moving kiddie fare! Offer Nissim Mix 1 (track 3) is ok, and nearly the same as Mix 2, but the rhythm and bassline are slighly off. It's just not that smooth sounding.

I have a much deeper appreciation of what it took to build the railroads, and also where terms such as \\"the wrong side of the tracks,\\" \\"a Chinaman's chance...\\" etc came from. I bought the unabridged audio version and listened while I commuted to and from work... I was sorry when it ended will listen to it again. This is a must for any train fan or history buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"And they didn't even tell you how long it was","review":"I spent 3 weeks reading this book and I can't remember a single instance in which Ambrose told me exactly how long the darn thing was. He spends WAY too much time telling me how the land was selected and the politics surrounding the whole thing, and not enough time talking about how they built it. The last 1/2 to 1/3 of the book is pretty good, but it just takes too long to get there.If I could give it 1.5 stars I would because it is pretty well written, but what Ambrose chose to leave out and what he chose to put in just didn't make a lot of sense to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like It in the World of Misconceptions","review":"An exciting read, but unfortunately so full of distracting and erroneous errors that it actually would have been better as an historical novel.

Repetitive writing. I heard this book on tape and thought I must be mistaken when I heard the same sentences as before. Then, I heard that Lee discovered Meade's orders in Civil War. HUH!! It was Meade that saw Lee's orders. I got a copy of the book and started researching what others thought of book. He has the wrong people doing things, places in the wrong direction from each other, rivers in the wrong states, states listed as territories. I doubt if there a single page in this book that doesn't have an error. Inspiring, but complete garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least he tried","review":"What saves this effort at all is the subject matter. The transcontinental railroad and its story is so grand that it is hard to screw it up. Stephen Ambrose has made a valiant effort but even with his great literary prowess he has proved unable to destroy the magic of the tale. Other reviewers have pointed out the repetitions, the errors, the plagarisms. I will point out just one strange one. On my copy of the book the rear cover prints reviews and raves for his Lewis and Clark book. At first glance you are prone to interpret it applying to this one. Mr. Ambrose, we still love you and know you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"both a good and bad book.","review":"the Bad- it repeated itself too much,and could have benefitted from more depth and detail in both aspects of american history and railroading.the Good- very easy to read. this is probably a \\"must-read\\" book if you want just a good general overview of the genre. however, as both an american history and railroading fan, my expectations were not satisfied.4 stars for its merit as an overview for the genre; 0 stars for its merit as a \\"deep\\" book for the genre, so as an average it gets 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish I read these reviews first!!","review":"I have always enjoyed Ambrose' WWII material, but this was close to unforgiveable. The Lee-McLellan order error was outrageous and Simon and Schuster couldn't have had an editor read the final much less edit the book. An incredible waste of talent and subject matter. I had the book for months on the shelf and read it to fill time and because it was a Stephen Ambrose. Don't bother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful story told well","review":"Stephen Ambrose has made a tremendous career for himself by writing oral histories about heroic American men. This book is no exception: Ambrose does a terrific job of digging up truly inspirational stories of common laborers who underwent grueling hardship in order to build the railroads.The result is a very compelling read. However, given how much effort went into this book and given the obvious depth of Ambrose's research, it would have been nice to see a bit more perspective, a bit more actual history surrounding the railroad. If you are still curious about the subject after reading Ambrose's book, I highly recommend _Empire Express_ by David Howard Bain."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than everything you want to know","review":"A disappointment, especially when compared to other books by this usually excellent author. Mr. Ambrose has taken material that should fit into a 50- to 75-page pamphlet and expanded it to book length. He does this by repeating similar information ad nauseam: for example, on page 345 of the normal print edition he states, \\". . . that day laid 4.2 miles of track. The next day, it set down 3.1 miles, and the day after that, 4.6.\\" Time after time we read similar statistics. Who cares?Because of the extensive annotations, this book might be useful for someone as a bibliography for further research on the subject. But one wonders if Ambrose has left anything unsaid. I note that another reviewer has questioned the accuracy of some of his assertions.Frankly, a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this","review":"This was the first book I read on the Transcontinental Railroad. Even as a novice I could pick out errors. My edition placed Wells Nevada in the western part of the state. It's east. I tried to keep track of mileages of track laid. They didn't add up. Errors were so rife I actually wrote the publisher a letter. The writing style was so bad I got the feeling that the work was ghost written with Ambrose' name thrown on to give to work credence. When I read a newspaper article about a group of Sacramento rail historians who cataloged the books' errors I returned the book and got my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story Poorly Told","review":"The book reads like a blast from a shotgun. Stuff everywhere, but disjointed with no clear theme or analysis. Many fragments of material were extensively repeated, contributing only to the word count. The maps usually did not locate sites described. The photos included fail to include any of the significant photographical endeavors described in the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Race","review":"Nothing Like It In The World is an exciting read about an amazing race in the 19th century. While most of us have seen the famous photo of the Transcontinental Railroad being joined with a gold spike, I did not understand the true grit, risk, ingenuity and challenges of the task. Stephen Ambrose brings this out in an entertaining and personal way. The entertainment comes from his 'dueling banjos' style of one chapter on the Eastern railway and one chapter on the Western competitor. Ambrose gets into personalities from the giants to those who dug the tunnels and pounded the spikes. He paraphrases some of the quotes, saving us from that era's stilted and preachy dialog. Finally, he puts the task into today's perspective. There is nothing like this in the world. It remains to be seen whether space travel will match the Transcontinental Railway's achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booorring!","review":"Being a big fan of Steven Ambrose, I was very disappointed with this work.

Is it because he got a free, special train ride, as he notes in the preface of his book? He compares the building of the transcontinental railroad to mankind's greatest accomplishments! Well, it wasn't and writing won't make it so. Either he's losing his edge or he received a tidy inheritance from one of the Big Four (here in California, Southern Pacific is still considered an insatiable octopus.)

It would have made a good article for a magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book by Mr. Ambrose seems rambling and repetitive. It could have been shortened if he had re-read the previous chapters and reminded himself what he wrote last week! He seems to be doing what the UP and CP barons were guilty of doing, making a longer book to exact bigger profits, like they were accused of trying to make the railroad longer to get more government money for it. Mr. Ambrose also has the irritating habit of confusing \\"elevation\\" with \\"altitude\\", though whoever drew the maps got it right. Still the book is an interesting starting point if one wants to pursue the subject in depth, or plan a vacation to Green River."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"Mr. Ambrose - who generally writes as readable a history as anyone - fell way short on this one. At the outset, he admits that his publisher recommended this topic to him.

The book was redundant and disorganized and gave the distinct impression of being thrown together like a midnight term paper. This book ought to be skipped."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Read","review":"Ambrose has taken yet another history lesson and made it readable. In his account of one of the most ambitious engineering projects in American history, Ambrose takes us through the fascinating tale of the building of the transcontinental railroad and introduces us to the men who made it happen. The politicians, investors, engineers as well as the Chinese and Irish immigrants and defeated Confederate Soilers who labored for the project all come together in Ambrose's skillful hands as he introduces us to the ordinary and common men who worked together to make their dream come true. The narrative flows freely as the portrait of the key players takes us from the beginnings of a vision to the completed project. A very satisfying read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like This","review":"The effort is readable and entertaining, but in trying to tell the stories of both the financing and the construction of the road Ambrose muddles the logic of his analysis. While the construction was a technological masterpiece, the financing thereof was the sort often described by NBC News as \\"The Fleecing of America.\\" The dismissal of prior analysis as \\"post Depression Era political correctness\\" in academia, is not substantiated by the evidence Ambrose himself provides. Also, the insert that it was McClellan's orders that were lost and read by Lee is exactly backwards, and appears to be one of those errors that should have been caught in the editing process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected From America's Best Historian","review":"I am a Stephen Ambrose fan...read his biographies of Eisenhower and Nixon. Read his WWII books. I thought Undaunted Courage to Be the most remarkable book ever. This one however is not up to his standards. In fact, I would call it a disapointment. Passages exist that remind you that Ambrose is telling a story but they are too far apart. The account is redundant. The same anecdotes are repeated sometimes two and three times. I was left wanting to know more. He just did not do a good job. I thought the subject deserved a much better treatment. The work seems rushed and in some instances the information is wrong. There is a reference of Lee's Soldiers finding McClellan's plans for the Battle of Antietam when in fact just the opposite is the case.Greg Strauser St Louis"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad history","review":"This book is a shame and a disgrace.

Sure, the railroad was monumental and the personalities involved were strong, but I didn't have to be reminded of this every page or two.

Stephen E. Ambrose is one of America's master storytellers. He reconstructs a critical piece of American history and conveys its enormous importance to the nation's growth. The research in this book is impeccable. Ambrose does a superb job explaining the backbreaking and dangerous work on the railroad. He also does a credible job of explaining the power and greed that contaminated some of railroad men."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Decline Continues","review":"It's sad to see that Ambrose, the author of such wonderful early biographies and histories, continues to churn out flawed and increasingly wooden material. He appears much more concerned these days with being President of 'Stephen Ambrose Inc.', than he is with writing solid history. If you're truly interested in the history of the Transcontinental Railroad, read David Bain's book instead. It may give you a few more details than you care to know, but the his passion for the work comes through almost as loudly as the passion (both good and nefarious) of the speculators and tycoons who lurked and paraded on the Transcontinental stage. In addition to several unforgiveable factual errors, Ambrose's work captures very little of the historical immensity of the this magnificent feat. Ambrose and his publisher are trying to sell words on paper based on the author's name. Hopefully he'll go back soon to writing insightful, compelling history that teaches as much as it entertains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff for a train and history buff","review":"This was an easy read, since I skimmed over the financial data and repeated statistics. That said, I found the historical detail on the workers and how they worked fascinating. The Chinese were truly amazing in what they accomplished, and I developed a new respect for their culture. The men who built the railroad knew how to work hard. Ambrose's view that the railroad truly was the greatest change in man's history is a valid one, and made me consider how amazingly fast our world has changed since then.I was left wanting to drive I-80 and see the original transcon route and visit Promentory Point. The bibliography is an excellent resource for anyone who wants to learn more. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambrose out of his element","review":"Stephen Ambrose has a great talent in getting to the \\"crux\\" of matters relating to history - providing an overall view of the strategy behind goals while providing a realistic and gritty view of the actions of average people making the strategy into reality. I have read most of his books on WWII and \\"Undaunted Courage\\". In this (Railroad) book, he doesn't seem to feel the same affinity for the average people that he has shown in his previous works. It's as if he read the Cliff Notes and wrote a book based on the notes. No true feeling for the work and iniative of the nameless folk (read the actual workers - Irish and Chinamen) comes through. He does a fair job on describing the few men with the true vision, but overall the work lacks heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"Ambrose was clearly uninterested in his subject. This is a disjointed, poorly written book. One would guess it was a student's first term paper if one did not know that Stephen Ambrose is an acclaimed author. The maps are simple and poorly placed. Under Ambrose's pen, the story is dull. Some sections appear to come straight out of the other recent railroad book, The Empire Express."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambrose derails his plans for a good book","review":"Having read much of Mr. Ambrose's considerable body of work, it is clear that deadlines and publishers are driving his activities today. \\"Assistants\\" are probably not making things better. He certainly is talented and capable (\\"Undaunted Courage\\" is my favorite), but this book is a complete failure. It's very popular due to the name on the cover, which says quite a bit about how books are sold.As noted in other reviews, the \\"facts\\" and the writing are uneven and, in some cases, just plain wrong. It appears that several people are coming at the topic from different places. The frustrating experience reminded me of reading the careless Washington and Jefferson biographies written by Willard Stern Randall.The bottom line for anyone looking at this topic: do not buy this book. Instead, order \\"Empire Express\\". It is a serious, well-organized and extremely well-written history worthy of the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - read Empire Express","review":"With \\"Nothing Like it in the World\\" eminent historian Stephen E. Ambrose appears to be resting on the laurels he earned with his earlier works. This book is a disjointed compilation of anecdotes about the building of the transcontinental railroad, lacking any sort of compelling or even coherent narrative. Worse still, the anecdotes are repetitive; he appears to have \\"copied and pasted\\" entire pages 5 or even six times, differentiated only by a few extra lines he tacked on here and there. One has to wonder if Ambrose bothered to have an editor read his manuscript before sending a first draft to the presses.I would like to point out some redeeming feature that might have made this book worth my time and money. Unfortunately, I found none, and am left wishing that I could get a refund for both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I wish I had read these reviews before asking Santa to put Ambrose's book in my stocking.

The readers are owed an apology by both author and publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly superficial","review":"I picked this up anticipating as fine a book as \\"Undaunted Courage,\\" but was seriously disappointed. It is quite superficial; even acknowledging Ambrose's desire to focus on those who actually built the railroad, the business and political aspects are given short shrift. Ambrose (or, rather, his cadre of researchers) has done a pretty good job of digging up information about what it was like to actually be building the railroad, and the various personal anecdotes are the best part of the book. But it suffers from very poor editing (several anecdotes are repeated nearly verbatim, and at least one blatant error exists) and has the feel of something that Ambrose knocked off quickly because his editor wanted him to write it. But it did picque my interest sufficiently to make me want to read a more serious treatment of the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than you would like to know","review":"It would seem that Mr. Ambrose:1. Needed to satisfy his publisher2. Needed money (doubtful)3. Had nothing better to do (could be)4. Wrote this book on several different occasions, and then quickly compiled it (highly likely)5. Wanted to bore us and re-bore us as to how many cottonwood ties and spikes could be shipped out and re-shipped out to the end of track.I'm a big railfan, and was expecting to devour this book. As a matter of fact, I read it while traveling on the Empire Builder from Chicago to Seattle and back. While hoping for a good read on my journey, I ended up feeling that I was being subjected to such minutia and endless repetition that I questioned every flip of the page.

The biggest complaint is that the story was so repetitive. The same facts, over and over. In chapter after chapter, he remarks on the number of rails laid, the number of spikes driven, the number of fills made, the tunnels dug, and so on. I think much more life would have been given to the story if more personal accounts and incidents of the workers had been expanded upon. No doubt it was a great undertaking, but more should have been written about the common man doing the work. Additionally, more maps and photos should have been included which would have given the reader a better view than just the endless list of facts and figures. Ambrose really missed it on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to the standard of Ambrose's earlier work","review":"This book reads like a rush job - it seems to have been thrown together in a hurry with sloppy fact-checking and editing. There are numerous errors where characters and place names, mountain ranges, and rivers are mis-identified. Several passages are repeated two or three times in different places as though the author overused cut-and-paste to flesh out his story. The time line is extremely difficult to follow and is in some places contradictory. It provides a very unsatisfying read.This is my fourth Ambrose book and it is not in the same league as the others, woefully not even close. As a here-to-fore fan of this author's work, I am greatly disappointed in this effort.

This suggests a lack of attention either by the writer (if, indeed, it was Ambrose throughout) or by the editor, or both.It is unclear that this work was necessary in that Dee Brown's \\"Hear that Lonesome Whistle Blow\\", as a nonscholarly history of the railroad, was at least as good, and perhaps better.

Such a shame to miss the compelling story of this feat, by publishing a rough draft."},{"rating":"1","title":"what missed here?","review":"i have to say that i was really disappointed with this book. its a natural fantastic story, with all the ingredients anyone would want, but ambrose, seems to have blown through this manuscript in about 3 weeks. it jumps all over the place, is incredibly difficult to follow sometimes and loses considerable punch with his casual use of prose. i have to be honest - this is the first ambrose book i have read, so i can't tell whether he simply had a bad month. i hope so. but this book is just not a very good read, which, given the subject matter, is too damn bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs down","review":"This book must rank among Ambrose's worst. It is confusing, redundant, overwritten, jingoistic and mind-numbingly dull. If any reader can decipher the Union Pacific Railroad's finances based on Ambrose's exposition, then he or she should get a Nobel Prize in economics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambrose needs a good editor","review":"It's interesting to read, but woefully repetitious in spots. Technically, Ambrose seems totally unfamiliar with his subject. I got the feeling he is neither a railroad buff nor mechanically inclined, for some of his descriptions of technical and mechanical aspects of the construction were pretty haphazard.In general, I enjoyed reading it, but I wasn't impressed by the quality of writing, and I'm not at all sure of the reliability of its information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious transcontinental tale","review":"This is a story about two companies building a railroad line between Sacramento, California and Omaha, Nebraska. While the workers are fighting Indians and blowing holes in granite and each other, the owners are scalping the country of millions. There is a great story here somewhere, but Stephen Ambrose has missed it completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"tragic","review":"A mind is a terrible thing to waste. As a young man, Ambrose gave us beautifully written books of intellectual substance. Now he gives us bestsellers, but they are shallow, facile, poorly researched work that panders to the public taste for simple stories simply told. He could have been a great historian and left a mark on his era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standards of basic scholarship","review":"This book is not up to the standards one would expect in a book written by a respected historian. It is obvious that the bulk of the book's research was done by the author's staff and not the writer. The editing is slipshod. The same \\"notecard\\" entries, for example, are used word for word in different chapters of the book. I suspect the Ambrose book was rushed to publication in order to appear before the publication of the vastly superior work on the same subject by David Bain, \\"The Empire Express.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Error filled and quotes from non-existent people","review":"All of Ambrose's works have been severely criticized for theirerrors and extensive plagiarisms, but this book may lead all of the rest, according to the Committee for the protection of &#65533;What is True&#65533; in Railroad History, chaired by G.J. &#65533;Chris&#65533; Graves, Newcastle, California, which found that Ambrose text contains at least 60 pages that display one or more rather obvious errors, as well as quotes from non-existent people. The test itself (at least that part actually written by Ambrose) has his usual bombastic statements and pedestrian writing. Ambrose never let the facts get in the way of a heroic tale. His books qualify for the fiction shelf. They're certainly not histories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"Wow! I had never picked up a book on the Transcontinental Railroad before, and this was very informative & eye-opening.

I would (& have) recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For a first time transcontinental reader...","review":"This book was the first time I have read something in regards to the building of the trans-continental railroad. I have seen others who are more educated on the topic criticize this work for some inaccuracies. I, as a rookie on the subject, found the overall content very interesting. The contradictions I find others making are minor to the overall story being told. This book satisifies my desire for learning about the building of the railroad. My biggest problem with the book is it's excessive amount of details (quoting telegrams that chased the location of missing spikes) and the author continuously repeating certain points of interest. The maps shown in the book add information for those not familiar the locations of landmarks mentioned and the photos are impressive considering their age. As a whole, I recommend this book for the average person who wants to learn about the railroad without being worried about the minute details."},{"rating":"1","title":"good looking, ages fast","review":"Seiko has outlived its reputation: this watch is way too expensive for its cheap gold plating finish.

Initially I skimmed through the book and tried to jump right into web design, which was a mistake. I went back to the beginning of the book and decided to start over, and it has been smooth sailing ever since! Each chapter in the book is designed to ingrain skills in your head by repeating tasks and building upon them. It is very explanatory and extremely easy to follow. As the book goes along, it assumes you know more and treats you less like a beginner and more like a pro. This is a must have for designers using D4/F4.

First, the volume is too low. Do not expect to use this phone with moderate background noise, e.g. with a fan running, or sizzling food cooking. IMHO, all phones should have a max volume that exceeds what you need in a quiet environment. Second, the answering machine sound quality is barely satisfactory. My old 900mhz Panasonic machine had better volume, better answer machine sound quality and more features, like the ability to page me, which this machine cannot do.

I have to pay to ship the phone back for them to repair it! Just terrible. When my phone is finally returned, the LCD goes out again within the week. Needless to say I am very dissapointed at this point.So I call their support and complain. This time they send me a shipping label so I don't have to pay for it again. Well, after waiting two weeks, I had to call them again to remind them to send me the label - which they did that time.Well, now my phone has been gone for over a month with no word from Panasonic. I am waiting on the phone (about 45 minutes now) as I type this to speak with someone about the status of my phone.Panasonic generally makes good products.

The handset and base station speakers are acceptable for talking to friends and family, but I wouldn't hold a work conference call on either if I could avoid it. My house is on a 1 acre lot and the handset maintains clear communication anywhere on my property.As mentioned in other reviews, the handset batteries are horrible, but they can be easily replaced with ER-P511 NiMH from Energizer.

The author presents a large number of scenarios and their variations and how to defend against them. There is good coverage on the different types of situations. For example, the author shows several situations where you are being held by two people while the third attacks, or where your hands are even tied, forcing you to use your feet to block and strike.I think a book on this subject makes a lot of sense. From my long experience as both a student and an instructor in a number of different martial arts, multiple attacker defenses are uniformly neglected in training in the schools. This book helps to make up for this oversight. Altogether an excellent book on a frequently neglected area of training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach: Cantatas, Vol 26 (BWV 180, 122, 96) /Bach Collegium Japan * Suzuki","review":"Bach: Cantatas, Vol 26 (BWV 180, 122, 96) /Bach Collegium Japan * Suzuki is a wonderful recording under the direction of Masaaki Suzuki who leads the Bach Collegium Japan on this NEC sponsored BIS Records AB recording from 2004.

I'm never again getting anything Zune in terms of headphones. My Zune is a beast taking any and all punishment (even when I sometimes want it to break to justify getting a newer one) but their earphones' durability sucks, AVOID AT ALL COSTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are not Premium earphones","review":"These earphones are not Premium Zune earphones since they do not have the cloth cord that the Premium earphones have.

I do like the sound quality very much, but when it comes to fitting in the ears, it's a pain. I don't like the fact that I have to cram them in my ears to get them to stay in, even after changing to the smallest bud size. The case is neat and they don't tangle much, but if you want to do anything active while wearing them, forget it. I couldn't get these to stay in my ears at all when I ran.

That fact aside, they're not even worth it because the sound is horrible; there's no bass at all, so there's no depth to the sound. Honestly, I was far better off with my normal (and cheaper) headphones that my Zune came with. If you have sensitive ears or actually like good sound, don't waste your money on these. Go for the standard Zune headphones; they're much more comfortable, don't fall out, and have better sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for a few weeks and then the left sound went out.","review":"These headphones worked great for a few weeks.

At first.","review":"When I first put them in my ears, I LOVED them. FINALLY earbuds that don't hurt me!However, I tried to go running in them, and they fall right out.

The right one works fine, but apparently the wiring has come loose in the left. I am NOT using them harshly, and I put them back in the case when finished with them. There is no reason they should be broken.The sound quality was good before they broke, but I would have been better off buying something at Wal-mart and not wasting my twelve dollars.A total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor Quality Product","review":"These earphones are awesome and I cant tell the difference between sound from these and V2,The bass is really good and makes up for the lack of an equalizer on the Zune.

Its sad that many of the accessories for it are not.","review":"The sound quality from these headphones was an upgrade from the original headphones included with the Zune, especially as it relates to bass response.HOWEVER, there are several cons to this product. First of all, even though there are three different sized sleeves included for getting the best fit, these earbuds are EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE. Just very bulky, not ergonomically designed to fit in the ear at all.And finally, I ended up having them a total of three days before the left earpiece stopped working. Returned them to Amazon for a refund. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst earphones I've ever bought!","review":"These earphones are terrible.

I got them, and they're pretty decent. I think they're better than my old skullcandies. They do have a tendency to fall out of your ear, and I bought them from this seller but did not receive extra ear bud sizes. These earphones do provide very clear and great sound, however there is very little bass and I don't think they warrant the \\"Premium\\" title. Get them if you are looking for some new headphones but don't want to spend too much and want something pretty decent. I know I may be sounding a bit negative here, but they are very good headphones.

The sound is excellent, with strong punchy bass, but you have to shove them all the way into your ear canal to be able to hear it, which means they're usually covered with earwax. Gross.The biggest problem is, I bought them, used them for two weeks, then the left one stopped working. They weren't damaged or strained in any way. Just poorly built."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working","review":"I really enjoyed these while they worked.

Nonetheless, these have good sound. I don't believe the sound quality is any better however than the earbuds that come with the Zune 8gb, but because they fit in your ear canals, they will cancel out most of the ambient noise, and are WAY more comfortable. They also come with 3 different size rubber pieces to fit most any size person's ear. They also have good base response for earbuds. The case they come in is nice to have, but a little difficult to wrap the cord perfectly so that it fits back in well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THESE","review":"The sound quality was fine for me, But one ear goes out after a month. I bought 3 sets and when the first went out I thought it was a fluke. Now the second has gone out in the exact same amount of time. These things are crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain terrible","review":"These headphones are absolutly horrible. First- it is nearly impossible to get a good seal so that it sounds halfway decent. After i had these for three weeks of easy listening one of the earbuds decided to die and become very quiet. Since then i have bought skullcandy full metal jackets and they are infinatly better. And since i only paid 25$ for them it was a great deal. Another issue i have with these headphones is that even before you get them out of the case the way that it is wrapped up makes the wire have a bunch of kinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good if","review":"These were pretty good when they worked. I used them about 6 times when I was running and after that one stopped working completely, 34 days after I received them. So I'm out $10 with a useless pair earphones. Might be good if you use them only when walking or sitting around, but they are clearly not high enough quality to use for any sort of sporting activity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regretting the purchase..","review":"I don't really have anything good to say about these (except the good price).My complaints (thus far):1) Sound quality is terrible.. it seems like the \\"treble\\" is cranked way up, and the \\"bass\\" is turned way down. Songs with a lot of bass in particular sound pretty awful (and this isn't something I'm particularly picky about. I haven't had problems with other headphones)2) The cord length is very odd. It seems to get in my way when I'm working out on a treadmill (again, I have never had this issue w/headphones before).3) The headphones have a tendency to fall out of my ears (especially when I'm working out/sweating). This got especially annoying today when the headphones would stay in my ears for maybe 10 seconds and then start sliding out.I definitely DO NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I thought it'd be","review":"My old zune earphones broke so I decided to buy a pair of these and I do regret it. First off it looks cool that it has its own case and everything but if you use it its more of a hassle than just wrapping it around your mp3. Another thing is that they don't stay in your ear so you keep having to shove them in. You can always feel them in your ear where its uncomfortable. The sound quality is worse than the stock headphones for the zune. I wish I put my money towards bose earphones. My brother has a pair and they are sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zune Premium? earphones","review":"I have to say that these earphones do not even compare to the original earphones that came with the zune.

Her tone is empathetic and hopeful, and for that reason I came away from this book with a better appreciation of my own family roots and a renewed sense of purpose. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Truths","review":"Ms. Ray opened her heart to us in \\"Ecology Of A Cracker Childhood.\\" Just when you think the expression \\"tree huggers\\" is a negative, along comes Ms. Ray with a wonderful explantion of why we should all be so concerned about our woodlands. Ms. Ray's love for her family and particularly the stories of her father are very touching. Truly entertaining and a story well told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Georgia Book of the Year is a Loser","review":"I find it hard to believe that Georgia chose Ecology of a Cracker Childhood as its book of the year. The point of a book of the year is to encourage people to read; I am an avid reader, yet if I had to read books like this one, I'd quit reading. Not only is it poorly written, it lacks organization with information about one topic being scattered throughout other chapters. Most of the characters are flat, and the ecology chapters are, frankly, boring. Clearly the editing and proofreading jobs were minimal; there are even two mistyped (or misspelled) words on facing pages.After the information was made public that all of Georgia would be reading the same book this spring, I was so excited; now I am disappointed and disgusted that I spent money for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A renewing flame for mind and heart.","review":"Ms. Ray presents a refreshing approach to a \\"growing up\\" memoir that is simultaneously heart-tugging, entertaining and convicting. All of our personal and family histories are closely linked to the natural history of some place. Ms. Ray gives us a wonderful reminder of that through the interweaving of her personal experiences and the history of the long leaf pine ecosystem. She also tells us just how tragic it is that so much of what should be the current part of that \\"history\\" is lost or about to be. Ms. Ray helps us experience the joys and the heartbreaks of her own family, and the dangers and adventures of a junkyard. The uncommon combination of what on the surface might seem to be diverse topics could have come across as disjunct had they not been so wonderfully melded. This book is a renewing flame for the mind and the heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldman needed to buy a house...","review":"...that is the only reason I can think of for resurrecting his beloved MARATHON MAN characters, completely rewriting their history, and shoving them awkwardly into a story that could have just as easily featured characters from THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Not only did he write a ridiculous book--a man creates a drug that makes a racist homophobe have sex with a black man!--he did the unforgiveable: he undid much of the power of MARATHON MAN. Turns out that tragic, shocking death in MARATHON MAN didn't even happen...Scylla's just been living on an island. Really unfair and embarrassing. Can only reccommend it on a purely camp level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic piece of garbage","review":"I bought this book used, and I have to say it might have been the worst $2 I have ever spent. If you have the paperback version, you might see some of the positive reviews in the front; in fact, one reviewer even proclaims it a \\"masterpiece.\\" Frankly, I don't know what book those folks were reading. If you like wooden, underdeveloped characters, an idiotic plot, pages of boring back story in the middle of an \\"exciting\\" scene, and an unexplained, shoddily-constructed, intelligence-insulting twist that would farcical if you weren't so angry that you had wasted a few hours of your life reading the previous 300 pages, then this book is for you. If it had been possible to hand out negative stars, I would have done so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent if you care about Babe and Doc, not so much if you're just looking for a page-turner","review":"Masterful little scenes which, despite complaints above, do much to enhance the characters, particularly Scylla of course. Indeed, wrapped up with haste and has a real bummer of an ending, although it is perhaps inevitable and fitting. Scylla ia a great character, both in this book and MM. Does have some cringe-inducing expository dialogue, but there are passages that are such a joy to read that I forgive its sins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing sequal","review":"I loved Marathon Man and have read it several times. As a rule I also am a great admirer of William Goldman as a writer. However, on more than one occasion he has read as if he was phoning in the stories.This is one such case. Most of the characters are killed within a chapter of being introduced. As a result, there is little drama as it becomes obvious that the only question is how the adversaries of Scylla will meet their ends within a few pages of being introduced.Skip this one. Re-read Marathon Man instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"This was my second Goldman book after Marathon Man (also great). I was captivated by this story from the beginning until the end. I absolutely love the character of Scylla. To me he is one of the greatest \\"bad boy\\" heros of fiction. Whereas the first book (Marathon Man) focused on the younger brother, Babe, this one focuses on the older one Tom (Scylla). It has all the intrigue of a spy/mystery novel with some of the wit of a comedy. I found myself rooting intensely for Scylla to beat all his rivals and achieve his goal. The ending was not predictablerise and kept me guessing to the final page. This book was a lot of fun to read. It reads like a screen play which Goldman is also famous for. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Columbia review","review":"I ordered these a half size larger as others have suggested and they fit fine.

Well, I was wrong, and since the day I own this I have never been able to listen to it in its entirety. The songs are completely boring and do not shine in the new millenium. I'm pretty sure they didn't, even in their era.

I went back to re-read the book a couple of years ago, hoping to refresh myself with that side of the book. Much to my surprise and delight, the characters and their stories were just as refreshing, and the sensual delight they take in each other works just as well now as it did thirty years ago. Indeed, the book teaches us, with delightful, spare, vivid prose, that living intensely matters to all of us, at whatever age.The hero's journey through the west is as much a journey through possible alternative lives, and ways of looking at life, as anything else.

(Grandaddy's Jason Lytle produced Fiver's first CD.)Fiver recommends listening to their music with headphones and I agree completely. The depth of sound and the experience is not the same over the loud speakers. The last track, \\"theme from lo-down\\" is the best example of this. The seven-minute track floats and glides in a blissfull, spacy trance. Guitarist Chris Doud's skill is showcased as the track progresses from quiet to rocking and then back to quiet.

The same can be said of his previous album, In The Running. While some of us may have \\"matured\\" and now prefer \\"elevator music\\", or adult contemporary styles, this does not describe the vast majority of Howard's fans from the 80's.

The bass, the drum, the highs and the 8-0-8 lows are what keeps my head nodding and my ears open for this! This CD was a must have after hearing \\"Heroes\\" on a underground radio show. I went on my search for this song without an artist name or a complete song title. All I had to go on was \\"hero\\". After 2 months of internet searching and asking all of my amazon.com friends, I finally came up on the name Kruder and Dorf. (Big Up Respect to Grant from Australia for the knowledge on this one) These kats are good at what they do. All the tracks are different and unique to the point of being totally different than other electronic artist out."},{"rating":"2","title":"K&D Will Pump You Up","review":"The K&D Sessions CD set is the Swiss Army Knife of electronica: suitable for all occasions. Pop the CDs in the player, hit Shuffle, then sit back and enjoy this Teutonic duet of mixmasters as they conjure up some great background music for any hip soiree, dinner party, study session, or romantic interlude. There is definitely a signature to their sound that captures the essence of the original tune, infuses it with a catchy bassline, seamlessly blends in trippy riffs, and sprinkles a bit of their unique, cool attitude that simply makes you say, \\"Ahh.\\" Impress your friends and get this album. Plus, it's just so cool to say \\"Kruder & Dorfmeister\\" in your best Hans & Franz accent. Try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a masterpiece.","review":"I am not going to bore you with a lot of hype, I just want to say that this album is truly a totally solid masterpiece...a totally incredible album. I consider myself a sophisticated listener, and the music on this album never bores me, always keeps things very tough-stylee-cool. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Deal","review":"There are 20 songs on this 2 CD set, so I won't bore you by intimately detailing them all. Suffice it to say, Sessions is one of the finest releases of 1999.

Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb chilled beats","review":"One of the most definitive trip-hop / downtempo albums created.

I read all the rave reviews of this album and decided to order it along with some other artists.I wasn't dissapointed. This two CD set is awesome! I absolutely love it. The reviews were dead on. Go ahead and make the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but a disappointment","review":"Don't get the into wrong, this is sick music for any activity - smoke, trip, f-ck to this - it all works. But, having seen these two mix live and having heard their DJ Kicks set, I was expecting more. Not quite as chill as their usual flavour which is a product of the tracks chosen - the thick drum n' bass of Roni Size can only get so mellow, for example. But the fact that I am a bit disappointed is not a slight on this album, but rather it's a testament to two masters of downtempo from whom I've come to expect almost universal perfection. This is nonetheless great music for the soul and is still one of the best albums in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Background Music?","review":"Lovely electronic, layered, compelling, better on each listen. A good thing to have on while doing something brainy: writing checks, writing poems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow Mind Massage","review":"This is not a collection of music you find yourself trying to \\"get into\\"; rather, it envelops you in intriguing, sometimes dark, but always welcoming beats and melodies. This is downtempo at its most lush, from Lamb's hazy \\"Trans Fatty Acid\\" to the dense bounce of Aphrodelics' \\"Rollin' On Chrome\\". There's no difference in quality between the two discs; give each equal time in your player, and spend that time massaging your mind with this rich and flavorful medley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrary to popular opinion, this CD isn't to die for.","review":"I bought this CD after reading the numerous positive reviewshere. But after listening it, I must admit that I've beendisappointed. Yes, the music is mellow, smooth, and definitely sets a mood. But if I wanted to listen to loungey jazz with a beat, I'd buy a remix of Herb Albert. And don't get me wrong, I like jazz ... but the mixes on this CD feel ordinary.

In Austria K&D are really big, they rule the scene, actually they were the first serious electro act in Austria, which had commercial success. And if you ever get the chance to see them live, don't miss it. I've only seen them once but it was a fantastic expierience.

They seem to take their previous work to a new level, including more rap, especially in Bug Powder Dust, great song. They also remix Useless from Depeche Mode, which is a beautifully mellow song, great album to relax to. I give it four stars, since not all songs are all that intriguing, some are very good, but others are not that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn good","review":"The K&D Sessions is one of the most highly respected electronica releases, and with good reason. From the first beat of Heros all the way to the fade out of Million Town it is a beautifully cohesive collection of dynamic, bassy soundscapes accessable to any mature listener with big speakers. This magnificent album is reason enough to upgrade your stereo to get the most out of it. Peter and Richard have done very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's what daaddy wants.Wane Hancock III","review":"I receved the cd and on two of the songs there is a skip or a space and is very annoying... otherwise all is well.

I cried, I laughed, and pondered whether Ian would make to the end of DILLARGAF in one piece.Now comes the second book in the trilogy following the life of Ian Foster. The author, B. Keith Jones takes the reader through some of the most hillarious as well as most painful, sad, and at times terrifying experiences one could experience. Many of the character of DILLARGAF are back with some new 'Wives, Lovers, Friends & Others' added in for pleasure. The result is more laughter, joy, sadness, and growth pain as Ian continues his journey toward self-awareness. The Roomie Do Me Blues is about God, love, trust, music, drugs and drags, good times, bad times, high and low times. In the end Ian shows us it really is 'OK to be yourself'.Congratulations B. Keith Jones. You are the rainbow. I eargerly await the conclusion of the trilogy \\"ALL I Didn't Say\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"George Jones","review":"I heard this album many many moons ago and I said then that this was his best album ever and guess what, it was! This was the highest grossing album ever and it's to bad that it never went further than a cassette edition. If you have an un-used cassette, it sells today for around $250 each. I am not truly clear why he didn't go forward with production of vinyl albums or CD's but, I have been told that between his producer at the time and the Production Company he was signed to then,they had a huge dispute over the rights to the songs,lyrics, sales and production. George swore he would never sing a song from the album either in public, private or do any recordings of the songs as long as he lived and, a man true to his word, he has not to this date. Some say he even refuses to acknowlede the albums existance. Shame because, this is his very best. Of course if you don't like \\"George\\" you won't like it anyway.

Adults only."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun crime caper set in south Florida - Miami Blues, part 2","review":"Charles Willeford has definitely improved with age. His earlier works were a mixed bag. Competent, but no humour. However since the 1980s Willeford has developed a sense of humour which matches his ability to crank out good crime stories, complete with memorable characters. 'Sideswipe' carries on in this tradition.In 'Sideswipe' with have a violent ex-con, a disfigured ex-stripper, a retiree who just lost his wife, and a talentless artist caught up in some shenanigans. Solving the caper is Hoke Moseley, our quirky cop from the novel 'Miami Blues'. Actually most of 'Sideswipe' concentrates on Hoke and his odd family whereas the crime story itself is a relatively minor element to the book. But overall it works well. The overall effect is funny without being stupid.Bottom line: competent and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every English speaking Muslim should have this book!","review":"This book by Dr. Nasr is a book which was waiting to be written and it could not have been written by a more qualified person. I learnt a lot about the intellectual history of Islamic thought from this book (philosophy, mystical ideas, speculative theology) and how it has developed throughout the ages to the present. I also was very very impressed by the scholarly yet succint way in which the major philosophical and intellectual movements which shaped the history of the West were presented. This again greatly increased my knowledge. These first two sections were excellent. The third section was not as strong as the other two--how Muslims should respond to the Western dominance at present and a comparative overview--as it was too brief. This though is an excellent book. I hope that Dr. Nasr writes another version of this book--for adults this time following the same format but including a lot more detail and references and bibliography."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST have on every Muslim family's bookshelf","review":"Seyyed Nasr's book is enlightening and illuminating. It is a counter to the many books written by orientalists who study and interpret Islam from their own very prejudiced views. Now, it is a Muslim scholar par excellence who is critically assessing the Western world from an Islamic point of view. The book is scholarly and academic in every sense of the word, never in any way deviating into vitriol, offence, or sweeping anti-Western generalisations. In this scholarly work, Seyyed Nasr begins by elucidating the fundamental truths of the Islamic faith. He then begins his exposition on the Western world, delving into its religious history, philosophies, politics, education, and social life. A must read, definitely one to be passed down from father to son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introductory Readings for teens and a text book for others","review":"Thank you Professor Nasr, this book fills a scholarly gap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Me When It's Over!","review":"I'm not a new-age fan by any means. But when I saw this CD and the personnel who were on it, I expected some sort of light pop-jazz. Instead it made elevator music more appealing. The strings are just overbearing on this record. The great Herb Alpert is relegated to a background sound. What a shame! I'm sure this appeals to the wine-and-cheese crowd, but for me this will cure insomnia in a heartbeat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a quintessential text with somewhat inaccessible translation","review":"While the mere availability of this text in english is certainly extraordinary and invaluable, the translation and writing will obstruct some of its benefit for most readers. The author's reliance on latin terminology, as well as an unwillingness to use conventional and/or literal tranlations of sanskrit and tibetan terms, makes this a difficult read. I would never describe this book as \\"readable\\"- just the opposite. As noted in other reviews, there is a wealth of information in the chapters leading up to the translation, but they suffer from the same faults. While I am grateful to Dr. Pettit for publishing this work, I look forward to the release of a new translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific one volume insight into the modern presidency","review":"This is a terrific book and rewards the reader with insight into the modern presidency. It talks about each President's strengths and how each of them got themselves into trouble and it illustrates its points using each President's own words. Because it is less than 400 pages long it is hard for Doyle to support all the claims he makes, but it is still worth reading. More than that, it is worth owning and re-reading. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I think the book could have gone a bit deeper into each presidency without adding too much length. It was just a bit too much this side of a tourist's guide to each presidency.But there are so many wonderful and new insights that I feel guilty for not giving it five stars. So, if you want, just imagine that I did give it the full five with this little caveat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprisingly Terrific Little Book","review":"This one was an eye opener. From the lead sheets I thought it might be a scandal ridden gossip tome. It was anything but. There are few books that provide a very real and accurate window into history. This is one of them.

Contains snapshots of several Americans that you will not find elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"If you like pictures of people breaking stuff, then buy this book. But otherwise don't waste your time and money. There is a little foreword with no usefull information on breaking and then...NOTHING. Just pictures of the author breaking stuff. Ask any martial arts instructor about breaking and you will learn much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and basic","review":"This book lacks depht. It shows a number of differnet tecniques, and is no doubt inspirational when it comes to new ideas for breking demonstrations. But it did not really give me anything new. Particulary the side kick break could be explained in much more detail, whwn it comes to keeping the body straight at impact and much much more. The pictures are however clear and the book is nice to look at, and for beginners ore novices this is no doubt an entertaining book. But if you practice Karate or Taekwon-Do allready, and has been for more than a year, i guarantee you will not find much new in this book. And if you do then shame on your instructor because this is very very very basic stuff. If you dont belive me, by all means buy the book, after all it has an all right price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love bites is more like a love tap","review":"You would think the cover of this movie would give someone the inclination that it would be the least bit interesting, or even the title would give someone that opinion, but watching this movie made me want to fall asleep. The supposed vampires in it were maybe seen for two scenes, and they were pretty terrible at that. Some of the acting was ok, but for the most part the movie was called. It didn't give the vampire genre any justice. I would say watch this if you obviously have nothing better to do, but do not buy it, I repeat do not buy it.

The book is well written -- though my spanish is shaky now -- and holds great sentimental value, as it describes one of the most magical places on the planet. -- Eric Poole"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointed","review":"I was a little disappointed that the book did not elaborate a little more on the specific cases cited as examples. Most of the time it just indicates if a particular case either set a precedent or was a counter-example to a precendent, and then gives a footnote reference to legal documents. The book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. When statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts. What I wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. I did not get that from this book. This was the first book on statistics and law that I bought and read, so I don't know how to compare it to others. But I will select and try another to see if what I am looking for is out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A surprising collection of music","review":"This was not the music that I was expecting.

There wasn't a lot of really relevant information here, though a few tidbits here and there. When she discusses the cords it didn't seems anywhere near as accurate as when Mark Rich writes about them in Energetic Anatomy. The part about the core star isn't anything I had ever heard of and didn't really resonate with me much. I think sticking with Hands of Light is probably a better idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the Science?","review":"This book definitely adds to Barbara's first book 'Hands of Light', but as her being a scientist I ask myself where's the science in this book? She seems to just rely on her spirit guides for everything, even all the stuff she should and probably does know as a well educated person! Why all the push to get everyone involved in the New Age/Eastern Religion stuff and depending on what the spirits say for everything? Instead why not concentrate on teaching people how to do things on their own like Donna Eden does in her book Energy Medicine? If all Brennan's guides chanellings where left out of the book I would have added another star to it's rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of authenticity and void of scientific evidence","review":"I'm strongly in tune with the first and second reviewers. There is no scientific evidence given for the practice written in this book. At any rate, light body is an ancient druidic exercise which is dissimilar to what is written in this book. In fact, the exercise in the book is a simplified sky and earth energy training of chi-chuang and druidry. All in all, the author has created yet another assumed energy channels and failed to note that chakras are one of many energy centres . If you're interested in cultivating your healing abilities and skills or healing magic, I would suggest you should be consulting authentic books on druidry and Nortern magic tradtion such as those written by Carr-Gomm and Pennick or join your local chi-chuang group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book in schizophrenic-stream of consciousness","review":"After muddling through the first 170 pages of this book, I had to give up. This book is written in the style of a schizophrenic stream-of-consciousness. Although the idea of a story based on the Persephone/Hades myth has potential, the overly descriptive and disjointed writing style make this novel more difficult to decipher than a college entrance exam. There are too many characters who are just kind of thrown into the pot, and none is either very interesting or apparently relevant. Although some images and settings are intriguing, character development and plot are sacrificed for excessive detail and crude sexual innuendo. There are three fools here: the author, the publisher and me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Moving!","review":"I agree with the person that called this a \\"so,so read\\".

After reading this book, I discovered that Mr. Weitz's primary occupation was a fashion designer, with the avocation of international playboy. It shows in his writing. \\"Hitler's Diplomat\\" has got to be the most poorly written book I have ever read. It is simply atrocious. More than a few sentences are simply incomprehensible. Most of the rest is just bad, bad, amateurish, high school level writing. The purported subject of the book- Joachim von Ribbentrop- is ignored for pages at a time and is given an extremely superficial treatment throughout. I am genuinely at a loss to explain how such trash got published, let alone graced with a forward by Tom Wolfe and favorably reviewed in the New York Times.

But these work great on claws and smaller crabs, such as Dungeness and Snow crabs.

I sent off for 2 cds, 'Vivid' (reviewed elsewhere and 'Pukar'.'Pukar' (Calling You) is a collection of songs about love and marriage. Unfortunately I am rather past the age of romantic illusions myself, but nevertheless I like the mix of rhythms, modal melodies, and jazz. My personal favourite is 'Jhoomo Gao' (Let's Dance and Sing), a lively wedding song in 3/4.The other songs generally follow a formula of a steady 4-in-a-bar rhythm, with long-held synth chords, soulful vocals, instrumental solos, and lively and varied percussion creating a rich and varied texture. The rhythm section together with some unexpected melodic shifts adds life to the proceedings, although some more up-tempo numbers would be welcome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did What I Needed.","review":"I use just about every tool and the metal pieces are firmly seated in the wood handles, they don't wiggle. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced tools for beginners","review":"My 11 year old son has taken an interest in all manner of sculpture and these tools are a great set for his age group - I would also recommend them for really anyone else.

While discussing The Hunger Games, I told them about Starman's Son.

I am anxious to read it again and share it with kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I read this as a kid back in the 1970s and always remembered it. The adventures were so appealing that, as a middle-schooler, I half hoped that the Cold War would blow up just so I could get out of the tedium of public school and become an explorer of the ruins too. I read it again while on vacation this year and it was a page turner... a classic post-apocalypse novel with mutants galore."},{"rating":"2","title":"SURPRISINGLY GOOD RECENT EFFORT","review":"Picked this up recently on a hunch. Pleasantly surprised at the quality of the songs and performances. \\"This Summer\\" is as fine a single as they've ever released. Would have been a huge hit if they could have come up with that one in 1985. \\"Electric Trains\\" is an excellent opener. Not a bad song in the bunch. Also, some interesting variations on their trademark sound that come off very well. For later day Squeeze, this is the one I would recommend. Even better than \\"Play\\" and \\"Some Fantastic Place\\", though those two are also recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO FANTASTIC PLACE","review":"I too had hoped these tunes would grow on me being a life-long Squeeze fan but they just seem bland an uninteresting. This like any Squeeze effort has a few moments. The nostalgic \\"Electric Trains\\" is very touching and reminds me of the Squeeze of the \\"Argybargy\\" period. \\"Daphne\\" also is a great song, somewhat reminiscent musically of XTC's \\"Dear God\\". Then there is \\"This Summer\\" which is a great slice of pop heaven. Other than that, filler and three good songs do not a classic make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I bought this hoping it would be as good as some of their earlier stuff, but instead, I'm left with a bland-to-boring cd of tired songs by a band who should've called it quits ages ago...I was also amazed that they recorded what is essentially the same song twice, under two different titles: \\"Heaven Knows\\" and \\"I Want You\\" - maybe they figured no one would notice because few people could sit through the whole cd...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap watch, do not buy!!!","review":"I bought this watch as Christmas Gift for my son.

It is interesting reading - if you like novels, I suggest you drop the fantasy and go for some REALITY for a change.The book is well written and well researched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"I found this to be a typical Jenny Randles book so if you're a fan of hers you'll enjoy it. I thought it focused too much on government documents and missing film and not enough on the Men In Black. Randles seems to have gone into the book with the pre-conceived notion that the MIB are government secret agents and spends the next 200 pages trying unsuccessfully to prove it. The book offered nothing new about the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well I am not sure what kind of Truth?","review":"OK, true enough, there actually was some new material , having to do with Men In Black, that mostly originate with UK sightings, however most of the older books on the subject seemed to focus on the MIB sightings in the US. So there was actually some merit to the book. However if you are expecting the TRUTH to suddenly come out and smack you like a trout, forget it, there is still a lot of conjecture and little or no answers,(sorta of like the x files, the truth is out there but we are not gonna tell you now). In fact I did read the whole book expecting to be more enlightened and did go away with some new information, a more practicle title would be, Perhaps more information on MIB's that you havent read before! I am thinking about selling my copy and would have done it already, except for my love of books in general, sometimes it makes it hard for me to get rid of anything with the least bit of extra information.....then again perhaps i will get over it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dry read...","review":"I was excited to read this book, until I started reading it. I had no idea MIB existed. I thought it was just a great movie idea. But, apparently there is some myth behind the MIB. This book is written after the first movie. It starts out with some great information a clear story about an UFO sighting and what happened afterwards to the witness. From there, they other stories are chalked full of information on names, dates, government offices, etc. So much so, I had to re-read several pages just to understand. It is very much a dry read with too much detail, so I feel. But, if you are big into UFOs, this might just be right up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"The problem with ufology are books like these","review":"The truth behind Men in Black is that it makes for an interesting topic to write a conspiracy book about, no doubt the author will make a lot of money off credulous UFO \\"researchers.\\" This book has zero evidence, or value for that matter. The documents she includes are worthless-- there's a document about Roswell and a few other things, but they have nothing to do with MIB's. Poor research, poor book, poor me for wasting my money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome DVD for an awesome band","review":"First of all, I have to commend Switchfoot on their amazing sucess with their most recent CD release, \\"The Beatufiul Letdown\\". This is a MUST HAVE DVD for anyone who is a fan and/or enjoys the \\"Beautiful Letdown\\" cd. I have seen switchfoot play live twice now, and must say this DVD captures much of the feeling you get when seeing them play live. They sound is great so it still has that live quality as if you were there, not watching them on TV. And not to mention their stage presence is phenomenal. They have come a long way from their more \\"yuppie\\" image(no offense, cuz they rocked even back then!) when they released their \\"Legend of Chin\\" CD in '97.

If you have a small child - this is for YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too cute","review":"I was convinced to go to this teenie bopper movie with my sister. We're both in our late 20's, but enjoy those cute romantic comedies. We were sorely disappointed. Mandy Moore's preoccupation with sex was pathetic. That seemed to be the only thing she cared about throughout the entire movie. And I felt that the unrealistic combination of her and the secret servicman was tragic. I found the most entertaining part of the movie to be the interaction of her two secret service guards who fall in love. Other than that, I would pass it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally unrealistic","review":"I appreciate that movies are a break from reality but Chasing Liberty takes too many liberties to make it watch-able. The chance that the President's daughter would be allowed to sneak around through Europe by herself is totally unbelievable. Many Moore does a decent job with the role but her whining proves to be pretty painful. I wouldn't watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great movie","review":"\\"Chasing Liberty\\" is romance and comedy. It is about a girl named Anna, played by Mandy Moore, who is the president's daughter. Anna is played by actress Mandy Moore. She is never alone because there are always FBI agents around her. She can't even have a date without agents everywhere. Then she and her family go to Prague, Poland. She meets this guy named Ben and she runs away with him. Ben is played by actor Matthew Goode. She didn't really want him to come, but he does. Ben is really an agent protecting her from danger. Anna does these really crazy things. Ben goes with her wherever she goes. He doesn't know it, but he is starting to fall in love with her. All Anna is trying to do is have some fun and get away from her parents and responsibilities. This movie is rated PG-13. It came out on January 9th, 2004. It is a really cool movie. It is romance and comedy. \\"Chasing Liberty\\" is one of the best movies that have come out. You should definitely go and see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Badly directed. Badly written. The acting was so wooden the actors must have gone to stare at some trees to get into character. Absolutely no chemistry between the two protagonists. Plot was slow, silly and unrealistic. Literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Fell asleep halfway through - woke up hoping it had all been a bad dream. Was bummed to realise it hadn't.The disk makes an attractive drinks coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable movie...","review":"...\\"IF\\" you take it for what it's worth. This movie is, at heart, just a glorified teeny-bopper romantic comedy. If you approach it from that angle, with those expectations, I think you'll find it to be very good.There is lots of gorgeous scenery (both of Europe and Mandy Moore) and lots of cute romance, centered around a semi-clever plot. It's kind of cheesey at times, but you have to expect that when watching a movie like this. You're obviously just kidding yourself if you go into something like this expecting an Oscar worthy film. But if you, like me, also enjoy fun escapist romantic comedies that aren't bogged down in too much substance, then you'll probably love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandy Moore Does It Again!","review":"I have seen all of Mandy Moore's movies (including this one) and I have to say she is one of the best actresses of our time! I own this movie on dvd and you should 2! Ths movie does get a little boring at times but still you should see it! This movie bombed at the box office because some people can't see a good movie from a bad movie and this one was GOOD! It has great scenery, comedy and even some action! I say if you want 2 see a actual good movie then see this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Liberty M Goode","review":"Worth a view - light comedy, some playful lines and carried by actors Matthew Goode and Mark Harmon. Nice lay back on the couch and enjoy film, pleasant and enjoyable comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Okay Movie*","review":"A nice little movie for fans of Mandy Moore.I really like romantic comedies and this was one.Okay movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for the Techno/Rave song played at the Love Parade?","review":"Well, so was I. But seeing how there is no soundtrack to Chasing Liberty whatsoever, I had to track down this song myself. As difficult as it was, its worth it. Unfortunately, atleast on Amazon, there is no place for you to preview this song to see if its the one you want, but even if it isn't, if you like a good beat, you probably won't be sorry. So, without furthur ado, the song is called Satisfaction and it is by Benny Benassi featuring Biz. I hope anyone who was looking for this song like I was won't have to go through the trouble that I did. Other than that, I really didn't enjoy this movie that much. I liked the footage of the Love Parade and the Benny Benassi song, and so for that I am giving it one star. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Chick Flick","review":"I enjoyed this movie. While it is pretty much the same as First Daughter, you have to remember that Chasing Liberty came out AFTER First Daughter. If you like \\"Chick-Flicks\\" you should try this one out. I liked it because the movie kept moving at a fairly good pace and added a few little twists here and there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cute movie","review":"....with beautiful scenary.

A fun, fluff movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars. if so","review":"I am a young person, but this movie just didn't tickle me in any way. I like Mandy Moore and sure she does a fine acting job for the kind of movie she does, but this movie wasn't the best.For one, it was totally unrealistic in NOT a good way. She is the presidents daughter, and because of that her freedom is limited. She gets a ride from a boy on a motorcycle, acts crazy, and the movie ends from there. The boy ends up being a secret agent who is protecting her on purpose. She has some drinks, gets drunk, exposes her bare ass, and the guy still falls in love with her.Obviously, it's a love story and the two do fall in love...The movie wasn't my favorite even though the male actor Matthew Goode looks good. Obviously, that doesn't make a movie good just because some actor is a hotty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Movie","review":"\\"Chasing Liberty\\" was such an awesome movie. Mandy Moore was excellent in portraying a president's daughter who's only wish is to have more freedom. She looks excellent and acts really well. Matthew Goode, who plays her secret service agent/love interest is amazing. He is such a good actor and his looks don't hurt him at all. He definitely is the next \\"Brad Pitt\\"...although cuter!! Go see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the soundtrack?","review":"I was hoping to find a soundtrack CD for this movie. The movie reminds me of some of my travels through Europe as a college student, though the story here was predictable. I thought the music throughout the movie was very catchy and would like to listen to more."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I agree with many previous posters that the portrayal of inept Secret Service agents is kind of scary. However, that's not why I didn't like the movie. I was disturbed that a supposedly intelligent and politically savvy daughter of the President would so little value herself as to throw herself at anyone willing to take her virginity. Of course, Ben resisted her the first time, but gave in when it seemed the alternative was to witness her hooking up with GusGus. Where was her pride and where was his sense of decency?It also bothered me that the McGruff character was treated so lightly after his theft of their money left the pair penniless in Europe.On another note, Mandy Moore is a beautiful and statuesque young woman. They should cast her opposite a similar physical type. Matthew Goode is tall enough but looks like a pinhead pencil neck geek paired with Mandy. Is anyone else bothered by the fact her head is bigger than his?"},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!","review":"Hands down this is the worst movie that I have ever seen in my life. In all honesty I couldn't believe that it was this bad. Mandy Moore is a miserable actress, she was completely unbelivable and very unemotional. The plot line was ridiculously stupid & upsetting. Looks like Moore's first flop ('How to Deal') will be closely followed by her second."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cute movie","review":"While the story line is pretty predictable, I do enjoy the work of Mandy Moore, she is a talented actress that contributed to this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!!, wonderfull romance movie, (If that's what u're looking for)","review":"This is on my top 5 romance movies. I have seen it something like 5 times already. I really, really, really recommend it if you like very romantic movies, with lots of nice cities views.

I patiently waited for something that would make me think differently of the movie, but I could actually predict what would happen. I didn't think there was any chemistry between Mandy and Matthew Goode -- they are both attractive on their own, but not together. I've always thought the world of European scenery, but not this time. Too obvious, too Americanized, not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on, you know you like it.","review":"Let me just start off with yes, I love romantic fluff, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. This was a great piece of romantic fluff to watch on a lazy afternoon. It wasn't boring, the lead characters looked good, and it had a great soundtrack. Sure, you could drive a Mac truck through the plot holes, and I'd be pretty scared if the secret service was as dimwitted as they were in this movie, but it still did not take away from my enjoyment of the movie. If your a realist and hate quality cheese, save your time and money, and don't watch this movie. However, if you're like me and like happy endings, cute kisses, and leaving reality back in the real world, you may just enjoy this flick too. Good job, Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of my favourite","review":"I so enjoyed Mandy Moore in Walk to Remember, but this movie was a very big disappointment. It lacked depth and was not a patch on First Daughter. I kept waiting for it to take off and my thoughts at the end was it was a story all about a young woman having a tantrum looking for someone to take her to bed to give her value. Even The President lacked any depth and yet he is one of my favourite i NCIS, I dont miss this TV show. Sorry I bought the dvd and wont recommended it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"one lie leads to another","review":"This story is about the Prisedents daughter wanting to have some freedom on a trip to Europe and all the problrms she gets into on her way to the Love parade.She is being watched and gayrded without her knowledge by a guy she tinks likes her.Each country they go through something funny and sad happens.Yhe characters are sttrong and the people who play them are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to the dentist instead","review":"Let's see here...

The only points of interest in this ppv are Brett Hart vs. Booker T and Eddie vs. Chavo, hair vs. hair. Brett Hart vs. Booker is just the building up of Booker's character and another gunshot right in the head of Brett Hart's career. Also, this is bogus. There has not been an official WCW product on sale since 2001. I know that WWE could release this if it wanted to, but why? Why release this over, say, a landmark like Bash At The Beach 96?

Every step in the movie is predictible, the actors are miscast, and there is no chemistry between the two lovebirds. Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode act next to each other not with each other.

It's not very original and you know that they're all gonna live happily ever after, and there are no surprises or plot twists, just Mandy Moore taking her clothes off, and for guys that's a plus. All in all it's okay, but I believe a Walk to Remember was much better than this outing for Mandy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Love Story","review":"Take it for what it is...a cute, fun love story. I like these kinds of movies, but if you don't...then don't watch it. Mandy Moore is a likable character as the president's daughter. All she wants is a little freedom and chance to get away from the Secret Service agents. She can't date and is a frustrated 18 year old girl. The story takes Anna on an unforgettable journey where she finds adventure, love, and heartbreak. It's a good story with a happy ending. Nothing more...nothing less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural Acting for Mandy Moore","review":"SO what if this is a remake of an older flick! So many movies have been! I believe Freaky Friday was the 3rd or fourth remake of an adult becoming a child and vice versa! There was one with Fred Savage, Judd Reinhold, Dudley, Moore Kirk Cameron, etc. All I know is that the acting gets better with many actors/actresses, and thank God it doesn't seem so forced or fake. Over-doing a good script can ruin one's imagination and sense of romanticism. Heck, in a violent world, this is a vacation away from the sick society we still have to deal with until we move on to that greater unknown. Great work, Mandy!I'll probably buy everything you make!

It is about a 39 year old married man falling in love/lust with a sheltered 17 year old girl. He seduces her; then leaves her after telling her father what he has done. She is devastated. Eventually she goes to college and meets a young man who is none other than the \\"hero's ?\\" son.

It's been awhile since I've read a Harlequin Presents that is just different. Even though it was written in 1979, this book totally enthralled me. The hero and heroine had very distinct personalities and were not cookie cutter characters at all. Even though HP novels tend to have a specific number of pages, Charlotte Lamb was able to incorporate everything there to satisfy me, the dream, the heartache, the pain, forgiveness, the loving ~_~ I too do not want to spoil the story, so all I can say is get this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it is not worth even free","review":"well i own it for two days and it already giving me trouble like half way into the movie it freezes with all the movies and so it start playing from the beginning but then i had to go thru it to find were i was and i well and it seem it be playing fine but it do it again and it also started as if the motor on it about to go out and also own another gpx dvd before but was not great either had that one for a month and the laser went out on that one too"},{"rating":"1","title":"Went out on a limb and...","review":"I decided to give this one a chance since the price was so good and it was a compact player. It didn't play some of our DVD's correctly, and then it stopped working. Too bad, it sure cleared up some shelf space being so small compared to our old player. It also seemed like the disc tray was really fragile because it was so thin. I shipped it back and will probably go for a better name brand for a few extra bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD Player","review":"I bought this dvd player to replace a dvd player that would not play rented movies. This player has the same problem. It plays the previews fine but locks up or displays a choppy, purple, pixilated screen when the movie starts. Burned video from my camcorder works fine. Avoid if you buy or rent movies. Mine is personally headed for the landfill and I barely got to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - I guess we get what we paid for","review":"Purchased this DVD player 6 months ago - used very infrequently. This morning tried to get the RENTED DVD out and the thing wouldn't turn on. Spoke to customer service rep who politely informed me that warranty lasts 90 days so I'm out of luck. Ended up taking the whole thing apart myself to get the dvd out - after that pieces are going in the trash..... Oh well, at least I didn't spend a lot of money in the first place. I still feel like I threw the money straight in the trash can...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely acceptable","review":"Mine could play Netflix rentals without any problems. However, several months into its lifespan, when I'd turn it on it wouldn't always stay on. But once I got it to stay on it would stay on indefinitely, so I just left it on full-time. But today when I inserted a DVD, it shut off and wouldn't turn on again. I had to take the housing off to retrieve the DVD.I agree with the reviewers who hate the remote. It's hard to use, and you need a clear unobstructed line of sight for it to work. I'm not buying one of these ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall","review":"For the price, you can't beat it. Yes, the picture frame is pretty cheaply made but for my 3 year old it's fine. Plus, you don't really notice it once you've put a picture in it and set it up. It's not like you handle it constantly. The toy bucket things are great. They're much bigger than I thought they'd be so can hold quite a bit. The measuring chart is fabric with a velcro side so you can move a fabric made jewel up and down to mark the height. The bookends and the coat rack are made well and look great. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not great quality","review":"This is a cute and convenient set for quick redecorating. The quality isn't great - the picture frame came a bit scratched, and height chart has really rough fabric, and the bookends are really light. I do like the bins, they seem sturdy. Overall, it's an okay set but I don't know if it will last long term."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, fast-paced read!!","review":"I finished this book in 2 days because I simply could not put it down.

So it was very eye opening to me, but more because of the deceit and lies from Mr. Cunningham. He evidentally felt he could \\"have his cake and eat it too\\"....but sooner or later the cake is gone and the empty plate is exposed to everyone. The damage he did to these two women is inexcusable. I had hoped to understand him, but I am afraid I never did. But I did understand it from the viewpoint of the Mistress and the Mrs. This book was interesting and read like a diary. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING TRUE STORY","review":"I think that this book was a good, quick read. It was amazing to me to see how people can get involved with another person and think that there are no reprocussions for their bad choices. How this man plotted to deceive his wife, daughters, parents and even his employeer, is indicitive of a narcissistic person. He truely only cares about himself, and his self image.

I found myself saying a dozen times, \\"Oh yeah, I love this song when I hear it at the club...but I never knew what it was called!\\" Every single one of my friends bought this album after hearing the titles alone, and we listen to it constantly. Despite the steep price, this import compilation is worth every cent because it delivers such a cohesive, exciting, and fresh group of songs all in one product.

Not one bad song on this disc set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ron Howard's Quest","review":"Ron's poetry is meticulously written in meter and rhyme, but it is in reading the entire book that its meaning is found. His book is a continuum of questions about life's journey, the world, society, the universe, love, God, and all that comes into his mind and heart as he travels onward seeking answers.Ron is not content with the world as it is, but seeks both to define and change it for a world where love is the perfect key to happiness.As he describes through his poetic words his lack of hope, pain, loss, or despair of finding that love in his environment, he takes the reader step by step into his life on a philosopher's internal journey to find the key,In the final chapters of the book, peace seems to settle over his spirit as his questions are answered and life becomes meaningful for him. This is a beautiful quest for love and fulfillment expressed in poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doyle is great.","review":"I listen to a lot of blues and blues related, inluenced etc. music and even though I love it, it can wear on you after awhile. Especially when it is a continual stream of classic retreads of people trying to better the originals or perhaps just trying to prove that they can play them as good as the original performer (which is rarely ever the case). Doyle is not one of those people. Even on his previous cds, his covers were injected with his own ideas and personality. On this cd of all originals he does a great job. Big beats and cool guitars are the call of the day. His singing is superb. The first time I heard him it was more than a little apparent where Stevie Ray Vaughn learned to sing. Don't be confused on this, it was definatly Doyle doing the teaching. Maybe not a total monster but scarey as hell.

However, as mentioned in previous reviews, it doesn't take long before the feathers start to come out. I thought for the price, I would try it and hope for the best. Unfortunately, my comforter did the same as others and with it being a dark brown, it is very noticeable that the feathers are coming out. This is not just an occasional feather either. It started out that way, but after a week or two, it is all the time. I especially notice it in the stitching areas. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not able to use","review":"The comforter is soft and pretty however, it isn't very full and fluffy.

Her lower ranges are better than ever and in songs like \\"Real Love\\" and \\"Are You Leaving Me Now?\\" long-time fans will hear and appreciate her vocal efforts. Ms. Bofill has one of the most balanced and delicious jazz/r&b voices around, unfortunately, she's been involved in several past projects that did not use her powerful instrument to its full potential. Her strong points are her ballads. \\"Love In Slow Motion\\" is her best effort in years. Let's hope she continues to utilize that amazing voice in future endeavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Jazz and Soul!!","review":"A superb songwriter with a gorgeous voice that ranges from sultry lows to siren highs. This 1996 CD compares favorably with Bofill's peak material from the GRP years (i.e. \\"I Try\\", \\"The Feelin's Love\\" and \\"Under The Moon...\\"). Almost every song is a winner. \\"Galaxy Of My Love\\" is a smoky 70's-style soul ballad. \\"Sail Away\\" is a percussive, latin-flavored mid-tempo stunner. My personal favorite is \\"Love Changes\\", a near-perfect jazz/R&B amalgam. Others standouts are the title track, \\"All She Wants Is Love\\" and \\"Let Them Talk\\". Bofill falters only on the pedestrian\\"Guess You Didn't Know\\" and the shrill \\"Are You Leaving Me Now?\\".

I suppose it could work as a children's book. I think many adults drawn to this subject will find it simplistic and trite, so I would recommend other books for them.

Cold Snap has some of my favorite stories, Cold Snap and Dynamite Hands, the middle of the book isn't as strong. This book is a let down from his first two. The opening story is strong, though it isn't as good as \\"As of July 6...\\" in The Pugilist, which has the same characters. But it has a great scene with Sonny Liston and some funny lines. Mouses is a good story. He read that at the reading I attended. Tarantula wasn't bad either. But in general, it gets a little too silly and Jones is not in the zone. This downfall of material in the late nineties is similar to Paul Auster, one of my other favorite writers. Hopefully one of them will produce something up to their standard in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pretty Small Book For A Big Man To Write","review":"After reading Jones' first collection, I felt that I had found the best American short story writer since Carver (who was the best since Hemingway). His second collection, though not as strong, confirmed that view. And that's why I am so TREMENDOUSLY disappointed in this third collection, which suffers from shocking lapses in professional skill, gratuitous and bizarre ugliness, and blatant confusion and point-of-view contradictions. Is T.J. undergoing a breakdown? Certainly his writing is. But someone of his talent can come back. Oh, yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre work from a great writer","review":"Although The Pugilist at Rest is one of the best books I've read, Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine is a real let down. Although there are some really good stories in here, there are others that are questionable at best. \\"Roadrunner\\", for instance, seems to be merely an excuse for an anecdote in \\"A Run Through the Jungle\\". \\"40, Still at Home\\" has its moments of humor but really goes nowhere in terms of story. Many of these pieces seem to be included (and published) because Mr. Jones is hot property. There are point of view problems and structural problems. He is a very talented writer--one of the best out there--but this is a weak collection with only a few shining moments. Buy it if you are a hardcore fan, but don't if you are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy's a sham","review":"I'm so tired of hearing about how Thom Jones is master of his gritty, testosterone-filled world. If Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine is any indication of his talent, then the guy is a writer of cliches that he knows nothing about. Every scenario is SO overblown, and so over-simplified - it's as if he can't be bothered to \\"know\\" his stuff as long as he can find a handy stereotype (drawing from bad movies). Don't even get me started on the fact that he can't even spell his Hawaiian street names right in \\"You Cheated, You Lied\\". Why bother to set an 80 page story in a place you know so little about? I bought this book for my husband based solely on Jones' reputation, and frankly I am embarrassed.If you want to read a true master, pick up Denis Johnson's \\"Jesus' Son.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The title story and \\"Fields of Purple Forever,\\" are the only bright spots in this otherwise dreary collection, and even these stories don't work with the power and precision of stories from Jones' previous two collections.Jones is an author who writes about what he knows. He is a former marine and an ex-boxer, and therefore marines and boxers feature largely in his stories. However, this collection unfortunately shows that this is not a formula with unlimited longevity. His previous two collections of short stories were masterpieces, but in _Sonny Liston_ Jones runs out of gas.If you appreciated the clever originality and gritty authenticity of _Cold Snap _ and _Pugilist_ you will likely be disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's Lost His Title Belt","review":"I am a huge fan of Jone's supreme first collection of stories, Pugilist At Rest. But with the competent Cold Snap and the completely lackluster, Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine, Jones seems to following the path of many great heavyweight fighters. Once the win the belt the get fat and lazy, in Jone's case he rehashes many old themes with language that tries to have the old zip but falls embarasingly short. The title story, Tarantula, and Mouses come close to what his genius used to be but even they have this forced quality that makes me want to beat the crap out of his editor.Someone should have told the champ not to step into the ring with these stories. I have faith that he can make a comeback, but, unfortunatley, with this recent collection mediocrity has knocked him down for the ten count.

Well I for one ate it up. I'm very impressed by this writer. He is one of those writers that makes me feel amazed that I am alive while he is actually producing these wonders. My only criticism of this book is a tiny one-- i felt disappointed in \\"A Run Through the Jungle\\" when Jones felt it necessary to point out the karmic significance of the fiery death of the road-runner killer. I just felt he should have had a bit more confidence in his readers' abilities to make that connection on their own. But that's it- my only complaint. Other than that- WOW! This book is incredibly well-written and the characters are amazing. Jones is a huge huge talent and i am certain that there will be many many a book report assigned on his work in future high-school/college English classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Pugilest at Rest","review":"First of all, i loved Thom Jones first two books. However, this one is not up to snuff. Maybe it's because his first two books were excellent and my standards for Jones are high. But Sonny Liston is awful. The stories have no closure, and you are often left wondering \\"is that it? did i miss something?\\" I'd love to get my money back on this one. Hopefully this is not indicative of what is left to come from Jones. He is much better than this book. Stick with Cold Snap and Pugilest at Rest.

And Jason has always been a killer, not a torturer. In this book he dices up every (and I mean every) victim before they die. Lastly, the movie was called Jason X...do when have to refer to him for now on as Jason X? That was annoying to constantly read.

This version of Pandora's Box is a pristine print, but the four musical score that it come with are lousy. They are boring and sleep inducing rather than hypnotic. The scores that Criterion produced add nothing to the impact of the film, rather they diminish the impact of Pandora's Box. If anyone has a copy of the version with the marvelous piano score that I remember from the television version introduced by Marion Seldes please let me know where to buy one.

I’ve had the album for the last four days and I’ve listened to Folk Singer, Good to Me and You’re Quiet at least three times a day. The rest of the album not so much.Since Benson is from the D, I expected something a lot less pop and a little more rock. The slower tracks have a Beatlesque sort of feel. I love the Beatles. But let’s admit that a lot of their earlier songs were bubblegum rock and unfortunately so are many on this album. Lapalco is full of catchy riffs and lyrical hooks which you’ll find yourself humming throughout the day.

I went to see him in Oregon and NY in the early 90's and think that One Mississippi was one of the finest records ever.

I was so happy to see he was touring again and that this new record was out. For those old schoolers, it is a departure, but a more matured and thoughtful effort. A pop gem to be sure. I am hopeful that this record will be, like the one prior, a permanant member in my steady rotation. Also, if you like Brendan, you should check out greydoesmatter.com. This guy is a powerpop hero.

There are dancers walking down buildings and across walls, dancers signalling from rooftops, and several versions Trisha Brown's accumulation pieces. By the time we get to the last piece (Watermotor, 1979), we are starting to see the complex, fluid movement that charaterises later classic pieces such as Set and Reset.

The illustrations are all drawings in color, very vivid and full of detail and human emotion. Of course it isn't great art--but it sure could set a kid's imagination on fire. As a 10 year old, the pictures really made me realize history was \\"real\\" and that people back then were human just like us.Actually, I was more inspired by these drawings then by the more glitzy DK Eyewitness series. The Eyewitness series is all photographs of artifacts or dressed up actors standing stiffly with emotionless faces...so it doesn't make history feel alive at all. These illustrations do. You might also want to check out \\"See Through History\\"...they have some pretty inspiring (for a kid) drawings too."},{"rating":"2","title":"What if all the Women were missing?","review":"Imagine a world with only men, with a social structure developed on homosexual relationships.

Chandler handles the transition well.Gay characters are treated with empathy and allowed individual dignity, which is quite commendable considering when this book was written and its target audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graco DuoGlider - Tango in the Tongo","review":"I can steer this stroller while its fully loaded with kids and gear, and it turns on a dime. It maneuvers like a dream! It folds differently than the single stroller, which took getting used to, but now I can fold it up and chuck it in my minivan with one hand, all while holding a baby in the other. Awesome. I live in the sunny South, so I love the two canopies.Note: Amazon's Product Description is inaccurate for this particular model on three points:1. This stroller does not come with a rear snack tray, it comes with an \\"arm bar\\".2. The rear seat can be all the way up or all the way flat - there is no multi-position recline.3. There is one parent cup holder, not two.Since I need the lure of food to keep the kids in the stroller, the lack of a rear snack tray was a major disappointment for me. (The trays can be bought from Graco for $19.99). The two-position recline and single cup holder were less significant problems for me. All in all, I love my new stroller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough trunk space","review":"I'm still shopping for a double-stroller and had high hopes for this model. I found it in a store and asked an employee to help make sure that it would fit in my trunk before purchasing it. Unfortunately, this stroller was too big for the rather roomy trunk in my new Nissan Altima. Hoping that maybe the Quattro Tour, which is supposedly 20% smaller when folded will fit, otherwise it may be time to trade in the car for the mommy-van. I can't really speak to the other features of the stroller, but just wanted to share that it does not fit in the trunk of an Altima."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Grandma","review":"My daughter and I had researched double strollers on the web.

I just did a flooring job a couple of days ago and had to undercut 4 doors in a small area. With this blade and a piece of the flooring as a spacer, I completed all four door in less than 20 minutes.

If you hate buzzing sounds like I do, you'll despise these torture devices.I would not recommond these slippers to anyone. They are too noisy and only vibrate, not massage.

If you have healthy feet they will feel bad soon and if they are in pain they will be worse. Homedics should be ashamed of this product and pull it off the market this is the worst product I have tried yet of any type of anything on the market all categories I think.

When I first got it I wasn't impressed. Then I tried it last night after being on my feet most of the day and I could barely contain myself as the balls massaged my feet. So its very dependant on how bad your feet need to be worked out. On days when they are fine it will just feel like balls rolling around. On days that you have stressed them it will feel like feathers! The only downside is that you need to be careful with the balls hitting the bones on your feet. I don't have meaty feet and sometimes the balls grind on the bone and that is not pleasant.

I'm a 195 lb. man, and the weight of my feet was just too much for the unit to handle. I tried using the massager on just one foot at a time, as other users had recommended, but even this proved too great a burden for the machine to bear. The ball bearings on the massage plates are made of plastic, rather than steel. The drive mechanism is grossly underpowered, and simply not robust enough for its intended use. The motor slowed, then stopped altogether. It's ridiculous that anyone could actually charge money for this.We bought a Medirub after returning this. It costs much more, about $175, but it is still working years later, and it's an amazingly powerful and solid product.

The circular motion of, and the massage points on, the machine do not reproduce the feel of a deep foot rub. The enjoyment comes mostly from just having something to get the blood flowing a little by the light contact it makes.

However, it was obvious from day one that this product is manufactured to sub-standard quality and will not stand the test of time. The unit slows down dramatically when applying a little extra pressure and the motor and/or drive mechanism begin to squeal from the strain. I've found that I can only apply the correct amount of pressure with one foot and not both or the unit will come to a standstill. Once again, overall, the product does provide relief but the quality of the product, including the on/off switch needs to be improved dramatically. The ergonomic design of the product could use some re-engineering as well.

I had the HoMedics FM-CR Foot Pleaser Foot Massager in my cupboard in the bathroom and decided to see if using this would bring relief. I sat in my recliner (not reclining) and gently placed my feet on the device (using infrared setting) and even forgot I was using it. I probably used it for a couple of hours or more. All pain and swelling is gone this morning when I awoke! I used it for a little while this morning and I can still feel the action on my feet after being off it for the last 1/2 hour! Love it! I do recommend wearing a pair of socks when using this product and just gently placing your feet on it, not stepping down on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to assist in breaking upscar tissue in foot post op","review":"I received this as a gift and did not take it out of the box for 2 yrs. Then I broke my tibial sesamoid ( bone in the foot). I eventually needed surgery and them promptly developed scar tiussue along the incision line. After the incision was healed a few weeks, I started to use this to both desensitize the incision line and break up the scar tisssue right around it. I used it the first time with heat for 10 minutes, albiet gently, and it was already starting to desensitze the scar area. This is a great relief, since the incision site was so sensitive before I started using it. If this only works till the motor burns out, as other responders have said, to me, its worth it's weight in gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop running or working after 3 days","review":"I like to try it out but after 3 days the motor burn out.

They say to only use it while sitting in a chair, I however use it while laying in my bed with a pillow under my ankles and my feet on the massager. That way I am able to get other areas besides just the bottom of my feet. I have paid tons of money for foot massages and am often dissapointed, with this device I am am able to work out the stress rigth where I need to, the rolling balls get in very deep and you adjust the pressure accordingly.

I returned the item and exchanged it for a new one. Another 2 weeks later and the exact same problem has reoccurred.

The rotating massagers feel like you are walking on marbles. The massaging pads are not soothing to the feet at all. The instructions say to allow a few moments for the infrared heat to warm up.

Thinking it was some sort of fluke, I looked it up and found this page which contains several other accounts of this product crapping out on the first use. Seems to me a product this shoddy should have been recalled a long time ago and taken back to the lab for retooling.Ignore any other decent or shining reviews of this product.

The \\"romance\\" is pot-boiler, fill-in-the-blanks, auto-pilot romance writing at its worst. The author of this attempt at romance completely misses the mark with undeveloped, unremarkable characters and a storyline that leaves you out in the cold. Pickens should head back to the country club or take a few practice strokes out on the driving range before attempting another \\"romance\\" again. This \\"Stroke of Luck\\" cost me $5.00 and left me frigid.... I think I would have found more heat in a golf magazine and more luck at a blackjack table.

This work is a movie in music format. The arrangement have an harmonic orchestration. For him, one album is a complete history, not a fragmented number of peaces.

You won't mind the repeated re-reading your kids will demand of Aerorace and will likely find yourself sneaking it from them after they fall asleep to more closely pour over the delightful, detailed illustrations. Jay Sopp displays his mastery of the sight gag, in each lovingly rendered page which harkens back in style and subject to a simpler time...a time when bears and flightless birds emblazened trails in the new frontiers. After meeting Penny and Polo, your kids will likely choose to set off on their their own expeditions through the house and yard in search of adventure, and who could blame them? To be like Penny and Polo is to be engaged in your world, and that's where life becomes meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A verty dull and boring experience","review":"This book has to be one of the worst books I have encountered in my long and distinquished reading career.

This one goes for the guts......","review":"William Wharton (presumably a pseudonymn for a well known author), tells a remarkable story of a bunch of high intellectual 19-year old soldiers caught up in the brutality of the second world war. Not your usual war novel, this one hits you where it hurts. Read it, if it's the last thing you do in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"War Never Makes Sense","review":"The book is well written and deals with a group of young soldiers (German and American) that find themselves in a unique situation during WWII. How they handle this and how it goes terribly wrong is actually a good study of the mindset of many young soldiers that have been sent to kill other young soldiers by their governments and politicians that really have no clue what actual combat does to a man.This work makes it pretty clear what really goes on in the minds of soldiers. The reason I gave it only 4 stars was just the fact that it seemed a little 'slow' it its' development and, in my humble opinion, had a rather odd, uneventful ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absurdity and the horrors of war","review":"Wharton's book taken most likely from his experiences in the military is a little bit uneven.

The main reason for getting a filter is to protect that lensfrom soil, shock and possible breakage.

While I can fully recommend doing so, I would not recommend using this book as a your travel guide.Often we found inaccuracies or even misleading information, particularly when travelling outside the charter tourist hot spots. We were often sent on wild goose chases by the so-called guide book. It is also often lacking in detailed information about the location of interesting things/places to see, so you could only read about it, but not locate it. Consistently we found the quoted prices to be wrong - sometimes actual prices were more than double the quoted prices (the book had been finished 1 years before we travelled, it was in the low season and annual inflation had been less than 5 per cent, so there is no obvious explanation for this)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for some practicalities, not much info on what's there","review":"This book is for people who want a bare-bones listings of accommodations and a couple of restaurant recommendations for every town. There's very little information on the countries themselves in terms of culture or history, and almost nothing on what there is to see when you get there. This doesn't mean that it's a bad book, but you should not expect it to point you in the direction of something interesting to see that you wouldn't have known about otherwise. I feel like there are other books on the market that do a better job of that.

His work addresses the shifting intellectual positions of Ruskins and the influence of modern thought on his positions.

I have read only Stones of Venice, Elements of Drawing, and at times found it difficult to follow the line of thought.Not a light read and it does require considerable concentration but well worth it to set aside much of the modernist/ post modernist position as sophistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossing to Safety?","review":"This novel is about two couples whose lives have been intertwined for years.

Paul Smith illustrates that a death is as individual as a life. His skill as a pastor gives us insight into ways we can help loved ones face death. His openness in describing the feelings he went through while being \\"in the moment\\" with dying friends is of benefit to any who are faced with the death of a loved one. And the way in which he frames death, as an integral part of life, is of benefit to all who seek wholeness in their own soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"An uplifting and readable book for everyone.","review":"This book makes us all think about our time on this Earth. It is not only for those who are in the process of dealing with a dying loved one or who have had to go through the death of a loved one, it is for the living. It makes us think about how we spend each day and more importantly how we interact with others each day. The stories are readable and engaging right away. It doesn't matter if the person is one of the famous ones discussed such as Arthur Ashe, or more unknown, you are immediately drawn into their story. A very valuable book not only for ministers and health professionals, but for the general public as well. It takes a hard subject and makes it accessible and uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Euthanasia","review":"This book is not about the inevitability of death -- it's about euthanasia, the killing of those who are \\"supposedly\\" terminally ill.

All the platitudes and distortions of Scripture espoused by this author will never overcome the obvious truth that none of us have the right to kill another, even if that person is weary and ready to die.

The attacks on 9/11 and other terrorist activities over the past decade had gradually convinced the President that the internationalist view espoused by Bill Clinton and his own father was simply no longer the answer. Bush has chosen instead to embark on a new unilateralist course favored by most of his senior advisors that the authors argue may be somewhat productive in the short run but likely to be a disaster over the long haul. Extremely well written, thoughtful and meticulously documented, this book should be an essential read for any citizen seeking to get up to speed on foreign policy issues before the 2004 Presidential election."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you agreed with Pres Clinton's handling of terrorism ....","review":"Mr. Daalder was a believer in \\"limited missile use\\" and that's what we got from Mr. Clinton regarding terrorism. And, like Clinton, he believes we need the United Nation's approval, which is apparently what Mr. Clinton also wanted and never got; thus, he let them tie his hands in really addressing the threat. There may be a different solution than that posed by the present administration, Mr. Daalder's is not the way.

When I first opened it, I noticed how weak the battery cover and USB plug were, because they can be opened with almost no effort, making it easy to accidentaly drop and lose.Despite it's features, the battery will last for about 3 hours or less playing music, and it happened that sometimes the screen will go black and I have to remove the battery, wait some seconds, and reinstall it to make it work again!I also purchased a Sandisk SANSA m200 for a friend of mine, and definitely, it has a more robust design and more easy-to-use interface, and battery will last for more hours!Sure it is cheaper than others brands, but the quality on the product is definitely inferior.

A hapless GI returns from Viet Nam to find himself entangled in a government search for a fellow American who has defected to the enemy.Is it true? What were the circumstances?

This novel is proof that he was wrong. The characters are stereotypes from the '50s. The business and social formality depicted was probably current when Asimov wrote the short story in 1958, sadly dated as the novel was written in the '80s, and a ludicrous extrapolation for the future setting.The problem is exacerbated by an apparent lack of editing. Perhaps the combination of two famous names led the publisher to skip any serious editing. Maybe nobody actually read the book before it was set in print -- how else can you explain gaffes such as taking \\"a long deep sip\\" of a drink?The combination of clumsy storytelling and bad writing turned a decent, though dated, short story into a dismal novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bonds of Iron","review":"A small group of men and I are going through this book right now.

I have recommended Ship of Gold to my management team so that they can see how one individual was able to harness the brains and money of a many to accomplish his goals.

I am and have been a huge fan of Jazz. Sam Roberts is obviously not a Jazz artist but a great musician with whom I will enjoy even if I do sometimes put Jazz on a pedestil. His album is full of very veritable yet great tunes. The album is surprising in that almost all fourteen tracks are listenable and not one filler tune. It's not just an album with the intent of showing off a hit or two. It is the work of an actual artist who is well on his way of (hopefully) leading the way for others who want their music heard, not just a cover song... ah um, alien ant farm,...

Roberts' \\"We Were Born in Flame\\" presents a lush and enjoyable listening experience throughout the entrie album. The songs range from casual rock reminisent of the Spin Doctors to a more mellow Spoon sound. He is able to extract old influences (ie Beatles) and creatively rework them to create a unique original sound. Roberts has a voice similar to that of the Beta Band but applies that a sound more rock oriented. Not too hard but not to soft. Overall, a good combination of guitar, percussion, and piano makes this cd worth buying and worth multiple listens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so talented","review":"Ok, the cd sounds ok (polished studio recording), but if ever hear him live, you'll quickly realise how bad he really is.

While some of the songs on this album are \\"all right\\", none are truly stellar and some, quite frankly, aren't that good. This album had potential (Don't Walk Away Eileen, Brother Down), but came off a little formulaic (On The Run, Dead End).I am a huge music fan, and some of the music I like the best is from Canadian artists.

But alas, though it was suspenseful at times, the story felt to me thin. The first third of the book I found fascinating and well constructed, but then the story seemed to march in place, more or less, until the finale. If Trollope wrote this novel for serialization, this could explain why huge swaths of background information were repeated at intervals in the middle of the book. Every seventy pages or so, he would tell me at length what I already knew, at which point I would skim ahead, looking for new developments. Still, the themes and characters kept me going, not to mention Trollope's fluid prose. Sometimes it was only his writing style that held my interest, not so much whatever was being imparted.

It's almost as if it was a class assignment that had to be a certain length and related to WWII.Most of the characters are one dimensional, and you never (at least I didn't) have any reason to care what happened to Jared Cleaves or his family or Detroit for that matter.

The series began with three well written books, and although each book was written by a different author and each had their strengths and weaknesses, they did seem to flow as part of a larger story.

I had to make a decision to quit reading the entire series because of the vapid writing in this book or force myself through it to get to the last two books. The author does not write well as part of a collaborative series. Arbitrary changes to characters and shallow story lines created a book that changes the story line of the entire series, making it challenging for the follow on authors to develop the characters.

That changed dramatically with Extinction. This bears very little resemblance to the first 3 and if it weren't labeled book IV I would take it for being an unrelated story and characters. I do hope the next 2 are better, this was a very painful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a BIG let down!!","review":"To think we had to wait for that! The first three books were so amazing I didn't think anyone could have messed the story up, until Extinction. In my opinion the characters personalities were way off in this book. The story didn't seem to accomplish anything and was boring. The others seemed to have a direction or goal and by the end they achieved that goal. It lacked the use of interesting spells like the first three. Smedman seemed to use only the basic spells, nothing interesting or new. It did accomplish one thing, it left me wanting. Now I'm no expert or anything like that. These are just the opinions of someone who has read a few books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guaranteed to blow your mind....","review":"This 2 CD set focuses on the Temptations' psychedelic period and features new, unreleased extended versions of \\"Ball Of Confusion\\" and \\"Psychedelic Shack\\". For the die-hard Temptation fan, there is really nothing new here other than the extended cuts. The rest are songs you probably already own, as most of them are on the box set Emperors of Soul. But for the newbie who doesn't own a lot of Temptations music, this is like finding gold. These CDs have the major psychedelic funk and soul hits and popular album selections that the group made with Norman Whitfield producing after Dennis Edwards joined them. From \\"Cloud Nine\\" to \\"1990\\", you will see why Norman Whitfield was considered to be a musical genius, and how truly talented and vocally gifted the Temptations were. My favorites: \\"You Make Your Own Heaven and Hell Right Here On Earth\\", \\"Take A Stroll Through Your Mind\\" and \\"Message From a Black Man\\". Powerful stuff!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"motown getting psychedelic","review":"yeah this is the temps stuff I digf the hardcore funk stuiff not too hardcore norman whitfield influenced by hendrix, sly stone and funkadelic decided that tiomes were a changing and he changed the temps sound I ,love these songs psychedelic shack, cloud nine, take a stroll through your mind, runaway child running child, slave, message from a black man this is full of drug references and believe me getting high is recommended on these jams. oh yeah george clinton himself said that psychedelic shack was funkadelic material that he gave to whitfield.it's been proven that whgitfield would go to funkadelic gigs in the late 60's and record the band then have studio musicians copy the guitar riffs. as a matter of fact the guitar riffs on here sound similiar to the stuff p funk was doing at this timwe cherck out the parliaments i wanna testify. norman whitfield was a big p funk fan and he used eddie hazel, and billy bass nelson on his fututre projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychedelic Soul","review":"Somthing was wrong with this CD.

You could pack the sets in a small mini-van and take them on tour. But it's the singing that counts and sometimes Gruberova delivers and sometimes she doesn't. The sad thing is Bellini wrote such beautiful music for this opera and it deserves to be heard by a seasoned cast. This is not the cast. The audience clearly adores Gruberova and she steps out of character to acknowledge their adulation every chance she gets. Bros picks up steam as the performance moves along but the Barcelona Opera chorus evidently had other things on its mind. Watching them in the background shows most of them uninvolved with the proceedings. It's not a dreadful performance but Puritani deserves better treatment. Until another production comes along, this one barely suffices."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a dissenter here","review":"I picked up \\"The Alchemist's Daughter\\" expecting to read something rich with alchemical lore. I wanted something magical like the superb \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.\\" Instead, the book was nothing more than a historical romance--and I am not a romance reader.The heroine was extremely unlikeable, because she kept everything inside, made no friends, and didn't even ask about the world outside her home. So, when she is taken for a ride by the errant husband (and I could see he was trouble the minute he entered her home), I could hardly feel sorry for her. She was a perfect sheep ready for a fleecing.I'd give this book only one star if it weren't for the fact that Katharine McMahon can really write with authority. Her descriptions are lush and elegant and it was this element of her novel that kept me going to the end. Sorry to say, I even found the ending lacking. And I learned nothing about alchemy in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like another's opinion of this book (bodice ripper with a brain)","review":"I only read half of this till I got to a rape scene that was too detailed. Up until then there was a lot of Science. On and on about alchemy and this poor sad girl who is her fathers science experiment. He takes notes and writes about everything she does and it is like one of his experiments. Poor girl is a mess but I really didn't care for her very much. The writing is very good and did hold me for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alchemy leads to love not gold","review":"The Alchemist's Daughter has a different type of heroine, someone who is very intellectual, albeit strange. The whole story rings of \\"Masterpiece Theatre\\" and it was beautifully written. I finished the book in one day because it had a driving force to it. The only thing that slowed me down is the scientific terms, which are a mouthful. The story could also have used a slant toward mystery, since it touches on alchemy but it is more on love. The ending is a bit abrupt although the reader can tell what it would lead to. I just prefer an ending that flows into a smooth finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written, Good Period Sketch","review":"The book is an excellent period sketch of that time of England in the early 1700's, when London was beginning to explode population-wise, all the merchants sought country estates, alchemy was slowly wending its way toward modern science, and even Sir Isaac Newton makes an appearance.The book is well written - not a poor sentence, structure or bad word choice. And the story is enjoyable, including the final \\"secret\\" that we learn.At the same time, there are parts of the book that seem formulaic and several of the characters are clearly only half-sketched with backgrounds that are hinted at being darker and more complex than they appear, but never really filled in. This is what keeps the book from getting 5 out 5 stars; but it certainly deserves 4 out of 5, and if I had to do all over again, I would probably still read it and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Focus on Batiks","review":"Jan Smiley's book is top notch.

I ordered these thinking, because of the price, I'd be getting a solid well-lighted candle. Not so. While the ad says they are \\"pewter\\" it is nothing more than silver colored cheap, lightweight plastic. The bulb glows more of a dark yellow/orange and doesn't look at all like a candle flame.

They're fairly heavy (could be because of the big batteries) and expensive (again, exacerbated by the price of the batteries) but other than that, I have no complaints. I have them set to flicker, which looks nice...not too orange, not too white. The photo sensor seems to turn them all on reliably. I like the little hooks that come with them to help hold them in certain windows... though the trick will be keeping track of them between winters because they are so small. Overall, if you're okay with the price (remember to add in the price of the batteries) I'd say go ahead and get them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right!","review":"These are lovely and well made.

As far as what some people mentioned about the color of the \\"flame,\\" I believe the warm tone is more realistic looking than if the light were to be white. It's supposed to have an orange look if it's supposed to be a candle flame because it's supposed to look like fire and not a light bulb. I think they are perfect.

Then I walked to the street (about 40 ft.) to see how it looked.It only took a minute to realize that they had to go back.The light is just not very bright. I had a hard time seeing it. The yellow/orange color doesn't really look like flame - not does it look white and bright as one normally sees in windows at the holidays. It's very artificial looking (to me.)They may be great for another application, but as holiday window lights, they're just not a bright idea.

This game has soooooo much potential. but just like the rest of the suikoden series, it falls short. You can't power level in this game. When your characters dies, they really die! The story is slow. The special moves are lack luster. The graphics are boring and sub par, and the music is very typical konami. The truth is, I keep getting suckered into these suikoden games with the promise of rpg goodness, and instead I end up putting 30 hours into it, quitting, and selling the thing.If your looking for a top notch strategy game, this is not it. If your looking for a suikoden game, well this isn't it either. This is more of an experimental title that will leave you bored and constipated.Have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"another game","review":"This game was blah at best. When I bought this game I was looking for a game that would last me a while and was interesting at the same time. What I found in this game was one with horrible character development, terrible graphics and the gameplay itself wasn't all that great. I have plenty of time to play the game but I couldn't keep my attention on this game for more than maybe a half hour. After that it was all the same. The plot was poor as well. I spent a total of 23 hours playing this game and still understood nothing but one thing, without telling what that one thing is for those of you who still want to buy it, that one thing didn't keep my attention. Just a friendly warning that the review in game informers was right on this game. (6.5) If you are desperate and really need to have something to play by all means get this game but there are plenty of other games out there that are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game.","review":"I love all the Suikoden games (I through V) and play them over and over. I like this one because it refers to the people and events in the other games. I am more of an old style RPG lover, so I am wrestling with the strategic battle style (usually just get a C grade on them!) but I'm learning and it's a nice introduction into strategy games. I would call it a combination RPG/strategy game. It moves a little slow but I don't mind that. I wish there were more places to save. It's depressing to go through 3 levels of dungeons and have someone die on you and have to start from the very beginning again. I'm not that far into it so maybe there is a way to resurrect them that I haven't found yet. But overall I am enjoying the game.

The bottom parts of the rivets hang down under the train and catch on places where the tracks are not completely level. Any track joint that sticks up a little bit or a countersunk screw that is not completely flush hits the train and makes it come off the rails. One could say the problem is with the track and not the train, but my son's set has several different brands of trains and this is the only set that has a problem on the track.I was excited to find a modern looking train to add to my son's set, but I do not think this train was the best choice.

Unfortunately, they have also released a lot of mediocre albums during their time, that's why I was skeptic when buying 1975. Luckily, I was surprised to find out this album is actually very good. It has a powerful rhythmic heavy sound that made me fan of theirs in the first place. \\"Cristobal Celai\\" and \\"Juan Sebastian\\" are both fantastic songs that display Richie's amazing talent on the piano and as usual, there's also some fantastic trumpet playing also. My favorite and the most recognized song on the album is \\"Gan Gan y Gon Gon.\\" I have to admit though there are certain parts of songs that have strange singing and music for brief moments. Nonetheless, the album is worth getting in my opinion and much much better than other releases such as \\"El Bestial Sonido\\" and \\"Back to Back.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable.","review":"I have many gardening books and catalogs in my library, however, Wyman's is the one I refer to time and again because of its comprehensive discussion of each plant.

For that alone, I strongly reccomend Popotan for anyone who wants a fun and enjoyable Anime.If that's not enough for you however, Popotan also has hilarious comedy in every episode and some steamy fan-service. Please note there is a lot of nudity in this show, but none of it is sexual. They managed to do a scene with the girls bathing in almost every episode!Again, I strongly reccomend Popotan for everyone who can handle a little nudity, wonderful characters, brilliant storyline, good music and funny circumstances.

They both produce a wild, syncopated heavy-metal sound at times, but DK do not push the envelope as much as the King (Crimson that is). DK have softer more dreamy moments that do bear some resemblance to Pink Floyd. I haven't listened to much Grateful Dead, so I can't really comment on that comparison, expect to say that the recording does contain a number of rip-roaring, improv guitar solos (which I gather the Grateful Dead are known for).The CD has over 70 miuntes of music so its \\"minutes of music per dollar\\" rating is pretty good (if that matters to you).I have 3 of DK's CDs, all of them excellent, but this (in my opinion) is the best of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long for such a thin plot","review":"I liked Thea and the characters in her office.

Scott) are not covered. Also, the book typeset is that of a typewriter manuscript in a small font that apparently was just photocopied by the publisher.

Ozkenrt's Glenclick Ile Elele is one slab or propulsive, synth driven dance music that never let's up. It is not psych and not disco, but mines a funky nitch in between.

The story provides an accurate account of the conditions in Berlin during the war, and of the friendship shared between the American soldiers (who we all admired) and the Berliners. It will be of great value to those interested in the historical aspects of the story, as well as to those who want a real page-turner about a young girl's perspectives on living through the war and how she and her family were able to cope through such a devastating time. A wonderful story which recounts the developmnt of a relationship between a young girl from Berlin and an American soldier who become separated by the battles of war, only to be brought back together again by fate.

Excellent ideals for business!","review":"Anita Roddick is truly an amazing woman. This book is like a mini-biography about Anita Roddick and the creation of the Body Shop. This is a great book for people who believe in social responsibility and have concern for the well being of people and the earth. It is rare that one will ever read about a busineess woman that will use her business not just for power and profit but as a vehicle to social awareness. I bought this book for a management class and it is a great reference book for non-traditional management. Roddick truly draws humanity and spirit back into the white collar world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avant-Garde BeBop Triumph","review":"John Zorn, Bill Frisell, and a trombone player! No disrespect to George Lewis, I'm just not familiar with his work. But all three musicians distinguish themselves on the exciting CD. Anyone looking for a contemporary take on Bop and Soul Jazz from the top players in the game today need look no further. Import contains three stellar live tracks. Some of John Zorn's most accessible playing, but still maintains his unique flavor and sparkle. A real must have for Zorn fans, but also for fans of Hank Mobley, Sonny Clark, or Kenny Dorham, whose works are all interpeted here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batman: Manbat","review":"This graphic novel had some good art in it at times, but sadly the way they depicted batman didn't appeal to me. The story to this graphice novel was all wrong. Through out the story they made Batman think he was above the law, made him look like a fool, and he went against his morals at one point and time. ... I do not recomend purchasing this graphic novel. If you are a true Batman fan it would just be a waste of your money. Obviously the authors of this book didn't know enough about batman and were more interested in the art than the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is the only graphic novel I've seen where the artwork on the inside is just as good as the cover artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Johnny Winter?","review":"I thought I had the wrong cd.

Harry Ammon's book was among the best that I read. Ammon presents history as a great story, filled with larger than life characters. The book clearly explains the politics of the day and gives the reader a definite understanding of the often overlooked President Monroe. This book is a triumph and an unexpected page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent full-life biography.","review":"This is a very thorough, very exhaustive look at the life of the fifth president of the United States, and while it may not be as easily readable as, say, David McCullough's \\"Truman\\", it is certainly less dry and slow-going than most scholarly works. If you're looking for a full-life biography of Monroe, one that truly informs you on the subject and does not simply dramatize the story of a historical figure's life, this is an excellent choice. If you're looking for light reading with a historical basis, this is definitely NOT what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Review of Monroe's Career","review":"This book provides an excellent review of the career of our Fifth president. James Monroe had a long and distinguished career of Public Service, so providing a complete and thorough examination of his career is a very daunting task.

The only slight critisicm I had was that at times it got to detailed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor President only by comparison to his predecessors","review":"This highly readable book focuses on the foreign policy elements of Monroe's career almost to the point that it is more of a book on diplomacy than a general biography. The portions that detail his partnership with his Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, especially the genesis of the Monroe Doctrine, are where it is at it's best. Unfortunately it gives short shrift to his relationship and feelings to his own slaves, even while giving a very good account of his activities around the Missouri Compromise."},{"rating":"1","title":"james monroe","review":"A very tedious read. were it not for my decision to read a bio on every president i would have ditched it months ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't know the font would be so tiny","review":"I have pretty good eye sight and I found the font on this to be challenging.I bought it originally to use in child training my children using the Bible Training set sold at:[...] but I don't think it will work well.

It is refreshing to see a movie deal with a character being HIV positive who is approaching his condition in such a positive way. This movie, much like Brokeback Mountain, is not only for a gay audience. Everyone could benefit from experiencing Felix and his journey. I recently saw Umbrellas of Cherbourg for the first time, and there is a certain charm that is unique to French films. Plus of course the language is so beautiful. It does present a lot of heavy issues in a very entertaining way. Sami Bouajila is a magnetic screen presence. I can see this actor has been quite busy so I will check out his other films.

But, it took three nights to finish it. This one man's journey didn't seem to go anywhere. Somehow, I was waiting for resolution, but didn't get that sense. I didn't find that many redeeming qualities in the Felix. He didn't seem to feel any guilt for car theft, treating a lovelorn teen badly, and generally just being more cynical than I got the sense that he needed to be. As he travels, he encounters 4 different people who supposedly have an influence on him and his journey. But I didn't see him take any of that with him as he went. I guess that I ended up confused about what all the fuss was about. Merely passing through lives doesn't do much for me. Becoming a different person after having encountered others does. Felix didn't really change or grow from his experiences, and I am left with a flat feeling, having not gained anything from the movie either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie EVER!","review":"This is by far the worst movie ever, and mentioning the worst gay movie I have ever seen.

It will not make you a GREAT swordsman by any means but it depicts excellent practice forms and partnered drills to instill practical techniques based upon the best known school of German swordsmanship, that of Johannes Liechtenauer, founder of the school that developed into just about everything in German fencing that came after him.

The author is intimately familiar with the languages, the cultures, and the multi-layered symbolic meanings of the dreams she discusses. Serinity Young offers fascinating accounts of the important roles that dreams have played in the lives of Buddhist teachers and mystics. She has especially intriguing things to say about the role of gender in dreaming. The issue of lucid dreaming comes up, but not in the way many Westerners might expect; Young argues persuasively that in the Buddhist context lucid dreaming (i.e., cultivating conscious awareness within the dream state) is a valuable means to the greater end of enlightenment. Dreaming in the Lotus is not a \\"how-to\\" book, but rather a stimulating invitation to learn about the dream traditions of another culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decidedly unimpressed...","review":"I had the misfortune of being in this arrogant, passive-aggressive windbag's class a few years ago.

The text is explanatory, but not overly detailed and this is by no means a college level treatise on Roman civilization. It is however fun to read and illuminates the practices of the antiquities for younger readers.Adult readers will enjoy the humor depicted in some of the drawings and the text and illustrations are informative for them as well.

Lovelace talks about Hugh Hefner and Sammy Davis Jr. Is her book cathartic or boastful? Is \\"Ordeal\\" just her means of exploiting her 15 minutes of fame (infamy)? Ultimately, it is a peek into the seamier side of life. Lots of sex, dope, money, mansions, celebrities, etc. At least, that's what I got from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"It wasn't worth the money.

The dog story is pretty wild as well. Linda drops some really big names in this book, you will be surprised, I guess they were afraid to sue her thinking that that would garner even more unfavorable attention.

The other part of it, I spent thinking she was stupid to let herself get that entangled in the first place and for not getting herself safely out of it earlier on. Her inability to escape and be free makes one wonder if she really didn't start out, to some degree, as a willing participant. Though, reading all of the horrible details, also has to make your think that she was, or at least felt she was, imprisoned in a really hopeless situation.

All easily worth the $6 total I paid with shipping for this CD. Who hasn't heard Smokey Robinson? No need to review the songs, we all know they are classics. The 20th century masters sets don't always have the best songs of an artist or group, but this one did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!!","review":"I just bought this CD and am totally disgusted with it. Looks like a great line-up of songs, right? Songs that you may have to purchase two or three albums to have, right? That's what I thought too. The fact of the matter is that the titles contained on this disc are NOT the original version of the Smokey songs we all know and love. This kind of duping of the listening and buying public ought to be stopped. Curses to Motown for their attempts at passing off outakes as the originals. It may be awhile, if ever, that I purchase anything on the Motown label. Do yourself and your pocketbook a favor and stay away from this turkey and for that matter, any of Motown's Millenium Masters series. They are a sham!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of Smokey Robinson & The Miracles (20th Century Masters","review":"If you have no idea of who Smokey Robinson & The Miracles are, this CD has good songs to acquaint yourself with them. For an old 42 year old male like me, they bring back good memories. Lyrics are not included, but they are easy to understand. The quality of the recording is okay. I like reading the historical articles within the CDs in this series (20th Century Masters Millenium Collection). The year of each song's release is noted."},{"rating":"1","title":"GEEZ SMOKEY, WHAT HAPPENED!","review":"Man, it seems like Smokey Robinson has been listening to a whole lotta new Metallica lately.

This will disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"Want to know one of the main reasons why so many people pirate music? This CD is the perfect example. I have a number of albums put out by the folks of this socalled Millennium Collection. There isn't a single one that qualifies as a genuine anthology. 10 or 11 songs is nothing but a scam when you are expected to pay full price. I sincerely wish the worse for the jerks who came up with this idea of cheating the customer for the umteenth time. Get your copy at the library like I did or find it used here on Amazon for under $5 including shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to my ears","review":"While most cds from this series have decent remastering this one is bad, really bad.

Most of our wine glasses will not fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it in a day...","review":"The only problem with this book is its length. Other than that, I think it's adorable. I love Lena, Carmen, Birdget and Tibby (Tibby most of all, it must be said), so getting to go still deeper into their characters is a treat. And I liked that the book included at least one thing by Bailey, who's one of my favorite characters. Also liked the sections on Tib's favorite movies, the excerpt from Carmen's short story, and many other things. Nice book."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty worthless","review":"At $5.80/10 foot roll, it should at least stick, but it doesn't stick to itself or anything else for more than a few minutes. The product description says it's easily removable, and since it's comes off on it's own I guess that part's accurate, but if you need something that actually performs as tape try duct tape in realtree or mossy oak.

Too many curves and not enough stretch on the tape. It also frays on the ends when cut and leaves a horribly sticky residue when removed (which was fairly prompt because it looked so bad. Waste of money for weapon wraps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"This stuff isn't really tape at all! It is more like a ten foot strip of cloth. The adhesive is virtually non-existent. It won't stick to ANYTHING, including itself. I had to buy glue to make the end of the tape stick to itself when it wrapped it around my bow. The camo pattern is ok, but it is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect sequel","review":"Second Maggie Shayne book I have read and was not disappointed! Read the entire thing in 2 days!!!

It never really was that exciting and the characters were not likable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic is back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Maggie Shayne has done it again. Like many readers I have been waiting anxiously for the release of Infinity. As much as I loved Eternity, Infinity is even better!

It is a sore disappointment, and I want to return it. Don't buy it, you'll be disappointed too, unless you like \\"manly\\" women--because this book utterly lacks femininity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"This book is a great disappointment from beginning to end. The photography is simply awful and extremly amateurish as are also the prints. A beginning dark room worker ahould be able to turn out better prints after only two or three darkroom lessons. Appatrently the photographer spent little time and energy on thid project. The only redeeming value this book has is as an example of what not to do in photography"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended.","review":"Some interesting images, but much redundancy. Quality of the printing is very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give it 1 star because there is no option for zero stars.","review":"This is a disappointment all around. It seems that the photographer does not have a grasp of real women. The models selected are extremely masculine, and are posed in masculine ways. With a title like \\"Among Women,\\" one should be able to assume that there would be some level of femininity to it, but there is not.If you are interested in seeing manly women, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing, Wanted to return this book.","review":"I am a beginning glamour photographer and look to others for ideas and what type of quality I need to acheive.

This is a snapshot book at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The NutriGrain for people on low carb diets","review":"Let's face it: there are TONS of options out there these days for people who want to go on a low carb diet. The days of digging for low carb foods in the grocery store are long gone: they almost push them in front of your eyes. So now comes a new challenge: finding the products that taste best in the sea of low carb options. With breakfast bars Atkins has made it a no-brainer. Its \\"Morning Start\\" bars are delicious and nutritious, so look no more and get yourself a box of these, and welcome to the low-carb ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works - hard to get on","review":"I bought this at a store for my racquetball racquet. It was a pain getting on but once I got it on it seems great. It seems to give a good grip. Too early to tell how long it will last but it looks like it will last. I like the feel of it.I will try to get back in 6 months to say how it is holding out. Only reason I do not give it a five that it is hard to get on, but most likely better than most. Looks good and doesn't slip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read fine print before buying","review":"I also was surprised to open box and see bags were only 7 oz. What a rip off.

I would buy it again in a pinch, but would not choose it over some other brands I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetically Bad...","review":"Even one star is too much for this edition. Lillian Gish was never happy with this film anyway (\\"I never thought the drama matched the splendor of its fifteenth-century backgrounds\\"), but it was stunningly filmed in Florence, Italy, where the story itself took place. But you would never know it by this tape-the print source looks like a ninth-generation 8mm copy,and often becomes one big blur. Titles are chopped off at the side, and the engineer even racks them up and down at points to \\"get it all in\\". There is no musical score of any sort. Please pass this edition up-the film has been restored in 35mm, and there is no reason to waste money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable print","review":"Having seen stills from this movie and being a Lillian Gish (and George Eliot) fan, I was disappointed to find that this DVD-R print is pretty much unwatchable. The titles are pretty much illegible. I'm not sure there is a watchable print available, but I fear the Grapevine print is not it.(The book I recommend for George Eliot completists. It's attempt to reconstruct Florentine dialect makes you wonder if the patois of \\"Adam Bede\\" wasn't a literary contrivance)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"All my congratulations for a great read on today's reality: Global Team prespectives on Growth.

I MISS THE 80's, Life was so much simpler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Cool for School collection","review":"This 12 collection of movies was well worth the cheap price. You get 12 unknown/never heard of comedy films that are mostly from the 1980's and few that are from the 1970's. The picture and audio quality was not that great, but very watchable- due to disk compression, 12 movies on 3 disks. There were some actors in the films that went on to become well known film stars. Most of the films were funny or entertaining. My favorites were My Tutor, My chauffeur, The Pom pom girls, Jocks, Cavegirl and The Van. This set is highly recommended. There is a lot of great classic 1980's cheese to love in this set! You really can't go wrong buying this set just for the entertainment value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another cheesy Cult movie, but awesome...","review":"This is another cheese cult movie from when I was growing up.

It's just as cheesy as you remember it, if not more."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta love watching the sexy Kathy Lee Crosby play basketball!","review":"Most of the movies are pretty damn funny! My Tutor great premise. I loved coach in part because I love basketball, great scene with former NBA great Sidney Wicks! Weekend Pass was kinda cute. Betsy Russell is very sexy in Tomboy! Malibu Beach and Beach girls are cool chill movies. Pom pom girls was a lot better than I expected the one male lead came of age. The Van is a classic I used to watch it on USA up all night! They had that show on fri and sat nights when I was in h.s. I watched Jocks when I was in h.s. and I saw it again recently and it's funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy vs race car Randy","review":"TomboyI loved Betsy Russel in this movie as a tomboy who fixes cars.I loved her feisty i can do it myself,just fine attitude.Jerry Dinome plays the celebrity race car driver and doesn't get why Tommy doesn't like him.She's not playing hard to get,she just doesn't like his cocky arrogant womanizing self! But then,he wears her down once she finds out he likes her,because she's not like the other girls that throw themselves at him.There's a great song during the brief love scene,them racing and being competitive at the park.She shows her independence when he says he'll whip her butt racing cuz she's a girl.It's a battle of the sexes!Does she make up with him after the race? Watch and see.You go tomboy!There's a naked boob scene to watch out for if you have younger viewers.This viewer gave it 5 stars!!!TomboyTomboy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Dog","review":"What a waste of brain cells this dreck is. The other reviewers appreciate it for it's cheese factor and that's too high praise. This flick is a complete bore. It reminds me of a bad afternoon school special with gratuitous nudity thrown in. Star Betsy Russell has a certain Felicity quality to her without Keri Russell's acting chops. I guess you had to have been there. Wait a minute! I was! This movie still stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set","review":"I had most of these from Cinemax back in the '90's.

This Bumkins bib saved many clothes from being stained and covered in food.Even my daughter loves this bib. We hang all our bibs up and she goes straight for this Supersized bib whenever she's hungry and hands it to us to place around her neck. Even she doesn't like spilling her mess on her shirt and pants.Details:The single food pocket on this bib is slightly larger than theBumkins Waterproof SuperBib, Unisex, 3-PackThe bottom half is generously wide and can cover a lot and works great in restaurant high chairs. The only difficulty you might experience is if you're still using a high chair with a snap-on tray. Since this bib is so large it will make a tight squeeze. However with a little tug here and a pull there it will still work.This bib has saved me soooo much time cleaning up after soup spills and spaghetti spills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom of 3.5 year old","review":"Best bib ever! Easy to clean, can be thrown in the washing machine. It is light weight and it folds small to take with you. I often put it in my purse when we go out. It looks more like an apron, so my daughter doesn't mind wearing it. Saves on laundry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only use these","review":"Never needed another bib.

It isn't.","review":"I'm certainly no prude and I like noisy music. I also find toilet humor funny like most men. However, I find this CD completely pointless and tedious. It is not at all funny, and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found. Every track of this excrutiatingly long CD is essentially the same -- a guy screaming lyrics in a strong French accent that sound as if they were written by a 14-year-old over unclassifiable, unprofessionally produced music which seems to be there only incidentally. I suppose some folks would know that a CD with a penis on the cover and a title like \\"Lung Farts\\" would not be their cup of tea, but for those (like me) who think these would be selling points, trust me, they ain't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Job Interview Material","review":"I carry this book to every Job interview I go to and it never lets me down! It is easily the most accessible of any of the books by or about Wilde and is an excellent distillation of his wit into a book that can be picked up and understood in five minutes.Of course, it isn't exhaustive, and can sometimes get a little flowery, but that is arguably its best feature - it can make you think like Oscar Wilde without the need to read any of his other works (although they are recommended!)So if you want a book that will give you a sharp wit and an ability to create 'bon mot', then I sincerely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"tight Album","review":"there are always rare albums that you ever hear about.alot of the time you have to take yourself&dig through some crates to find something that everybody ain't talking about. this album is just that.Roy Ayers Guitarist James Mason brings the Heat on this tight album. now some of the tracks don't get the finishing touchings that Roy Ayers is so known for,but this Album has alot of cooking tracks.good thing slick city are tight grooves. there are alot of vamps here that will keep your head bopping.i dig the arrangements alot on here as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good for a sequel.","review":"Though I would have l liked to have seen more of Sir Percy and at least an appearance by Chauvlin it was still a great novel worthy of 5 stars!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense and betrayal around every corner...","review":"Imagine falling in love with the one person whose life you've sworn to destroy. That's the story of Juliette Marny in this thrilling continuation of the SP series. Having taken a blood oath to avenge her brother's accidental death, Juliette betrays the popular Citizen-Deputy Paul Derolede only to discover that he is the only man she will ever love. Of course, our favorite hero, Sir Percy steps in to help Juliette out of her jam when all hope seems lost. But will our elusive pimpernel acutally succeed this time? This book contains page after page of suspense you won't want to put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Read","review":"For anyone that has read the other Scarlet Pimpernel books, you must read this one. It's in the same sprit as the others, but it concerns a Citizen-Deputy for Revolutionary France and a daughter of a aristo. If you have read \\"The Elusive Pimpernel\\", you will know about Juliette Marny. This is her story. Although Sir Percy plays a smaller part in this book than any of the others, since it is concerned with Juliette and Paul, he is there and of course comes to the rescue of these two just in time. It might get off to a little bit of a slow start but it picks up very nicely. Overall, a very good addition to anyone's library that loves the Pimpernel series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the description","review":"The Amazon description says:\\"Installs with 3M adhesive foam tape Reduces heat build-up in the vehicle No drill installation provides a secure and snug fit dark smoke gray acrylic\\"What you get are cheap, metal vent shades that you have to screw in to install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stocking Stuffer for the Techies on Your List","review":"For how long have you been aware of the web? Five years? Six? Didn't it seem as though we woke up one morning and there it was? Not so, as you will find out when you read this fascinating account of the way in which Internet technology took on a life of its own and morphed into the gigantic marketplace/library/chatroom that we think of today.For example, did you know that the techniques used in the Internet were born out of Cold War paranoia? Or that email was an afterthought to the original system that unexpectedly became the most popular application of the network? Or that in the early 1980s, the military agency running the Internet was so afraid of hackers breaking into the system (\\"unauthorized penetrations,\\" as one army major put it) that they split the network in two, one for the military and one for the civilians? Read the book for the details on these and other intriguing techno-tidbits."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought the wrong version..........","review":"I was totally disappointed (it was my own fault sort of) that I payed good money for this CD and the version I wanted was not even on here!!!

Bravo Mr. Bragg..well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk.","review":"I received this product after viewing it online. When it arrived I opened the box and I could not believe what I saw.

It was broken in the box when it arrived. I am still waiting for a refund!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, family oriented series!","review":"This is a fantastic series of inspirational romantic suspense. The characters are all members of the O'Malley family. These are characters you wish were real people so you could spend more time with them. Stephen's story is the 6th (last) book of the series. I highly recommend this series and all of Dee Henderson's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"More O'Malley Excitement","review":"Stephen O'Malley is a paramedic who has had enough of being a big city EMT. In a promise to his dying sister, Jennifer, he says he will leave the big city to take care of heart attacks and sprains in the slower pace of the country. On his way out of Chicago, he receives a call from Meghan, a childhood friend, who is looking for a little comfort from the rainstorm and a ride to her parents' house.The story of Stephen and Meghan's early relationship is told brilliantly in flashbacks. When the story catches up to present day, the plot twists and turns like a scenic mountain road, blending Stephen and Meghan's lives with a series of jewel thefts. This is by far the most tantalizing O'Malley mystery. Stephen's struggle with the concept of having a relationship with God adds spiritual depth to the novel.The other O'Malley novels are: The Negotiator, The Guardian, The Truth Seeker, The Protector, The Healer, The Rescuer. Each is a wonderful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!","review":"Our whole family loved listening to this audiobook by Dee Henderson.

Just as I expected, very BT.I just love his choice of sounds, his programming and his effects programing on Pro-Tools, Wicked! My personal favourite is Ride which is laid back trance city. The remix on CD2 is kinda similar, not as remixed as I would have liked but still superb. The whole CD sounds like it could have been written 2 or 3 years ago, but if you are a BT fan then it doesn't matter you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice.","review":"ever since i got a hold of renaisance worldwide: singapore {which is a very hard to find now 3 disc, 1. mixed by david morales 2. mixed by dave seaman 3. mixed by BT, album} i've really respected both dave seaman and BT. since this is a BT album review i'll limit my praise to him.......all that nonsense being said i'm left with only one real comment to make regarding this 2 disc album:awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to argue with BT","review":"It *is* a bit uneven but there is quite a bit here to like. Mr. Transeau is a fantastic producer and a skilled musician, and the Atari samples don't hurt, either (at least, not in my book). OTOH, some of the songs (notably Dreaming) come across as a bit hamhanded, I think. The music is beautiful and the production is flawless, but the arrangement might be a bit over the top. Plus, Mr. Transeau is *not* a great singer. (No worries - just 1 track).This would be a great album for somebody new to electronica (pretty eclectic), and it's not a bad listen for the more interested fans of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy - CD has a trojan!","review":"I started using this book and it looked excellent. I put in the CD and was using it with the text. When I tried to shut down my computer later it wouldn't shut down - said \\"Winclickme.exe\\" wouldn't close. I restarted the computer and did a search and found that others had had this problem from the CD - please see other reviews for more details. It is really too bad because the book looks great and it is one which needs the CD to be used for practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreaming of Babylon...sadness, futility, and dreamscapes","review":"Brautigan's \\"Dreaming of Babylon\\" chronicles the dreamscape of a down-on-his-luck private eye. Drawing in seedy tones, he explores the inner dreamscape of the character. The escapism of the protagonist, as well as the hopelessness, mirror those Brautigan felt in this stage of his career. The inventive turns of phrase and wry humour are there, but an underlying sadness permeates the plot; the outcome, failures, and cramped, small dreams are known from the beginning. The protagonist is a stand-in for Brautigan, much as in \\"Sombrero Fallout\\" and other later works. As one who owns all his fiction, I think of this as one of the sadder books.

I think that the case and all of the parts are built very well, and very solid. There is no problem with the design of the product. It was easy to set up, and it works. The problem is that the resolution is very poor. The resolution is so poor that you cannot really tell if you are in focus, so you still have to use the viewfinder for focus, which defeats the purpose of having a 7\\" LCD on the top of the camera.If you need a 7\\" battery operated LCD for setting up a video capture station in the field, or if you simply need to check framing, then I think it will be fine. But I would not plan to replace your viewfinder with this product. For the same money you can purchase a 20\\" HDTV to use as a field monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"secret ninja","review":"This movie is a pretty good product to watch and to review, it is exciting and full of action,And it is good for the imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, but not the worst","review":"I would actually say this is one of Dragon Lee's better performances, but if Silver Fox wasn't in this, it would be a complete loss. Kind of like \\"Demon Strike\\" you wait and watch this movie for the end. But the ENTIRE movie blows and just doesn't make any sense. But then again it is a Godfrey Ho movie so it is actually good for him. It does have a sex scene as the other reviewer says and while it was too long and had no place in the movie, I did nto mind. Frontal, backal, you get the idea. And I certainly hope I never have to see a silver fox love scene again. The reason this movie gets a 2 and not a 1 is beacuse Dragon's friend in the movie has some REALLY good moves and both him and Dragon pull off a coupel of sweet kicks at the end. And the end is actually pretty good, even if the movie didn't make any sense up to that point."},{"rating":"2","title":"great item","review":"have ordered from this company 3 times. always satisfied.

To coin a cliche, it was all about HIM.

I live in the city where he started his career and he was not and is not well respected.It has been the general opinion that he was not a good role model for the police officers of his day.

He is a liberal who happens to be a cop and a police chief. That makes his tone very 'preachy' and self-righteous. He has made many mistakes and uses this book to explain his thought process at the time and what he learned from his mistakes.

I like the information and tone of this book, but the errors are terrible. There are quite a few lessons you can do along while reading the book, but some of them tell you to open the wrong file on the included CD (the Intro lesson or the Pen Tool lesson), or the file on the CD has been altered so the lesson won't work (the Layers lesson) or don't work at all (the Actions lesson)! There are even simple errors like typos that indicate just plain, sloppy editing.I only stick with it because all my lessons have been written to go with it, and, at this point I think I've found most of the errors (I have compiled a two-page errata). But I'll definitely find a new book when we upgrade to Photoshop 5!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Errors","review":"Knowing almost nothing about PhotoShop and being thrifty, I purchased this book mostly because of the price and CD Rom Lessons.

Mitose","review":"This edition was published in 1980 from the original text published in 1953. From a historical aspect, this book is an important document. This was the first book ever published in America on the Kenpo system. James M. Mitose was the official granmaster of this system and had many famous students; however, politics have made this great system controversial in some circles. Ed. Parker's Kenpo Karate System was developed from his training in Kenpo Jiu-Jitsu. This occureed in Hawaii in the 1950s. This volume covers the basic history of the art, the basic techniques and the application of Kenpo Jiu-Jitsu in self-defense situations.In conclusion, this is a book that has historical importance and if you are lucky to get a copy, treasure it.Rating: 5 Stars.

The other people that left reviews were being much too nice, the loading times completely ruined the game for me, especially after playing the PS2 version. There is really no reason for the loading to take THAT long, the graphics are very similar to the newer games in the series on PSP, which load fine. Maybe people that use a dial-up modem will have the patience for this, but not people that play video games regularly.

May deserve more than the one star, but considering how incredibly good Penn's \\"Loch Ness\\" was, this was such a let down. Some of the characters are quite irritating and lot of the time it's just unfunny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't connect","review":"If there were two subjects just ripe for satirical take-down, it would be Las Vegas and poker. (One could argue that Las Vegas is in a continuous state of self-satire, and that the current incarnation of poker is a dumbed-down apology for the noble game, but never mind.) And \\"The Grand\\" includes many zingers at both subjects, both scripted and nicely improvised. But after about half an hour, I caught myself looking at my watch, and I realized that I wasn't sure what the film was really all about. I think that good satire needs a central character with whom you either empathize (think Graham Chapman in Monty Python's \\"Life of Brian\\"), or squirm (e.g. Ricky Gervais in \\"The Office\\"). Like an extended SNL episode, \\"The Grand\\" has lots of jokes, but ultimately no point. And that's a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few laugh out loud moments but kind of drags","review":"This movie reminded me of one long episode of \\"Curb your enthusiasm\\".Possibly because Larry David's TV wife plays a big part.I thought it might not be that good when I heard Ray Romano was in it, but his part as her husband is pretty funny.I never really got caught up in the Poker craze...so it's really not all that interesting to me. The television commentary jokes were lame, and have been overdone in so many other movies like this.I enjoyed Woody's role, but again, only in flashes.Basically it's a weak story line, based around a few funny one liners, with a lot of cameos from some marginal TV actors. (Gabe Kaplan, Lenny from Laverne & Shirley, and George from Seinfeld)Good for a few laughs...but I would fold on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Loser","review":"The less said about this dog of a movie, the better. It ate up 104 minutes of my life. That is so unfair. It has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Under the Special Features Section I noticed that there are \\"Alternative Endings\\" and \\"Deleted Scenes\\" listed. I can't imagine what scenes were deleted. I can only say that not eough were.I always liked watching Woody Harrelson on \\"Cheers,\\" as the dumb bartender who got off good one-liners. He falls flat on his face here, however, as the gambler with 74 wives. If one of those is the runaway bride from the Atlanta area-- the photograph looks just like her with that wide-eyed stare-- then that is mildly amusing. But all the king's horses and all the king's men can't save this scrambled egg of a movie.Walk your dog, play with your cat or treat youself to a good chocolate dessert but avoid this film at all costs unless you are certain you will live to see a hundred and have precious time to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen!","review":"Save your money, not even worth a rental fee. I read the bad reviews and thought how bad can it really be? It has a good cast, it's about poker which I love, and it's in Vegas! Well, it was terrible! It had to have been written on the fly as it appeared no thought was put into it whatsoever. What a waste of a talented cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept poor execution","review":"Let me prefice this review by saying I enjoy watching the world Series of Poker on ESPN. I have followed it for several years, so I was anxious to watch this movie.However, what came across as an interesting concept quickly turns into \\"Who will have the next cameo\\". There are several times in the movie where I felt the plot took a backseat to getting someone screen time.This movie was supposed to be a comedy, but the only thing to laugh at is the poor plot. I can not believe this movie was able to get the star power in it. Not even a high rolling cast of actors could save this terrible story.I would have liked to have seen a whole lot more poker and less filler and uninteresting plot lines.In the end, this is no where near the quality of movie I Was hoping it would be. If you are looking for a poker-ish movie watch Rounders or 21. Skip this one all together and save yourself the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Cast; Awful Movie; BORING","review":"I love poker but hated this boring, no action, contrived plot movie. Too much dull talking and I kept waiting for it to get better. It did not. No poker strategy, no poker plot, just a bunch of boring conversations with fictional characters. The movie trailer is better than the movie; by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best, again","review":"It comes close to being a waste of resources. A lot of plastic was used unnecessarily to do this movie. Slow and boring are a bit understated but I know of no words that sound worse or more informative. The acting was stiff and almost unnatural. It is a shame that some folks are going to think that this is the way to play polka. Perhaps this is the way to dance the polka but certainly not the way to play it. This was a movie that you did not push the pause button. You simply went to the fridge to get your icecream and come back when you were ready but hoping that the movie would be over and low and behold - it was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, unfunny comedy","review":"\\"The Grand\\" is a mockumentary about six internet poker players who gather in Las Vegas for a $10 million, winner-take-all tournament.A game, eclectic cast - Woody Harrelson, Hank Azaria, Chris Parnell, Ray Romano, Werner Herzog, Gabe Kaplan - struggles with a mediocre script that, in tone as well as in style, steals clumsily from all those far superior Christopher Guest movies like \\"Waiting for Guffman,\\" \\"Best in Show\\" and \\"A Mighty Wind.\\" In the case of \\"The Grand,\\" the humor is largely lacking, as each eccentric character plays out his little assigned shtick over and over and over again.As executed by writer/director Zak Penn, the poker scenes are particularly languid and lifeless and utterly incomprehensible to any non-poker players who may happen to be a part of the audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT FILM!!!","review":"You will not be disappointed with this film! I give it a 10/10, 5 out of 5 stars, 2 thumbs up. It's a great poker film and an excellent film overall. The acting is far superior than any big blockbuster in years. The plot line and story flows well, with all the characters meeting at the final table. The sub plots aren't cheesy and are true to life. I can not think of a better film I've seen in the past 10 years. Too bad this was only a limited release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very entertaining","review":"I usually enjoy ensemble comedies, but not this one. It started out hopeful with Woody Harrelson really doing some funny lines as a recovering addict (such a bad addict he LIVES at a drug rehab full time), who, while on a binge, takes out a loan on his grandfather's casino with a land developer (Micheal McKean). Woody checks out of rehab to join a poker game called \\" The Grand\\", in hopes of paying off the loan and getting his casino back. The movie just goes down in a BORING ball of flames at this time. I had to FORCE myself to finish watching it. I won't give away the ending, but it ended okay in a BORING way.I don't recommend this comedy, which is sad, because there are some really good actors in this movie. Just not an entertaining movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grand","review":"A cast of well known actors stars in a mockumentary of poker.

I had some time off recently so picked it up and literally could not put it down. Ms. Gordon has a gift in creating characters so real that the reader feels very invested in what transpires, and the plot so interesting that it keeps one reading! I found it totally engrossing and was truly amazed at the twists and turns of the plot, as well as the outcome. I also enjoy books that are educational as well as entertaining; this novel is full of interesting information about the Middle East, interwoven into the story in a way that left me feeling like I had received a privileged peek into that world. I recently read a book recommended by a relative \\"Absolute Friends\\" by John LeCarre. It is also a political thriller, and although good, I loved \\"Ready the Eight\\" much more. I recommend it to everybody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Stories and Great Information","review":"If someone is planning a trip to the real Mexico, not just the hotel zone of Cancun or Puerto Vallarta, this is the book to read.

There is no better book on Mexico available. It's funny, it's informative, and best of all, it's simpatico.It won't tell you about specific places in Mexico to visit, but it will tell you what you will need to know in order to function on the ground anywhere in Mexico - eating, drinking, camping, hotelling, what to look for when you buy things, dealing with the police, insuring your car - in general, how to be a minimally offensive gringo. You'll thank yourself for reading it, and you'll thank Mr. Franz for writing it, after you get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must read for anyone planning to drive through Mex","review":"One of the best travel books I have read. It is the only one that is thorough enough to even provide some of the information I need for traveling to and from Mexico with my parrot. It does take a sort hippie bias for travel which doesn't fit quite with my preferences. I am not one for dirt floors and such.

After about the third or fourth spin, you'll find you won't be able to take this CD out of your car. But listener be warned, the Deep Dish experience is unlike any other trance mix CD. Snare drums and other dance music clichés are forsaken for effortless & fresh mixing techniques. Deep Dish really aren't about trance (although this CD is more trance-y than Yoshiesque) - and this is a good thing. How many continuously mixed trance CDs does one need? Put down some moolah for this CD and you'll find a whole new fresh perspective on dance music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reflection of the times!","review":"I recommend this book to anyone in the labor force from laborer to top level management. Stephen Adams will force you to evaluate your current employment situation with an eye toward the uncertain future. Adams' take on the trends in Corporate America are very much in line with what I encounter daily as I work with Job Seekers who are left out in the cold by their employers. This book will change the way you view the relationship between you and your employer. It will also help you to make decisions about your professional development that will increase your marketability in the future. There is a strong emphesis toward self-employment, but not like you might expect. Inspires and creates hope for the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits all the points","review":"Susan Richards does a good job with the subject. She doesn't just tell you what to find out about your parent's finances but also discusses thoughtfully how to approach your parents on the topic. She addresses the psychological aspects of these issues.One caveat: the book does not address how to handle your parents' finances if there are too few assets. For instance, it may not provide many answers for adult children of very poor parents. The book assumes your parents have at least some assets to protect/manage.Much of the information applies to all, though. I'm sending copies of this book to my brothers and sisters even though it will be several years before we need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice tights!","review":"I purchased these for my 2 yo daughter.

They are a little bunchy at the ankle."},{"rating":"1","title":"hole in crotch!","review":"Product arrived quickly. These were tights for my grand daughter for Easter.

I spent much more on these tights hoping they would be long lasting. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Brady was DOA","review":"Ordered as a gift.

No wonder there are no sample tracks... it's dreadful!An absolutely terrible, boring CD from one of my absolute FAVORITE performers. My long waiting for a new CD has been wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a big Annie fan","review":"I was really let down when I bought this album. Annie's lyrics are still great, and her voice is still amazing, but somehow the songs on this album didn't bring me in like most of the tracks on Diva. I enjoy Pavement Cracks. It almost sounds like a leftover Eurythmics track, if one chooses to see the distinction between the material from Eurythmics and the material of Lennox solo. The word \\"boring\\" may be a bit too harsh to describe my feelings about \\"Bare\\", but it certainly is not an album I will listen to excessively."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"What a snoozer Annie has dropped on us this time.I consider myself a big fan of her Diva album, but this dreck is ridiculous. The songs border on ridiculousness in their banality. \\"Bitter Pill\\" and \\"Pavement Cracks\\" just reek of the typical I'm-so-artistic-and elite- attitude.Do not waste your time or money on this dreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Bare\\" is Brilliant!!","review":"\\"Bare\\" is simply put, Annie's best work. She continues to be in a class all her own. Her beautiful, soulful voice is absolutely breathtaking! Every song is spellbinding. This album will stand the test of time. Like I said...BRILLIANT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not everyones gets it.","review":"I was quite taken with this cd. It must be hard to compete with your own past and I think some of the negative reviews are from those who loved Ms. Lennox's prior cd's. This one is harder to float along with I would have to agree with that. BUT. The middle songs on this cd \\"Loneliness\\" and \\"Saddest song\\" blend together in a brilliance that surpasses any weakness one might argue it has. Annie is a fantastic artist and she has much to offer - don't be afraid to jump in these deep waters \\"bare\\" ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, Emotional Heart-Break at its Best","review":"For anyone who has had their heart shattered, each word can be related to on this album. This is a very personal inside look at Lennox's broken heart -- which while cathartic for her, is a very generous revelation to the listener into her most personal life. This is what Lennox intended, one assumes, for the greatest of artists has an undeniable need to connect with their fellow man.Lennox is growing and should not be criticized for not sounding like an earlier album. Who would want to be the same artist as they were a year ago, ten years ago, twenty years ago? That would mean no growth -- the creative death of an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie's soul undressed","review":"After 8 years with no new material this 50 year old woman give us the best album of her career.Bare is a beautiful emotional ride through her feelings.The musical style has quite changed from medusa showing a more mature sound.All the songs are really intense. \\"a thousand beautiful things\\" and \\"the hurting time\\" stand out.All the others are simply beautiful.It's a shame that no commercial singles have been released.Just buy the album, it's really beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Out The Hankies","review":"After her past albums, something so dramatically sad is a great depature to say the least. Her voice is as fantastic as ever and her lyrics dazzling, don't get me wrong. This is just NOT one of those albums you'd pull out to get you in a good mood. It's a rainy day album where melancholy comes down with each drop. You wont be disappointed, but it will take a bit of getting use to. Play when you want to be in a deep mood. And maybe that's the point. She's pouring out her soul, her torment, her saddness, her tough times, and it comes out clearly.Why 4 stars instead of 5? A few songs seem an awkward fit to the mix, and keep the whole thing from being clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"BARE Essentials! A \\"must\\" for music lovers!","review":"Annie Lennox. She's done it again! She is a musical genius! She hasn't written original material in a while and BARE was worth the wait!DIVA was a fantastic album and it's one album that I'd have with me if I were deserted on a desert island. Then came BARE. She pours her heart and soul (I'm not meaning it as a cliche; she's got lots of soul!) into every song and squeezes those emotions out of you when you listen to the songs. You almost become her when you listen to the songs.I have several favorites. \\"A Thousand Beautiful Things,\\" \\"Wonderful\\" and \\"Oh God\\" are just a few of my favorites.If DIVA made you cry, BARE will make you wail. Annie Lennox is back and she's still got it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rediscovered treasure","review":"I'm not one to make comparisons to Annie Lennox's other solo recordings. Truth is, I lost touch with her after the early Eurythmics. No real explanation for this; just never got around to listening to her. Something about the cover got to me and I had to check her out again and I am glad that I did. This recording deserves a Grammy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time changes a lot","review":"Every Annie Lennox CD has had to grow on me. Her first two solo releases turned out to be some of my all time favorites. Sadly, I just can't get into this CD. It is almost painful to place it in my CD player.I still have so much respect for Annie Lennox that I purchased the European edition as well as the US edition (exactly the same, except different record labels).I hope that Annie Lennox is around for a long time. Next time I might be more excited if the music is in a different style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excess Baggage","review":"There is something very contrived and artificial about this record. I don't question the sincerity of Annie's emotions, or the pain she has experienced, but she has failed to translate that into a deeply felt organic musical statement along the lines of Joni Mitchell's Blue. This album seems to suffer from its own baggage, and is too self aware and self-conscious for its own good. Does she have to expound on the themes that pervade the album in the liner notes. It all comes off as so self-important. Annie, can't you just let the music speak for itself? And therein lies the tale: the music just isn't that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Annie, Crack a Smile!!!","review":"Annie looks and sounds so sad and depressed on this album, like she lost her best friend. I want to paint to her a happy face and tell her to keep her chin up, if only for a little while. Hun, life isn't all that bad. Crack a smile. You'll feel so much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now THIS Is Like Walking On Broken Glass","review":"Annie Lennox has never been one for emotional singing - her vocals tend to be very dry and mechanical - seemingly too intentionally technical. But that served well enough when you got the hooks, and when with Eurythmics, hooks she never lacked. Her 2 solo projects prior to Bare attested to her longevity, if not tenacity. 'Diva' wanted to be a masterpiece, but failed to be so on her vocal prowess alone, and pined for Dave Stewart to bring the riff. Her covers album, 'Medusa' never achieved her desire to be a soul interpreter to be reckoned with. So, 8 years later, newly divorced and obviously in pain, she releases a dull litany of raw emotion. Melodies meander, lyrics muddled. The point is well taken, but maybe counseling would have been better suited than the ponderous banalities diffused here. My grade: C+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who needs sleeping pills?","review":"Lyrics and singing are good. The music is drab and just doesn't fit. I had to rip the thing out of the CD player by track #8 just so I wouldn't fall asleep from boredom on the way home from work. I'll give it a few more tries. Maybe when I have trouble falling to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Very dull. I just cannot get into this CD. Her previous work andmusic had much more to it and was more jazzed up. This is so mellow that you want to go to sleep.I would not recommend this CD unless you like very dull, slow paced music."},{"rating":"1","title":"UnBAREably depressing","review":"When I saw the cover of this album, I thought that it was brilliant because I assumed that the album was about baring her soul. I was so wrong. The whole entire album is about her painful and bitter divorce from her husband Uri. It is not necessary to have a whole entire album about a break-up! All you need is one song and one song only to get the message across. Alanis Morrisette managed to pull off a song about hate with \\"You ought to Know\\", and Paul Carrack did the same with \\"Don't Shead a Tear\\". As Carrack said, : \\"All that I saw in you, now I see through!\\" Maybe Lennox was too cheap to see a therapist? Anyway, if you want to hear really good mope music, get Morrissey's greatest hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Eurythmics first album","review":"This album is not good at all.The quality doesn't sound good here.When Annie was with Eurythmics that was her best.This is not a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I could not have asked for a better follow up to the truly great Diva cd.Every track is great after just a couple of listenings.I only buy one cd a month instead of the 8 to 10 that i used to buy when i was younger, so im very selective and am i glad i bought this CD .Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply brilliant.","review":"Yet another brilliant, lavishly elegant body of work from the incredible mind and soul of Annie Lennox.The songs are surprisingly diverse in their stylings. \\"Pavement Cracks\\" reminds me of Lennox's days in synth-laden Eurythmics, while \\"Bitter Pill\\" is a stylishly soulful and somewhat aggressive tirade against someone who has obviously hurt Ms. Lennox.This is an extraordinary album. If you don't have it in your collection, then there's only one thing to do. Run, do not walk, to your local CD shop and buy it. NOW! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Pavement Cracks - great track, but I downloaded the Saddest Song first and loved it...I think its my favorite of the two. Its great to hear a Sad Song. Sad, happy, we need both and Annie gives us both in her unique way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've been a fan of Annie for a long time and was disappointed in Bare overall. I only liked one track and this was the up tempo, Bitter Pill. The faster material in the past was simply better. For instance, it would be great to see a dance remix on final album vs. an extended single. I have great respect for Annie and was impressed that she did the album cover without airbrushing. Annie is proud of her age and not trying to be something she's not. I'm still a fan. My hope is the next album will go a different direction and be more upbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Annie??????","review":"I have been a long time Annie Lennox fan; but this \\"creation\\" of hers is absolutely horrid. I cannot fathom why her beautiful voice is totally ruined in this collection of bizarre and depressing pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype!","review":"I agree with hzli - this is the worst collection of Annie Lennox's music that I have ever heard. I have been her fan since the Eurythmics days and have always found her music to be incredible - awesome voice and moving lyrics and music. I had heard all kinds of excellent reviews for this CD and since I absolutely loved her \\"Diva\\" CD, I assumed that this one would be even better if that was possible. Boy was I wrong! I listened to this CD all the way through once and it was appalling. The mood was depressing and the songs were boring and non-memorable drivel to say the least. Needless to say it was a waste of my money and I will not give it another listen. I would recommend you listen to Diva and her previous, other excellent works but take my advice, don't waste your money on this contrived mess of a CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!! - No one does it better.","review":"If you loved \\"Diva\\", this album may not have as many \\"Radio Hits\\" - but It's even better. No one pores so much into there songs as Annie Lennox - her lyrics and amazing voice make her one of the best ever!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touches The Soul","review":"Usually synthesizer driven music does not appeal to me. However Annie Lennox's Bare CD has something intriguing about it. The tones are a little depressing but are also quite haunting at other moments. The bottom line is that the synthesizer creates an atmosphere which enchances a mood. Whereas I would like to have heard more of a presence by the guitars, bass, and drums, these mood enhancing synthesizers cover up such weaknesses quite reasonably.Also, Annie's voice seems to take on many dimensions. Sometimes its loud and other times soft but always good. Her performances on A Thousand Beautiful Things, Oh God, Honestly, and Pavement Cracks are especially exemplary.Whereas this is not in my usual musical realm, I can certainly recognize its merits."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Goddess is Back","review":"After reading about her in Canyon Newspaper here in Beverly Hills under the column Star-gazing the author/columnist wrote a nice article on her.I just had to buy it.\\"Wonderful\\", \\"A Thousand Beautiful Things\\" and \\"Honestly\\" are vintage Annie, while \\"Loneliness\\" is arguably her best work to date. \\"Loneliness\\" is my fave track. Both heartbreaking and uplifting. Annie fans are gonna be thrilled! This CD is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic annie lennox","review":"If you are a big fan of Annie Lennox (like I am), you will not be disappointed by \\"Bare\\". Full of emotion, and Annie's terrific voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE ANNIE LENNOX BUT.....","review":".... the \\"but\\" is that its just more of the same. Annie Lennox is my favorite singer in the world, but everything on this album sounds exactly like her previous stuff without the power ballads of Diva nor the intensity of Medusa. I was really expecting something new and fresh, something that showed that she has not gotten stuck as an artist. But this just marks the fact that she has not moved forward and has stayed in an artistic comfort zone. The way the songs are arranged in the album lacks fluidity. And unless you look at the stereo panel you don't even notice when most songs start and finish its all a constant soulful wine! I'm totally disapointed that after 8 years this is what she has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her bravest, most creative work yet.","review":"This is an impeccable collection of songs. In many ways, it's the CD we've all been waiting for. Annie's voice has never sounded better, and her music and lyrics refreshing and startlingly contemporary.\\"Wonderful\\", \\"A Thousand Beautiful Things\\" and \\"Honestly\\" are vintage Annie, while \\"Loneliness\\" is arguably her best work to date. \\"Loneliness\\" is my fave track. Both heartbreaking and uplifting. Annie fans are gonna be thrilled! This CD is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie","review":"I am the type of guy, who likes to tell you how it is. I hate for people to buy an album, and wish they got told about it before. I just have to warn you, Annie is the same Annie when she was in the Eurythmics. Yet, her music is darker and much more modern. I would say, listen to the audio before you buy it. Each person has certains flavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her strongest since 'Diva'","review":"For anyone who enjoyed Lennox' album Diva, this is a worthy and natural progression of her sound. Her voice shines, with beautiful lyrics and plain excellent music. This is one of those long road-trip companions, and an album where no song ever has to be skipped. Its Annie Lennox at her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an interesting listen","review":"Okay, I am not the typical Annie Lennox listener. And lets be honest, I really didn't expect much out of her. But after buying this album, and listening to the 11 great tracks on here, I have fallen in love with this album. For real, my favorite songs are \\"Erased\\", \\"The Hurting Time\\", \\"Honestly\\", and \\"1000 Beautiful Things\\"...1000 Beautiful Things (5/5)- DopePavement Cracks (4.5/5)The Hurting Time (6/5)- I loved every 7 1/2 minutes of this one.Honestly (5/5)- This track flows perfectly.Wonderful (4.5/5)Bitter Pill (4/5)- Funky little song, it worked for me...Loneliness (4.5/5)- I loved the flow of the song.The Saddest Song I've Got (4/5)- I love the lyrics in this track.Erased (5/5)- THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAV. SONG!!!Twisted (5/5)- I was feeling the vibe from this...Oh God (Prayer) (4/5) - A beautiful end to a beautiful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gorgeous Album!","review":"I've never used that word to describe a music album, but that was all that I could think of to describe it. I have all of Annie's solo albums. While \\"Diva\\" is her best work, this one had the best \\"flow\\" of songs. Songs like \\"Why\\" and \\"No more I love yous\\" made me pay attention to Annie but songs like \\"Wonderful\\" and \\"Honestly\\" cemented in my mind the fact that she is still one of the most relevant female pop performer from the last two decades. I mean who else can get a claim to that other than Madonna? I'd recommend this if you like to listen to mature, sensible,and soulful Pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"This is Annie's best work to date, in my opinion. From the very start, her voice just draws you in and doesn't let go until the last. The only song that I didn't care for that much is, \\"Oh God\\". However, if you have iTunes you can pick and choose what songs you want to purchase. Don't miss this CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Triumph.","review":"Somehow, Annie Lennox wraps up all the gooey, jagged pain I've ever felt in one beautiful package. She captures all the anguish, helplessness, and bitter-sweetness that come with a love lost.I tend to use music as a tool, and this CD helps me work through the hardest parts of regret and mourning, and regain dignity and confidence.She's clearly touching on experiences in her own life, and that's what makes this work so moving. It is the sincere and powerful voice of a real person.Thanks Annie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total amazing","review":"WOW! What else can I say. The pure raw emotion that comes through on this CD is amazing. I can't stop listening to it. I loved Annie when she was with the Eurythmics, but I think she fabulous as a solo artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"so convenient, i love them!","review":"these things are great. they are so much easier to use than having to try to wash a piercing with soap and water like most piercers tell you to. you get the same results in my opinion, except these are a million times more convenient. they are great if you travel or are spending the night somewhere too cause they are everything you need in one little swab. it takes less than a minute to do, which is good if you are really tired one night and just want to go to bed, or if you are rushing around in the morning.definitely recommend to anyone.ive been using them on my new nose piercing and just ran out, so im buying another pack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great for pierced ears","review":"We ordered these for our daughter to use after getting pierced ears.

The costumes and action separate this show from most others.Kind of different than most shows but closely related to Xena-Warrior Princess in style.And, oddly, the main character is NOT the Title character as the story revolves mostly around Gina Torres' character, Helen (Hel), and her father's part in the rise of the Bailies.Well worth the money for this DVD set."},{"rating":"1","title":"let's be honest people","review":"This is coming from a huge, huge sci-fi fan.

Instead, once I read it, I found that it is a badly written conspiracy book. It seems that the author is convinced that the entire space science community is allied against Gilbert Levin, the book's central character. The author seems to see coverups by NASA in every corner - all with the odd purpose of covering up what the author says is clear proof that the Viking robots discovered life on Mars. In addition to the conspiracy aspects of the book, it is horribly organized and jumps all over the place confusing this reader immensely. Someone should have hired an editor and a few real scientists to review this book before it was printed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of my time !!!","review":"Mr. Digregorio is a regular visitor at the MSNBC space chat page. Given his strongly-voiced, and often passionate concerns about our environment, and the potential threat posed by a sample return mission from Mars, I read his book. When I opened the cover I was against all sample return missions. Now that I have read his book, and its inaccurate, contrived excuses and bad science, I have to say that I no longer fear the prospect of having samples brought to Earth from Mars. This book is simply awful - the author seems to be on some sort of political rehabilitation kick for several has-been space scientists - who just happen to be co-authors - hence co-royalty collectors - each time this book is sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slam job against NASA","review":"I used to work for NASA and saw mention of this book in an editorial the author wrote for Space News.

I know the people involved and the version of events the author portrays is wholly false."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad science fiction is better than this book","review":"I read this book based upon the statements made on the dust jacket. Gosh was I disappointed. The author seems to think that NASA is engaged in some sort of immense, multi-decade conspiracy to silence Dr. Levin, the main 'hero' of this disjointed tale, as he claims to have found life on Mars back in 1976. Some of the book, while meant to be serious, is rather humorous given the dark, almost comical paranoia with which it was written. As a practicing biochemist, I have to say that the author throws around scientific terms with little or no concern for the accuracy of the sentences he uses these terms within. He clearly does not understand the science he claims to be presenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stunning achievement not seen since the Bible","review":"Wow what a book.Well children it was fun reading but hard to follow and bit hard to believe.

It turned out that diamonds on them are real, just poor quality. The jeweler sharpened the tips for me so its easier for me to put them on.

Go-Back saves a part of your hard disk as a hot-fix area that keeps restore points for you to \\"Go-Back\\" to in case of a virus or worm attack. All you need to do is to restart your computer, when the go-back screen appears, hit the spacebar, and then choose a point that you want to go back to where your system was working normally. After your system has been restored, a window appears with a list of all the files that were affected by the restore, and you can choose which files to keep.

Set your BIOS to boot from CD-ROM if it isn't already so set, insert UBCD4Win and look for the \\"Unhook GoBack\\" tool. Run it and then you'll be good to go with your restoration.

I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either.I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home.

The color in the photo is a good representation of the color of the shoes (sort of a dark beige). I am a woman and wear a size 10.5 shoe. The large fits perfectly. I like Crocs because they provide a bit of arch support. I got the khaki because it is more discreet than some of the other colors. My habit is to wear Crocs around the house and yard, but I would feel comfortable wearing these to run errands around town. The only negative I could mention is that I like to wear the heal strap \\"up\\" over the top of the shoe. On this pair the heal straps don't actually sit on top of the shoe but rather on top of my foot. It's not a real problem, just different than I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops","review":"We received the Crocs, which are my son's favorite shoe to wear.

To the point of even being tight. The back strap ismore narrow than the previous shoes I purchased. The front part of the sole is not as thick. Overall,it feels like a cheap imitation.

My husband is a surgical tech and wears the closed Crocs (no holes) in surgery. He's on his feet 8 hours straight and and he loves his Crocs. We have a 21 yr. old college student who is embarrassed to admit how much he likes them. (He says they're ugly, but very comfortable.) Our five year old loves them because he can put them on by himself and we can hose them off when they get muddy.

I used to wear flats or flip flops out to run errands or go to class but now I am always in my crocs. They fit like a glove, or light weight and airy. I live in Miami so its hard to walk my dog without dying from heat, but the lightweight material and holes in the tops and sides keep my feet cool and comfortable. Definitely a great buy and they were shipped SUPER quickly. I was shocked to get them so soon, but definitely NOT disappointed :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"She Likes 'Em BUT.....","review":"As most people say, the wife never liked the look of these but now that she tried them she wears them around the house all the time. Even made me buy her a second pair. Good purchase. I ordered these as a second pair to my original black ones as well. These were branded the same size but were too small. Sole to Sole they were at least a half inch shorter! So, the consistency from pair to pair is NOT there. I was going to order the next size up and the Amazon price went up 10 dollars as I was ordering them! SO, I'll stick with my first pair only I guess. Also, I put my crocks in an athletic bag in a hot car. Stuff was piled on top and when removed the one shoe was deformed and did not go back. I stuffed the shoe with cloth and put it in the hot sun on a 100 degree day and the shape came back somewhat. Hasn't been quite the same since so use caution you can mess them up.

I was looking forward to learning more about stars like Jean Harlow, Rudolph Valentino, and Marilyn Monroe. They must have talked about Harlow and Valentino for a total of four minutes, and didn't focus on Marilyn as much as I had expected. Also, where was Clara Bow? There was more discussion devoted to vampire erotica films than to the brilliantly sexual stars and films of the past.All in all, I think this documentary was just a sorry excuse to show porno clips."},{"rating":"1","title":"24 FRAMES PER SECOND...THROUGH SEX","review":"REALLY DISAPPOINTING.

The English is very poor (it's vs. its mistakes, punctuation errors, etc.), with a simplistic vocabulary and not a hint of accuracy and clarity of expression that you find in Erickson or Haley; Apparently typeset in Microsoft Word, the text at times looks like a copy-pasted transcript from one of the training seminars that authors advertise many times throughout the book.Some of the reviewers pointed out that one \\"goes in and out of deep trance while reading this book\\". If puns like \\"trans-formation\\", and other word-plays of similar quality will make you go into a deep learning trance, then they might be right.

I have been studying and using NLP and hypnosis for many years now. This is the best book in my whole collection. Hypnotic language is used throughout so you get the idea of how to use it while reading the book! And just in case you missed it, it is helpfully put in hyphens and bolds and things. By the time you've read this book you not only know how to do it, but you have \`seen' it done and have the actual wording in the book to train you and refer back to as well.

Cornog uses his Tascam 8-track to great effect, creating a richly textured collection of songs of resignation and deluded dreams. The guitar work on some of the best songs (ie., Bring on the Loser, Metal Detector) is reminiscent of Vini Reilly's guitar stylings with Durutti Column, while other songs flower into gorgeous guitar riffs (Marty, Powerful Man) that evoke Galaxy 500.

They took all the science out of it and replaced it with ridiculous stories. With the exception of a very few episodes (Murder most foul, slide like an Egyptian, the guardian and double cross) it was a very disappointing season. I don't think that either the director or producers know where they were going in season 3, because they made the biggest foul up of them all by killing off the professor (the father figure of the group).Season 3 is not worth the effort. The stories are just too dumb down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"After finding the first two seasons thoroughly engaging I was surprised to find the the writing take a dramatic downturn on this third season with the characters becoming more one dimensional and the overall outlook becoming more cheesy and sanctimonious than Touched By An Angel. Plot devices were continuously recycled, oppresive governments, corrupt military officers/scientists/corporate execs, Quinn's damsels in distress and white knight act, the sliders constantly being surprised by how things in each new world aren't what they appear and taking the long way to figure out something that is easily apparent to the viewer. In addition to creativity being traded in for formulas certain episodes shamelessly rip off the creatures from the film Tremors and an X-Files episode where a noisy generator motor powers a light keeping creatures at bay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumps the shark in this season","review":"I enjoyed the first season, and some of the second, but it really \\"jumps the shark\\" in season three. For me, the biggest problem was that it started taking itself too seriously, trying to get dark and edgy, with few comedic breaks to lighten the mood. Most episodes have them entering a dystopian world that I sure didn't want to spend even an hour in. The show should have taken the lead from Quantum Leap, which managed to balance a few more serious plotlines with more lighthearted fare. Perhaps if the show had started out being deadly serious, the transition would have worked better for me. Instead, it morphed into something it wasn't and slid into a season that left me behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its A good Slide","review":"After watching some of the Bad Programming that FOX has.

Both cases are a huge risk to the discs. In the first one, its pretty easy to scratch them against one another. And this one is even worse!!! The double-sided discs wouldn't have been a problem if they hadn't arranged the case the way they did. Having to take the top disc out to get to the bottom disc? Absolutely ridiculous!. And you practically have to hold the case open with both hands just to open it wide enough to get the discs out without scratching them. Then, you've got no hands left to grab the disc(s)!!! If you plan on buying this series, plan on investing in a set of cases too. There's no way you should keep them in the case they come in."},{"rating":"1","title":"a great series that lost it","review":"I was a huge fan of sliders, seasons 1 and 2....and something happened, perhaps with the change of leadership at the top. It went from being a sophisticated, adults sci fi show about the possibilities of alternate universes....to a show aimed at the 14 year old market, emulating sci fi monster films, breaking all of its own rules in the process. They couldn't go back in time, yet....guess what? They did!

The first stage, provided by two high carbon steel blades, sets the bevel. The second stage, two ceramic rods, hones the bevel perfectly and easily.

I was able to get a sharp blade but it didn't seem to hold very long. When I saw that Wusthof had a sharpener, I knew it would be worth having. Already knowing the quality of their products, I was certain this would be the same.After passing my knives through a few times, the sharpness was back. No fuss, no muss. Easy to hold when placed on the counter and no angle to figure out.The only down side is that there are no instructions or advice included. I don't know if this should be used every time I want to sharpen my knives or just occasionally. Also, I question whether I am sharpening my scissors correctly since I had to figure it out on my own. Perhaps the Wusthof Web site has more information. Otherwise, it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last long....","review":"I am guessing most folks review this knife sharpener shortly after they get it.I too was pleased at first.

Looks like the sharpening elements get dull.Poor quality product not meant to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wusthof makes a quality product that's easy to use","review":"How much needs to be said about a knife sharpener?

I have had three graco infant seats and they have all had the warning label on them in the same spot, none of the labels have been a problem they are not scratchy and will not hurt your child. It sounds like the previous reviewer was just worried about the looks of the seat not the function, and function (SAFETY) should be the primary concern. I currently have two of these seats and matching duoglider in the GGG pattern(the graco G is in two tones of brown on fabric). I have been VERY happy with all three of my graco snugrides they are very safe and my babies have been comfortable in them.

We bought the entire travel system and threw the boxes away...otherwise it would probably have been returned by now.My daughter absolutely hates it! Been using it since birth and now she is 4 months old. It is designed to rock & sits almost v shaped making the bottom squish down into the seat. The seat is very confining and not comfortable. It's design is to be cozy, but my daughter finds it constricting. She is always sweaty after being in there. The buckle where you snap the harness into does not move, so you must loosen only the straps around the shoudlers: this makes the harness snap around the diaper area very tight and loose straps around the the top. The carry bar is uncomforatble and the seat is very heavy. Not pleased at all with this model. Now on the search of another carseat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable for the baby...for the mommy it's a pain in the #*$^#%!","review":"This car seat has (for the most part) been great! At nine months our little girl still fits in it quite well. She has been very comfortable in it. We never found it to be too tight for her or difficult to get her in and out. We have gotten many complements on the pattern as well. The big complaints that we have had have been: getting the handle up (a major pain!) and that the metal piece that holds the straps in the back getting caught on the holder for the manual (making it difficult to tighten the straps properly!). Because of these two things we have decided to upgrade to a convertible car seat before she has out grown the SnugRide. We will keep the SnugRide in my husbands car in case of an emergency...but for everyday its out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO!!!","review":"I just had my first daughter a month ago and was obsessed with reviews and finding the perfect everything for her! I was sure this was the perfect car seat, with the comfy foam and cute design, but it is the complete opposite, the black rubs off on EVERYTHING, even after being washed 3 times, most of her pink and white clothes are ruined (thanks graco), the foam is comfy but constricting, she was premature and still very small (7 pnds) and looks akward and uncomfortable and the head support DOES NOT work, her poor little head bounces everywhere I end up having to ride in the back seat to protect her neck...

Both a comedy and a romance.Amy Adams was both cute and funny. Her character was at times annoying but also likeable. The idea to be the one to propose to the boyfriend showed her as being a 21st century woman. But it also showed her as being silly (going to Ireland to propose the day of leap year).Matthew Goode. This guy is a dream. Yes I know he's English playing an Irish character. But he did do a good job at it. He played the part really well. His character had a devil-may-care and anti-relationship attitude. I just loved him.The story-line was unrealistic. The whole falling in love within a matter of a few days was predictable.

So we only wasted 30 minutes on the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled","review":"Tell me if you've seen this story (a thousand times)!(1.)

I watched the entire film, but I was not engaged by it, and I found it to be trite. Leap Year reminded me of the film Romancing the Stone, though I consider Romancing the Stone to be a better film. I had no problem with the storyline or the acting by the cast, though. The Irish scenery was interesting, and the attractive Amy Adams did a solid job in her character portrayal. Actually, I rate Leap Year 2.5 stars. It is not a film that I consider to be a favorite, but it was cute and worthy of a viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only thats good is the scenery","review":"(Spoiler) I rented this from Amazon.com bc i normally agree with reviewers here. Not this time...This was a common and terribly written seen it a hundred times attempt at a love story. I am a sucker for those love stories where you know the couple will probably get together at the end. But, it has to be written in such a way where you actually care. I could have just as easily seen this couple ending up being friends and the woman ending up with her original boyfriend. It really absolutley made no difference. And it really wasnt the actors they did fine with the material that they had there was just no substance. Nothing to make you want the couple together or the other couple apart. The only good thing were the beautiful scenes of Ireland."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of 2010's Worst","review":"It's not good when one of the stars of your film says \\"I just know that there are a lot of people who will say it is the worst film of 2010.\\" Those are the words of Matthew Goode (Amy Adams costar) and boy is he right. The writing, horrible effects (attempting to paste the actors into scenes from Ireland), 1950s plot and clunky acting - wow - this film should never received the green light. What a waste of my time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"This movie is just as simple and entertaining to me. It didnt drag the story for a long time and it was romantic in every angle you can think of, at least to me. Matthew and Amy were just as funny and sweet, wonder why they never mention his name or depict him in any of these Men Magazines like GQ and them? I will highly recommend it to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had high hopes. Sorely let down.","review":"I had high hopes for this film... A co-worker recommended it and said the scenerey from Ireland was beautiful--that was the only good part about the movie. I kept up my hopes until about halfway thru when i realized it wasn't getting any better. I seiously don't undestand how good actors keep making these horrible movies--must be something other than their acting skills...Such a good storyline could have been so much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most un-romantic romantic film EVER!","review":"This is one time I should have paid attention to the right side (negative) of the reviews. I have been anticipating viewing this film ever since I heard the Maltin pro give it a thumbs up.Went to Redbox to rent it for $1.27 and it's not available in GA. I see why. I was so enchanted with Amy Adams in \\"Enchanted\\" that I just wanted to see her in another film.The Irish accent from the star was very hard to understand and since AMA will not get subtitles, I had no idea what the male lead was saying. I will still try another Amy Adams film as she is adorable, but this ranked up there with the top five most terrible films I have ever rented and this is saying something because I am a 'movie-olic.'. . .wish I had not spent the $2.99 and a call to AMA to get this film. . . should have listened to my gut."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to gouge my eyes out","review":"I love romantic comedies and I like Amy Adams. Correction, liked Amy Adams. The plot is unoriginal, the acting is horrible, the characters were flat and there wasn't a single moment that made me laugh. I couldn't even stick around to the end. Amy Adams' character was uptight and unlikable. The Irish guy was rude and the cardiologist boyfriend was annoying. Save yourself the agony and skip this one. I don't usually write reviews, but this one is just THAT bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure after a couple of weeks","review":"I had gotten this movie back in early part of October and I really havent watched the movie that many times. Well, suddenly the movie would freeze and when it started back up again, the sound was not working. It is not the player because I would put in another movie as soon I got tired of fooling with the movie. It is really odd but I think I may have just gotten a lemon. I'm not going to be the one saying do not buy from this seller cause I had great delivery. It is more of a product failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even An Adorable Accent Can't Save This One","review":"A bad cold and a lack of cable led me to invest my dollar at Redbox. What a mistake. I figured it would be cliche in spots...but oh, the whole way through! Amy Adams' cute clothes and the lush landscape were somewhat distracting, but the unreliable car, the pretend marriage that leads to a forced, revelatory kiss, the off-handed comments that change their lives...even a NyQuil haze couldn't make this film interesting. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Before You Leap ...","review":"And too bad too. The leads are very good and the scenery better, but the story doesn't cut it. This film is essentially a remake of \\"It Happened One Night\\" that happens to be set in Ireland, and it doesn't stack up with the original--the script just isn't as sharp as it should be.Can't anyone make a romantic comedy anymore?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most predictable","review":"I don't understand the appeal for this movie. It was predictable and silly.

Watch it more than once. The story is told by the facial expressions. The key is the recurring themes. Look for both. And the big question: yes and or no? I think yes so look for clues to this element. This is definitely a good, well done, well written, well directed movie. Amy Adams is always great, no question there. Matthew Goode is amazing. I love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like it","review":"This movie is clean and sweet. I did get me a little when she's falling for this guy while she already has a boy-friend.

I recommend for young and old as the message applicable to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"I love amy adams, so I watched this movie. It's a waste of time. The acting is poor and forced. You know what is going to happen right away. No surprises. And no, the movie does not get better. I was hoping it would and actually watched the whole damn thing like a sucker. Don't let this happen to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Display of Female helplessness and stupidity","review":"I wanted to watch something sweet, a love story.This movie started off weak, and only got weaker. This girl claims to be strong, in a good place in her life, successful.... And yet, I haven't the slightest idea how she got to that state with the common sense and smarts of a pebble. Apparently, the money she's mysteriously made as a decorator (doesnt take any kind of credentials or brains) has served her well, and masked her inability to make good life decisions (ie. not handing over your $1000 suitcase to a perfect stranger...and being surprised/pouty when they take it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"there is NO ACTRESS as good as Amy Adams","review":"As usual, Amy Adams does more with a character than one could imagine any other actress doing. This was a very enjoyable film (my favourite part was when he laughed at her with his mouth full of food while driving). It has just a few creaky moments (i.e the wedding shoe scene), but I LOVED that it didn't have overt sexual behaviour or violence or foul language which seems to mar so movies these days (and has ruined most Jude Law film roles for me -- what a waste of talent there). Amy Adams is charming and Matthew Goode manages to put much naturalness into a role that could have fallen quickly into the stereotypical. Goode manages to keep the romantic lead firmly grounded in a masculine ethos. Leap Year is a film most women will want to enjoy more than once, and most men will find watchable at least once. (And yes, it helped me to figure out what I would save if my home was on fire.) Very charming gem of a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The title of this movie should have been \\"Lame Year\\" and not \\"Leap Year\\". Disappointed as both my husband and I love Amy Adams. She made a mistake on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The only redeeming thing this movie offers is the scenery. The plot was predictable and plodding. The romantic and comedy parts were basically left out of this romantic comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unendurable","review":"I like romcoms. I like Amy Adams. I almost like silly, sexist 1950s situation comedies as long as there is some element of freshness. These aren't my favourite things, but sometimes a little mindless escapism is just the ticket.But this is unwatchable, and after 45 minutes I accepted defeat and turned it off.The characters are boring. Their situation is boring. The protagonists are supposed to be unappealing in the beginning because their relationship together is supposed to grow from conflict to co-operation to charismatic romance, but everything is working against this. The dialogue is inane. The Irish locals are nasty rednecks. Ireland, a truly beautiful country, looks dull!If 'Leap Year' transcends all these flaws and polishes into a beautiful diamond in the second half then I apologise for not being able to endure the journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"fahgetaboutit","review":"very poor quality tape - skipped periodically and finally jammed my DVD tray -ergo -no longer watching DVDs...... Lesson Learned: don't buy second hand tapes !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was terrible.","review":"I am a big Amy Adams fan, and her co-star is a total fox. But those are the last two good things I have to say about this one. Bad dialogue, bad plot, bad chemistry, bad editing, bad writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chemistry! Very funny!","review":"What a charming and funny movie! I can't think how I missed this in the theaters, where was I when this one ran? Goode and Adams have just delightful chemistry! I love Goode's accent, Adams is lovely, as always; the countryside is beautiful, and the Irish people sweet and entertaining. It was amusing to see Adams, so in control in the first scenes, come so unraveled and vulnerable as the trip goes on, and the disasters begin to pile -- and then to watch Goode's character grow in kindness and respect. Great valentine movie, but I think I'll watch it again on St. Patty's Day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"As anyone who has seen my reviews knows, my tastes are varied and eccentric. Usually not romantic comedies, but this one is SUPERB! The humour was tops, the swearing was minimal, no sex scenes, and the plot was funny. Yes, it may be \\"predictable\\", but so are young couples falling in love. It happens over and over, yet humans don't tire of it. So why tire of a \\"love story\\" that is well told? The Irish landscapes are great, the actors do their jobs well, and the humour goes from subtle to slapstick. A true family film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching sweet love story","review":"Anyone who likes Amy Adams will like Leap Year. Shot in Ireland, the cinematography is beautiful as well as the sound track.Especially the very different and haunting version of Neil Young's \\"Only Love Can Break your Heart.\\" The film is a mix of old and modern values and comes out some where in between, making it a film anyone can enjoy.The script is weak in places, but the actors carry it through and even though it is some what predictable so is every other romantic comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film!!","review":"This is a very cute and romantic movie with great acting. I loved it not just because of the great acting performances by Amy and Matthew, but it is the feeling you get when two people fall in love. The ache in your heart when they depart from each other... and then the expoding climax as they get back together. I've watched this movie on cable like 4 times, and I haven't gotten tired of it because it is so breathtaking to see the beautiful scenery of Ireland. Who cares if it didn't do well in the theatres, I loved it anyway despite anybody who didn't care for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Leap Year\\"","review":"Best movie even in a long time. Since we recently returned from a trip to Ireland, it is more special because we actually saw some of the places in the movie. Watch it and you will want to visit Ireland very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"Movie was as stinky as their shoes, but then you'd have to see it to understand that comment - don't waste your time or money. I feel horrible about the #3 and 2 hours that I just parted with to see this. I kept thinking that it had to get better, but no. Male lead was the only saving grace, not bad acting with the script given to the poor guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned it off half way through...","review":"Nothing special. No chemistry between the main actors. Dragged on. Turned it off somewhere in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puts you right too sleep,LOL","review":"Did anyone really expect this to be anymore than an average romantic comedy? I no i sure didn't. I even expected that it would be unoriginal. Most romantic comidies are. However, none of this makes up for the fact that this movie gets it all wrong. Lets start off with the casting. Amy Adams should never be considered a leading lady. She has a quirky awkwardness about her that never seems to work. Some actresses have this genre down packed (Kate Hudson-Katherine Heigl) and some never will. I felt sorry for Matthew Goode because his performace was actually pretty good. Sorry, this film is not very entertaining. In the scenes that should be funny it seems like the actors are not trying hard enough. I hate to repeat myself but Amy Adams ruined this already unfunny little flick. This one gets 2 THUMBS DOWN. Don't even waist your time renting this one. You've already seen this story before. You just couldn't recognize it because now it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh, kinda sucks.","review":"A so-so love story with good looking people, beautiful shots of Ireland, and a story you really never fall for. At no point does your heart break and make you think \\"I hope they end up together.\\" you instead think, oh well, if they do great, but I don't see why. After a garbled mess of a patch work story, and losely based writing format of conflict, climax, resolution, you finally get a bit of back story. Not that it adds up to anything, bad stuff happens, good stuff happens, and then well, it ends, and you don't feel any differently than when it started. Stick with P.s I love you, or Enchanted if your hankering for a good love story with Amy Adams. This one, won't leave you caring one way or another if there is a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"as an Irish person, this was painful to watch - wish there was a \\"zero\\" star available","review":"I picked this movie to watch entirely because Amy Adams stars in it, and I've admired her work in other movies. I was also probably feeling a little homesick for Ireland, and thought it might cheer me up, especially since it is listed as a comedy.How wrong was I?Was the \\"comedy\\" part of this to rewind the outside perception of Ireland to that of the 1950's? Because how else could someone have thought there was any sense or meaning to the plot in this movie? Or was this on a sarcastic black humour level that I entirely missed? Not even Amy Adams could rescue this one. Don't waste your time or your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie","review":"Great Movie. DVD worked without a problem.

Thankfully, I didn't listen and rented it this weekend to watch with my teenage kids. We absolutely loved it. In fact, we watched it twice and loved it even more the second time because we were able to more fully catch the subtle wit and humor. Who says romcoms have to be full of sex and inuendo to attract teenage audiences. My teens loved it.Hollywood or \\"Hollywierd\\", as it has come to be called, puts out so much filthy garbage that it is refreshing to find something clean and funny that represents marriage as something desirable instead of detestable. Thank you Deborah Kaplan & Harry Elfont (writers) and Anand Tucker (director) for going against the current of sexualized and explicit media."},{"rating":"1","title":"French Kiss in Ireland","review":"This movie is very similar to the Meg Ryan/Kevin Kline movie, French Kiss, except the location is Ireland instead of France. Girl flies to foreign country to bring back/marry the man she loves/meets a sarcastic, cute-but-bitter foreign guy/ travels around on madcap adventures with him/ has her suitcase stolen/ foreign guy threatens thief to get the case back/ fnds the guy she went searching for/ doesn't want him anymore/ stays with/goes back to the foreign guy. Even the scene in the car with the lead man making fun of her 'plan' is almost identical. Oh, and the shower scene, too.

There is no chemistry between the two main characters and the story line is so cliche as to be annoying. Seriously does Hollywood not realize that women have more interests than snagging a man for marriage. UGH!Thought I'd try watching it again cuz we've been snowed in for a couple of days and I was bored. I watched it thinking maybe it was just the mood I was in that other time. It wasn't.

Characters not appealing.","review":"This is about the most predictable, contrived, unoriginal romance movies I've seen.The only reason to see this movie is Amy Adams and the Irish scenery.[Spoilers:]Her main Irish love interest is unappealing at the beginning and doesn't completely improve by the end. Their early animosity quickly becomes tedious, then continues throughout too much of the movie.In fact, all the Irish people in the movie get rather poor portrayals. The Irish people I've known were more friendly than those you see in this movie.I found it rather incredulous that the Amy Adams character would fall for such a rude and unromantic guy. He softens a little but even in practically the last scene he still calls her an idiot, even if in jest. If I were a woman I wouldn't be impressed with this guy, even after understanding his reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luckily leap years only happen every four years!","review":"Haven't I seen this movie before???

Thank goodness I checked Amazon. The positive reviews here got me to buy it (although I still didn't expect much). It has quickly become one of my favorite films, one that I'll watch for years. Somehow the two leads manage to convey their characters slow and reluctant growth from a blazing clash of personalities to real intimacy. I believed every word and gesture that they made.

Two of the tracks were recorded under the name of Leonard Feather. The liner notes do not make any of this clear, and the cover picture is clearly Hackett at a later stage in his life. Nevertheless, the tracks are good, solid dixieland jazz, as interpreted in the swing era. There is one vocal track, \\"Blue and Disillusioned,\\" featuring Linda Keene. All the other tracks are instrumentals. The highlight is Hackett's 1940 interpretation of \\"Singing the Blues.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This book totally changed my life, the way I view God and modern man.

The songs that begin it ('A Good Man', 'Testify', 'Moments')are pretty good then, towards the end (Lucky Man', 'Painted Too Much Of This Town', 'A Boy Becomes A Man'), they fall squarely into Nashville disposable fluff. Too bad, because the fire-brewed playing and musical reference to 'Kasmir' in 'Devil Went Down To Georgia' would be lost on those whose perfect day is spent wasting away on a front porch watching children play in the yard.

It was their only release (other than some EPs) although you can contact members of the band for CDRs of unreleased songs I assume are from the same time period.

The last two tracks sound more appropriate for romantic films instead of a sci-fi movie. Why James Cameron & Brad Fiedel weren't involved with the third movie is a mystery to me, as they also made \\"The Terminator\\" franchise into what it is with the first two movies. Don't waste your money on this soundtrack. Stick with the albums for the first two films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terminate this soundtrack","review":"This score is just a symptom of a bad movie. Beltrami has done better music in the past (The Crow: Salvation) but this is a farce of the the original score mastered by Brad Fiedel.The original theme is used once - during the end credits - and Beltrami seemed almost embarrassed to interpret it as the music comes across sounding like a low-end keyboard played through a Sparkomatic AM radio. The entire score is irrelevant to the film and sounds like a jarbled collaboration of techno nonsense.Avoid it even at a used price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome score!","review":"One of My favorite scores is this one! Its exciting and has the listener's adrenaline following! Most of the tracks roll right into each other making no breaks in the score. Its loud and has good rhythm with mixed electronics and orchestra. A couple songs are located at the end of the CD. Fans of the performers should like them. Marco Beltrami's Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines score is an non-stop action packed listen from beginning end! Check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissappointing","review":"I am a big fan of the Terminator movies. I have the soundtracks to the first two movies, including the rare German import \\"Definitive Edition\\". I enjoy the Terminator theme so much, I eagerly awaited the release of the Terminator 3 score. I was very disappointed to find out that the movie did not open with the familiar theme. I might have been willing to forgive this, if it had been used periodically in the film. But sadly, it was not. The composer had a chance to take a great theme that was used in Terminator 1 and 2 and do something special with it. However, he chose to use very unmelodic music (and I use the term loosely). It is more like white noise or atmospheric sounds. You definitely do not leave the theater remembering any of the themes, if there are any. Shameful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for the money","review":"I only just got it, but this Sabine Zipbeat metronome seems pretty decent. Takes a 9V battery, but it comes with one.

In fact, I did put it down. Several times. I even stopped halfway through and read another novel, then finished this one. The main characters of this novel are all corrupt politicians, and I found it hard to muster sympathy for corrupt politicians. I just did not care what happened to them. Further, the writing of the subplot about the relationship between Roscoe and his love Veronica was uninspired. In fact, I thought most of the scenes involving the two of them read like a cheap romance paperback.I loved Kennedy's book \\"Ironweed\\" which dealt with the outcasts of Albany's society. This book deals with the insiders of Albany's society.

When you produce a record yourself, it tends to end up exactly how you want it. As for those who want to bash the lyrics as 'meaningless' and with 'no substance', you're absolutely right, and that's a good thing. This band doesn't take themselves too seriously, and in the spirit of bands like the Ramones, the Dead Boys, and Motley Crue, fun, innocent lyrics are a rarity and a refreshing alternative to the likes of terrible songwriters like Staind and Saliva, who want everybody to feel sorry for them.

I have that cassette! It's called Tot Ou Tard. I received it as a review copy and I have been looking for the full length albums ever since. I actually saw them as imports for $16 each at amazon dot com, but now that I see them as much more reasonable mp3 downloads, I finally got them. They do NOT disappoint!I really like their second one, with the giant water balloon on the cover. Very tight, dense, intricate but very melodic prog in the Rock In Opposition style. A bit more 'challenging' than a lot of ELP (unless you consider, for instance, some parts of Tarkus) or stadium prog, although I like the original lineup of Asia too.Recomended for 'Serious' listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prolific, but a bit overrated","review":"The Perfect Planet & Other Stories probably would have worked better if it had just been the Perfect Planet. In the first (and best) of three long stories, James imagines himself inhabiting a world inhabited by robotic versions of the people he knew as a child. His interactions with these robots is intended to give us some deeper understanding of our humanity. It works on some level, even if the only real conclusion we arrive at is that people are mean-spirited jerks who don't deserve to live. The second tale, a meandering non-adventure featuring James and his wife, their talking cat, and a misunderstood snowflake, never really gets off the ground, and the third story, about a frog, a fly and a malevolent toadstool, reads like Jon Lewis' late, great True Swamp after about a dozen bong hits. Kochalka is certainly prolific, but a thin idea is a thin idea whether it takes two pages to complete or twenty.

Several pages later, I was sound asleep. I attribute this to the fact that Viola Solin, when she's theorizing, writes like Immanuel Kant tripping on acid. This was especially discouraging, since I had just finished reading Audition by Michael Shurtleff, which is the most clearly written and insightful book on acting anyone could ever ask for.Skimming the exercise descriptions, I found some of them tedious (\\"Play a salesman with only your calves!\\") and some of them risible (\\"Scream with your elbow!\\"). Also, her chapter on Emotion seems to contradict the entire Method acting tradition, which, thankfully, she is in no danger of overthrowing.I'm sure that there are some useful points that this book makes, or might make through its exercises, if I cared to try them. But thanks to Spolin's soporific word-salad, her points are a pleasure to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the foundation guide for Improv","review":"I had to rreplace a copy that I'd had for many many years but lost to a house fire, so I was glad to find it again.

Even when the fight goes to the ground alot of the contenders will defend very well and try to change position or take advantage rather than sitting back trying not to lose. Theres some well known guys popping up in here and also some unknown randoms which make for some spectacular rumbles, technical or slug fests.

It is a book providing a thorough and sound foundation in English grammar through sentence diagramming. It is clearly written, comprehensive, and easy to understand. It is \\"Grammar by Diagram\\" by Cindy L. Vitto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful but flawed","review":"The book is a helpful refresher for those of us who remember sentence diagramming but have forgotten some of its nuance. I have been using it to teach a 14-year-old high school student some basic grammar that she never learned in grammar school! In particular, sentence diagramming as depicted in this book have helped her to see the differences between pronouns in the nominative case and pronouns in the objective case. Having learned to diagram prepositional phrases, she can better understand why, for example, it is wrong to say, \\"Just between you and I,\\" or \\"Give it to Mary and I.\\" Nevertheless, the author is distressingly ignorant of the meaning of passive voice. Her misunderstanding is fundamental and detracts from an otherwise good book, which explains why the books earns only two stars.

The author does not understand sentence structure or verb usage. Most seriously, she confuses active and passive voice with transitive and intransitive verbs. She also privileges passive voice over sentences beginning with expletives, a choice that will result in poorly written essays.

It's like the two are one -- there was no looking at my Dad without seeing his love for Sam Cooke. And there is no listening to Sam Cooke -- even to this day -- without remembering my Dad.There have been great voices since Sam Cooke, but none will ever be equal to him.

In my opinion Collective Soul does not get nearly enough recognition for thier talent and song-writing ability. All of the songs on this album are good but the ones that really stand out are Heavy, Needs, Slow, Run, and the incredible ending song Crown.

I have been listening to it non-stop for several weeks now. I find something familiar, and something new, with each spin. #4, 7, 8, 10 and 11 are my favorites. For those who say their lyrics are shallow - well, what can I say. Anyone in touch with life, relationships, and spirituality will not find Collective Soul shallow. If you are into guns, violence, killing, trashing other people and pity parties for how unfair life is then, yes, this might not appeal to you. Otherwise, take a listen. It is anything but shallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Right Dosage","review":"I agree with the reviews for \\"Dosage\\" this album did get ignored, how people ignored such a wonderful album is beyond me. The album started off with two very well written and well sung songs, the first was the rock hit \\"Heavy\\" which I think is one of Collective Souls' finest, then on the heels off \\"Heavy\\" came \\"Run\\" where the band totally switches styles to a more laid back approach, and again the hit the mark with this song, then they released about three more songs that definitely should have been recieved by radio better, \\"No More,No Less\\", and \\"Tremble For My Beloved\\" were great songs, but the song \\"Needs\\" never should have been ignored, \\"Needs\\" is probably my 3rd favorite on the CD, other than \\"Heavy\\" and \\"Run\\" which were on the charts at the same time, this is a great album, sorely underapprecaited by the music world, and it also has one of the best album covers around, so I agree how did this album not do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't say enough about this one...","review":"Dosage is just a truly remarkable accompishment by a truly remarkable band. I have all 5 of Collective Soul's CDs, and in my opinion, this one is, all-around, the best of the five. This CD was actually the first of theirs that I purchased, and from top to bottom one of the best CDs I've ever purchased. Ross Childress plays guitar like some sort of flawless machine, Ed Roland seems to be able to do no wrong here, and Shane Evans drumming is once again nothing shy of standout.The single, Heavy, shows just how superior Collective Soul is to most other bands out there today. The terrific blend of guitar and that driving beat is truly breath-taking.I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a huge Collective Soul fan, and if you were to purchase this CD, I think you'd have to say the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best album of 1999","review":"Although it's different from their previous albums but it's still great! With a mixture a of explosive songs like \\"Heavy\\" and \\"Tremble for my Beloved\\" to relaxing acoustic songs like \\"Run\\" and \\"Compliment\\" and even a bonsu track (\\"She Said\\") from the Scream 2 soundtrack! this is easily collective soul's best album and possibly the best album of 1999 with something in it for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Collective Soul has done it again!!!","review":"With their new CD, Dosage, Collective Soul has risen to the ranks of King of Pop. This CD contains the perfect mix of lyrics and emotion. This is one the top CDs that they have released. It's right up there with their self-titled album."},{"rating":"2","title":"As usual CS kicks butt!!!","review":"This group continues to grow stronger with each release. This disc is fun to listen to and seems to fly by. I love the remix of \\"She said\\" (the hidden track) and \\"Generate\\" is pure rock at it's best. Ed Roland is gifted at writing catchy guitar riffs and hooks that are extremely pleasant to the ear. I also enjoyed hearing Ross sing on one tune. The last release stayed in my auto disc changer for 8 straight months, this one will most likely match that...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money!","review":"I am a big Collective Soul fan and was not let down by Dosage. I was deeply impressed by the fact that it did not completely sound like there old stuff. It shows that they can offer a variety of sounds unlike so many bands. They used a bigger range of sounds and instruments and like always there lyrics are the icing on the cake. My favorite songs are Run, Dandy Life, and the hidden track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dosage takes a back seat to thier previouse two CDs.","review":"The first two songs on Dosage are the only two that sound the way I like Collective Soul to sound. I can listen to Collective Soul (2) and Disciplined Breakdown all the way through from beginning to end anytime, Dosage on the other hand falters after the first few songs with an occational catchy riff after that. Bring back the loud and proud Collective Soul that became my favorite band four years ago. Oh! By the way, please come back to the Spokane area. Believe it or not thier are many C.S. fans here in the Inland Empire."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Turning Point for CS","review":"This album is a departure from their previous two. If you are looking for a repeat of just their heavier past songs, you may be disappointed. However, if you want to watch the beginning of the transformation of CS into a band with staying power and a broadening range, buy it and enjoy. With the addition of keyboards and other techniques, CS is definitely on their way."},{"rating":"2","title":"They have perfected their sound. absolutely amazing.","review":"I'm a huge fan. I have to admit I kinda forgot about them after Discipline Breakdown but what a comeback with \\"Dosage\\". They are by far one of the greatest bands ever. buy it, buy all the albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden track and internet only access to music","review":"While I enjoyed the music on this CD, I totally dislike the records label use of the internet to get your email address in order to unlock the HIDDEN content on the cd. I hope this is not a music trend. If I pay $14 for a cd, I don't think it entitles you to make me give you an email address for junk mail in order to hear what I paid for. Not to mention having to be on the internet to listen to content that you paid for on your CD is totally wrong. I don't want to be on the internet to hear music that sounds better on my stereo than my PC. MUSIC 4 Stars, Record company marketing -10. IMHO TJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another agreeable, strong album by Collective Soul","review":"This is probably Collective Soul's best album after the self-titled second album that had a bunch of hits. For sure, it is another case of great musicianship blending \\"classic\\" and \\"modern\\" elements into a fine pop/rock album.\\"Heavy\\", the first single and second track on this album, epitomizes what this band is about at their best. Meaty guitar track and strong vocals in a very catchy song. \\"Run\\" is another single that is moody, melodic, and sweet--vintage slower Collective Soul. \\"Tremble For My Beloved\\" gets the album off to an anthemic/rocking start. \\"Generate\\" is a catchy, mid-tempo rocker with similar stylings to some of the second album tracks. \\"Crown\\" and the hidden track within it end the album with melodic, lush, relaxed stylings.The flow of this album is one of its strengths. Good mix of rockers and slower tracks, and none of them are fillers. As a whole, a very enjoyable rock album. Great musicianship and sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I was not a listener of Collective Soul when they were popular in the '90s or early '00s; so I am new to them. I love this CD however! A friend of mine who knew my musical style and taste thought I would like this CD and I do. It's a great mix of really different styles of music and I even like the order it is in; it seems to flow even though each song is so different than the one in front. Rock, Soul, Easy, Contemplative--it's all there. I know that some reviewers really raked Collective Soul over the coals (no rhyme intended here) but this is a great CD. Listen to the cuts before you buy; I happen to have very eclectic taste that runs the gamut from Classical to Blues to Blue Grass to Country to Classic Rock to Pop to Jazz and then some! So I liked the fact that there were so many different styles represented here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singable, danceable - what more do you need?","review":"This album contains one of my all-time favourite 'in the mood' songs - \\"No More No Less\\" - and one of my favourite 'takes me out of myself' songs - \\"Run\\", so there's nothing I can say about it that's not good. The track with vocals by the lead guitarist (Ross Childress) is by no means gratuitous - he's really good and could be featured more often, and Ed Roland is amazing as always. I consider this and the self-titled second album to be their best releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album","review":"In this one Collective Soul are more sythesizer stuff. Just about every album is different in a way. That is cool"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty great but....","review":"I have to admit that when i first heard this i was alitte disappointed- it definately was not as great as the last albums with songs like \\"the world i know\\" and \\"shine.\\" But... it was really great listening to; there is not one bad song! And, the more i listen to it, the more i like it. It may be a different path than the other albums but i dont think thats in a bad way. Collective Soul really is evolving and surprises me every time. And thats more than i can say than some other bands that bore us with the same music over and over again! (green day)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GO C.S.!!!","review":"If you liked \\"Hints Allegtions And Things Left Unsaid\\" you won't like this one. But i personally loved it.TREMBLE FOR MY BELOVED-A cool song with REALLY hard guitar but softer & melodical vocals.HEAVY-My favorite song on the whole album, it has Ed Roland basically repeating: \\"All of you're weight. It falls on me. It brings me down\\" in a deep and rocky voice.NO MORE, NO LESS-A pop-y song where Ed Roland is talking about being \\"No more, no less of an angel.\\"NEEDS-The only song on this album that i hate.SLOW-A good song (although Ed Roland gets pretty high-pitched with his vocaling).DANDY LIFE-A good song that sounds diffrent from the rest 'cause it's written by Ross Childress (the lead & rythm guitarist).RUN-My 2nd favorite on the album, it's a mysterious, melancholy and not nasty song.GENERATE-Not as bad as \\"Needs\\" and not as good as \\"Heavy\\" & \\"Run\\".COMPLIMENT-See \\"No More, No Less.\\"NOT THE ONE-A good song but not a great one.CROWN-See \\"Generate\\"Well that's it and i recommend this to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for industrial application","review":"I have had four of these monitors in service (in a climate controlled room) for a little over one year.

In my experience, this CANNOT be used for operational use. Also, if you are left handed, this holster is not for you. The material is very firm and strong and can withstand just about anything. However, there is little to none adjustability. Also, when drawing your sidearm, it is extremely uncomfortable. For the price, which is about 15 dollars, it is a real deal to steal.

I was able to fit 2 8rnd mags in each magazine pouch, +1 in the well and bring on the zombie horde.to rectify the tight nose on the holster i took a sharp knife, and cut the stitching where the sides of the holster meet at the nose about 1\\". then used a heated element to make a hole in the appropriate place to refasten the nose to fit my pistol.

And besides, Lotte Eisner makes an interesting and complete review of the most important german films, for example Caligari, Nosferatu and Metropolis, also speaking a little about other films related to Germany, yet made in other countries. Since the authoress was one of the most important movie critics of Germany, and also a wickness of the birth of german cinema after the First World War, her statements or reviews are solid and plenty of good reveals."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have 3 of these and love them","review":"These stools are taller than the standard children's footstool which makes them the perfect height for my kids (ages 3 and 5) to be able to wash their hands at the sink by themselves.

By contrast,Star Wars: Dark Empire II 2nd Editionis just bad. The main villains are a bunch of Dark Jedi working for Palpatine who can't seem to do anything right. There really isn't much of a plot. The worst part is the Galaxy Gun. If you're sick of super-duper weapons, you'll hate the plot device. The Galaxy Gun can just fire a single missile and take out any planet. It makes being a dictator all the easier. But it's also pretty unrealistic and silly. After all, if such a weapon were possible Star Wars, why wouldn't anybody else build one? Rather than conquer the galaxy, why not just destroy any planet that puts up any resistance? And why didn't Palpatine use the Galaxy Gun to destroy Mon Calamari? Unfortunately, superweapons in the Star Wars universe have become a substitute for a good plot and character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks. Really stinks.

I had just gotten over the Star Wars Christmas special and Han's party in ZORBA THE HUTT's REVENGE (oh, so hardened smugglers drink \\"zoochberry juice), when I found Dark Empire II. For starters, the title just shows how lazy Veitch and his editors are. Emperor Palpatine's death was the climax of Return of the Jedi and was the moment was marked the redemption of Anakin Skywalker and the fall of the Empire. So what does Veitch do? Resurrects our favorite despot...over and over and over. And I have to admit that the World Devestators were a decent concept (much more efficient than a Death Star). But the Galaxy Gun is just plain stupid. Especially since the Galaxy Gun ends up colliding with the aptly named Eclipse II, destroys Byss, and makes me wonder why I spent the money. Thanks alot Tom Veitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone wanting to make money off of Star Wars","review":"The first book was mildly interesting, but Veitch really has no grasp of what Star Wars is. It's not creating better and better weapons and making things look more and more hopeless. It's about people pulling together to overcome the odds. The way they portray the Emperor is highly implausible. If he could make Dark Jedi with a mere touch he should have been able to obliterate the Rebellion without a thought the first time. And I doubt that all the warlords are going to just stop fighting each other and join up with the first person that comes along claiming to be the Emperor. Where does he get all these resources? All in all it looks like someone wanted to cash in on the Star Wars resurgence and decided one book wasn't enough. Lots of nice art and action, but annoyingly little substance. Veitch saddled a lot of good authors with his poor plot, forcing them to acknoweldge his ideas to preserce continuity.

Indeed it can be shown that false belief as much as true belief (and in fact no belief at all) can infer an increased level of fitness on the host organism.If evolutionary psychology has any truth at all its truth is that we cannot trust our mental faculties to obtain the truth at all.

I started to raise my eyebrow a bit in the beginning of it and so I went the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com) to see what screenplays the author had written so that I could assure myself that this guy actually knew what he was talking about, but he had no writing credits at all! Not even \\"Glitter\\" or \\"Gigli\\" - even as bad as those are, at least that would mean that he has actually written a script that got picked up which would then give him the right to teach me a few lessons. I re-read the back of the book and it says that he is a professor of screenwriting.

From the opening track, it's a raw sensation that digs its way into your brain and refuses to get out. The band is AMAZING live, with so much energy that it feels like drinking a pot of coffee. Their sound is reminiscent of older stuff from Aerosmith, Billy Idol, and The Clash, with definite elements of old-school punk rock that will have you headbanging, dancing around like an idiot, and cranking it up to maximum volume. My favorite track is \\"Bad Things to Bad People\\" simply because it is impossible to ignore; it slaps you in the face with the very definition of indulgent rock 'n roll.If you like bands like Fireball Ministry, The Knives, and CKY, you will LOVE Bullets and Octane."},{"rating":"2","title":"a long time","review":"I also saw this in 1980 when i was 12.

The characters serve merely to support the action, which in turn functions entirely as a structure for the effects (which, along with the sets and costuming, are rather good). Somewhere in the midst of watching it I got a craving for Gone With the Wind, which made me realize how fantastic a vampire Scarlett O'Hara would have been.

Scarcely any of the author's droll wit is preserved in transition; this movie is exciting as an extravaganza of stylized combat, yet divested of its source material's facetious character, ultimately nothing more than inadvertently vacuous. At present, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a rarity among Anglophone screen actresses: personable, talented, a paragon of comely femininity. She's aptly cast as Mary Todd, but as so often before, her charm can't salvage an unappealing production, especially one in which a fun premise and ample talent are squandered beneath a discernibly artificial excess of CG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Terrible movie.

If I were Roger Ebert I would write \\"I hated, hated, hated, hated this concept\\" but being an ordinary mass culture addict with time, a credit card, a childish sense of curiosity and no discerning sense of taste, I went to see this movie. Perhaps it's a childhood indoctrinated with respect for a president during our most trying years as a country but I was unable to slip into that zone of acceptance where I enjoy science fiction or horror or for that matter 98% of films.

Not sure if they were being serious or not but it's one of those things where it was like they wanted to make a vampire movie but wanted to try and take it to the next level so they thought \\"Hey let's make Abraham Lincoln the vampire hunter\\". The acting was actually pretty good, which salvaged the movie for me to at least be able to finish it. It's just the premise that I couldn't buy for a movie in this genre.

I would not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"This ruined the premise of the book, I am not sure why the writer signed off on it, another sign that when Producers get input on a film or directors think people just like cool camera angles and forget the story you end up with this crud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abe and the vamps","review":"Well the story stuck with the facts of general history with a bit of writers imagination thrown in for entertainment.

A good B movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter","review":"Fun movie. I don't usually buy videos but I am buying this one! Loved it in the theater. Anyone who is expecting a serious or a historically accurate movie will be disappointed (duh.) But the production values, acting, and special effects were much better than I expected. The plot was much deeper than I expected for a movie with this title. The action was almost non-stop and many of the fight-scenes were over the top, but thoroughly enjoyable. This film has changed my life in one way: I am now convinced that Abraham Lincoln is way more awesome than Chuck Norris.This movie is not life-changing (again, duh) but it's a whole lot of fun. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was WAY better","review":"Most people I know who read the book loved the way the author seamlessly blended historical facts with fiction to make a really fun story. I could not put the book down.Not only did the movie leave out most of the back story that could help you understand why Abe was driven to hunt vampires, it reduced it to a large train explosion. I had a hard time believing the same author who wrote such an awesome book wrote this crummy screenplay. It even left out Abe's assassination and the twist at the end of the book.I love action movies and escapist entertainment as much as the next guy, but this movie really dumbed down a great story to something not really worth your time to watch.Read the book. It's way more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"You couldn't pay me to watch this again...","review":"I was so disappointed in this movie. I almost went to the movies to watch it - so glad i didn't. I love vampire, zombie, sci-fi anything. I generally even enjoy a \\"B\\" horror/sci-fi flick. So as I write this I am trying to illustrate that I really wanted to LIKE it. I won't give any spoilers in the review, but will say that this movie was all over the place. Several scenes were just ridiculous. The train scene, horse scene specifically just left me starring into outer space wondering what the hell was going on. Abe at times didn't seem human to me, which he was suppose to be. One minute he was young, the next he was old. I was playing games on my iPad the last 30 minutes of the movie and my boyfriend was sound asleep. Rent or buy at your own risk, but if you do watch it I hope that you enjoy it more than I did. The fighting scenes were cool, but again was Abe really human?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Storyline For This National Hero","review":"I admire Abe and the depiction of his life as president was a nice twist.Recommend for anyone (PG).

I know, another person who doesn't like the movie adaptation of a book but even on a strictly movie basis it was pretty bad. The movie had a basic introduction, just enough to get a person to understand the premise, but not enough for anyone to empathizes with any character.Basically, it was an action movie with just enough story to break up each fighting sequence to ensure that the entire movie wasn't one long battle. Some of the fight scenes were adequate, don't get me wrong, but there was a lot more that could have been done.

Believe me, non-sentient squirrels are the worst at picking movies to go see. Terrible. Even worse than the book. At a certain point the movie makers said \\"Screw the book.

So let me start with the good and let the s**t roll down hill. The graphics with this movie were good (with the exception of a few) and the character in the beginning was built up well... then it started getting far fetched (even for a fiction film). Things started to get way too over done and then they decided to push the limits some more. They could have inserted a few tag lines from Terminator and it would have fit in perfect; that's how misplaced some of the story was. Then they ended it all with a spin ( and let me give you a hint... this president rhymes with yo mama)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"I saw most of this movie in the theater before my friends and I just had to walk out. Poorly written/acted action films should at least have the decency not to take themselves too seriously, along with a high enough production value to make the film visually entertaining. This film was on the very low end of all those categories. (Again, I saw this in the theater, where the visual effects are supposed to be the most stunning, and I felt like I was watching a D level made for TV movie on a big screen). The premise is supposed to be campy, but the director/writer/producer couldn't seem to agree on whether to commit to campy-ness or take the serious hero route.

This movie had a buttload of it. After like the 5th scene I was fed up with it. The movie was too short, the acting was stale sometimes and it was like a quick minute story moment then back to action and slow motion scenes. I felt I was watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.

In the book, there are a lot more historical characters that Abe comes in contact with, who tie in to the whole \\"vampire\\" theme.I didn't feel there was enough character development at all. Again, referring to the book, I missed learning more about Abe's childhood and how that played a role in what he was to become.

I also found it offensive, even in a fantasy, the suggestion that Lincoln's mother Nancy and his son Willie were killed by vampires. I was also repulsed by the conceit that the Civil War was really a battle between the vampires and the mortals.

There are a few interesting bits but for the most part it's a limp story with a bunch of unknowns who lack screen presence. The vamps are buffoonish, clownish ogres who lack the syle and gravitas of Coppola's Dracula or Interview With The Vampire. And it is long, so very long, each minute felt like an hour. The movie drags, focusing too much on filling the screen with empty CGI and not enough on an engaging story. I hope this marks the end of the atrociously written mash up books.Skip this dud and rent Timur Bekmambemtov's Wanted, Night Watch or Day Watch if you are looking for great thrills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Lots of action and a decent story.

Someday, someone will have to explain to me why filmmakers insist on taking a perfectly well written story and totally ignoring it while adapting it to the screen. After the movie was over, I was convinced that I had read and watched two totally different stories.On the movie's merits alone, the plot was uneven (mind numbingly slow at some parts, too quick at others), the actual dialogue was crap made crappier by poor acting and worse directing, the action scenes were boring, including the big action scene toward the end which my friend had to nudge me awake to witness, then fell back to dozing until the end credits.Complete failure as a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"I loved the book, but I went into the movie knowing it was nothing like the book.

I would call this an entertaining and creative movie. The story line is original and fresh. The acting is great. If your stupid and think a movie about vampires should be historically accurate because the main character is Abraham Lincoln then this movie is not for you. Give this movie a chance!

It may be about vampires but I did not find it scary if that is a concern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good movie for men and women","review":"When my husband proposed watching this on Amazon Instant Video, I admit I grumbled a little. I grumbled even more at the beginning, which was quite violent and scary! Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that these vampires don't twinkle in the sunlight or profess their undying love to young girls, but these vampires are SCARY!Before long, though, I was completely engrossed in how history and fantasy were interwoven seemlessly.

Great effects, great acting, great flick.I'm glad I bought this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"You may be very disappointed if you read the book","review":"Abe Lincoln as a Vampire Hunter is certainly an imaginative idea. The movie's execution of the concept is far different from the book's:1. The movie is loosely focused on a plot and a super-vampire that does play a major role in the book.2. The movie's characters are loosely based upon the book. However some key characters are omitted, others are new, and some key characters are entirely different in terms of what they do in the movie vs. the book3. The surreal depiction and exploration of American History is 99% lost in the movie4. The definining events in Abe and Henry's lives are completely different from the book.Think of it in the following sense. Abe Lincoln was a legendary president...someone wrote a fantastic tale that he was also a vampire hunter...someone heard about the book (but didn't read it) and wrote a movie.I was not pleased and considered my time spent on the movie to be wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought George Washington was the president that used the ax? lol","review":"This is historically a total fictional account of Abraham Lincolns life.

Sure the story is a little silly but the production values are great. Special effects are fun. Action sequences are exciting. All in all, completely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Movie","review":"Okay, so the actor didn't really look that much like Lincoln and actual history is really tinkered with in a big way. But consider the title! If you just watch the film for the fun of it, it is well done. I enjoyed the special effects and didn't worry about historical accuracy (for a change, as I'm usually a stickler for that!). It's a goofy movie based on a goofy idea, so just relax and enjoy. Don't expect too much from the film, but I did enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great watch!!!","review":"great movie overall!!! excellent weapon of choice.........lol.

Flying over the holidays and different things caused me to start and stop the movie. Won't rent another movie from Amazon till they change their policy.

This would have been so much better had they made 3 movies out of it - there is so much material not even touched in this movie it is ridiculous.Not everyone in the 19th century was a Ninja/Circus acrobat, but you'd think so after watching this crud.

Definitely well made and thought out. May be that's exactly how it played out ;-) Worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I'm typically not into the recent vampire craze. No offense to Twilight fans, but it just doesn't appeal to me. Decided to watch this on a whim while getting mindless tasks done around the house, and was pleasantly surprised. I'm also not a huge fan of violence and though there was some gratuitous blood, it wasn't overly disturbing. The premise, though far-fetched, weaved in enough real historical events to make me think, yeah, maybe. Just don't tell my absolutely fabulous U.S. history teachers that. Now I kind of wish I had read the book first, because I usually try to do that with books made into movies, but I just didn't think I'd be interested enough. I might go back and try because it really is a creative story. I liked all of the actors, the portrayal of real people was interesting (particularly Mary Todd, I thought), the plot moved well, it was easy to follow, and there were some interesting twists and turns."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Movie Tash","review":"Sorry to have donated a few bucks for, no doubt, the worst excuse for entertainment we have ever spent...Amazon buyers must never had watched this trash for even ten minutes...I left the room after six minutes and my wife and neighbor shut it off after about thirty minutes.

I would absolutely recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BOOK, you guys","review":"Having read the book, I was hoping this would be a lot better. Seth Grahame-Smith's book incorporates a lot of real-life historical detail that not only adds depth to the story but really gives special meaning to all the vampire stuff. It's surprising that Grahame-Smith signed off on this movie, much less that he was responsible for the screenplay, because the story is hollowed out into a stylized action/horror movie that's pretty much what the title indicates, but nowhere near its potential, leaving it maybe a notch better than Sharktopus territory. Also, Benjamin Walker was really not good.I guess if you just want to see Abe Lincoln fight vampires, go for it, but if you know better or want more, just stick to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"If you have read the book, you will be very disappointed.

Unfortunately, the execution of the idea was lacking in many, many ways. Its essentially a flood of over-the-top computer generated combat that left me yawning and only the most labored attempt at any character building. The story itself was practially non-existient. There also weren't any key moments that left you thinking that plowing through the visuals was worth anything. For the most part, its a 2-hour video game trailer, without any real purpose or meaning.

Even though it wasn't really supposed to be funny but it was still good for a laugh. I absolutely love the Amazon customer service though. The playback when I was watching it was really bad where I pretty much couldn't see some of what was going on when anything fast happened. I'm pretty layed back though and I only payed about $4 to rent it, so I didn't really even think about complaining.

It was my husband's pick for a Thanksgiving movie. I should have given in to food coma and not bothered myself with this movie. I like action movies and martial arts but I'm not a vampire movie kinda gal. I do like cheesy movies and have always appreciated Abe Lincoln. On the other hand, I hate being scared and I especially hate effects that are absolutely impossible. Was this supposed to be like the \\"true\\" telling of a legend or an excuse to kill vampires? I also really hate it when someone has the super human power to hold a train tressel together while a train is going over it but gets injured in a fight. Let's be consistent here. Whatever. I'm not waiting any more time on this.

Turns out the slave traders are vampires sending slaves South for dinner. The traders take revenge on Lincoln's family by killing Abe's mother while she sleeps. He grows up and seeks revenge, but ends up almost dying when he takes on the vampire who killed his mom. The guy that saves him also trains him by teaching him how to chop down a tree with his rage in one swipe. Later Abe discovers the guy who trained him is a vampire. It gets worse. Somehow Vampires end up playing a piviotal role in the Civil War. The only way to stop them is to melt down all the silverware in the North to arm troops at Gettysburg so they can kill the vampire soldiers who are helping the South fight the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The movie was difficult to watch and the storyline was absurd. Abraham Lincoln who had no special powers just simply trained to develop strength to ward off and track down vampires.

I'm not really crazy about vampires, but I loved this book. I went into the movie aware that the books are always better than the movies and fully expecting it. I still expected SOMETHING from the book to make it into the movie though. Everything that I loved about it somehow did not make it into the movie. Instead, it was all replaced by flashy action sequences. I debated giving this 2 stars just because some of the action scenes were pretty cool. But my husband who had not read the book said they made no sense whatsoever, so I couldn't do it.

This one is definitely a step above. There was action a plenty.

Wouldn't recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is awesome","review":"When I was watching this movie, I felt like some one picked up the book, read the back, and thought, \\"Hey, this would make a great movie.\\" They then summarized the back of the book for someone else, who wrote the screenplay based on that. The book was AMAZING, especially in how the author combined historical and fantasy. Abe Lincoln worked hard to get strong enough to fight vampires. There was none of this super-hero chopping trees with one swipe cause of his feeling crap.

I loved that they took the real \\"Abe Lincoln\\"and made him believable as a Vampire Hunter. And how they took his history and blended in to this story.

Most scenes are very dark and difficult to see. Overall Read the book first then watch the movie and it will all come together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably OK if you're into vampires. Otherwise, mostly not.","review":"As yet another vampire-sploitation flick, it's probably decent, if that's what you're into. The production values are high. As a film related to Lincoln & his times, it does make a few interesting parallels, but in total they last about 5 minutes. It's anti-slavery flavoring is nice, if minimal, but the rest of the film is ludicrous (Lincoln practicing Kung-Fu-like moves with his axe) in both plot and action, and, of course, violent and gory. The guy who plays Lincoln must have had too much botox before the shoot, as his expression never changes. 2 stars is generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow mo OVERKILL","review":"At first, i found the intro interesting. Then...then it got ridiculous. The slow motion used in several parts throughout ruined the flow of the film for me. Very exaggerated and overdone, in my opinion. As usual, the book was better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This was by far the most painful 105 minutes I've subjected myself to in a few years. I had a feeling I wouldn't like this but the sudden slow motion action shots were but one thing that made this unbearable to watch. I'll never get that time back again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Routine","review":"Except for the interesting premise of the story, casting the former president as Buffy, the movie is extremely humdrum.

Wait for this to come to a subscription streaming service like Netflix or Amazon Prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat Concept, But Poorly Executed","review":"I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't. The premise was interesting, but that's about where it ended. Don't waste your time or money on this dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Twist on History That is Well Written and Directed","review":"I am not the type who likes any of the vampire movies.And I also do not like gory movies.This movie has vampires and lots of killings.So why did I like it?The vampire scenes throught the movie, and the killings, are done in a more subtle way than depicted in most modern movies.At the same time the special effects for the other scenes in the movie were top shelf.I also felt caught up in the twist on history to depict how Lincoln fought the vampires and how they effected everything during his life.The director did a great job in putting the story together on film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its okay","review":"A liitle too unbelievable so it somewhat lost my interest toward the middle of the movie.

I'm glad I did. It was actually a really good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absurd But Fun","review":"Overall, this movie is almost a must-see for fans of vampire and monster movies or history. It is also based on such an absurd concept that its awesome-factor is enhanced, thanks to its fine quality acting and cinematography, rather than reduced. The only objection I have is the very brief nudity that appeared in the movie, which I feel was an unneccessary distraction, and detracted from the overall experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worse movies ever!","review":"I have no idea what the writer was thinking.

The way the vampire story was woven into Lincoln's true story and our nations history was masterful. What was happening at that time was intense and the movie traded all of the authentic drama of the times for the same old vampire slaying we've been seeing for years. Hard to believe the same person wrote the book and the screen play.Maybe if I hadn't read and loved the book it would have been a fun, silly vampire flick... or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Never stops to acknowledge the high farce it could have been.

This could have been either of those, but was just a waste of two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"An author's view of Catholicism...not necessarily Merton's","review":"Paul Hourihan's novelization of Thomas Merton's last day reads more like an apologia for his own loss of faith in things Catholic rather than an imaginative exploration of Merton's death in Asia. This self-published novel reveals far more about the author than it does its subject. For a real understanding of the issues Thomas Merton wrestled with read the journals he maintained during the course of his adult life."},{"rating":"1","title":"My dear friends!","review":"Some of the favorable reviews seemed a little confused as to what truth is. Speculation is not truth. This book is fiction like the Da Vinci Code, without excitement or RESEARCH. Or very limited research.Oh, and by the way (to those who think that I am a Merton worshiper), I very much doubt that anyone worships Merton (for obvious reasons)."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Detail Please","review":"Maybe I missed something in my copy of this book, but I was disappointed in the level of detail. I was expecting a blow by blow account Bob Woodward style and I got what I viewed as almost a campaign \\"get to know the candidate\\" piece. I wanted more details about how the other people involved in the issue were acting and thinking. I also wanted more detail on JFK and the overall military activity. I come away from this book still looking for more information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some insight, some disappointment","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book on what I thought would be a keen insider's look at the Cuban missile crisis, and was somewhat disappointed. I realize that RFK was not able to complete the text, and perhaps that is reflected in it's length (100 pages of narrative). A large part of the printed material, about 1/3, is made up of supporting documents. I had hoped for more detail about the minute-to-minute events of those 13 days. The strength of the book is its undeniably interesting topic and author. There was insight to the crisis that I had not previously known, and reading it here was interesting and informative. For a mid-1900's buff, this might be one piece of a collection and its uniqueness may prove worthwhile. This is the first book I read on the Cuban missile crisis, and I am left wanting a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rewrite Of A Dead Person's Ramblings To Promote A Movie","review":"This author of this book used Robert Kennedy's book as an excuse to promote a new movie. Using dead people's work is a normal fraudulent way of Hollywood to make money. This book is so far from fact that the book should be banned even in the open society we call America. Robert Kennedy, and JFK, are probably still rolling over in their gaves from the lies told about them in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure myth and propaganda","review":"It's unfortunate that RFK could not tell the truth about the Cuban missile crisis- that it was JFK's weakness in the Bay of Pigs, in Vienna, and the Berlin Wall which caused the Russians to test him. It's also unfortunate that RFK did not disclose the truth about the secret deals he and JFK made in exchange for the removal of the missiles- our promise not to invade Cuba, and our removal of the Jupiter missiles in Turkey. This was not a proud moment for the U.S., and it's taken recent historians to show the facts of what really happened. RFK's book is just another example of Kennedy myth-making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave the Cubans alone","review":"I read this to study history of American propaganda, and I watch new Kevin Costner film. It is shameful that the attack on Cuban sovreignity is called heroism by the Kennedy clan. Robert Kennedy and his brother 'Jack' are both good friends of Marilyn Monroe and they shared a belief in the Monroe Doctrine that both America's - North and South - belong to the USA sphere of influence, but Latin American peoples are not slaves of America. If they wish to invite Soviet friends to place missiles in Cuba this is their freedom. Robert writes like a politician. He doesn't break the truth or tell lies, but he bends the truth so much it cries to be broken. These guys make your President Nixon look good. Kennedy was stupid to challenge Russians for a few missiles. Only a few years later intercontinental missiles could reach America from Kazakstan. What a foolish gambler, this Las Vegas Disneyland President was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Short for 5 Stars","review":"Bobby Kennedy's text was riveting and terrifying, taking the reader inside the minds of those men who, for a few weeks in October 1961, held the world back from Nuclear War. I cannot recommend RFK's section enough. It should be required reading for every concerned human being on this planet.Why the editors decided to include a series of white papers by policy wonks and graduate students after Kennedy's haunting tale is beyond me. But it nearly kills the importance of RFK's story.By all means, read A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis. But put it down when you finish Bobby's unfortunately short section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, no new secrets but a lot of personal insight.","review":"This was how the Attorney General, who was the Presidents closest advisor, saw the crisis unfold, and what he encouraged JFK to do. Good book, but somehow missed that it was a pocketbook, when I wanted a hardback edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside View of Debate & Deliberations of the Missile Crisis","review":"Fabulous book. I've seen numerous documentaries on the Cuban Missile Crisis, but reading the memoirs of someone who was there is irreplaceable. Even though we might all know the ending to this story, Robert Kennedy documents the crisis in such a way that you almost feel the tension and anxiety that the President and others must have experienced. While the book did not reveal any new public facts of the incident, it did provide enlightenment on the behind-the-scene struggles and deliberations that were essential to the outcome. One can only wonder what the world would be like now if the Kennedys of this crisis had not not been assassinated. I imagine it would be a different place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critical moment in history","review":"I was surprised at how simply this book was written, and it was not bogged down at all by political mumbo-jumbo that most politicians write with. This becomes a compelling read, because it is accesible to everyone, and the account is obviously first-person, the only book of this nature. The Cuban Missile Crisis was the most important two weeks in our history, and it is the closest the world has come to nuclear war, and inevitable destruction. It seems that many people are forgetting how close the US and USSR came to pushing the button here.I like the way RFK writes, and it is unfortunate that this book is unfinished, but this is an interesting read for anybody who is interested in the magnetic Kennedy family and the history of the Cold War.I will also reccomend the movie entitled \\"Thirteen Days\\", which is a great adaptation of this book and is gripping from beginning to end, Kevin Costner's laughable New England accent aside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting look at an extremely tense spot of the 20th Century","review":"RFK's memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis gives an insider glimpse to the way the days unfolded in the White House while missiles were aimed straight for them. You can read RFK speaking to you from after the fact, and sense his political undertones which add an entirely different aspect to the book. It should often be considered the importance of when the book was written just as much as the scope and subject. I strongly suggest the read into the decisions made by RFK and President Kennedy, who both knew that the USSR wanted war as little as the US did.Very good look at how frightfully close the US and USSR came to starting World War III."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well wriiten book and a great trueful look at that trying crisis","review":"Robert Kennedy never got a chance to add to his furst draft of the manuscript becuase he wrote this book shortly before his death, but what he did get a chance to write was very insightful of himself, then men in the ex-comm meetings and the president. As well as human nature, it also shows what it really must take to be a good president - to be pateinet and not let the armed forces bully you into imidate warish actions without- by looking at all avenues and consequences that could comes from each step of the process. This is a must have book to add to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE COMPLETE FILM","review":"As James Helberg has written about this tape, in a differnet box, this is NOT the complete R-rated original version of the film. It IS the stupid edit for television, missing four minutes of language and a shot of Matt Lattanzi's bare backside, as well as Bisset's in-flight orgasm. What a shame, and how stupid! Racier scenes can be found on daytime soap operas! If you love this movie and/or George Coukor, skip the VHS versions (both of them) currently offered for sale here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it!","review":"My children have watched it over and over.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid interpretations of The Stones by some jazz masters","review":"Lest there be any confusion, this is not one of those albums in the vein of the horrendous \\"Streetwize\\" records. This is a trio of traditionalists having their old school way with some Rolling Stones songs and it's great. If you like your jazz mellow, down-to-earth and with an eye on its heritage, yet still fun, this is the record for you. It has the feel and pacing of your typical Blue Note outing, but with that hint of familairity that grounds it for you.

You pump them up and they shoot straight up in the air making a great pfzzzoom sound and then they come floating down. My five grandchildren love them. These are very simple, non-electronic good fun toys. My grandkids, age 3-12 all laugh each time a balloon goes up. I'm glad I found this on-line. I was afraid rocket balloons were gone forever.

No problems with the arm since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Danby","review":"I purchased this DW from Target through Amazon. It leaked like a sieve within 24 hours.

We followed directions given by other folks having similar problems and attempted to seal the window/leaks but after three times, we are finally throwing this dishwasher out. Loved having it when it worked because we have two small boys and it was endlessly convenient for our family. I think the quality of the unit is poor and would not recommend it to anyone looking for a countertop dishwasher. If anyone has information on a good quality, reliable countertop diswasher, let us know as we are looking for a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best and worst appliance ever","review":"We lived in a tiny NYC apartment with no dishwasher, so this appliance really saved the day... however getting a unit that wasn't defective was a bit of a challenge.

Three of them arrived with shipping damage, and the one that didn't had defective hosing that wouldn't attach to the unit. My latest Danby countertop dishwasher has expired after a move cross-country, something about the journey didn't agree with it. I think some water got up in the electrics.. be sure to THOROUGHLY dry the thing out for a few weeks if you ever have to move I guess.

We used the first one for about 3 years, until it stopped pumping water. We replaced it with another Danby, as we'd been happy with the first. The second Danby began leaking water quickly and severely. I eventually replaced the front loading door with the door from the first washer (which we'd saved for spare parts). That door is also now leaking, and this washer has been in service for about 1 year, maximum. We won't be buying a third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until this latest serious leak!","review":"I've loved this dishwasher due to it's size and price. ( The only other countertop dishwasher available is too tall to fit under cabinets) However, even though I only use it every two or three days, before 6 months water was coming out of the window seals. I took the window out myself and super glued the seals and window in place which luckily worked out great. The seal around the door came loose and again, luckily I was able to fix that. Sadly, almost 2 years after purchasing my dishwasher, it began to leak from underneath. The cost to diagnose and repair would come too close to my original purchase price, so It's a goner! I really expected to get longer usage time from it since I never used the sani-mode and usually ran it on the shortest wash cycle, combined with using it 2-3 times per week. If I had used it everyday with full wash and sani-mode, I expect this little dishwasher would never have seen it's first birthday.

I plodded through the preface and first few chapters, then had to resort to skimming the rest. I found it cumbersome and verbose -- filled with long-winded sentences, lofty and uncommon language (I had to keep my dictionary at hand), and references that were entirely unknown to me. One might say it was over my head I suppose. The best parts were her descriptions of the simple but heavenly foods she recalled from her childhood. Other than that, and her account of life in Quaker Whittier CA, I didn't find much in this memoir that I cared about. I know that her prose is highly regarded, but it was lost on me. I have not read any of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely \\"cumbersome and verbose\\"","review":"I must agree with the review that finds this book clumsy, wordy, and difficult to read. Ultimately it's just boring. While I have no trouble understanding her vocabulary, and usually prefer writers who use involved sentences, Fisher rambles and doesn't use her vocabulary or sentence structure to good effect. I'm not sure she has a clear idea of what she wants to say, and her observations on other people in her life seem mean-spirited and cynical. She pretends to have enjoyed the Quakers, yet portrays them in an extremely negative and biased manner, basing many of her conceptions on what she presumes they must have thought and felt. She doesn't recognize that she may have misinterpreted their actions through the filter of her own childhood ideas. I read it for a Book Club, but what a chore to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratches easily","review":"Product is difficult in adhering without air bubbles present.

Another reviewer mentioned that Patty Hearst attended years earlier. This is not correct; she was a sophomore when we were freshmen. She was booted out soon after...Jane got the nuns just right. Her details were pretty much the way I remember. She captured the stifling aura of the place, but I can't understand how anyone who didn't go there would read this. Her writing was surely less than adequate. Indeed, a lot more could have been done with this material.

At first i was not too happy at the school, i admit, but it gets better. She was just trying to make our school look bad. Maybe she just didn't fit intto Catalina. Maybe it wasnt right for her. But for others, it might be the ideal school. Maybe she didnt fit in, or maybe the types of girls that go to catalina arent the types of girls she hangs around. Personally, i think the girls at Catalina are wonderful. Nobody is negative towards other girls. I think that it fit me and maybe it didnt fit her. She also wrote the book long after she left the school, and may not have had the best picture of it in her mind. She may have only remembered the negative parts about Catalina, and not the positive ones. She may not remember what positive things happened to her at Catalina. She wrote the book well and she gave her opinion on the school, even though it might not be someone else's. That is why i gave her two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst","review":"This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read in my life.

It's a wonder there was anyone willing to publish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"absence makes the heart grow bitter","review":"As a present student of Catalina, I feel I have a responsibility to respond to this novel. I have to agree that Cataline is not for everyone. However, finding out one is in all honors classes would not make one faint. I don't believe that the school putting in you in higher classes constitues frantic mind spinning fear. I think Ms. King is misinterpreting homesickness and freshmen jitters to paranoia and hate for the school without giving it a proper chance, and hating it before anything happened. Besides the basic content being mildly hateful, for a nonfiction book, it sure has a lot of the actual people and places within. Maybe had you giving Catalina a chance at all, it would have been written better all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graduate","review":"I graduated from this school as well and had an amazing experience.

Disappointed! This is not only one of the most poorly written books I've ever bothered to pick up (this writing skill comes from Catalina honors classes? That's the only real slap in the face to the school to be found here!), it's certainly the most boring. No scandal here - except that a mailer to Catalina alumnae has generated such undeserved attention and profits. I can only guess that the author was performing some kind of mid-life catharsis by committing this disjointed and unmemorable name-dropping memoir to the printed page.

You can tell by her picture on the cover that she is def. not Catalina material. I mean, look how freaking chubby and ugly she is, and she's not even wearing GAP or Abercrombie clothing. Catalina girls are pretty and thin, and really really rich. I think God chooses who should be rich and then the chosen ones send their daughters to Catalina.

As much as I disagree with the author's point of view, I cannot argue with it because her experiences were obviously vastly different from the majority of people's. What I can argue with, however, is the inferior quality of the writing. This is one of the most poorly written books that I have ever come across. She has no sense of grammer or structure, her vocabulary is extremely limited, her characters and story plots are exceedingly boring, and she lets everything just hang in the air, disjointed and empty, with nothing to tie it all together and finish it off. If you're looking for a cheap trashy novel with the absolute slightest hint of dumb scandals at a school, then this is probably the book you're looking for. If you want to read something that requires even just a little bit of intelligence then keep loooking, you won't find it here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Good","review":"After skimming over the other reviews of this novel, it was quite apparent that Ms. King's opinion of Santa Catalina is, on the whole, quite the opposite of most of the school's students and alumnae. I am sure that many people exceedingly enjoy Catalina, but Ms. King is entitled to her own opinion and therefore it is extremely excessive of the school's graduates and pupils to continue to write reviews insulting the book merely based on difference in perspective. What the reviewers should focus on is the writing ability of the author: it is that of an amateur and deserves little or no praise. If I were at all connected with Santa Catalina, I would be ashamed that the school was being represented in such a disgusting way. Ms. King obviously did not benefit from the academics at Santa Catalina. Along with its repulsive composure, the material is down right stupid and plot and characters are extremely dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catalina doesn't ruin girls; it makes ruined girls smarter","review":"While Catalina can be at times a stressful environment, King's experience here can only be attributed to her own insecurities. Catalina is an incredibly strong academic school and the faculty here do everything in their power to help students do well.

He apparently believes that if the Nepalese are more like us then they would be happier.They march on in their bright goretex outfits, lacking meaningful contact with the locals while their porters carry all their western comforts.-Go figure-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Home Movies should not be offered for sale","review":"If you are wanting an insight on the Annapurna circuit Trek,including classic views from Poon Hill and descent to Kagbeni, and the changing climate from Rainforest to Tundra.together with the change from Buddhist to Hindu culture.then this video is not for you.If however you are into somewhat indulgent home movies with some good views then this will suit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moonbeam","review":"There is an immediacy to this slim gem of a book that tugs at you, that instantly transports the reader back to childhood and forward to children yet unborn.

That's what he's done in the book. He spends time teaching the principles that somehow our Grandparents missed or missed passing down.I think eventually the principles he lays out, (Attitude of service, intimacy between husband & wife, father as loving leader...) will be the ones that \\"glue\\" the family back together again. They are not presented as quick fixes, but as an answer for those who want to enrich their family.His principals will work for the non-religious as well as the religious.

I'm also not a particularly enthusiastic fan of animation. So when I sat down to watch the film, I was skeptical that it could hold my interest.Like any good documentary, though, Adventures in Plymptoons does not necessarily require a particular interest in the the exact subject matter it covers. The filmmaker has crafted this film to show a man's journey from young doodler to accomplished - but always unconventional - craftsman.

The screen graphics are good, but most of the POIs are in lettering that is too small to read, especially while driving. POIs are difficult to locate, and many do not seem to be in the data base. You cannnot download your phone book from your cell phone, so that each number you call must be manually entered the first time. The touch screen is difficult to use, since many of the numbers, letters, and other choices are quite small, and the screen itself is not very sensitive. However, once you enter a destination, the voice directions are excellent. For the same price or less, I would stick to Garmin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective on arrival.....Speaker distortion","review":"Upon testing the unit on arrival, I discovered the speaker distorts on any setting above the lowest position.

The TMC feature is also great and lets me how bad the traffic is while i'm drivingFew cons of this product is1.) It sometimes thinks i'm on the correct road when i'm actually on the road parallel to it2.) The traffic updates only works when i have the external antenna plugged in3.) It doesn't calculate the shortest time route all the time. I compared this by using the route it suggested when i went home.

It has been plagued with software problems. Fortunately their tech support is readily available and helpful. I have over 50 hrs. into troubleshooting on my own and with their help. They replaced the unit twice and the SD card twice. The earlier problems have not resurfaced, but the third unit locks up during route calculation/recalculation. That really messes me up when in heavy Seattle or Portland traffic.Even though they cannot fix it, they absolutely refuse to refund my money. Don't buy it.If they had the bugs worked out it would be a great GPS. The features are fantastic. I have not experienced the functional problems that others have reported."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"My experience with a GPS is the Garman Ique-M5, so that set my expectations. The Navigon has traffic info, 3d images, and street names but the benefits end there. The Navigon gave really stupid directions and I tried all of the different settings. Setting it for \\"fastest route\\", it would take me off of a main road to go through a sub-division just to come back to the main road later, and that is only 1 example. Also, if the address does not exist, you cannot save your position. There is also no option to find a restaurant or gas station on-route; you can only ask if something is nearby, therefore if you search for a place nearby it may take you backwards from your route. It will also not allow you to put in permanent detours - say if a bridge is out, you cannot put it in there to not ever route that way. I was very disappointed, so I sold mine, and I am saving up for a Garmin unit. It will be about $100 more, but at least I will not get lost using it, and I will cuss less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cool !","review":"I love this device! I was impressed with the device after visiting the company's website. I did a lot of research and concluded that it offered the biggest bang for the buck. The display is AWESOME...reminds me of a mini plasma TV, free traffic info. which can automatically re-route my trip is great for my daily commute, Bluetooth is very convenient to use, the Reality View and Lane Assist feature reduces stress, it's like having a co-pilot with me everyday.

So many reviews almost swayed me from buying the Navigon. Like any new gadget you have a learning curve. It has taken me time to get familiar with my GPS but don't all technology?I registered my system with Navigon and right away told me to add the updates for it and that was no problem. The list of cell phones that it is compatible with is not up to date because mine (Nokia 6555) is not in the list but it is compatible. The touch screen works as it should and the live traffic extends farther than is says. All in all Amazon .com has never let me down with anything I have purchased and the GPS was a great purchase I have no regrets and the PRICE was the best. Having the Navigon for my trip put my daughter and me at ease"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy","review":"This item is a very poor excuse for a NAV system. First off touch screen requires you to use a hard nail or you get no response. Second the battery life is terrible. Barely lasts one hour or so.

We also enjoyed using the scenic route to tour thru New Hampshire and Vermont.Another plus is no monthly fees. The additional features for dinning, recreation, gas stations are great.

That still holds true. Very nice unit- attractive and works well, too. Recently, I wanted to update the maps, but there was no Freshmaps Activation card in the box from Amazon. You need the code on that card to get updates. So, I emailed Navigon support for assistance. They sent the following:'Thank you for your inquiry. Accessories, map material and content are not available in North America through NAVIGON. Unfortunately we don't have information concerning the availability of these products at other major retail shops.'As has been noted in the posted comments, and which I discovered too late, Navigon is pulling out of the North America market.

The size of the information on the screen is so small that if you are in the over 40 crowd and use reading glasses you can't see the info. Side by side with my nuvi 680 traffic winner Nuvi, shortest routes winner Nuvi, accuracy of routes winner Nuvi. After a few days with the Navigon I couldn't wait to put my Nuvi 680 back into full time use.

But when I got it - I realized the negative reviewers were just not bright enough to bend their dogamtic view of the routes. The system works like a clock, perfectly and dynamically reroutes. Even if it seems that it is suggesting something stranger than you'd expect - once you sit down with a map, you realize it does perfect job for the routing mode you've selected in the settings.Pros: Excellent graphics, slim, fast, strong signal, lifetime TRAFFIC,reality view, lane assist, quick rerouting, many othersCons: A little smaller graphical controls for my big hands, robotic voice, but still completely understandable.Conclusion: excellent buy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!","review":"I have purchased a Navigon in March and my new navigation unit made by Navigon has already gone out.

My friend recommended it to me and i thought it would outlive my expectations but then no. I am dismayed with the stand and/or connector. it's too long and not discrete. As you all know that gps are one of the \\"hot stuff\\" being stolen these days and with that kind of connector, you would increase the likelihood of your unit being stolen and storage wise, it'll need a big space in yout car.

Looks can be deceiving. I ordered the 7100 which came with a rebate that needed to be sent by the 30th day. Well, I sent it on the 31st date and they would not even give an exception to this policy. Navigon is not about customer service. They said there are no exceptions. Well, I decided to keep it. There are some cool features: (1). It saves any of your destinations, (2). Informs you when you go over the speed limit, (3). Count down your destination in time and miles. Locating POI's is too complicating and when you enter a specific place like Starbucks, it will not locate it unless you choose it from the list. Last but not least, after 2 1/2 months it simply failed to turn on. Not working at all. Good thing Costco accepts return if you are simply not satisfied. I was not satisfied.

I tried the Navigon 7100 but, man, is it one of the worst GPS units out there. The main problems are: first, it takes FOREVER to get a satellite signal, even in open areas. I think the average time of getting it into navigatable mode from powering on is like 10 minutes, which is absolutely unacceptable. Second, it's very slow, esp. when it tries to show fancy \\"reality view\\" graphics. You'll likely miss a turn because it can't keep up with your driving. Routing engine is even worse than the not-so-good one in the Nuvi 350, which costs half as much. This is just such a huge disappointment as I was hoping to finally replace my Nuvi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product!","review":"This is my first GPS so I have limited background. I have found it to be a very good product and particularly like the 3D view which indicates which lane to be in when a road splits.The traffic reporting is quite limited as it just says the word \\"caution\\" but doesn't give any actual traffic report.Sometime the routing is not the best as it does not take into account traffic patterns and stoplights so it may not be the fastest route when you consider that. That is ok when you know the area but when you go out of town, it may not take you the best route.Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Navigon 7100","review":"Good piece of equipment for a very reasonable price.

This has happened to me on more than one occasion while using the system on very familiar routes using different settings. When the unit was set for fast route which means fast roads not fastest time it took me on a route that was not the shortest time route. If you set it for shortest route it will provide a shortest distance route which may not be the shortest time route.I called Navigon and spoke to their technical support and general support people. They were unable to provide a solution to correct the problem.This was very disappointing since I know Navigon is a very good and respected supplier of GPS systems in Europe.

I decided to buy it but then returned it 2 days later after navigating with it on 3 trips. I was disappointed by the POIs which are VERY few as I was comparing it to my son Mio, the battery life was very short despite that I charged it all night through, and there was no reality view in NC as advertised, and the navigation was not accurate. I returned it back and bought the Mio C720t which have a fantastic database of 12 million POIs, VERY Accurate Navigator, a camera that register the location and the navigator can take you back to the same location, and a LOT more of bells and whistles.

Navigon keeps replacing it free though.It is a sleek stylish system with many features, reality view is okay but not always accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"GPS works well, holder is a joke","review":"This is my first GPS unit and I have really enjoyed having it. I really like the lane assist. I find it to be accurate. Its directions are 98% of the time the route I would have taken. 2% takes me on a scenic drive that I don't really understand why it thinks is faster. It functions great and is quick enough that I don't feel like I wait on it. My biggest complaint is the holder to attach the unit to the windshield. I read the reviews about it being loose and really tried to be careful with it. It became so loose in 4 months that I had to call and get a new one. They sent me a shipping label to return it and got a new one in under a week. Driving down the street the new holder just snapped and the GPS unit went flying to the ground. They can't seem to build a quality holder. I am looking into other options since it cost enough that throwing it away and starting over isn't an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've used.","review":"The 7100 looks good and has a great POI list.

I don't understand why the girls would like a boy in a snap if he made a hit, to me is they think a handsome face and blonde hair is \\"cute\\", GROW UP!!! Looks aren't everything, you need talent too. To me Jesse is trying to be like this guy, thats why he's always whining in his songs. To me he's on the same note through the whole song. This guy is a discrace to younger singers and the music business. Also (for the guy's) if you buy a cd that has anything to do with only boy bands, put it in a bag and put a genade in there too.

Occassionally there is a nice episode, but in general the series is dark and depressing. Topics covered include teenage sex, sex outside marriage, babies born out of wedlock, marital affairs, visions of spirits, praying to spirits, enchantments, fantacies, and etc. While it is true that Little House on the Prairie addressed some of these same topics, the perspective revealed that these were wrong and in the end the good guys triumphed. Not so in Emily of New Moon.

Emily of New Moon will not find a home in my library of treasured shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Obnoxious!","review":"Season One was OK...a bit dark for family viewing. Season Two was annoying with it's irritating cast of characters. Season Three? I'm amazed it lasted this long. I'm amazed I lasted this long! I hoped it might improve somewhat from Season Two. I was wrong. The cast has made the shift from annoying to obnoxious. Cousin Isabel is a self righteous b%#&h, Laura, a spineless wimp, Ian, an overbearing sexist pig, his mother (along with much of the town) a bigot and a snob, Emily and Ilsa are busybody menaces. The only characters who are at all believable are cousin Jimmy and Uncle Malcolm. Everybody else in the main cast is almost cartoonish in their melodramatic histrionics.

D. James's stories are all nicely textured, with carefully-layered plotting and interesting characters. In this story we have a crime novelist who is found dead, his hands severed from his body. The suspects have alibis; one (a slightly effete and decidedly obnoxious critic) is played by the superb Bill Nighy. There are two subplots, one involving a sleazoid gangster, the second involving Dalgleish and his relationship with his girl friend. As those subplots intersect, the girl friend is threatened. The climax is particularly memorable, with a storm at sea and Dalgleish trapped with a suspect in a seaside cottage through which the winds are howling and in which the water is rising. This is definitely worth a look, if only for the Nighy character."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of James' Most Suspenseful","review":"This is one of James' most suspenseful DVDs-just below A Certain Justice andOriginal Sin.

Roy Marsden falls flat as a romantic lead, Mel Martin bears little resemblance to the Deborah of the book, and there's no wonder sparks don't fly between them. And alas, the script writers fail to salvage their fiasco with a poorly staged storm rescue scene.Please read P. D.

The audio (as with many DVD's from the Mystery Series) was poor, getting loud and then too soft to understand. Audio clarity was also poor making the \\"English\\" accents hard to understand. The last 10 minutes of screenplay was truly horrible in concept and technique. An implausible storm rescue scene that looked as if the technology used to film it was from the 1930's (or earlier). It also appeared as primarily a \\"time filler\\" for the DVD run time requirement.

So, he takes his family away to his old family home in Vermont to stay indefinitely.

The vocals are very out of tune in places.. Also, I was not impressed at all with their version of \\"Whole Again.\\" It was originally done by the UK group Atomic Kitten.. if you want to hear a good version of it (without some very cheesy lyrics.. Play changed some for whatever reason..) listen to Atomic Kittens original version. Also, they butchered \\"Just a little\\" which was done by Liberty X another group from the UK..

The whole album didn't impress me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Play is nothing but a bunch of little girls trying to sing.

My wife and I gave it a preview and we were extremely disappointed. I'm not quite sure if the young ladies of Play are more interested in making good music or losing their virginity. Almost every song contains innuendo and much of it is appallingly obvious.Now don't get me wrong, I realize these girls are experiencing a wide array of feelings and emotions and to sing about those feelings is fine. I have a big problem with this type of music being peddled on kiddie TV like Nickolodean.If you are a parent of a young lady under the age of 13 and you want to TRY and keep them sheltered, avoid this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Skye Fargo rides into Carn and trouble!

To be honest I was looking forward to hours of old lullibies as I was having to spend money on purple dinosaurs and stuffed animals with weird geometric shapes growing out of their heads forced on us by the Brits. However, my wife and I were more than pleasantly surprised.This folk take on the classic lullibies is a winner. We can listen to it everyday . . . and we do! Within a few minutes, our son is sound asleep or at least calm and quiet and we're singing along (usually offkey).

I started listening to it just after our son was born, and although he was too young to care at the time, I just really enjoyed it. Now it's part of our bedtime routine. If the baby is fussy because he is tired, we turn it on and he's immediately calm!Our favorite for bedtime is #7, \\"Resophonic Lullaby\\". It's a Hawaiian lullaby that transports us directly to a beach when we hear it!Our more-upbeat favorite is #4, \\"Song for Two Pamelas\\". It's a guitar duet, which sounds boring but is so fun and playful. I get the baby's toes tapping to this one and he laughs.I also really like #9, \\"My Creole Belle\\". It's so obvious the singer is singing to someone he truly loves.I won't mention them all, but they're all great.

Within the first ten pages of the text, \\"negative reinforcement\\" is defined (multiple times) as being \\"essentially a form of punishment\\" when this is completely incorrect, not even close to being right. Negative reinforcement involves rewarding a behavior by removing an aversive stimulus, basically the opposite of what punishment is.I stopped reading after the tenth page or so because this text is just so clearly riddled with misinformation that I felt finishing it would do me more harm than good. I don't know if the Spark Notes of this text has the same errors, but from what I have seen from skimming it, it is a much more reliable resource than this would be.Do NOT buy the Cliffs Notes on Walden II, its author is by no means authoritative on the material covered, and had no business writing a study guide on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best for women who like love, intrique & antiques.","review":"I try to find paperbacks for traveling or while on vacation and often end up with something close to just senseless \\"drivel\\".

This world of antiques, which she comes to treasure as a young adult, will turn out to be her saving grace. I learned so much about antiques which the author did not have to put in or research...but gladly she did,and also gave me a glimpse into the light and dark worlds of \\"the wealthy and well-antiqued\\".

I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 for 2 reasons: I think it's a bit on the pricey side for how simple it is, and because it would be nice if it could go louder. (Although you can adjust the tone and volume somewhat by rotating the top and side panels, the maximum volume is still a bit quiet.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I have been using the Marpac sound conditioner for a couple of weeks now, and it certainly beats my old air purifier (which rattled and growled a bit, and for which now-hard-to-find filters cost a third the price of the machine).Besides the quality of the item itself, Marpac provided excellent documentation, explaining the possibility of the need for a personal breaking-in of sorts, while one habituates to the machine. VERY thoughtful, and probably based on research/user comments. I got used to it quite rapidly.I like it! I live in an apartment building, where even comparatively light ambient noise can startle someone at the edge of sleep. It works for me, and I hope it will for you, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Office, Baby","review":"I bought this sound machine originally to cover noise in my office. I work in a community college and have a small office in a building with 9 other faculty offices. With students coming and going and conferences going on all day, the surrounding noise really distracted me from my work. This sound machine does a very good job of masking most noise to a background level without being distracting itself.When our son was born, I decided to buy another for our home because I was afraid of the baby's cries waking our two-year old. What I quickly learned is that the sound was also very soothing to the baby! I had tried to put our son down for a nap many times, and he wasn't going for it unless held. When I turned on the sound machine, he quickly drifted off to sleep without crying--and in his own bed.I recommend this machine for both uses. Very good for home and office!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound machine","review":"We are getting a good night sleep.

The dual speed has a bit of sound range, but it's just not loud enough to really drown out other sounds four our little baby girl. We had a Brookstone Tranquil Moments sound machine that broke on us - we were hoping to pay a bit less money and get a nice replacement. This just doesn't have the volume, even though we wanted to like it. Poor baby didn't approve. Not sure where to go from here, the Brookstone is expensive and I fear it's just going to break again. I think the A/C power supply cord/connection is a poor design...."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"Since we got this machine, my boyfriend and I have been sleeping better. It helps us fall asleep at night by blocking out neighborhood noises and helps us sleep in as long as we please in the morning by doing the same. We have been dealing with dogs barking, a diesel truck engine next door, a day care next door, and homes being built down the street. It mutes all of these sounds to the point of us not being awakened by them. I am thankful for this machine. I wish I would have bought it sooner. I also like the fact that this machine generates its own fan-like sound, so it is not a recording. I like the option of two settings. We use the high setting when dogs are barking and we're trying to fall asleep. We use the low setting most of the time. We had previously tried using a small fountain to cover these neighborhood sounds. There is no comparison between a fountain and this machine. This machine is way more effective. We have been recommending it to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My neighbor's screaming baby had woken me up throughout the night for months! I used earplugs for a while, but they fall out easily and my doctor told me it's not healthy for your ears to sleep with earplugs in all the time. I got the Marpac product as a gift, and have slept soundly since! I absolutely love it. It sounds almost like a box fan, but it's great that you can change the sound levels. Plus, it's so small that it doesn't take up much space at all. (It's about the width of a regular coffee can, but half the height.) Also, it only uses a very small amount of electricity, which is nice. The instructions say that it may take you a few nights to get used to the sound, but I slept soundly (and happily!) without any problems.

As a result, I owned the SleepMate for quite some time before needing it. The good news is that, yes, it does produce a fan sound that can lull you to sleep. But please consider that the unit is much louder than it needs to be, even on its lowest setting. So loud, in fact, that the instructions say to locate the SleepMate away from your bed. If you do that, you'll find yourself having to get up in order to turn it on -- not good at all if you only want sporadic use. Second, and I realized this way too late, there are far better ways to accomplish the same goal. My son downloaded sleep sounds onto his iPod Touch.

It just sounds like a box fan turned on low even with all the holes opened up on it. I actually bought a Homedics Nature Sound Machine with volume control that works 10x better than this thing! I need to return this because it's not worth the $50 and change. I am very dissapointed because it got such good reviews. It doesn't drown out anything. I had it on high and I heard a truck drive by and the sound was the same as if it was turned off. I really can't think of who would benefit from this thing! It's definitely not good for apartment or condo living that's for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Better Than a Fan","review":"I'm surprised by the ratings given to this product. I have a vornado fan and it does a good, if not better, job drowning out noise at a fraction of the cost. If you are looking to drown out low frequency noise or hard-soled shoes on wood floors, you will be very disappointed in this product. Note: To be fair, the Vornado fan isn't any better at drowning out these sounds either. I really wanted to say good things about this product, but it looks like my neighbors have won the battle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as loud as some of these reviewers would lead you to believe","review":"I bought this machine after reading the first review on the page. The reviewer wrote about how this machine masked the sounds of his noisy neighbors, but after owning this thing for a few days I just don't believe it. This sound conditioner works okay, but I was expecting something much louder. I've tried all the settings, but it just isn't loud enough. I've never returned anything to Amazon, but I need to exchange this for something louder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sleep I've had in years.......","review":"This thing is awesome! It makes the perfect noise for sleep. I have been looking for something like this for years. We tried a fan in the bedroom...this is much, much better. Thanks again for a great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep at last!","review":"I love it! It keeps me sleeping through the night and through construction that is taking place near my apartment. I won't sleep without it, and sometimes I travel with it.Laura"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I have to sleep with white noise and for years I have used a fan. Now I have white noise and don't have dust flying around the room all night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good... for a time","review":"I have had this product for a little over a year now and it worked great for the first 11 1/2 months or so. I noticed after about 11 months that the sound emitted from the machine was becoming more and more inconsistent. Sometimes it would be loud while other times it would be a much softer sound even when using the loudest setting. It got to the point where over time the sound would actually just fade away to being completely silent over the course of the night.A few days after a full year of having the product the machine just stopped working all together. I tried using a different outlets in the room and even in other houses all to no avail. The product literally does nothing when I plug it in and turn on the switch. Best part is that the warranty for it is only for a year so I'm stuck with a $50 paper weight now.The first 11 months of owning this I would have given it a 5/5, but I would prefer for it to have more longevity if I'm going to spend $50+ on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"created more distracting noise","review":"The reviews of this device were so impressive that I purchased it without much thought. However now that I've received it I am astonished it got such good reviews. As soon as I turned it on, the motor created an unpleasant vibrating noise (think cell phone vibrating on wood) with an intermittent clicking noise. It was so bad I figured I had to be doing something wrong. After trying it on multiple services, trying both speeds, and adjusting the sound I eventually realized it's just a bad design. I thought that perhaps this particular unit was damaged or defective but I came back to amazon and saw that plenty of other users had the same problem.This is designed for people who have a hard time sleeping due to distracting noises. This device just produces more of those. Obviously lots of people are satisfied with it, but I am not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product works but overpriced","review":"I was surprised to find out that this device does promote good sleeping conditions. I think it is overpriced as it is just a simple fan in a special box. But since it seems to work as advertised, I am satisfied with my purchase. I deleted one star because of the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"sound sleep","review":"I was slightly skeptical regarding this device but needed something like this claimed to be. I did not want beach or animal sounds, just a noise \\"blocker\\". This works very well and has plenty of adjustments to suit different needs it seems to me. So far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it was a little louder","review":"I bought two of these, one for each of my kids (1 and 3). Its perfect for my 3 year old, but I wish it was a little louder for my 1 year old. He's a bit more sensitive to noise. We travel alot, and it is super easy to pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"help me to sleep while neighbor is making noise","review":"I love this product. It helps me a lots. I was able to sleep during the night while my housemates were doing activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little machine","review":"I got my first Sleep Mate about 20 y ago, still have it and use it nightly. I got another one for trips out of town. I far prefer the white noise of the Sleep Mate to the manufactured sounds of other sound machines. It's a fan in a box; it's reliable; it's simple. I love it! For a fan in a box, you might balk at the price--but you did read the first part of this review, right? 20 years and counting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purchase","review":"My husband and I purchased this because we were tired of the bulky oscillating fan in our bedroom that we were using for some white noise. This little machine, which sits discreetly upon my dresser, sounds like the fan and helps me sleep through his snoring and helps us both to tune out the noises in our neighborhood and even the phone ringing in the house.We were a little skeptical before purchasing because we thought it was pricey for a machine without any bells and whistles, but we both love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"could also be relabeled as SanityMate","review":"I am so pleased with this item. I have purchased 2 for our apartment. I am no longer bothered with the noises from the neighbors at night that used to cause me such angst. It's a wonderful thing. I find the whoosh of the air to be quite soothing. Anyone that lives in a multi-unit dwelling should invest in one of these, worth every single penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"White noise heaven","review":"IF you have difficulty sleeping in hotels or at home where noise outside the room keeps you awake, this is for you. The light sound of rushing air is all it takes for a sound sleep. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - really helped sleep","review":"I have found it very helpful! My sleep has improved dramatically. Took it on a trip and stayed in a hotel and it even worked there! Awesome product overall, would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more sleepless nights from the neighbors","review":"If you have loud neighbors, roomate, or traffic; this sleep machine is perfect for you. In my apartment the ceilings do not have enough (or any?)insulation. We were constantly listening to TV at 2:30am. With this white noise, we no longer have sleepless nights.I highly recommend this sound maker if you are just interested in a steady white noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"peace and quiet","review":"I've been using a sound conditioner for many years. No, I don't live in an especially noisy place,but if the tv is on in another room when I go to bed the sound is completely blocked. I think this type of white noise is helpful to anyone who has trouble going to sleep. Once you become accustomed to it, it's so soothing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"We use this noisemaker in our baby's room. We love it. She sleeps well and I don't have to worry about all of the World's noises waking her up at night (we live near the end of a base runway so we have large helos and C130s and sometimes F18s flying low over the house)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle hum puts me to sleep","review":"Whenever I would get on a plane the gentle hum would put me right to sleep. This is the best way I can think of to describe this sound conditioner. The white noise is similar to a \\"whooshing\\" noise and can be adjusted by turning the cylinders.I absolutely love mine and can't sleep a night without it.I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a continuous white noise to fall asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marpac-Sleepmate","review":"I use these in my kids bedrooms to drown out any noise outside of their rooms. I started using these when they were infants and now they are 5 months, 5 years and 7 years. Best for when we travel and all have to stay in one room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it! Best thing I've bought in a while. AWESOME!","review":"This fully adjustable white noise machine has not only two speeds but it twists to let more or less air through to customize the sound. It drowns out a LOT of outside noise. I used to not be able to sleep with the windows open because the birds woke me up at 4am. With this, you will sleep though it! Noisy neighbors, my kid playing her music in her room, etc. This thing makes a noise that isn't noise... it's air. You'd have to hear it for yourself. Don't put it next to your bed; put it away from the bed in the room and it will fill the room with the quiet, white noise and you will probably even end up bringing it with you when you travel, as I did! Best purchase in a while. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like white noise, you wil love this device","review":"I grew up falling asleep to the sound of a fan. I used to use a fan throughout the year. There is just something soothing about constant background noise. I grew up in a very quiet neighborhood that was almost too quiet and I needed help falling asleep. In college it was too loud so I used a fan during that part of my life to fall asleep. I have tried other devices that make sounds of crickets, thunderstorms and other sounds of nature, but nothing comes close to the Marpac 980. We now have two small children and we use two Sleepmates and we are about to purchase a third one. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys masking inconsistent background noise or lack thereof"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Too Quiet","review":"I spent an hour reading hundreds of reviews for this product before I bought it. A few people claimed it was too quiet, a few said it was too high-pitched, etc. I use a fan set to high for white noise in my bedroom when I sleep, and it's perfect. I was afraid the Sound Screen would be too quiet, but I figured if it was, I'd just use it in the future in our baby room.I received it in the mail last week and plugged it in, and even with both the cap and the collar rotated to allow as much white noise as possible...it was whisper-quiet. It says to place across the room from you for full effect, but even when I then moved it to my bedside table, I could hear a pin drop over it. I'm very disappointed with the machine...great concept, but they should have designed it so that the user could manipulate the loudness more effectively.So...this went right back into the box, to be saved for when my husband and I have a baby and need it in the baby room. What a waste of $40."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Very Pleased","review":"To me, the Marpac 980A makes a sound like that produced by a fan, but mercifully without the cold air(I'm very cold-natured).The Marpac 980A is small,making finding a place for it easy.It has two settings, and there doesn't seem to be a tremendous amount of difference between the two; either does the job for me.My bedroom window faces a fairly well-travelled street, and I have a few high-spirited cats who often play rather noisily at night.With the Marpac 980A,I'm not awakened when I don't want to be, so I have a restful night, and don't awaken too early.I expected it to take me a while to get used to the sound of the Marpac 980A, but I fell asleep easily from the very first night I used it.The Marpac 980A isn't fancy or \\"high-end,\\" but it does exactly what I need it to do.I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this one","review":"The product's noise was very artificial and it was louder than the outside noise. We couldn't sleep with it. If you buy it through whitenoise-us and have to return it, your \\"free shipping\\" will get substracted from your refund amount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Great product, masks product and helps me get sleep. Without this machine, I'd be still trying to get to sleep, and being frustrated when something wakes me out of my well earned sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective for serious noise.","review":"I like that the machine sounds like simple air, but it does not help if you have serious noise. I have neighbors with hardwood floors above me and I can hear everything. I was hoping to find a machine that would generate enough white noise to equal the street traffic noise I hear when I open my patio doors (it's getting cold), but it doesn't even come close. I imagine it would be useful in a smaller, quieter room. It was not effective for me, and I don't think it will be effective for masking loud noises. I used the highest setting and the sound was barely noticeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I bought it","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old. Passing trains would wake him up, and each night I'd have to take a screaming boy back to bed. No more. After a (maybe) 2-day conditioning period, he could sleep soundly. Even in a new house with passing trains again (geez!) he sleeps soundly. Although I would rather not have needed it because it's preferred that he get himself back to sleep, this has gotten us through a rough patch. Glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my needs","review":"I needed to cover up night time noises so I could sleep. I checked out other type of machines (with sea noise etc.) but chose this one. I'm glad I did. There are several different settings depending on how loud you need it. I'm very happy with the product because now I can sleep straight through the night."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],O={key:0},B={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-d23d0892"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/48.md","filePath":"library/48.md"}'),L={name:"library/48.md"},G=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{R as __pageData,G as default};
