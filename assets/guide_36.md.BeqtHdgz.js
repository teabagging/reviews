I love stories about time travel of sorts. Also, these three women are my age -- I too will turn 40 this August.I tell you, I couldn't stop listening. In fact I was home and the story had me so involved when I pulled up in from of my home I didn't want to get out of the car. I was only on the second tape! Each time I got back into the car I was rivited.Two days later on shorter trips (I travel a lot in my business) I finished the book -- I LOVED IT!

I give almost any author a second chance--but this time I'm sorry to have wasted my time. I did finish it, but it wasn't easy. The three women in this story have made stupid decisions which have adversly affected their lives. Instead of taking charge and changing their lives for the better, they seem to be basking in their own unhappiness. One is too fat (oh my), another is too thin (oh dear), and the other hasn't developed any interests of her own (what tragedy)! Upon reuniting with one another, they have an encounter with an orange-wigged psychic who provides them with an opportunity to go back and alter their pasts.

Though I do occasionally encounter a book club choice that I would never have picked but end up thoroughly enjoying, this was not the case for Summerhouse. The plot is somewhat upsurd, but I would have been willing to accept that if the characters were believable and a little less insulting. This book is one big cliche (Leslie's husband is cheating on her with a secretary named Bambi! No, really). The female characters are shamefully pathetic and needy, and the circumstances surrounding their original meeting are just plain goofy. Don't even get me started on the dialogue--completely unbelievable. The only reason I gave this read two stars instead of one is because, amidst all of the incredulous elements, I was somehow compelled to find out how low the book would go.

I don't want to say much so as to not spoil things for other readers because you can't say one thing without having to mention another and on and on.

For the same reasons I can't tolerate watching movies where women are vicitimized, I couldn't tolerate this book. It certainly started interestingly enough, but quickly deteriorated into three long, overly dramatic tales of women who allowed the men in their lives to walk all over them, time and time again. Perhaps the author was trying to elicite the reader's sympathy for these characters...instead I just wanted to scream at them to get a life.Please, Ms. Deveraux, although some women are forced to endure sub-standard treatment at the hands of their lovers, it's a bit tough to believe that these THREE such gifted women would ALL have had their lives ruined by men and been unable to, just a little, pull themselves out of their despair. Give women more credit, and give men a break.

There was love, and pain, redemption, and so much more in this book. I do have to admitt this book started off a little slow for me, but after the first few chapters this book picked up and my heart went out to all three of the characters.

However, after reading just a few pages, I found myself wondering how in the world this woman has sold 27 best-selling novels (according to the author bio). Her writing is stilted and juvenile, the characters are paperthin and under-developed, the dialogue is unrealistic and awkward, and the plot is cumbersome and laughable.

For starters, to think that workers in a DMV office would retain beautiful women just to look at them is as preposterous as the chances that these three strangers would share exactly the same birthdate! ...And in one short meeting they forged a friendship that caused them to reunite nearly twenty years later?

The furigana (little hiragana above the kanji) are a godsend, given that I don't know many kanji or all their pronunciations. The example sentances that follow most words are also incalcuably helpful in demonstrating how words are actually used in context. Some very useful phrases find their way into these example sentances, so this dictionary actually doubles as something of a strangely-arranged phrasebook.The only whisper of a complaint that I have about this dictionary is twofold: the book is a bit heavy to tote around everywhere. Also, the furigana really are quite small. Readable, but small. If your eyesight is less than perfect, you're going to have to all but bury your nose in the book to read the furigana if you don't invest in a magnifying glass of some kind.Other than that, I love the thing and will take it to Japan with me when I study-abroad there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I love this dictionary.

I had just started learning, and I didn't need much. I was more worried about having a dictionary than I was about what was in it. Looking back, I have to say that it really wasn't useful for long. I soon found myself looking in other dictionaries because this one simply did not have what I needed.This all happened while I was studying Japanese on my own. I have since taken two semesters of Japanese in school. I find that opening this dictionary is a waste of time, and I suspect I would have found it just as useless at this point if I had taken Japanese without studying on my own beforehand.My overall impression is that this would be a good dictionary for someone who has just barely started learning Japanese, or has no real intention of learning the language.

This is greatly beneficial to those wanting to become fluent in Japanese written and spoken language, as to not be handicapped by romaji as a fall-back.Beside that, This book is made of amazing quality. Measuring in at only 7 7/16\\" tall and 5 3/4\\" wide, it weights almost 3.5 lbs. That alone is testimate to the high quality paper and binding used.

I've been using it regularly for about two years now. It's been a constant fixture in my book bag. One of the best features of the dictionary is that it includes sentence examples to make it clear exactly what sense of the word is being used. The next greatest part of the book is that it does not waste space with romaji, leaving much more room for examples and words. It is extremely comprehensive and actually has several terms that are too specialized for common usage and thus not in the average Japanese exchange student's vocabulary (leading to some humorous exchanges).The second feature is also its greatest flaw; if you cannot read hiragana and katakana, you cannot use this dictionary. I still strongly recommend this dictionary, but first-year students will probably want to hold off until they can read Japanese before picking this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine dictionary","review":"This is a good dictionary for beginners and intermediate students. However, the focus on furigana may not be such a good thing - there is the risk of relying on them as a crutch instead of learning kanji properly as furigana use is actually relatively uncommon in Japanese texts meant for adult readers. So if one can avoid becoming \\"dependent\\" on furigana, then this is a good dictionary. It would probably be pretty useless to advanced learners of the lanugage. Again, taking the time to memorize kanji readings instead of relying on furigana will save you a lot of time spent on looking them up when you are trying to read a text that does not incude any or all furigana.Ivan Rorick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Examples, Mediocre Listings","review":"This dictionary is one of the best that I've used for 3 reasons. First, it gives very useful, clear example sentences with most words that leaves no doubt as to how to use the word in a sentence. A must for any dictionary used to help with conversation. Second, it is a furigana dictionary to help us foreigners through those annoying, yet important, characters known as kanji. Third, it has a very useful appendix section which, among other things, includes a listing of most (all?) counter words (dai, to, mai, etc.) and when to use each.The biggest shortcoming of this dictionary is its word coverage. All too often I have needed a word for a conversation only to find that it's not in the dictionary. Don't get me wrong, the coverage is decent, just not superb.All in all, though, on its own, this is a good dictionary to use for most conversations.

With the cd, BSB takes another step forward. I've always loved their music/videos. But these seem a bit more focused. I love each and one of the videos and how they go into detail about the making of each one. The only thing i would like to see in the future is perhaps all of the BSB videos on one DVD.Otherwise this is easily a worthwhile purchase for any Backstreet Boys fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"It is made to sound as if you get all the film clips from the never gone cd, but in fact you only get three and the making of those!

It is bright and colorful and based on the board game Candy Land. The down side is that after about a month, the smelly spots, which were very strong smelling faded away, and now less than 6 months of after purchasing the book, we have a non-smelly scratch and sniff book. Wish I had read the reviews, I would have saved my money. Those DK scratch and sniff books are fantastic, the smell has lasted forever. Buy those instead of this book, you'll be happier in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratch and Sniff areas do not last long","review":"My children love scratch and sniff books so we have all that I have been able to find.This book is simple and cute, but the odor areas do not last long at all.

Wish I saved the money...YOU SHOULD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so scratch and sniff","review":"The presentation of the book is very similar to the board game with King Candy as the host. It didn't have the number of pages I expected. It is the typical box shaped hard cardboard type book. The pages are very, very bright. Myself and my 5 year old scratched out the smells completely after only a few uses. I expected the smells to last much longer than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Barbecue Bible","review":"Nice recipes, but many are complicated; many ingredients are unique and therefore difficult to find. A better name for the book would be \\"The Barbecue Gourmet.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't impressed, the book totally misses the point. Bible??? I think not! Where's the meat?","review":"Where this book fails immediately is that Barbecue is not about the sauce it's about the meat. I know, I design sauces and own a BBQ Sauce Company. I'm always looking for good BBQ cookbooks. The author gives no information on preparation of meat or cooking it. He spent 13 pages on how to light different grills and I wasn't impressed much with that. I think the big headlines were used to waste space so that he could put out a big book. I could go on but here is one final thought. The book claims to be the Barbecue Bible, you'd expect it to cover the subject in every detail and with some degree of experience. This attempt at being the Barbecue Bible fails miserably. I bought the book online, if I saw the book in a book store and was able to go through it, I would not have bought it. Steven Raichlen is probably a food critic or cookbook editor, not a barbecue expert."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Barbecue..Bible????","review":"Ok, Perhaps the recipes are great, but unlike his other books with great illustrations, I might have just picked up a world dictionary that doesn't entise the imagination.

We bought a grill to help increase our cooking options. I received The Barbecue Bible as a gift from someone I consider very well versed in the art of barbecuing. If nothing else, while reading and after reading The Barbecue Bible, we found ourselves experimenting more with the capabilities of the grill. We baked cookies, cakes, cheesecakes; we grilled fruits and vegetables. I seriously doubt we would have tried much of the baking if we hadn't read the book.We also found the stories about how different cultures grill to be facinating.

Our daughter-in-law has been using it for a couple of years to treat us to many of the recipes and barbecuing tips. When we finally purchased a high quality gas grill we knew that we had to have the Barbecue Bible to do justice to our grilling. We have loved the guidance in creating perfectly prepared meats, side dish recipes and even desserts and appetizers from the grill.

This book passes muster.I think this is probably the only Raichlen work worth studying. Although the How to Grill book I would get instead for those who don't know how to tie their shoes culinarily.He gets these recipes from people all over the world and many of them are outstanding. He must be very personable to coax them out of all those talents. I don't think he is a particularly great cook but he does know enough about grilling.I think this will please gourmands who want to be able to extend their abilities to the summer get-together concept, but it will be a bit over the head of your average beergutted grill jockey. Most of my nascent grilling repetoire so far consists of variations on what I found within."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think so","review":"Great if you want recipes from around the world with ingredients that can't be found. It seems to me that the author was trying to make a statement more of his travels than of his culinary acummen.

He is from the South and can't wiat to try some of what he has learned in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm In LOVE!!!","review":"My husband and I Have been trying a new dish every day from this book since the day it has arrived. I have always loved to cook outside on the grill for several reasons one of the biggest is not heating up my house by cooking in the kitchen. We have made EVERYTHING for dinner every day since we got this book. So far my favorite is his recipe to brine plain boneless chicken breasts...and I have to say plain grilled chicken breasts has been one of my favorite things for years....but after a soak in his simple Brine it was a FLAVOR EXPLOSION and so moist and tender! I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone who enjoys fabulous food. Total MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"I bought this book for my husband since his birthday is in the middle of grilling season!

Thumbs up on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must-own\\" grilling book","review":"This is hands down my favorite cookbook of ANY sort. The recipes are incredibly delicious, and yet very easy to make and understand. Before I read this book I just did the basics on the BBQ, burgers, chicken, steaks, etc. They tasted good, I got lots of compliments, but since I've been using these recipes, even my old favorites taste better, and I've added many new great tasting dishes to my grilling experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbecue Bible-too exotic","review":"I found the book full of strange spices and exotic recipes, way to exotic for your average backyard barbecue. I purchased another of his books and it was much more useful, full of colored pictures, and ideas. This book was a waste of money unless you are really really into cooking. Never heard of most of the ingredients used in his book. Also, no good color photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I love to barbeque. I love finding new recipes, so a book called the barbeque bible seemed great. This author seemed to worry more about filling the book with as many recipes as possible rather than making sure the recipes were of high quality. I will say that this book is probably good for the beginer. I think a better book would be anything by cooks illustrated. They test every recipe thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many ingredients","review":"If you like a cookbook that requires you to have multiple ingredients per recipe, this book is for you. I like cookbooks that have useable recipes from things I probably have already in my home. This cookbook is too complicated. Just to make their \\"Basic Barbecue Sauce\\", you need to have 19 ingredients. I would rather pay 99 cents and buy it at the store. I was truly disappointed with this book. I bought it for my husband and it has sat in the cupboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Damaged","review":"My copy was damaged. The binding glue didn't incorporate all the pages.

I barbecued almost every day and this really became my barbecue bible. I am no longer intimidated by my gas grill and I look forward to the wonderful dishes I can make. This book is worth the price just for the chicken recipes but every recipe I tried is wonderful. I also love the marinades and sauce recipes.

It comes with detailed instructions about heat, smoke and every other aspect of barbecuing. Buy this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for my personal use.","review":"this item was not for my personal use.

I've owned this cookbook since 2000 and it is covered in goop and just about falling off the binding because I use it so often and love it. It is for adventurous grillers who enjoy ethnic adventures. We often open up the book and say \\"where would you like to eat tonight\\" and we choose a region or country. Other BBQ Bible \\"deciples\\" and I email our favorites back and forth. I've never even made anything mediocre out of this book - everything has been great to fabulous! Even side dishes and drinks are great too...

I'm sure this cookbook will be a summer staple at my house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for outdoor cooks of all levels","review":"The Barbecue! Bible is a great grilling and barbecueing reference and cookbook, suitable for cooks at any expereince level. The first great quality of this book is its breadth. In addition to hundreds of recipes it covers some of the basics such as, how to grill the perfect steak, temperature guides, and equipment suggestions.Second, the recipes cover the most simple (The Great American Hamburger) to some truly exotic dishes from the many cultures of the Pacific rim, to the spice of Latin America, to the classic tastes of Europe.Third, it is easy to use. Categorized by course (starters, salads, entrees) and by protein type (or vegetable), the book is easily navigable.I received this book as gift nearly two years ago. It remains one of my most frequently used cookbooks and has provided many, many crowd pleasing meals."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Joy of Cooking\\" for the grill","review":"This book includes not only some of the most interesting methods of cooking and preparing food for the grill, but also a thorough introduction to preparing the grill, the methods of cooking the dish, and in some cases a description of how to make the side dish. I have given this book as a gift to several others, and recommend it highly. The Beer Can Chicken is a sure conversation starter -- at least until everyone starts eating it and they all shut up cause the Meat is the best you have ever tasted. The best thing is that Steve gets us beyond the typical American grilled fare -- and tells us how to create exotic dishes cooked over an open flame (the Balinese chicken stands ou here)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The essential BBQ Book","review":"My husband and I have long enjoyed Steve Raichlen's PBS shows and this book is the perfect BBQ companion for keeping all these tips and recipies at your fingertips."},{"rating":"2","title":"I eat better now","review":"I bought this as a gift for my husband who is the bbq chef in our home.

It is so quiet and it really does a great job. I like the fact that it makes what you shred into so many tiny pieces and the container holds so much. Great product for the price"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Gear Material Design","review":"The gear that links the powerful motor to its shredding teeth is made out of poor material... yup, you guessed it, PLASTIC! WHAT KIND OF DESIGN ENGINEERS DO THESE COMPANY HAVE? And just as expected, in just a few months of service, the gears have worn out and this heavy duty machine has turned into a very expensive TRASH CAN with wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Schredder!","review":"I have owned approximately 10 schredders and Fellowes have been the best. The extra money you spend is well worth it. I own and manage a medical billing service so my business requires a lot of documents to be disposed of by schredding them. I have a Fellowes SB-99Ci cross cut schredder and it has worked very well and still does after 2 years of use. I decided on the Fellowes MS-460Cs to be the replacement for a non Fellowes schredder used by one of my associates for 4 years before failing. Due to the volume of schredding, the MS-460Cs requires ten times less basket emptying then the SB-99Ci, it produces a higher security level of schredding and it is also quieter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet, Strong, Durable","review":"Love this shredder. Last one, same model number, last for years. This time the shredder is a little taller, but much quieter than the previous one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to love this shredder","review":"I've been using this shredder for a year now and while I love the way it can turn any paper into dust, the fact that it can only handle a few pages at a time has been driving me crazy. First the good- it's large, has a huge pull-out bin, and shreds paper into nothingness. The bad- this thing is a total baby when it comes to shredding more than 3-4 pieces of paper. I've tried heavy and light paper and regardless, the sensor on this unit refuses to go over 5 pages most days. The box is completely misleading when it says 10-sheet and the majority of the time you can only send a few. I've spent countless amount of time feeding and re-feeding the shredder.I really want to love this shredder but one year later I'm sick of it. It's a frustrating experience to be only able to send a few pages into what appears to be a heavy duty unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Built to Break!","review":"Like another reviewer, I had this unit break just outside of the 1-year warranty, and this unit cost too much money to only last one year! Most of the unit is built with very heavy duty metal parts and gears, but they've got this one critical gear that is made of PLASTIC! And of course they won't repair the unit or replace the gear, no matter how much I begged them to let me buy one, they just wouldn't sell one to me. I would have paid an arm and a leg to get this thing repaired so I wouldn't have to throw this huge machine into the landfill and pollute the planet, but the only solution they could offer me was to throw it out and buy another shredder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again.","review":"How this company stays in business I have no idea. I am now on my third Fellowes shredder in a few years. All three have acted up with minimal, and I mean 10 minutes once every few months minimal, usage. I keep stepping up thinking they get better with price, but they do not. This one constantly jams when shredding six or more printer-paper thick sheets. Unopened envelopes with a single sheet must be opened and the envelop portion discarded. It often spits paper back and sometimes takes three or four tries while holding the button to shred. I clean it regularly and oil as well, but it is no matter. Even the disposal can is poorly designed. It is such an odd shape and the edges so sharp that it tears the bag when trying to empty. I will never buy from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publication - Lacking basic information","review":"Ifeel the author did not go into sufficent detail to explain how to determine the correct tension of blade; any easy techniques to thread blade for inside cuts; hints on proper feed of project into blade for clean, smooth cuts etc. In short, lacking information a rank novis should know to better assist in proper or easier ways to become proficient in sawing, rather than having to learn from trial and error."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Nothing new in this book.I'm a pattern junky and didn't like what this book had to offer.You're better off with Spielman's Country pattern book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET ALL THEIR ALBUMS NOW","review":"Stellar performances by seasoned musicians who have all mastered their craft.

I took my chance and bought it anyways, and I'm glad I did. You would think the stroller would include this accessory since it's so expensive, but unfortunately it doesn't. I really needed a place to put my coffee or cell phone when going for a walk in the morning. I placed it on the inside so it wouldn't stick out, and I haven't had any problems with it getting in the way. Every once in a while I'll take it off if I know I'm not going to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well but sticks out","review":"I have the Bugaboo Bee stroller. It's great to be able to hold a drink, and the cup holder works with different size cups (paper coffee cups and soda cans both fit snugly.) However, the extra couple inches that this adds to the width of the stroller is really noticeable when trying to squeeze around trees, busy sidewalks, crowded stores, etc.The cup holder can be placed on the inside of the handle to avoid this problem, but the handle will then not fully collapse and I'm not sure the stroller will fold up correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well thought out design","review":"As another reviewer mentioned already, the idea of having a cup holder mounted on the outside of an already fairly wide stroller is a total flop. Within two days of attaching it we hit so many door frames, gates, etc. that we decided to return the product (before it gets busted). Two stars for holding bottles well and not breaking after being hit a few times."},{"rating":"2","title":"convenient convenience","review":"i bought 2 of these for the Bee (one for child and one for parent). it's nice for him to have his cup at-the-ready while strolling around. although somewhat pricey for its simple function, it would have been nice if the attachment clamp were universal as opposed to having 3 of them in the box for the correct size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes life easier","review":"I think a cup holder is a must for any stroller and honestly believe that it be included when you buy the standard stroller (like it is with other strollers that aren't Bugaboo).Anyway - it fits great on my Cameleon. I like the fact that it can be fitted anywhere on the handle, and it's strong enough to hold a mid-sized water bottle/soda bottle or a venti-sized coffee cup.My only problem with the cup holder is that it sticks out (no matter where you place it on the handle bar) and adds substantial width to the stroller. Because of this it is harder to maneuver in smaller places (like elevators or a aisle in a drugstore) plus I have to remove it when ever I fold the stroller into my car - not and easy task.I like the holder, I just think it should have been designed differently..regardless - if you walk around a lot it's a must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not stay in place","review":"The cup holder is very easy to install but it does not stay in place.It was quite expensive for something that keeps falling even when there are no cups in it.I bought it for my Bugaboo Bee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"Worked great for a few months, until the internal holder broke, rendering the whole thing useless. Also since you have to take it off everytime you fold it down, it quickly became lost. It would be better if it was somehow integrated into the stroller. Poorly constructed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never stays on","review":"This cup holder never stays on. Even with exchanging the parts and size pieces it comes with. I'd rather hold my drink than fight with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well built cup holder, but pricy","review":"Solid built , nice addition o the bugaboo stroller. Its on the higher pricy range for a cup holder, and wishing it would be included as part of stroller. It holds a baby bottle as well as a normal size adult drink bottle, no complaint there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightening!","review":"Born and raised in Wichita, KS, I found this book set in my hometown particularly disturbing--in an entertaining way.The characters are interesting people. Dr. Sydney Rochester, a recovering alcoholic with her own problems, stands up to her fear when the most vicious and unstable patient she's dealt with escapes--even though she knows she is on his list of people to eat. Special Agent Garon Sloan is an FBI tough guy dedicated to putting the bad guy back behind bars. And the bad guy, Max Luden, is a seriously demented and a very, very bad guy.Conflict, tension, suspense, and a heavy dose of sexual attraction make this book very appealing and satisfying.DARK NIGHTS is the first book by Shelley Dawn I've read, but I'm anxiously looking forward to reading SWEET, SWEET JESSIE and I'm hoping this author produces more tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"This is a very nice performance as expected, but as usual for Previn perhaps lacking the ultimate spirit or bravado. Vocals are excellent and the playing by the LSO is just about perfect. Sound is very good, but not as good as I was hoping for. This 1976 recording could have sounded better with lower noise and more distant miking. 1976 was near the end of the analog recording era, and I can guarantee that analog recordings have sounded much better than this. The sound is not at all bad, but it's not nearly as great as it could be. Ditto the performance.Update: I went back and re-listened on better equipment, and the sound quality on this recording is very good, if a bit close-miked as is unfortunately typical for most commercial recordings. Vocals sounds very real, and instrument sounds are generally very good. The underlying sound quality is very good and definitely better than my first listening on lesser equipment suggested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huumer Feeder","review":"Great feeder - combined with the humbrella - we have had no ants, no squirrels - no problems.Easy to clean and fill!The hummingbirds love it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hummzinger","review":"This hummingbird feeder is a gem.

The monster is ridiculous, but that adds to the effect rather than detracts. Watch for Deputies Bob and Tillus to steal the show, but the rest of the cast is great too.

Unfortunately, in the academy, one needs neither intelligence nor originality to succeed; rather, one only needs to be \\"progressive,\\" which means formulating the most politically obtuse and obscene ideas one can, replacing the obscenities with grad-school words, and--to make sure it sounds \\"academic\\"--removing all traces of narrative cohesion.

I find the dialogues really help me to learn how to pronounce French words and speak conversationally as real people do. They throw a lot of new words and grammar at you in the form of 2 or 3 person dialogues, rather than leading you through in a more traditional, words by word, sentence by sentence manner. I have enjoyed this, because it really does get one started speaking quickly. I have been practicing with a friend that studied French in college, and they are quite amazed at my progress.The proof was going to Paris last month for work. Even though I was still very much a beginner, I found that my learned pronunciation was quite good - almost too good because people started speaking to me in French!

The series is definitely a conversational language course which is great if you are going to travel in France. Some of the topics covered include eating at a restaurant, talking about a house, telling someone if you aren't feeling well and talking about your hobbies and work. What I really wanted, and maybe I shouldn't have expected from this series, was step by step grammar instruction and pronunciation techniques. There is a grammar review in the back of the workbook that I used more than the actual book.

The 30+ pages of front matter include a preface by the late Avery Card. Dulles contextualizing the Exercises in its time and within the larger corpus of spiritual literature written before and since then. An overview of the saint's life follows, and the translator's preface explaining his methodology. The translation itself reads smoothly, but it is not light. Fairly comprehensive notes are found at the end of the translation, and the editors have added an index at the end to assist in quickly finding useful passages.One can read it quickly, but to do so is a detriment to the reader. It is useful to remember that these exercises were conducted over the course of a month. Likewise when reading the book one must stop, reflect, think, and pray.

I also found the characters to be really funny and likeable.The only complaint I had was about the seemingly constant bickering. I didn't enjoy watching these supposedly smart and sometimes ancient characters picking away at each other. The theme I am especially getting tired of is this story of the \\"hen pecked man\\"; the poor men who must constantly put up with bitchy women. The only thing I'd really want to change in this book would be it's tendency to represent overly sympathetic men while creating, for the most part, antogonistic women.

The only other fantasy books I read were The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. I was surprised at how well this book came out. It's not just monsters and dragons, but a story about a world and a little farm boy named Garion.This book is humorous, action-filled, playful, and suspenseful. It's a great read, and Eddings has great fluidity. The book starts out on a farm, with one boy and his aunt. Throughout the book, tiny bits of information eventually lead this boy and a group to an epic adventure.The characters are great, each with its unique part to play. The plot is wonderfully done, as the story unfolds itself slowly, adding to the mystery surrounding the boy.Because of this, I vowed to read every other book in this five part series. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull characters, incomplete plot.","review":"In \\"Pawn of Prophecy,\\" the incomplete plot gradually introduces a set of characters, but virtually nothing happens to them. The characters are thin, as the blatant foreshadowing screams that Pol and Wolf are far more than just a simple cook and a storyteller, and Gorion will inevitably be the farm boy who rises to greatness and saves the world. The only thing more tedious than Aunt Pol's constant scolding of Gorion after he was well beyond boyhood was the glacial pace of Eddings's plot as the party traveled in a circle from city to city, looking for some nameless artifact they never could find. Eddings creates a colorful world of seven different lands, each inhabited by multiple races, but he doesn't develop most of them beyond simple caricatures and the different races become just names the reader has to remember. Eddings writes well and firmly develops his world, but without a more complete story line, \\"Pawn of Prophecy\\" is just 290 pages worth of introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Round and Round.","review":"Maybe I missed something.

I found this book to be a bit pointless. There was not any great plot. A boy trying to figure out who he is. Nobody telling him much. So he gets angry constantly at his Aunt and others. This plot just went over and over. And even by the end of the book he still does not know much. I had to force myself to finish the book. I just can't figure out why this book got so many great reviews. Instead I would recommend George R.R. Martin for anyone looking to start a fantasy series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Fare","review":"I am still trying to understand how this series got so many good ratings. After reading this, I bought the series only to be really disappointed.This book is filled with shallow story line; hackneyed characters; generic setting. The problem is you never get passionate about the character to root for victory or failure. This is essential for any fantasy book.Surprisingly, I see so many comparisons with Tolkein or George R R Martin. There is no way this work (supposedly among his best) comes close to Tolkein's work and George R R Martin's Song of Ice and Fire has some complex plots and great character development.The only reason I am writing this review is to ensure that people like me don't get ripped off thinking that that this series is great and waste money on it.If you are browsing the site to check if you want to invest in this author, then be warned, that the overall ratings belie the actual quality of the book/series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Simple Minded For Adults","review":"I read about 90% of this book and then I just stopped. I was starting to wonder if this is intended to be adult fantasy or is it meant for young adults?The plot is unbelievably linear and the characters are mostly one-dimensional. The different racial groups are shallow stereotypes. And, finally, I don't find the world all that compelling. Pawn of Prophecy reads like a relic from the 1960s.This might be a fun read for a teen. But it really doesn't have enough depth to hold the interest of somebody who has been reading the really excellent adult fantasy that is available today.I recommend looking into the works of Steven Erikson or George RR Martin or R.Scott Bakker instead of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"loved this book from the moment I read it paperback, had to buy it for kindle.

The unsuspecting hero thrown in the deep end, his comrades in arms, the evil villain and his lackeys looming on the horizon and an all important quest.

His heroic characters exhibit human flaws that make them all the more likable and his villains are portrayed with just the right amount of sinister zeal. I can't wait to get started on the second book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it young","review":"This is a great book for anyone of any age but the younger the reader is, the better. Any 10-12 year old will become immersed in the plot and feel that these characters are real. Any older reader will read it in amazement over the rich vocabulary and details. The best reason to read it young is because it will be harder for you to predict and therefore a more enjoyable read.

One night, I said \\"I have nothing to read\\" and then he threw Pawn of Prophecy at me. I finished the book in only a few days. I would literally tear myself away from it. It is a well told story with characters that you can relate to, with a unique humor to each of them. The entire series is worth reading again and again and again. One day, my children will begin the journey from Faldor's Farm, guided by Aunt Pol and Old Wolf. I cannot wait to share the experience. Thankyou David Eddings, for writing what will be held dear for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This book, although a quick read was definity really good.

This is ENTERTAINMENT, not meant to make us think to much. That is why I think it is good. It has all the classical fantasy elements, including a lot of scorcery.

It was slow, and I didn't care about what happened to any of the characters at the end of the book. However, my friend assurred me that the following books in the \\"Belgariad\\" built upon this first book, and that I wouldn't regret reading this book once I was done with the series. He was absolutely correct. Once I had finished the first five books, I couldn't wait to read more. Now, I read anything I can find by Eddings"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly repackaged Tolkien","review":"This book is not only a blatant reworking of LOTR, it is not even enjoyable reading. Eddings' style is simplistic, the dialogue is rudimentary, the plot is predicatble and the characters are dull. Couple this with the obvious lack of originality and you have a pretty dismal reading experience here. I forced myself to finish the book and was glad to finally put it down. I don't recommend this book and was so unimpressed that I plan not to read any more of Eddings' work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent...","review":"Being very picky about what I read, I have found Eddings to be a refreshing change to other Fantasy writers. One person mentioned that he could have written the entire series in a 600 page book, but I wish to defer. The story is perfect for someone who likes details about the characters they meet in the books. A major complaint of mine with other authors is that they never tell you what happens after all the excitement is over...Eddings does that, which makes his characters all the more human. I have read every book of his, with the exception of High Hunt and Losers, and I highly recommend them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRRRRRRRRRRRREAT!!!!","review":"There is no way that you can read this book and not read the rest of the series.

This series is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a Thesaurus, but a good read","review":"When I first read Pawn of Prophecy, I couldn't put it down. The next day, I bought the next one, untill I had the whole series. Now, you might think I'm loony, but I REALLY enjoyed it! Sure, the story is old, and the rang of vocabulary irritating, but it has strong characters devoplment. You care about Aunt Pol and Garion (even though he is rather stupid and whinny), and the rest of the gang. I laughed every time Beldin opened his mouth, and the same with the air-head knight, Mandorallen. My only major complant is that Garion is sooo immature in the Belgarid. (He's about 14 in the begining) I read these at age 11 (1996) and figured out the whole thing way before he did (one book vs. four whole books). But to get to the point, if you want an entertaining, easy read with few flaws, then what's stopping you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddings writes real characters in a fantasy setting.","review":"David Eddings has the wonderful ability to take the reader to a well thought out and exicting fantasy realm, and still give his characters real feelings and personalities. One of the major problems with the Fantast jounrah is that characters often get lost in the setting of mythical animals and magical events. This, however, is not the case in Eddings' seires. His characters are very real and easy to realate to. I love the fact that Garion, the books young hero, often displays flaws and genral confusion, after all, that seems to be the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I actually read both the Belgariad and the Malloreon as they were being published. They are great popcorn fantasy. Don't expect anything deep because the characters are defined almost entirely by static description and the manner of their speech with frequent sitcom-like quips and jokes. It definitely isn't literature and is often times predictable, but it's so much fun that you can't help but lose yourself in the joy of the ride. If you want something light-hearted and fun as well as completely fattening, easily digested and wholly non-nutritional, then pig out! It's a great series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent book!! It's well written!!","review":"I completely loved Garion in this series on what I call the best ever written.. David Eddings creates a world so believable that I (even if just a moment) felt as if I were there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond excellent","review":"When I started reading this book, I thought,\\" Oh God, it's going to be boring\\", because the scene was set out in a kitchen. But once I carried on reading it, I couldn't stop. The book is so funny and exciting.I enjoyed this book very much, and would certainly recommend this book to any person who enjoys reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up","review":"Reading a fantasy series for the purpose of evaluating its contribution to the growth of the genre will greatly reduce the enjoyment that you should get from ANY series. This series wasn't written to be the next Lord of the Rings. It was written to be enjoyable reading, and that's how it should be taken. Eddings succeeds overwhelmingly in making the Belgariad, and later the Mallorean, an enjoyable read. Sure, much of the story is predictable at times. So what? If you approach reading without a literary critic's hat on, you'll love this series. If you can't read for enjoyment, you won't like it at all, and you have my deepest sympathies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too predictable","review":"The first book of the Belgariad was a very good start to the series. I found it a little too predictable though. In the introduction where it describes Belgarath using the guise of a wolf, that gave me the suspicion that the storyteller (mister wolf) was indeed Belgarath. The same thing happened with the aunt pol is polgara thing.Besides that, the book flows well and has an interesting storyline. It slowly builds up the suspense in the end wanting to make you finish the book. Overall, Pawn of Prophecy was a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first million words are cr*p...","review":"Or so said Hemmingway and if this is true Eddings is still working to get past the hundred thousand milestone. If you are considering reading this book or the whole series in general, don't. It isn't good and there are no surprises at all. Aside from bad characters which I won't even go into He's taken a pretty classic storyline and hasn't changed it very much. These are not his biggest flaws though, he doesn't keep a reader interested. If you can predict what's going to happen the only joy from reading this is finding out that you were right with each turn of the page. In all fields of literature there are great authors and there are hacks. Eddings falls into the second category. -Cliff"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped me dead","review":"This book dissapointed me so much that I never reached the next in the series. Maybe it was because I'd just finished tEoTW, but I thought the writing was terrible, so never managed to get past that to the OK plot. Sorry Eddings, back to Jordan and Donaldson for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst fantasy series I have ever read.","review":"After completing the entire ten book series, I came to two conclusions. First, here is a clear diagram of how not to write a fantasy series. Do the exact opposite of everything Eddings did, and your story will turn out fine. For example, villians should be more than a name, a physical desciption and a method of dying. They should pose a threat.Second, I can only liken the reading of the Belgariad to dragging myself across broken glass to drink out a toilet. Painful, predictable and with an unsatisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"If formula books had an aristocracy, this book and its following series would be king. Let's see, we have a rustic country lad who has a great destiny. He is assisted by two magicians, some strong men, and a thief. His mission: to kill the world's source of evil as recorded in a prophecy. Does this sound even faintly familiar? The sequel series follows the exact same plot, too. Talk about lack of creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kewl","review":"This book did start a bit slowly but it drew me right into it and never let me go. I liked the funny parts in the end, like Garion's encounter with Maidee, and the way he ended up stuck above the throne room. This book changed me a lot - that one line where they were scoffing Islena \\"She fancies herself a sorceress.\\" I used to have the disgusting habit of imagining myself lots of things I wasn't - really powerfully psychic (I still belive I may be a little, though), slender, pretty, a good gymnast, a fast skater, none of which I am. Now I am careful, thanks to Islena, to not let my ego get away with me. I am much more critical of myself, rather than bragging only.

Eddings is the closest thing to tolkien I have read not as in depth but few things are but there are some strong similarities. If you like fantasy these are essential books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but no sigar","review":"The Belgariad is a collection of good ideas piled together under the influence of Lord of the Rings. The story is too obvious and predictable, and here are too many easy ways out and cheap sollutions in the series to make it really entertaining as a whole. The author has some original ideas and descriptions, which make the book fair enough to read, but im sorry to say that this was not a thrilling experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A riveting read.","review":"This is merely the beginning of a wild and fantastic series of books (I mean BOTH the Belgariad and it's successor, the Malloreon). This is definitely a must read for fantasy buffs, as the characters will simply come to life. Eddings has done a masterful job in this book, and the entire Belgariad/Malloreon series as a whole. If you think you know about how magic works after reading OTHER series of novels, Eddings gives you a fierce reality/fantasy check... and it's a refreshing one as well.A caveat if I may... if you read this novel, you WILL be reading the whole series eventually. There is simply no escaping it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"This is my favorite series of fantasy books! Nothing I have read can compare to the simple wonder and joy that these books create. The world is rich and vibrant, full of interesting places and people that give a wonderful depth to \\"The Belgariad\\" (books 1-5).The plot is full and moves at a comfortable pace, never slow, yet never so quick that you feel rushed about. There is action, but it is not gratuitously bloody.This is the perfect story for young readers (9-14), who want more excitement than \\"Harry Potter\\", and who's parents don't want them having nightmares!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor way to experience the story","review":"The book is definately worth 5 stars, but this audiobook is barely worth 1.

Apparently, many of the readers here enjoyed it, however, I would have to recommend just about anything else in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than Terry Brooks...","review":"I guess Mr. Eddings feels that if he loads his kiddee books up with words like \\"belgariad\\" and \\"malloreon,\\" they will be beloved, respected fantasy. Please Mr. Eddings, toss that typewriter out of the window...your childish musings are annoying at best, and a great blemish on the genre at worst.Cookie cutter plots, characters, and situations populate this book, and every other that follows it. Classic childrens fantasy (CS Lewis, Lloyd Alexander, etc.) was *never* this bad - indeed, those stories are beloved classics for a reason.The worst thing of all, people have bought into those, throwing their money at some of the most insulting, poorly written c r a p the genre has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dire for words","review":"An improbable combination of the bodice-ripping excitement of Jane Austin, the concision of Tolstoy and the literary elegance of Philip K Dick; this novel explores the depths of every tired fantasy cliché. Observe Eddings' creative genius at work as he draws past civilisations out of a hat, makes them all American and creates his own fantasy milieu!

Granted it is somewhat short, but the book just abruptly stops at the end, without tying anything together. I assume it will be continued directly in the sequel which I have not yet read. I know a lot of writers plan on writing many sequels (Jordan, Goodkind, etc.) but at least there is some kind of resolution of at least some of the characters problems at the end of each book. Eddings does write a solid fantasy, however, and is very good at immersing the reader in the environment of the novel. It is a little slower-paced than most of the fantasy novels I have read, but still it is very good. I look forward to reading the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series is the best one i have ever read","review":"The book Pawn of Prophecy has kept me up so late reading i have barley been able to put it down it is a great book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pawn of Prophecy by David Eddings","review":"The book was torn up all across the bottom back.

Since then, I have read the covers off of two paperback copies of this book and the other 4 in this series. I have since bought the hardback version of this series and the following series (The Mallorean).Eddings writes with enough detail to bring this world alive around you while the dialogue keeps you glued to the characters. His use of humor with the characters will make you associate with one of them, guaranteed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fully developed 2-dimensional characters...","review":"I'm fascinated with fantasy writing because so little of it is good. Tolkein, of course, and Urusla LeGuin, but beyond that the field falls to hacks ranging from pleasant to truly awful. Eddings is somewhere in the middle between these last two extremes. All of his characters seem to come from old-school children's books (The Noble Thief, the Valiant Warrior, the Uppity Princess) and they fulfill their roles as well as they can, but there is little to develop. The overarching plot of this series is nothing to write home about. The biggest confusion I have is just who he is aiming these books towards. Linguistically and stylistically they are aimed at about a 6th grade reading level, yet he also introduces some heavily suggestive (no real nudity, mind you) scenes as well, along with a few bits of truly graphic violence. My guess it is aimed for adults who can't read beyond a junior high school level. Not a bad book, but certainly not worth remembering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of decent Villians and weak in its exercution.","review":"I find most of Eddings work a continuous rehash of the same story that's OK because many of todays authors do it. Sadly like many of todays authors the story is weak and the characterisation even worse. We are introduced to Garion a young boy who's destiny is one that will shake the world of men and gods. Sounds good but then it's down hill from there Eddings seems to be incapable of giving his Heroes decent villians to combat so much so that there is no doubt they will succeed. I also found his attempts of humour quite sad. I rate his books down there with that other original writer Dennis L McKiernan."},{"rating":"1","title":"very linear","review":"I've found with these reviews that people arent very critical. Is this really the best book youve ever read?? Its got that definite, \\"they go here, then they go there, then they travel here. etc etc\\". Nothing ever really happens. There is only 1 battle in the book which goes for about 10 lines. There is no finale either. Yeah its part of a series, but you still need a climax. The end of the book finishes with the party heading out on the road again (so Im not sure if I want to read the 2nd). There is also no real use of magic either. I dont know how this can be compared to the likes of Gemmell and Feist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow start of an epic","review":"I do not exactly know why I read this whole series. Because I did not fancy this first episode. In my opinion there was no logic as to why the group of people followed the route of travel they followed. Furthermore I like a story with several storylines interwoven. This book lacks that for sure. To go short I was not half as impressed as the majority of reviewers overhere. Nevertheless I read through the next volumes and I must say the series improves towards the end.

Everything is totally predictable and the characters are one dimensional and incredibly uninteresting. Not to mention, nothing actually happens in this book - and I mean NOTHING. The entire book is a slow meandering journey which only stops for long repetitive dialogues that do absolutely nothing but take up space. The main character is not only purposely kept in the dark, but Eddings view of women in general is extremely degrading and condescending.I read this book on the recommendation of a friend. Luckily they are short and easily forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't become a pawn.","review":"This book is beyond awful. The setting is stock and does nothing to advance the genre of Fantasy, (probably the opposite), the plot isn't stock, but it is not very efficient in moving the story or keeping the reader's attention. The characters are dreadful. If you can't realize that these characters have no depth, are poorly described, and have no personality traits, then you need to go back to a high school english class. Eddings makes an attempt to write fantasy that is similar to Lord of the Rings, but fails every step of the way. Even if he had succeeded, it has already been done. So, the bottom line is that this is a common fantasy story with no original ideas and paper-thin stock fantasy stereotype characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is annoyance enterainment?","review":"If so, this book entertained me. But lets be fair. It is incredible how many five star reviews this book gets. There is really nothing in it that wants me to read the rest of the series. It is full of cliches and there is nothing that suprises the reader. The story holds nothing that we haven't already seen elsewhere. I always finish a book i started but i must say i was counting down the pages to go like a convicted criminal!As we can not read anything that is published now (and in the past) maybe I should be glad that Eddings' first book teaches me to skip everything he wrote and concentrate upon other writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly adolescent fantasy","review":"David Eddings commits every sin a writer of fantasy can: there's the wise old all-powerful magician, the big strong warrior, and the boy who is destined to fulfill an ancient prophecy; and not to forget angry Gods who for some reason turn out to be complete nincompoops and allow themselves to be defeated by humans at the end of the series (I'm not considering this a spoiler - this seems obvious). Eddings wrote in his foreword that he wrote this book in order to tackle philosophical issues that bothered him at the time. I don't know what kind of issues he had while writing this, but the deepest philosophical message you can get out of these books is something akin to love conquers all (or of the same type of \\"keen\\" insight). Might satisfy adolescents, but absolutely NOT for adults. I'm not a fantasy buff but I _know_ there is better fantasy out there - such as that by lord Dunsany and others.

This game becomes very repetitive because you have to play it in 2 modes. 1 to get money to buy items and another to raise your levels. You must fight over and over to get anywhere and this is just a waste of time.The major problem in this game for RPG players is you CAN NOT pick the enemy that you want to attack and you usually attack a weak one and not the one that is beating the crap out of you.

The game is slow in all the wrong ways, and punishes players who want to speed things along. Your characters move at a slow crawl, and to move at a somewhat exceptable rate lowers HP. In a game where transportation and resource management are key, this is unforgivable. It is as if the development team made the players not want to progress through the story quickly to pad the number of hours taken to beat the game. It frustrated me in such a short time frame that I returned my copy the next day. I may not have gotten to any redeeming points of interest or plot points further along, but they gave me no reason to stay.

Alexander, in \\"Got Your Back,\\" shares his experience with Pac as the one who was to ultimately protect and maintain him, his bodyguard.

The dark, evil cabal of the Secular Elite have amassed all of their resources for one insidious purpose: to stop you from saying \\"Merry Christmas\\". According to our writer, it's not just a skirmish, a conflict, it's a *war*. Cue the hysterics! Man the canons!Honestly, the one thing to recommend this book is its case study in self-righteousness compared with paranoia. Don't worry, you can still say \\"Merry Christmas\\".

So strong he -in my opinion- shows signs of tunnel vision in his discourse. This left me with the idea I'd been reading a very shallow, mono-sighted paper, sometimes even on the edge of insulting various groups in our vulnerable society.Of course, Mr. Gibson is not a novelist or scholar but still, with just a minimum of efford by the author a more readable and perhaps more interesting piece of work could have been produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isnt it interesting?","review":"How almost 100% of the people hating on Gibson haven't even read the book, yet somehow miraculously have an \\"expert\\" opinion on it?

Why not use a holiday greeting that is appropriate for people of any religion, including the twenty-five percent of Americans that identify themselves as non-Christians, so that the true meaning of the holiday can be expressed? It's not offensive whether a tree, representing Christmas spirit, is called a \\"Christmas tree,\\" or a, \\"Holiday tree.\\"...It's offensive that the media world has come to this as a real issue.

I'm actually ashamed that I'm taking the time to write this. This book (sic) is nothing more that an effort to grab a few bucks and pump up ratings for FOX.

Throughout the course of the show, Gibson continued to bring up Ledger's death, jokingly claiming that current events may have caused him to commit suicide, suggesting that Ledger killed himself because he had \\"a serious position in the (stock) market\\" or perhaps \\"watched the Clinton-Obama debate last night.

If the local tax-dodging churches would allow Hanukah and Kwanzaa displays on their publily-subsidized property, maybe that would be something else.For your sanity, do not read this book; it's all lies.

Need I remind you of the first article in the Bill of Rights:\\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\\"This right states in black & white that the establishment of Christmas Day as a Federal Holiday by law is wrong.This book seems to forget that U.S. Citizens have the right to not be christians and to not be bombarded by any specific religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure partisan drivel for falling FauxNews ratings","review":"As the American people awaken from their 5 years of stupor caused by 9/11 to find that we are still mired in a war in Iraq and that the president has bypassed the Constitution to spy on regular Americans FauxNews all-rant, all the time style has grown tiresome and their motives a lot more transparent.

Bascially, Gibson rants and rants with little in the way of actual support for what he is claiming. Clearly, he rushed this book out in order to get it on the market for Christmas, which suggests to me that he knows that this holiday is more about money than religion.Strange how this \\"War on Christmas\\" is basically being fought on the front lines of businesses.

No manger, no Holy Family, not even a wreath. \\"Holiday season\\"? \\"Best wishes?\\" Why no mention of the baby Jesus? Where's the Christ in Christmas? There is even a small quote from the OLD Testament (i.e., no Jesus). Why do the Bushes hate Jesus? Why is Bush promoting this war on Christmas? Why aren't they covering this on Fox News? How do Gibson and O'Reilly feel about this gross promotion of secularism by the Bushes paid for by the RNC? Why do Republicans hate Christmas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive and Unreadable","review":"I sat down with this book and was unable to finish it. The notion that anyone interested in enforcing the idea of the separation of church and state is therefore \\"anti-Christmas\\" is ludicrous and patently offensive.

The cause: Christianity. It's why a moron is in the White House. Christmas wasn't originally about the birth of Jesus (their savior, like a person should be worshipped), it was the celebration of the Winter Solstice.

In this case, Gibson has somehow managed to define \\"oppression\\" as \\"lack of monopoly.\\" According to Gibson, the continued existence of non-Christians during the winter holidays constitutes oppression of Christianity. Never mind, of course, that the Christian religion probably holds the all-time world record for being oppressed less than any other major religion; it had a remarkably easy road to hegemony. With this book, Gibson hopes to make any non-Christian terrified to express any religious sentiment other than that of the power base."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is more than enough","review":"Are you kidding me?

This phony War on Christmas is the scummiest and lowest tactic yet, but persistence is key; they've been doing it for years and its sadly entered the public discourse.

Far from being a true or accurate of the shifting face of Christmas in modern society, he has instead crafted a crass and fact-deficient political screed that's keyed to the Coulter/Limbaugh crowd. This isn't a book meant to inform or explain; it's a book meant to misinform and inflame a religious base against any and all alternative ideas about Christmas.

I can't wait for it. I put up my Christmas tree and hang stockings and leave milk and cookies for jolly old St. Nick and some carrots for his reindeer. You know, just like Jesus used to do.

Well, it's because i can actually understand the vocalist and what their saying, and im an angry person, so this kind of music just fits my personality.Hell Promise is musically and lyrically pretty much along the same lines as Unearth, All That Remains, As i Lay dying, and others in the american metalscore scene.

Her remix of \\"Heartbreaker\\" from Divas Live 2000 is amazing, her voice is in top form and the song is so awesome... you just wanna listen to it all day.

I finished the book, I guess that says something.","review":"Gray Hollowell was hired by Mariah's father to find out who murdered his wife several decades before. Then Mariah's dad, Edgar Henry, died. I liked Gray's character but I found it hard to believe that Mariah, who just came out of a physically abusive marriage, would want to hop into bed so soon. I realize Gray was a sweet person but I just couldn't believe Mariah would want this to happen so quickly.Also, why did Edgar suddenly decide to investigate his wife's death when it happened 27 years ago? Another thing that bothered me was that Dixie took the time to write a mystery but it wasn't very suspenseful. I just wasn't impressed with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW OLD ARE YOU?","review":"I was 25 when I saw one edition of the Ink Spots. Only the guitar player was an original member of the group. The lead singer sounded a lot like Bill Kenney; it was an enjoyable evening. The Ink Spots found a sound and stuck to it as nobody before or since; it was as if they were afraid to stray away from it and in time they faded as a group. The Mills Brothers, a similar group who had Dean Martin as a major fan, on the other hand, lasted until every brother was dead. But during their time, the Ink Spots left us with some classics, \\"To Each His Own\\", \\"If I Didn't Care\\", and one used in a commercial \\"I Don't Want to Set the World On Fire\\". Some other songs like \\"My Prayer\\" were covered in the 50s by the Platters with Tony Williams on lead and \\"That's When Your Heartache Begins\\" by Elvis Presley.

Not only does it give clear, easy-to-follow instructions, but the techniques and skills taught are incredibly useful and ensure a really nice, professional-looking finished product. The visual detail is very clear thanks to the DVD quality, making it easy to see exactly how Jim Bartz carves his signs. I haven't seen these techniques anywhere else, and I've yet to carve a sign using a easier or more professional method.

Buy this and you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very hands on and informative!","review":"I really enjoy this DVD! It's fun to watch and puts you in mood to go in your workshop and get going. I like that you can actually see exactly how Jim Bartz makes relief carving. He could have spent more time covering engraved carving, but you will not be let down. Don't worry if you can't find specific software to make signs.

There are typos throughout the book. Run on sentences that were also a cause of confusion. Then to really put the nail in the coffin, there are missing steps in many of the excerises leaving the reader guessing how something was done. Horrible book !

I am spending more time trying to figure out what the author is describing because the editor obviously had no clue how to edit text for computer users. Many of the menu paths are incorrect. For example, where on the Flash menu is the command Copy > Paste in Place (there is a Edit > Paste in Place). This is just one example of why I am getting a headache trying to learn from the [amt] piece of crap. I need to get back to the Help Files to really learn some best practices because this book has none. Hard to follow so a weekend is probably not going to cut it. Look elsewhere unless you enjoy inflicting pain on yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful...sorta...okay, not really","review":"I picked up this book hoping for a quick introduction to Flash, and that's exactly what I got. Not much depth at ALL. However, my problem with the book is that the tutorials don't seem to have been tested. I am an honors computer student, and I still found myself thinking \\"Whoa, wait - where did he get that?\\" Missing steps, unclear instructions, and typos all contribute to my low rating of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book If You Read the Cover","review":"I picked up this book with the idea of getting just what it says out of it... the information one might get in any CRASH COURSE. Well, Lo And Behold, that is exactly what I got. The basics were explained, and lots of 'not within the scope of this book' caveats were given. I have since picked up a couple more books on advanced Flash techniques, and FS. I would venture to say that the negative reviews this book has been given were due to the facts that ONE - the reviewers did not take the 10 seconds to read the intent of the book - and TWO - because, in all likelihood, the reviewers were too ignorant to comprehend what the book was attempting to teach them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make the same mistake I did.","review":"I write this review because I do not want what happened to me to happen to any of you. I bought this book on impulse. I will never do that again. I was under the impression that a major publishing company would prevent anything like this from hitting the shelves, I was wrong. My advice to any of you out there thinking of buying one of the many Flash books on the market today is, \\"BE CAREFUL\\". If you are going to buy this book, make sure you get a good look at the book before you break the CD ROM seal, thus making it unreturnable, and leaving you with the curse of owning the book.

Andsnes was allowed (invited?) to record this album of Grieg's Lyric Pieces on Grieg's own piano, and that alone speaks volumes about Andsnes' reputation in his homeland.Judging from the reviews here, the acclaim for Andsnes doesn't sit too well with some classical music fans. We all have our favorite performers, but I've heard enough of Andsnes by now--not only his version of the Lyric Pieces, but also the Grieg Concerto and the Rachmaninov Second and Third--to know that, at least for me, his technique and musicality are superb. I bought this CD for \\"Wedding Day at Troldhaugen,\\" but I found Andsnes' performance sparkling and elegant in every piece on this disc. Unless you are a partisan of Gilels or some other pianist in this repertoire, I think you will enjoy this CD very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short album, but a great mix of songs","review":"What a great debut! The lyrics are simply fantastic, and this EP is a really amazing mix of songs of different tempo. The first song, You're a Wolf, made it onto their subsequent album, Leaves in the River, later in 2007. I ended up buying both this EP and Leaves in the River because their music was so good. The EP ends with I Don't Know if I'll Be Back This Time, possibly the best song on the EP, although I think that The Garden That You Planted is really good, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sergio Franchi is one of the few singers with a great voice.","review":"Sergio Franchi was a great singer, a master of both pop and opera.

Unfortunately, this project has been spoilt by a major flaw, and that is the casting of Jane Eaglen in the title part. Not only is Miss Eaglen's performance cool and dispassionate, her voice often turns ugly above the stave. Her performance leaves much to be desired both vocally and dramatically. O'Neill is a good Radames and Plowright, having turned to the mezzo repertoire, is a vivid Amneris. The other roles are adequately taken and the orchestral playing is good without being remarkable. Anyway, a recording of Aida without a proper Aida cannot be recommended. Thus, I can only award it with 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad description","review":"This is something I ended up returning, the description described something it was not.

Good English translation, which, even you don't use it, makes easy to understan Italian text.

I have owned several copies of this book since I was in high school (1977) and have always enjoyed reading it. The book has a sad air to it, considering the circumstances of its hero, J.B. Books. I have almost come to tears several times while reading it, when I put myself in Books' shoes.Some of the best lines in Western fiction are in this book:\\"..I would not die a death such as I have described.\\" \\"No?\\" \\"I would not.

It is not very long at all and is much more descriptive about the pain J.B. is enduring in his struggle with the cancer which adds to the story.

Color photography is briefly touched on at the book's end. The first half of the book deals with various camera systems, accessories, film choices, photograph visualization and film exposure. All of these topics are covered exceptionally well. The second half deals with the developing and printing process. If the prospective reader will not be involved in the developing and printing process then the Ansel Adams Book 1, \\"The Camera\\", and Book 2, \\"The Negative\\", may be better choices. However to receive the maximum benefit from the art of B&W photography one must eventually delve into the darkroom.

Each page (with a few exceptions) contains only one word and a picture that describes that word. But in some cases, for thoses children who do not know the word, it is difficult to determine what in the picture the word is describing. For example, on the \\"scarf\\" page, one sees a picture of what looks like a little boy wearing a cap, scarf, and jump suit standing in front of a large window with prominent white curtains and snow falling outside. So what in that picture is the \\"scarf\\"? And to make matters worse, the scarf and cap are identical in color and virtually touching so a young child might think they are one item. Of course a parent could clarify this to the child, but why should a parent have to work at clarifying the shortcomings in this book? Save your money and let this book remain on the bookshelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm.....","review":"Without a complete description or the ability to zoom in on the picture I assumed these were sythetic fiber and that there was a very small thin \\"brush\\" in the kit. The brushes are natural fiber and the fibers break loose very easily. The twisted wire ends are just cut off, not smoothed or deburred, which could lead to scrathes on the inner bores of your equipment. The small very thin \\"brush\\" is actually just a wire. These brushes are all larger than I expected, the \\"toothbrush\\" is about 7.5\\" long (for reference) and the smallest diameter brush is 7/16\\" diameter, a little too big for many of the smaller orifices in most spray equipment.

Upon listening to the samples provided by Amazon.com, I thought I was getting an album that would contain very similar content to the Last Poets: some great politically charged poetry, perhaps accompanied by some funky beats. However, when I listened to the whole CD, I was disappointed to find out that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like \\"Get Out of the Ghetto Blues.\\" If more of the tracks had the sound of the title track, this would be a five-star album, in my opinion. True, Scott-Heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout the album, but not in the form I had hoped for.

This is , maybe, due to the time he lived. Spain was under the dictatorship of Franco.For a whole generation Argenta shown and introduced the great Spanish composers through his emision in the national radio broadcast. Personally I think that Falla has been always his \\"piéce de resistance\\", and this recording is a real proof of it.I find the selection in this cd very interesting and with the bonus of Ana María Iriarte, an elegant singer.My personal favourite is the second cd. El Amor Brujo is a wonderful masterwork. And I think is here where Argenta reveals his great quality. The orchestrations of this work are perfectly reflected in the recording. Although I miss the orquesta Nacional de España the one chosen here is a good one. Its sound is very from the fifties, but is charming anyway.

That doesn't say much for the story.

One small cliched twist at the end does not justify over a thousand pages of reading (Between Night Sins and Guilty as Sin). The shame of it is that there were so many other interesting aspects of the story that could have been wrapped up but were not (vague here so as not to spoil): the role of other significant characters and leads that were developed throughout that led nowhere or were left unexplained. And how did these brilliant perpetrators become so clutzy in the end? On a second point, I don't object to the mixing of romance and thriller but this romance was a copycat of Night Sins with different characters: complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain good","review":"If you're hooked on Hoag and have read Night Sins, you've got to read Guilty as Sin.

Then this book is for you. Beautiful, single, dedicated-to-justice lawyer (of course) battles against her undeniable sexual attraction to ruggedly handsome writer (of course) while also having to face off with slick defense attorney who is also her ex-lover (of course). Not even mentioning suffering from frightening threats to her life (of course) by a sick, mysterious but ingenious criminal (of course) that you can spot as the one who did it when the character is first mentioned at the beginning of the book (of course). But in defense, it's a readable book that will occupy your time while you wait for the bus."},{"rating":"1","title":"600 pages and a cliche on every one","review":"From the main character's general aspect (determined working woman and therefore lonely)to her romancer (suave, painfully handsome, southern scoundrel) to their very dialogue, these 600 pages are simply a heaping pile of cliche! An assistant prosecutor is designated to try the case of a child kidnapper, caught seemingly red-handed -- but the nightmare continues even after he is in custody. As they uncover their clues, the reader has to uncover the story, sifting through the junk heap of improbable chatter, stiff character description, and standard Steele-like love scenes. And it isn't even a mystery which leads you to the conclusion -- instead Hoag pulls a switcheroo. Heavily edited for useful text and characterizations, this 600 pager could become a more reasonable, and probably persuasive, book. But write like we readers have half a brain and want to use it! Don't challenge us to sort through unimaginative text for the story"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Sleep Aid","review":"I have never read anything by Tami Hoag before and I doubt that I will again.This story starts off slow and gets worse quickly.

It might be good if one is having some problems with insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Long-winded Story","review":"It has taken me over 4 weeks to finish this book because the story developed so slow that I often turned a few pages and then went to sleep ! If that is Ms Hoag's writing style, then I will skip her other books. My requirement of crime fictions is simple : the plot should catch the readers' attention and the pace fast. Words should not be wasted on unnecessary details. The storyline which appears on this book's jacket seems intriguing enough, but unfortunately the writer failed to deliver. Two-third of the book should be condensed. It's really annoying to see the same message appearing again and again (over 10 times ?) in the latter half of the book.Last but not the least, romance and crime don't mix. Sidetracks of love-interests will not appeal to those who expect to read a thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, flashy and frightening","review":"I read Dark Paradise which read like a romance novel and I decided to read Guilty as Sin.

In fact, the line-up for this great double disc set is probably one of the best and most versatile I've heard. Tom Coster is a brilliant keyboardist, Graham Lear and Raul Rekow are both top-notch percussionists, and of course Mr. Santana is once again seminal and sublime. The rest of the band fits in really well; no one ever tramples on another performer's playing. A few personal notes: \\"Dance Sister Dance\\" is, simply put, amazing, \\"Black Magic Woman\\" is much stronger now, having been updated from the older version that everybody is familiar with, and the guitar solo/outro in \\"Toussaint L'Overture is still peaking. The bottom line is that Moonflower is perfect, one of a handful of recordings that just keeps progressing and traveling and speaking to the listener with every listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right balance","review":"This is about the only late seventies Santana record that I would recommend because the group struck the right balance to satisfy those fans that dug the rock group and those who liked the jazz-fusion group.

I simply love this album (particularly the 1 CD). Santana shows some brilliant playing from insane overdrive solos on \\"Black Magic Woman\\" to great Jazzy sounds on \\"I'll Be Waiting\\". The final guitar solo on \\"Europe\\" is worth the price of the CD by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carlos at his best as band leader of jazz/rock fusion","review":"from soulful to rockin to downright funky, this one covers a nice little spectrum of Santana tunes and styles.

Only complaint: the plastic clips are a bit awkward when attached to the landing skid and popped off during harder landings. We were lucky to find it in the grass.

The first victims, an interracial couple, die within hours of being brought into Rhea's small emergency room in Dawkins County, South Carolina.But, they aren't the only ones to die and before it's all over, Rhea must use every ounce of her impressive medical talent and survival skills to save her town, her staff and herself from the evil that lurks in the shadows.Hunter keeps getting better.

Claire Sun-ok Choi's delicate and beautiful quilling creations have been combined with potato prints, pressed leaf stationery, seeded-center flower cards, and vegetable kingdom collages that look very sixties (or third-grade, if the truth be told).Many of the cards suggested within this book have bits that will fall out of the envelope when it is opened, or won't even fit into envelopes and will have to be delivered by box.A wedding card included in this book has a zipper sewn between the photographs of the future bride and groom. It could also be used as a divorce announcement by unzipping the zipper.If you'd like to buy a book on quilling, I'd recommend Claire Sun-ok Choi'sArt of Paper Quilling: Designing Handcrafted Gifts and Cards.

Singer/guitarist Darren Rademaker shows himself to be more than a mere '60s California rock disciple on tracks like the rousing \\"Go Ask Yer Dad\\" and the Lou Reed-ish \\"Henry VIII.\\" Other standout tunes include \\"Best Intentions\\" and \\"Crystal Canyons,\\" both of which are dominated by swirling quasi-psychedelic keyboards. The band occasionally missteps: \\"Takes a Lot of Tryin'\\" suffers from an overdose of Santana, while the surfer's paradise of \\"Shortboard City\\" amounts to a Beach Boys novelty tune. Overall, however, this is a fine album that will retain its playability when the summer turns to fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like sunshine!","review":"If you didn't gather it already from the beach-scene art on the cover, or perhaps their name, this CD is like listening to a summer day. Though some of the band hail from the alt-country group Beachwood Sparks, the overall sound is more Cali pop than anything else. The songs are perfectly catchy without being annoyingly so, and Darren Rademaker's voice supports the tracks superbly. It's a good, cohesive album where every track works, although my personal favorite is the opener, \\"A Loner.\\" This is a perfect summer CD, and will also be a good album to perk you up come winter.

So, I paid 23 bucks for sand, had it dumped on the floor, then I vacuumed it up. So not worth it. My kid did have a fun time with it for a short while.

We took the top off a pizza box so that our son could mess around with it without getting this stuff everywhere, and he smartly added drops of water to it to see if he could get it to do something, but now it's just glittery wet sand. Thankfully, he maintains that this water now represents water basins at his magical sand quarry. He's also decided that a dump truck will be coming soon to take it all to the dump.I hadn't planned to write a review, but was on the computer searching to see if there was something we needed to do to the sand to make it malleable, but seeing nothing to remedy this situation, I can rest satisfied that this product is simply worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!!!","review":"This is my one of my best purchases of the year.

You may have recognized it from her work with Mike Shinoda of FORT MINOR, an offshoot of Linkin Park in the popular song WHERE'D YOU GO.Turns out there's more to Holly than just her beautifully nuanced vocals. Her songwriting is melodically superb and lyrically soulful. Her interpretations are both innocent and sophisticated at the same time making for a wonderful duality. Also a multi-instrumentalist and co-producer, Holly is able to bring to fruition what she composes resulting in a stunningly mesmorizing effect.This is a great debut collection which already seems to have hit a nerve with a wide audience.

Her lyrics are heartfelt and compelling, her voice is sweet and yet haunting, and her piano playing is just extraordinary. It's hard to describe what makes this album so great to someone who might also listen to harder music, but it's definitely one of my favorites. This is her first CD and you should definitely give it try. It will grow on you, just sit down and give it a couple listens when you want to hear something different and unique.

Not having the hard copy, I don't know if these errors are in the original publication but names are misspelled throughout as well as common words. These errors are repeated. Words such as intuition, unfortunately, prostitute appear as inmition, unformnately, prostimte, respectively. The architect of the Paris Opera is Charles Garnier but in the book is Gamier. There are many more of these errors.In addition to this, in the Kindle edition, plates are referred to but do not appear. Since this is a book on painting, this is indeed important and a pity that they do not do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded all my expectations","review":"This outstanding book skillfully interweaves social, cultural, and art history into a fascinating story that never drags or dries out. Both enlightening and entertaining, it should appeal to anyone interested in either the period, the place, or the artistic movement with which it concerns itself. I am a pretty picky reader, and while I'll suffer through the odd academic tome in order to increase my knowledge this title was nothing less than a constant pleasure. (Can I say I was sorry to see it end?) Broad in scope and offering heapings of helpful context (much of it suggestions for further reading), 'Judgment of Paris' surpassed all of my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meissonier who?","review":"King chronicles the careers of two French artists, Ernest Meissonier and Edouard Manet, during the late 19th century. Meissonier, the darling of the Paris Salon (the organization that could make or break an artist's career during that time), was the most famous and highest paid painter of the day. In contrast, Manet, heralded as the father of the Impressionist movement, struggled with constant rejection by the Salon as well as the critics. Manet's popularity came later in his career and following his death while Meissonier's work has since faded into obscurity. King gives a fascinating look at the politics and history of the turbulent time period. My only criticism: while the book provided some illustrations of the paintings, there could have been more. King went into great detail about the minute details of many paintings, which was wonderful when the painting was illustrated in the book, but a bit frustrating when it was not. All in all, a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Superb.

Easily read and enjoyed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will give you a whole new perspective on Impressionism","review":"Before I began reading this book I had little interest in impression - mentally it made me think of Monet's \\"Water Lillies\\" and Renoir's scenes of wealthy people socializing - just a little too \\"cute\\" for my taste. However, I've become very interested in the 1800's since reading a few Darwin biographis so I picked this book up on a whim to take on a trip. I am more than halfway through reading it and am fascinated with the political and cultural situation in France in the mid 19th century and how it influence the artists who became known as the impressionists. If you enjoy history at all, and if you particularly enjoy books that give you a complete cultural picture of historical events you will like this. And it might even change your attitude about impressionism."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho hum","review":"was a more a history lesson than a novel .... quit reading half way through... already knew the information wanted more of te personal connection with the artists"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Portrait of an Era","review":"Ross King succeeds in painting his own meticulous portrait of the rise of Impressionism and the tumultuous times which brought it about. I was in the Metropolitan Museum shortly after finishing the book and was stunned at the sight of Messonier's Friedland hanging in a room I'd been through countless times. Although, I'd been through that room so many times before, usually on the way to the Monets, Manets and Degas, I'd never even paid attention to Messonier's painstakingly accurate battlefield painting. It's quite astonishing to look at Messonier's work in contrast to those of his more famous contemporaries in the adjoining rooms, particularly after reading this book and gaining an broader understanding of the history behind them.Although I knew that many of my favorite artists had works that were initially and repeatedly rejected by the Paris Salon, I never knew the hows or whys, and I think that King succeeds in telling the story in a very interesting and compelling way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The judgement of paris","review":"Very interesting segment of art and political French history during late 19th century. Portrays the struggles of the birth of the impressionist style, while empathizing with the earlier classical style. Spiced up with details of the times, quotes, anecdotes and psychological insights. Would recommend to those who like niche histories with intimacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"fine item, but seriously overpriced by the seller","review":"This product is fine, but the seller charges over 2x the price on the manufacturer's website (where the product can also be ordered, incidentally).

I've found this cart to be solid! The wheels are great and the frame is super sturdy and it held together with screws (not plastic fittings like other carts). I roll this cart all around my laundry area in the garage and it is working great. I love the sturdy bags that are supported by the metal grate on the bottom. I am very happy with this laundry cart and anticipate is lasting for many years.Update: Nearly one year later and I still love this cart. It is holding up so well despite the constant wheeling around in my garage. I'm still super-pleased with this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"Best sorter we've ever had. High quality components which combine into a well-built and strong unit.

Have no problem recommending this to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cart for the money!","review":"I did my research and decided to purchase this item due to the amount of positive reviews it has and I am not disappointed! It was very easy to assemble and seems very sturdy. The hanging bar is also very handy and is easy to adjust. The bags seem to be well made and should hold up well over time.

It was very easy to put together. It seems very sturdy and I think it will be a great addition to my laundry room for years to come. The handles to the bags are also very sturdy, one piece metal (I could not see them well from the pic). Some of the reviews that I read before ordering this item stated that the hanging bar was very hard to get up and down. I think that these people may have not pushed the horizontal hanging bar far enough into the plastic connectors which make the vertical bars fall into the base at a weird angle. This would make it really hard to raise and lower. I noticed this potential problem when putting it together and put the vertical bars down into the bigger ones on the base before connecting the plastic pieces that connect it to the horizontal bar. Mine is now very easy to raise and lower. I am very happy with this purchase and its a great item for less than $50 (same price as Costco)."},{"rating":"2","title":"price shot UP !","review":"Costco price $44.99, Seville price $59.99 Amazon the same as Costco.Difference, Costco you can return it if it breaks.

It is well constructed and it is worth the price. I would even buy it at the higher price. We are able to stay on top of our laundry now. The bags holds enough for one large load.

Only thing I wish the bar had a longer pole, so when I am hanging clean clothes, as I wash them, I could keep the dirty ones in bottom of the bag but they touch the dirty ones if I do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This thing is the ingest piece of junk. The hanging bar broke after ONE month. Now, its just my Fiancé and me, so it's not like I was expecting this to support the entire Duggar family's hanging laundry. The plastic snaps that hold the hanging bar in place are cheap, cheap plastic, and both side snaps broke after a month. We used duct tape to secure the side poles & hang bar but after a while, even that wasn't enough and the pole kept sliding down. I eventually got so fed up looking at this waste of the money that I threw out a couple of weeks ago. If you really want a durable solution, buy Metro branded products. They are adjustable, can support up to 500lbs, and have a large variety of add-on components to fit your specific need. I purchased an InterMetro shelf at The Container Store a few months back for my pantry and I LOVE it. I plan to purchase another for our Garage soon. Save your money & don't purchase this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I've only had this together for a few hours but I already love it! It was very easy to put together. My 14 yo son and I put it together in about 15 minutes. It comes with easy to follow directions plus an allen wrench and a bolt tightening wrench so no extra tools are needed. It seems very sturdy. The wheels are NOT plastic which I love and actually thread into the cart rather than be pushed/pounded in like other plastic wheels I've put on. We have 2 laundry shoots and clothes end up piled all over the floor. Now our piles will be sitting in a bag til it's full. An added bonus is that It will help my kids do laundry as they'll know when the bag is full, it's time to throw a load in the machine.ADDITIONAL COMMENT:I've had this a little over a year now and still absolutely love it. It's a nice looking, sturdy piece and it does exactly what it's supposed to do.

One is as pictured, the other has a hanging bar about 5 feet high. Strangely enough, when I ordered the unit shown from the Seville Classics, they sent the unit with the hanging bar. I called them, and they told me that this was the only type they currently have in stock. They were pleasant and easy to deal with, and I was able to return the unit with no charges for shipping.I just received the unit I wanted from another marketplace seller. It is well designed, easy to assemble, and overall a good deal. It is solidly built, by home use standards, but it wouldn't hold up to abuse in a commercial laundromat. If you can keep your kids from giving each other rides down the hall in it, it should last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you don't need to hang anything wet!","review":"I purchased this laundry cart about 6 months ago. At first, all was well. It seemed like a solidly built cart, however, after about 2 months, all of the plastic fittings on the hanging bar started to crack and break and now the bar will not stay in the \\"up\\" position even with hardly ANY weight on it. It wont even hold dry clothes. I am now using garage spring clamps to hold it up.

The wheels are sturdy and smooth rolling, and the hanging bar makes it easy to quickly hang my clothes up while in the laundry room. The directions were clear, and I assembled it easily (although I am pretty handy at assembling things). The only con that I can think of is the size. Make sure you have a spot picked out for this-- it's not something that will fit in most bathrooms... But I like that it fits three large loads of laundry.The one star is taken off for the value: I was disappointed to discover that I paid over $20 more than it is now listed, and I purchased this item less than two months ago (ordered July 17, 2011)!

If you see yourself moving it a lot, this may not be a good cart to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I've wanted a sturdy laundry sorter with a hanging rack for quite some time, and I purchased this after reading many good reviews. I'm very happy with my purchase. It was easy to put together-it took me about 15 minutes. It's very sturdy, from the strong casters, the heavy frame and the sturdy canvas laundry bags. Well made. The grid shelf under the bags supports heavy loads of laundry.I use the hanging rack daily and love the fact is adjustable.This fits quite nicely in my small laundry room. I use it for sorting laundry for my family of six. I only wish my room was large enough to fit another one of these units.

I almost feel like I am going to break them when I try to lock them. Finally I decided to just have my Husband lock the bar in the up position and leave it there. While it was a good thought to have an adjustable bar, it just doesn't work out that well because of the locks.Other than that issue, I would still recommend this to anyone. I love mine and am glad that we got it.The bags are a sturdy canvas that expand to hold lots of clothes, the bars that hold the bags are heavy duty with rubber edges, and the grate on the bottom allows this unit to roll easily and not drag the bags on the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laundry Basket","review":"This is a great, your clothes are separated and ready for washday.

I'm thinking about getting another one too for others in my household as the top bar is great for drying clothes and pre sorting your clothes as you use them, more of a time saver/convenience than I thought it could ever be and the bags are much easier to carry around than bulky baskets.

This collection of letters is quite intriguing, and we certaintly can not discredit it as the letters come from real troops with real concerns. I must fault this book, however, because the book clearly does not give a complete picture of the sentiments of our troops. In a time when we really need to reconcile the differences between \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\", or liberal and conservative, this selection of letters does little for that goal. A more accurate representation of the letters Moore recieved, with both sides of the argument, would have made this a far more useful read. Overall I would say read this book for what it is, a selection of letters from disenchanted troops, and try not to let it's clearly liberal leanings boil your blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Moore AND Annenberg","review":"Mark in Memphis, you might want to check the Annenberg site again: \\"October 16, 2004.

The good part about it is that it is not full of lies because they are real letters from real people. It was a wonderful idea for Michael Moore to post real letters, so people know how people really do feel about certain current events. Basicaly this book has letters that people have writen commenting about the war in Iraq. And many of the letters are very touching. They will make you cry if you are sensative. This is because the stories that are told about true experiences with terror are simply teriffying. This book was writen by a true patriot. Michael Moore doesn't bow down to the pressures of an unjust society. Proving this, he has writen a truly patriotic book. I give it five stars because it got me interested and happy, it also really got me thnking more clearly about the world around me. It could be though that it just appeals to me because I am a Liberal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you take away 2 more stars?","review":"Wow, it's a book from a spiteful and arrogant lib.

The first page of this book discusses Baqubah...Yes, Baqubah was scary and bad...but how would Michael Moore know. He's not in Iraq, never will be. He's too big a target. I ain't bagging on him about his political views either...at least Al Frankin and Henry Rollins can do POSITIVE things for our troops.

To begin with, my husband, siblings and many friends of my family is serving in Iraq, have recently returned or on their way back. Where is the voice of the ones that agree with the cause? (I know over fifty Marines, Airmen and Soldiers that find Moore offensive and despicable. One Navy Officer friend of mine wrote him a letter of condemnation, where is this?) I question the validity of the majority of these letters.

This man is AGAIN exploiting emotion in order to make money. Moore now has about 5 or 6 products on the market about this topic and he is getting rich off of every single one. He is quoting U.S. Army men and women, and reading from these letters in his cross country tour, but what he is not saying is that the average price for him to speak at one of these engagements is $30,000 plus expenses,(look it up).

What happened to all the \\"other\\" letters from military men & women who support and love their country? Conveniently left out? This is the type of propaganda which causes not only simple minded Americans, but uneducated and un-knowledgeable foreigners to think negatively about America and our way of life.

It contained letters from soliders in Iraq and family member of these soliders. As a military spouse myself, I was especially moved by these soliders and families words. Whether you love Moore or hate him, he speaks his mind and you have to respect that. In our overly PC world there are not a lot of people who voice views that may be unpopular with the world. This is an amazing book and it is full of the views we should listen to: our soliders. I read a review that said basically our soliders shouldn't have opinions they should just do their job. Obviously that person has never loved a solider.

Without more additional commentary or more that a few pages by him, his name on the book feels like corporate shilling.As a fan of Moore's political position, I find people dismissal of things like this stupid. Sure it's biased and one sided. So's Fox news. Or are we to beleive that lack of vocal opposition to the war on US news to mean everyone supports it.

Thank you Michael."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Not Effective.","review":"This book isn't effective for the pure reason that it represents less than one one-thousandth of a percentage of the United States military. For all we know, bags of letters could have been written to Moore supporting the war, outraged at him for embarrassing the country, asking him why he doesn't care about Democracy for the Iraqi people, but that would nullify his argument.On Overstock.com, \\"most people\\" who bought this book also bought a Titan Scooter, but that's probably not representative of his book buyers either.Patriots don't lie.2 stars for the original idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic return to the originals of country music, awesome","review":"This CD gives one the chance to step back in time to the originals of country music. Although the background is a bit 'raspy\\" the feeling comes through.The pliantive vocals harkened me back to my childhood in the fifties. It brought back memories of Hank Williams, Kitty Wells, Ernest Tubbs and Red Sovine etc. Although, the original Carters were much earlier than the fifties, the music has much of the plaintive quality of the country music of the fifties. This is country music with all the feeling with little adornment. You can almost feel the sadness and bitterness when you listen to the music.This album bears little resemblance to the \\"syrupy\\" country music of today.

They should rerelease this and use a British narrator or find someone who knows how to put one on and another thing is that this book has been extremely abridged on this tape, it is only one tape and approximately ninety minutes so though I love listening to audiobooks I also love to read and I would recommend you buy paperback or hardcover editions instead so you will get the full story.

If you still remember your high school Biology, you'll remember that amino acids were defined as \\"the building blocks of life.\\"I started learning about their power for healing the body about two years ago, when I was trying to help my husband recover from a bout of crippling fatigue. Amino acids are components of protein and their targeted use can do amazing things for the body. You'll learn about l-carnitine, l-tryptophan, l-tyrosine & many others that can help you live a healthier, happier life in our high-stress modern world (filled with processed foods & unbalanced amino acid profiles).The book is very detailed without being overly technical.

This is not what I expected. I would never have purchased it had I known.I have to wonder if the older versions of the book had more information. I'm sure not going to waste more money finding out.

I quickly discovered that these authors compiled around the topic of sins is a great way to see inside these writers styles and appraoch to a similar idea.

I thought the storytelling was rather intelligent, I'll certainly watch this film again to catch what I missed the first time.

Nancy's a wee bit too perfect for the adult me: She somehow always knows the right thing to do. But the kid me didn't notice that, and would have given the book 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS PLEASE !!!!","review":"I rated this one star even though I haven't read it I just wanted to get your attention. have you read these other peoples reviews the \\"1 star\\"ones ? well they are saying about wanting a nicer covers on the front, I mean pathetic so if they dont have a nice cover ? get over it and dont juge a book by its cover !!!! and if the text is changed good because I'll understand it better than old fashioned stuff !!!!

One of the books I started out with was this one.In the introduction one will find a crash course in beginning the quilt, types of materials to use, fabric cutting, sewing, setting, blocking and finishing the quilt, as well as preparation of the top, quilting and binding.The things I liked were the full size templates, color charts, and easy to follow directions. Not to mention it precisely telling you how much of each fabric is needed.This book is simple enough for the beginner, yet challenging enough for the avid quilter. I'd recommend it without any qualms."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Passage...","review":"I came to know the work of Christine Jerome as a gift from her late husband John. For years John Jerome has been one of my favorite authors. While not, unfortunately, widely read; he remained true to his own voice. In many of his books he mentions his wife Chris, and with John gone I felt compelled to get to know Chris better, through her work. I am so glad I did. This is a fine, wonderful book. I hope to see more from Christine Jerome. Perhaps a biography of John."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best honkey-tonk album ever","review":"This album features some of the best writing, both musically and lyrically, in country music today.

I purchased the product and it comes fully assembled and the cups are clear. I have purchased other products from this company as well. They have great customer service and great products. I use this on my craft table and it holds all sorts of scrapbook embelishments. I love how it puts it all in one spot with easy access."},{"rating":"2","title":"I adore this camera","review":"It's fast, small and cool-looking. My husband has a high end digital camera that I like but this one is much faster and also takes good pictures. Digital cameras are improving!Yeah, it does eat battery power, but only if you keep it turned on. I've only had it for a few weeks but have taken it to four gatherings and on a ski trip with no problems except for one time when I let my nephew play with it for a half hour without turning it off. I've already got in the habit of recharging it the evening after I use it so it's ready for next time.I'm only so-so when it comes to understanding how to use high tech stuff, but I was able to figure out the features of this camera pretty easily. Except for the red-eye reduction. It took me a bit of manual study to figure out how to turn it on. (Push the arrow up.)I love the design, too, and so far I love the pictures. And it's just incredibly nice to carry around and pull out and snap pictures with. Makes me giddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little camera!","review":"I've been waiting around for a couple of years, trying to convince myself that I really needed a digital camera. I'm glad I finally jumped in with this little gem. This camera makes vacation photography fun again! I was looking for a small camera, but one that would hold up and do some video. I read all the reviews and will admit that I was hesitant, particularly about the memory and battery life. But what I liked out-weighed the negatives, and I am thrilled with my decision. The first thing I did was go out and purchase a larger memory card, which is really necessary. The camera comes with 16 mgs, not nearly enough for photos, let alone video. But with more memory, the thing is perfect for me! I should add that if you really want to enjoy digital photography and don't really want to climb the learning curve, buy a Mac, sit back and have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in This Book","review":"This book was sad and depressing! I LOVED the first and second Aunt Dimity books (Aunt Dimity's Death and Aunt Dimity and The Duke) and enjoyed the third book, but I really disliked the tone and topic of this book. Cozy mysteries usually make me feel happy, but this was depressing. I prefer lighter topics that end happily. I wish that I had just skipped this book in the series. Frankly, I haven't read the later books, because this one left me feeling unhappy about the series. However, I do plan to read the later books. I so loved the early books and I'm hoping that this was just an aberration in an otherwise fun and happy series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet cozy","review":"Who walks among us and changes us in inexplicable ways? Lori Shepherd is unaware that the question exists, but soon that simple query will haunt her every thought until she attains answers. Lori fully focuses on the upcoming Christmas holiday that she plans to celebrate in the same manner as when she was a child. She desperately wants her first Yuletide season in Aunt Dimity's Finch, England cottage to the best ever for her beloved family.This novel is not a typical cozy mystery in the strictest definition of the sub-genre. However, the quest of the two individuals to learn what they can about the mysterious stranger provides readers with all the basic elements of an investigative tale. As Lori peels one layer away, new questions surface. However, in the end, without saying one word, Kit teaches her the true meaning of Christmas. AUNT DIMITY'S CHRISTMAS is a strange, but special tale that warms the souls of those who read it.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aunt Dimity","review":"A delightful, light, airy read. The language is wonderful. The characters a delight. No blood, guts, and gore.... just pure fun and enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and Full of Joy!","review":"Aunt Dimity's Christmas is a touching heart wrenching story. We are back at the little cottage with Lori, the boys, and her family when a homeless man shows up outside during a snowy night. The homeless man is nearly dead, wasting away and almost frozen. Lori is in the middle of planning the best holiday of all time, mostly like she thinks a Christmas should be, when this interruption brings her back on track to what the true meaning of Christmas is. I cried; I laughed; I loved the story and the point. It made me re-think how we celebrate Christmas and question where my money should be going."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Setting - is it the 1960s or the 1990s?","review":"This is the first Aunt Dimity book I have read. It's very nice but the setting confuses me. In the story, Lori, a mother of nine-month old twins, states that her father died in WWII when she was just a few months old. When a comatose man is discovered outside her English cottage, she becomes involved with his past. For help she turns to the Rev. Julian Bright, who oversees a soup kitchen in a shelter for the homeless. One of the first things he says to Lori is \\"Don't worry I am not a homosexual.\\" This is a 1990s phrase so that makes me think the setting is now. She also states that she has a cell phone, another current item. What confuses me is that if this is a contemporary setting, that would make her in her late 50s, and she is the mother of nine month old twins? Maybe she adopted them. The story would be more enjoyable for me if the time setting were clearer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initially delightful series now losing its spark","review":"I really enjoyed the first couple of Aunt Dimity mysteries, but this one left me feeling that the series is starting to wear a little thin: will Lori perpetually end up lusting after handsome strangers and completely forgetting about the existence of her husband Bill? It strikes a big sour note in the books' otherwise cozy/comforting world. And now she's also forgetting about the existence of their two baby sons for chapter after chapter -- and giving away almost all the boys' Christmas gifts at the end of the book, to boot (it's meant to seem charitable, but to me it seemed more like Joan Crawford/Mommie Dearest). For a protagonist who's intended to be sympathetic and appealing, she's beginning to seem pretty annoying and unsympathetic -- and since these mysteries are fun mainly because everyone in them is so nice and unthreatening, this book isn't as enjoyable as the earlier ones in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuddle up with some cocoa and this book.","review":"Lori and Bill and the babies are back, this time rescuing a beautiful stranger Lori finds in the cold. We get our usual dose of Aunt Dimity wisdom, both about the stranger and Lori's life, with a Christmas message thrown in. Also, if it's not too much of a spoiler, Finch gets a new regular. A great gift for a cozy lover.Let's face it, no one is going to award Ms. Atherton the Nobel Prize for Literature. Any potential plot problems are summarily dealth with in advice from beyond, so things never get too complex or challenging. Good always wins out and Lori always goes back to Bill and you know that's what's going to happen when you pick up one of these books. That's more than OK with me -- it's just perfect. If I want a world that isn't fair, I can just look out the window. If I want enjoyment, a little encouragement, and a happy ending, I read Aunt Dimity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"The battery works fine, the only thing I don't like about it is that it's silver color and does not match with my Canon Optura 30.

But I suggest you should not believe it will last equal to or longer than the one that comes with the camera originally. Expect 80% the capacity for 10% of the price of the OEM battery.

But if you examine the photo of the product closely, the packaging says it's NOT 1000 ma-H, but 800 ma-H.

Tried it, let it charge all night, next morning tried it in camera, still dead. Sent it back. Received a replacement battery in February.

They may not hold up for very long at the preschool as the spoons do bend quite easily (I think this is the \\"adjusting for sound\\" another reviewer talks about), but there are several ways to make music with the spoons: palm, leg, floor, seat or other soft surface, as well as pinching the spoons together rather than using the handle. It's pretty easy for my 3-year-old to create noise with the spoons, though how close it comes to music, I won't make any guesses.

Some of the events examined, such as Stonehenge and the pyramids, didn't provide that much new information but seemed simply to end up confirming knowledge that many people already know or would with basic research. But other points in history, such as the death of Napolean or the possibility of the Chinese discovering America, was completely new and extremely interesting.

Flamme is now the second best performance on my list, I prefer extraordinary Marie-Madeleine Duruflé-Chevalier on Erato as unsurpassable - she has some shortnesses but enourmous energy, mystiscm and profound understanding of the work.

The CPO recording is very good in CD sound and excellent in SACD sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"I agree they could have elaborated more the relationship but the movie is simply charming, delightful i think it's a little bit weird to find this kind of movies and this is well done one you should see the characters they connect from the beginning and you can the chemistry between them it's a lovely movie simplye adorable i really liked it a lot"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Awesome!","review":"I love that this was a mainstream movie with a lesbian romance in the center of it all.

All the familiar conflicts and characters are here, and there's not much depth. How did they fall so much in love even before they talked to eachother? Anyway, that can be overlooked as usual in this kind of movies. The acting is superb by the whole cast and the little subplot with the parents is a nice addition to the main plot. The film should please fans of romantic comedies, both gay and straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable and definately catchy tunes","review":"wow - didn't expect to like this one as much.

Well, no! Piper Perabo just isn't a good actress. I mean she tries and you can tell, but she just stinks! She pouts the entire way through the film and is put in obsurd situations, the only time she doesn't pout to convey the point 'she's truly found herself' is at the very end!

Great choice for those really wanting to focus on love and romance.It isn't my style to root for a romance that starts off with adultry, but it is practically impossible not to root for the leads here. I wish it was on Blu Ray, but that's ok. Where would the conflict have been if she'd just called the wedding off and listened to instincts we in this modern world are taught all to often to ignore.I just had to review, before I get it, since I've seen this multiple times already and because I'm appalled it is rated R. This is PG material. You'll find far more objectionable content in terms of sex and violence masquerading under PG on TV, than this. Hideous double standard. If you're looking for smut, you might be disappointed, or the movie will be so good, it won't matter"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at first sight","review":"This is a sweet, light hearted, feel good film about falling in love at \\"love first sight\\". The problem comes into play when this happens at the wedding when the bride locks eys with a stranger, a woman while walking up the aisle. An instant connection and bond is formed. This brief moment sets the scene for the rest of the movie, each woman trying to see more of each other. A love triagle of three always means someone eventually has to get hurt and this holds true.

I'm a little disappointed. I didn't like the movie, not because it is a lesbian movie. If you call falling in love with someone else (love at first site) on your own wedding day is romantic, then this is the movie you should watch.

I am not gay and the \\"reviews stated\\" that it was a great movie, even if you were not gay...and that it was a great love story worth watching. I found myself still cheering for the husband and wife to reunite and it did not have a \\"happy ending for everyone\\" as the reviews stated.

The 'bad guys' were endearingly 'good' after all, and their journey through crime was a fun ride for me as well. The tongue-in-cheek account of the world of charitable organizations I found particularly funny. A special surprise for me was the rendition of Amazing Grace included in the film.

When I tried this set-up without the anti-sway bar the jet ski trailer was extremely prone to sway at any speed over 40 mph. After I purchased the anti-sway bar, I can travel 50+ before I have to worry much about sway.It is somewhat a pain to have the extra ball welded to your hitch, but it is a necessary pain. Once it is installed it does a good job in reducing trailer sway. It seems to be a great product at a very reasonable cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!","review":"This item was installed and the ball torqued as per manufacturer's specifications: with the factory tension on the slide bar the front ball broke during a normal turn onto the street.

Also the hieght of the trailer frame was smaller than the base plate holes so it would not have fitted anyway. Amazon SUCKS in that although the parts made by the same manufacturer did not work together as advertised, Amazon did not care and when I returned it I only got 50% of my money back.

In the last 4 months I have gone thru 3 pairs of jeans. They did away with the french seam on the inside of the leg wrong choicethat is the one area on women that wears out first. The french seams makes for a stronger and longer lasting seam. But because the material is so thin any real stress and the material splits in a way that cannot be repaired other than an iron on patch.Needless to say that they have lost me as a customer and will now go back to wranglers.

The waist is high (higher than my preference) but tolerable. By far their biggest problem is that the jeans material is thin and easily tears.

I have several pairs and love them. I do have a couple of complaints though. First, lack of colors. Either a dark or light version of blue jean, not that is bad, but having some other options would be nice. Second, do not make the mistake I made and grab the belt loops on the sides to pull them up...the loop may pull out a chunk of pants! These seem to be made in various locations, although i don't think one is better than the other. These jeans do stretch, and will get a little baggy though the day..But I still love them.

I'm about a quarter of the way into it and am totally bored. I saw the ad in a magazine and it sounded interesting. The details she gives in some parts are just not needed as someone else stated.

The facts of her story are certainly interesting, but Carter's observations of her own fate are removed and somewhat clinical, rather than compelling and empathetic. Her story weaves back and forth between her childhood, young adulthood and careerhood in a poorly structured manner that is confusing to the reader and does the story no favors.

And it is with a woman. The three of them deal with the situation in very different ways. When they find out their mother has given her new girlfriend a large sum of money, they assume that the new girlfriend is a gold-digger and they plan to break them up. What ensues is a series of hilarious and revealing scenes about hot each woman deals with their mother's sexuality, and their own. Very good and interesting movie. I especially liked Rosa Maria Sarda and Leonor Watling in this movie.I have a different version from the one in this listing. It has a different cover and no Special Features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The lesbians have absolutely no chemistry (although to be fair, despite the title, the movie is about middle daughter Elvira and her impending twentysomething crisis). The actions of the daughters in trying to break them up are actually quite vile, when you think about it, but are sugared with a Almodomar-esque brightness and sweetness. Conventional Hollywood ending.

A total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good reference, but not a modern text","review":"If you want a good grammar reference, this is the book. However, the text is old. There are several vocabulary items that reveal the original age in which the course was written (1882). For example, in the travel chapter, it has the Spanish word el vapor, steamship. Hey, we don't even call them by that term in English!Also, the pronunciation guide is for the Madrid dialect only, with no variation for Latin America.

The motor works, but I can't get suction into the inlet tube. The basket that holds the carbon media is very poorly designed; it opens easily, spilling the charcoal out into the canister (where it doesn't belong). I did solve that by using 2 rubber bands to hold it in place. There is also a \\"rigid core\\" that fits inside the basket; my wife accidently threw it out after the basket opened when she had to clean it (I can see how it would happen). I reordered a replacement, and it was several WEEKS before it shipped. Overall, I have not had a very good experience with this filter, although if I could get the $@#% thing to work, I might form a different opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will eat your wallet","review":"Bought two of these for a turtle pond, and completely regret it.

Thanks Richard.Written by my husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"SR-71 Politics Revealed","review":"This author had an agenda, and he doesn't hide it. It seems he wrote the whole book just to fill for the later chapters where he puts forward his agenda and whines on how the program was unfairly terminated and how they didn't deserve to have their little toy taken from them.The book has virtually nothing in terms of technical or developmental aspects on the plane and fills an entire chapter with detail such as how to operate the engine's doors which is quite irrelevant since that's pretty much the ONLY technical aspect we get to see in the book. NOTHING on how the plane flew, how it was designed or its history. Pretty short on anecdotes too.Overall left a lot to be desired, and quite boring to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to know about something always ask an expert!","review":"In life, if you need information, or want to know honest and real information on something, then ask an expert. And few can talk about the SR-71 with the credentials of Rich Graham! Not only was Rich an operational pilot of the Blackbird, he was an SR-71 Instructor, Squadron Commander, Director of the Program at the Pentagon, and Wing Commander.So few know what he does. His stories are very readable, he manages to mix facts with humour and technical information. Plus he has gathered some trusted friends to tell real life stories of the aircraft, the crews, and the way it operated.If you are a fan of the SR-71 like me, and want to know more, then this is one of the books YOU MUST OWN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the humor value","review":"This book is more humorous than it is useful. Those looking for actual useful advice should look elsewhere. However as a light, quick read for the humor, it's good. It's not that the book is wrong; actually many of the tips and experiences are far too real. It just doesn't give any really practical advice on what to do about it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric at best","review":"Bought this as a gag gift for a recently divorced friend. It achieved its purpose. It comes across as a gag...maybe that was the author's idea. Written for the anti-social shy, petrified dork who has no chance with women. Maybe even more so after reading this book. It shares the occasional morsels of truth, but for the most part is written tongue in cheek. This book came out way before all the great PUA titles. Perhaps in its day it was a prize. If you find Mystery Method, et al to be too much to stomach, than give this one a try. Or maybe send it to a friend to make him feel hopeless.

The series of visits to California, UK, Bohemia, Germany, Belgium, and Holland provide the viewer first hand knowledge of legendary breweries and the beers that made them famous. You really want to go to these places and experience the brews first hand. What makes this video important is that you as an individual can not go to these places and meet the brewmeisters without special permission. Mr. Jackson gives you Cart Blanc and knows the right questions to ask to solicit a knowledgable answer. The video is witty and is best viewed with a Chimay or Maibock in hand, sipping quietly, as the pictures roll by. I anticipate more adventures from Mr. Jackson, and hopefully soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointment big time","review":"Bought this for two reasons. The good reviews it had and I wanted fresh water fish instead of Goldfish.I was completely disappointed. Fish are all drab silver in color, their swimming is very mechanical. Overall the underwater scene is the most boring ever and completely drab. For a little dose of horrible \\"realistic\\" movements, select the frog.I will now be very happy to go back to my Goldfish aquarium. The colors were so vibrant, the whole fish tank was more realistic than an actual fish tank. Bubbles, movements, water shadows were are superb. I was looking for all of this with this program but it is completely boring and drab to the nth degree. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was kinda blah...","review":"Didn't care much for it, found it boring... but for the price I guess you can't complain much.

A surround sound setup would definitely have been much cooler and the inane dual commentary is mostly annoying (but the nature of it is 100% Tool). For $7, I'm happy I purchased it.

I own salival and the parabol dvd, and am ordering this schism dvd. No, i'm not one of those guys who dress in all black, I just recongnize incredibly good music.

This is only one track and not worth it. This is a good song off an album that is loosing it's zip. The video is a standard tool video, claymation and bizarre images. However, other than the first track, the rest is just a waste of time and money. The audio comentary is not funny, and makes tool look like fools (but with a some of my money, and me feeling used.) The bonus remix is nothing but an extension 8 minutes of ambient noise before the same song. If you want real trance like meditation like music, listen to Neurosis, they have been doing this for 15 years and are a lot better at it. Tool better have a heck of a next album to dig themselves out of this embarassment. The only reason I don't give this a 1 is that I do like the packaging, and the video is nice to add to Salival in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Material, Probably worth the money","review":"Hey Jake Cambell, I am a college educated, staunch republican, and I my favorite band of all time is Tool.

Hip deep in trashy underage girls, drinking champane, and shining his fronts with his index finger using the reflection from one of his platinum records.

Presuming it allows for as many recharge cycles, an excellent buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery schmattery","review":"I had high hopes for this battery for my Nikon camera. It promised more MAH than the OEM battery that came with the camera. Unfortunately, it must be leaking electrons all over the place, since a charge in this model does not compare to the original. I would guess that the charge lasts half the life of the original Nikon battery. The price was cheap and you get what you pay for. If you are going to purchase this one, get two since you'll need to keep one charging while using the other.

It won't hold much of a charge any longer, yet the OEM battery is still going strong. So for five years (it actually was dying about a year & a half ago), that's not bad, but considering I have other rechargeable batteries that are much older (and the OEM's long life), it's not that great. But still a good battery.I would buy another one, if I can't find the OEM battery, if only because I can't find the OEM battery. Just thought I'd add my long term use of this battery to those who would be interested.

In my mind, that meant a place to get ideas for contemporary home improvements, as well as a means to make them actually happen. I envisioned a book that showed a photo of a (kitchen, floor, bathroom, some tile, etc.), discuss the actual materials used in EACH setting, and where possible, where they can be found. While there are a few basic references of this type, the bulk of the book gives the name of whatever architect contributed to each setting and then describes the shot in great detail, yet with hardly any information about what's IN it. In addition, many of the pictures are too small/shot too close up/at odd angles to get a lot out of them. I'm sorry, but I did not find this book helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expectation vs product","review":"The book is more of a catalogue than an architectural publication. It certainly contains lots of contemporary details, but these are often displayed lacking context. I believe this book was published to help architects in their everyday practice, but don't we have enough commercial material these days?What I was looking for was an album showing contemporary interior design case studies, focusing on details. What I found was another market offer, except published in a hardcover. However, there are some interesting photos in a book, and if you are looking for a tool that could improve communication between designers and their customers it is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary Details 1992 ed","review":"I got my hands on a used 1992 edition.

The story is very interesting and moves along at a good pace. I like historical fiction, in fact it is probably my favorite genre, and this also has a bit or romance in it as well. I saw the \\"hook up\\" coming a mile away (I'm skilled at noticing these things by now I guess), but it was engaging and a good read. It seems like the author has two more books in a similar vain, and I'll probably end up checking those out as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another take on a familiar tale","review":"Yet one more Anne Boleyn book. This one's somewhere in the middle of the pack, taking a different look at the story through one of Anne's servants. Considering how this is the story of Henry's obsession with Anne, it's funny that all the sex seems to happen off stage, like a 50s film. On the other hand, this does away with the graphic scenes that writers like Philipha Gregory like to include, so I would safely reccommend this version of the story to younger readers.

Often driven to tears by the capricious royal moods, Frances suffers the good as ill with as much grace as possible. Even her own marriage lies under the cloud of the court.** It is difficult to define a true plotline in this story. Frances does provide a different sort of look at one of the most infamous love affairs of history. However, her own story is somewhat distracting from the more interesting royal one. **Amanda Killgore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Readers Beware!!","review":"I enjoyed the first Laurien Gardner book,and bought this one right away, expecting the same quality historical read.

I couldn't figure it out, until I read on a readers board that the books are written by different writers and the name LAUREN GARDNER is a HOAX.Maybe this isn't so bad as the James Fry books, but still if readers buy a book with a certain writers name on it, they deserve to get a book by that writer, not someone else. It's a FRAUD and it's not fair to readers.I will think twice about buying a LAUREN GARDNER book again.

He gagged at most of the idea's presented in the book. I did think the book had a few interesting basic ideas, that with some creative thought and know - how could become more suitable decorations. I don't think many people would create exact replicas of the decorations in the book because most of them are a little out-dated and almost any groom would turn their nose up at them. I think just flipping through it in a book store is enough, in fact I never used my copy of the book. If your looking to make your own wedding decorations I suggest buying an actual craft leaflets (like The Complete Wedding Floral Book, by Leisure Arts) which you can get at your local craft store.

Something about Gus touched me and when the river king was discovered I was devastated. So much so that I skipped ahead in the book to see what had truly happened. At that point I put the book on the shelf and left it there for over a week.Thinking surely that justice would prevail I went back only to be disappointed. The magic of Alice Hoffman could not overcome the cruelty Gus endured. Nothing about the book could overshadow the hazing that took the life of a teenager struggling as so many do through that period of their life.Maybe Ms. Hoffman wanted to shock, if so she succeeded, but this time I was disappointed more than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"She wrote this one for Hollywood","review":"This book is Practical Magic part two.....complete with roses, thorns, frogs and a dead guy. No originality! That is my first complaint! But if you loved Practical Magic, and want to read it again, then this is the book for you!Second, the main character is 15....yet acts as if she is a college freshman. Smoking, sex....all of it....the fact that this is a high school, and we are talking about a bunch of 14 and 15 year olds just doesn't fit the story. I know that high school students do these things, but the WHOLE SCHOOL?Third, there is not as much conflict between the townies and the prep school kids as you would think from the book jacket.Finally, this book is so predictable. I think Hoffman wrote this book so that Hollywood could cut her a big fat check for the screenplay. \\"The River King\\" starring Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Elijah Wood. Coming to theaters this summer. No thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another must-read by Hoffman","review":"Haddon Prep is a private school with, sadly, typical teenagers. Haddon Town is a washed-up forgotten place with lonely people.

Even dead ones. Hoffman proves once again that she is one of our greatest writers today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delighted First Time Reader","review":"I recently rented the movie \\"The River King\\". I was disappointed in its many barely explored sub-plots. However, the overall story had my attention, and I had the impression that the book would be wonderful. (Aren't books always better, anyway?) I was not disappointed.The River King is an insightful look at outsiders trying to survive in an insider's world. One does not survive, but his soul lingers on, as does his best friend's guilt, and the local police officer's determination to understand his death at all costs. A theme of self preservation, guilt, and perserverence touches each of these characters, making this an artful story.I am glad that a mediocre movie turned me on to a wonderful writer. I can't wait to read more of Hoffman's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"I've read and greatly enjoyed many of Hoffman's other novels, but here I found one plot point impossible to get past. A boy sporting virtually every one of the signs of a Youth in Crisis, (in a black trench coat, no less!), comes forward to report abuse and nobody takes him seriously? After Columbine? This was hard to swallow.As for the rest, the descriptions (as usual) were beautiful, but there were just too many characters whose stories weren't woven together enough for me to sustain interest in them. Keeping the focus on Betsy Chase, Abel or Carlin might have helped. As it is, Elizabeth George's mystery \\"Well Schooled in Murder,\\" tells a very similiar story and does it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe she's a great writer, but...","review":"I'm unfamiliar with Alice Hoffman's other work, but if this book is indicative of her talent, I'm inclined to remain that way. I have a tendency to continue reading books I dislike, just because I don't like to quit things halfway through, so I kept on reading well past the point I had begun to wonder \\"why am I reading this?\\". The plot is as worn as an old shoe and the reader must continually endure schmaltzy references to the \\"mysterious wafting scent of roses\\" indicating - what? A ghostly indication of the character's victimhood? As if we didn't recognize this on our own? The characters seem to have been ripped straight out of a melodrama, complete with fainting spells and evil sneers. And the ending is just halfhearted. There's sure to be a movie, where at least the only wafting odor will be that of popcorn."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deeply moving novel that has a sorrowful tone","review":"I bought this book on instinct after reading the plot summary and I was not dissapointed. I have read other books by Alice Hoffman and I thought this was probably one of her best.Actually, this books is quite sad and the mood throughout is very melancholy. In most cases a sad book is not always enjoyable, however, I was deeply moved and at times I was on the verge of tears.I must say that I found similarities between The River King and the novel \\"The Secret History\\" by Donna Tarrt. Both are based around a small elite college campus that have beautiful houses and mysterious going-ons. I highly reccomend reading Donna Tarrt's novel as well if you enjoy The River King.Overall I found the book to be enjoyable and magical even with its sad plot and melancholy characters. I finished reading this book in one evening because I simply could not put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Magical Realism","review":"A story told in the writing style of magical realism about love lost and love found. Highly imaginative and unusual. It is those qualities of the novel that kept me reading. Hoffman relies heavily on allusions to nature, weaving a web of mystery and suspense where every truth lies below a shimmering surface. Set in a riverside college town, the residents and students can't seem to come to grips with each other until a drowned boy makes them confront the truth behind each of their lives.If you enjoyed Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, you will likely enjoy this book too."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Brilliant Word Art by Hoffman","review":"She does it again, she's a genius. This book is excellent, until the end where the writing gets a bit loose and hurried. Overall it is excellent. It's easy to identify with the characters, because she makes them so real. When I put down this book for a moment I kept thinking there was something that I was supposed to be doing or someone waiting...and yet...It was only the book calling me back. I like it when I fall into a book like I do Hoffman's. This is not her best...Turtle Moon may be...still excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"riveting and absorbing","review":"I could not put down this book!!!! The characters were exquisitely developed and the plot was so riveting that I couldn't stop reading it. When I finished the book, I read it over again. It was as fantastic the second time. Ms. Hoffman is a truly gifted writer, with a voice all her own. This book is a MUST. It won't let you down--"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've been a fan of Alice Hoffman's for several years, having read and enjoyed almost all of her books. However, I didn't like *The River King* because (1) the magical realism was too heavy-handed and (2) there were too many false details, such as a character wandering around in the country looking at Joe Pye weed blooming in the Spring, or some such silliness. Just as I would begin to get lost in the narrative, some errant detail would bring me back to the realization that I could not willingly suspend my disbelief. I gave up on this novel about one hundred pages into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I had a hard time getting through this. I will usually give any book a good long time to kick in and hook my interest, but The River King just never did. Worse, it bored me to tears....when it didn't have me squinting at the pages, saying, \\"What?\\" To put it succinctly, this was one of the most bizarre and puzzling books I have ever read. The characters practically define the term \\"one-dimensional\\"; I never understood or cared about any of them - once I figured out who they were in relation to one another that is. They did not fit, alone or together with one another. As a matter of fact, everything in this book, from the plot (or lack of one) to the setting, from the dialog to the development was jerky, disjointed and malformed. What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wished I waited for the used paperback","review":"... I found the plot and characters only marginally interesting and the ending rather ho hum for a supposed murder mystery. I guess I am spoiled by my favorite writers... ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book!","review":"Is it a ghost story? A love story? A murder mystery? A coming of age story? This book hits on all of these things in passing and fails at each and every one. The character development is awful- she sets up the characters with one personality and then immediately has them act in the exact opposite way. New characters are introduced halfway through the book. Don't waste your time or money!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe yet predictable","review":"This was pretty grim and predictable. It sort of meandered ( like a river?) without really comimg to a conclusion that was believable. The adults behaved like adolescents, while the street-wise, over-exposed children \\"acted\\" like \\"adults\\"? I didn't feel much empathy for anyone, except the older teacher, who seemed like the only real character in the book ( and the cat)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive","review":"The Kindle price is more than the paperback, which is nutty.

Don't the parents of these sutdents expect something more than everyone, students and staff alike, sneaking around at all hours. These students are supposed to be in high school.

Is this really what goes on in boarding schools or did I just stumble into one of the poorest examples of education? Puhleese, spare me."},{"rating":"1","title":"On its way to the thrift shop","review":"Took The River King outside to read yesterday afternoon, but realized in short order that this read was a big waste of time. All I could think of was getting it over with, so I closed it up and put it with a pile of things to take to the thrift shop for re-cyling. It was bad enough that I had wasted my money on it (hadn't even bought it thru Amazon), but it would be worse yet to waste my energies on such a lovely afternoon. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always A Beautiful Writer","review":"As always Hoffman writes with extreme beauty, the writing mesmerizing, and the descriptions you can actually hear, smell, taste, and feel. This definatly goes under Hoffman's best books. Although, strangely this novel really reminded me of Twin Peaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"I am used to reading for pleasure and many of my books don't cause me to do much thinking. This book made me stop and think at different times about what exactly the author was trying to describe, portray, hint to, etc. I found this book so deep and interesting to read, the characters were so real and human and interesting and the story line was addictive. I thought the relationship between Carlin and Gus was so unusual and was glad to see Carlin make the right decisions in the end. I thought the way Able handled the situation with Harry was insufficient, he deserved stronger punishment, and I was happy to see Betsy find her true love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read by Hoffman","review":"Again, I am amazed by Alice Hoffman and the lyrical quality of her writing. I am also spellbound by how easily she moves in and out of what we consider the natural world. Although we know this is purely fictional, it really makes one wonder about the paranormal and the effects of such on the living world. Again, Hoffman brings us a great cast of characters, although I found myself wanting to know more about them. I found her characterization in perious novels to be much deeper, so I felt somewhat disappointed that I didn't get to know Betsy and Carlin and Gus a bit better. Also, the secondary characters are left as just that - secondary and flat. However, it's a great story overall and I would recommend reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book missed the mark for me. I did read it, but I did not find it necessarily engaging. I think that this may have been targeted for a younger audience. It was dark in an odd way - not like Practical Magic, however. I felt a little cheated when I finished the book - I did not have that 'good' feeling that comes after having read a 'good' book.I do appreciate Alice Hoffman's talent, but I did not feel this book showcased it as well as others have. I much preferred A Probable Future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual case of movie being better than the book","review":"This represents one of the few instances in which I actually saw the movie before reading the book. When I saw the movie, I found it moderately captivating. I was drawn into the story and really felt a connection to the characters (however, I have to add I was ill at the time and cannot rule out this reaction being an effect of the fever). In any event, seeing the movie moved me to read the book. I was overall a bit disappointed. The book just never seemed to capture my attention. I never seemed to enjoy the characters or the story and I felt the movie director did a much better job of making the characters real and moving. This is the first time I have ever felt a movie outperformed the book the movie is based on. This is my first time to read a book by this author. To me, it was just \\"okay\\", and I don't believe I will be reading any of her other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW VIBES IN TOWN","review":"There's not much competition when it comes to playing the vibes, but even if there were, Matthias Lupri would whup most of them. The Boston based musician doesn't sound like Milt Jackson or Gary Burton or Lionel Hampton or any of the other mallet-wielding patriarchs, and his intense writing distinguishes him even more so.Verbole's ballsy sax is a perfect foil, the two of them weaving in and out of each other's paths, sometimes at a ferocious pace as on \\"Freefall.\\" Lots of tempo changes midtune, the band holds itself together by the telepathic rhythm section.

This is definitely a band worthy of greater recognition.--JazzNow Magazine - April 1999"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sister Got Game","review":"This is one of the best love stories I've read in a loooong time!It is contemporary and true to life.

I just finished reading it again this evening and I have to say that it was awesome this time around as well lol. I read it so long ago that I completely forgot some of the characters and most of the plot! This book is definitely a keeper. The characters were brought to life which made the story enjoyable. There were no editing issues and the plot was really tight. Darien and Maxwell had a lot of chemistry which made the story really HOT!

The content is very superficial with much much more focus on Chief's trivia than the Chief's history. Their are numerous interesting pictures but the only color one is the one on the cover. Finally, I found the layout of the book awkward to look up the answers to the triva questions. There are tens of pages of trivia with the answers all in the back of the book without the questions repeated; you will spend the majority of your time flipping back and forth trying to match answers with questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat idea, neatly executed","review":"I bought this after seeing it performed at my hometown university. Sure, there are songs where you agree that they should have been cut from their respective shows, but there are several that stand alone and are worth the price of admission: \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful\\", \\"Bang!\\", and \\"The Girls of Summer\\" rank among these. The two performers do very well and hold one's attention throughout. Also, though I am usually a proponent of show orchestras being as large and lush as possible, I do not agree with the complaints of other reviewers about the lone piano accompaniment. I think this show would be overwhelmed by 20+ musicians. It might be fun for someone to try a small chamber wind orchestration someday, but I think the piano suits the presentation very well. A pleasure to hear these songs this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Sondheim Lyrics","review":"I listened to this album today for the first time in a long time. I really enjoyed revisiting it. I saw the original, low-budget revue in a very small off-Broadway theater. It was never meant to be a big show, and the recording reflects this simplicity. I'm glad the show was even recorded. I like the piano accompaniment here because the Sondheim lyrics are crystal clear and witty. The songs aren't the usual ones found on many Sondheim compilations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morose","review":"I am a Sondheim fanatic. Having said that, I will now go on to say that \\"Marry Me a Little\\" is one of the worst Sondheim recordings I have ever heard. The synopsis to the CD said that Sondheim was reluctant to put on a revue that contained songs cut from other shows. If only he had trusted his instincts in this case! Musically the songs are underorchestrated and the lyrics are gloomy. \\"Happily Ever After\\" contains many lyrics that are later included in \\"Being Alive;\\" yet while \\"Being Alive\\" celebrates marriage, both the good and the bad, \\"Happily Ever After\\" is just downright nasty. \\"Bang\\" and \\"Marry Me a Little\\" are used more effectively in \\"Putting it Together.\\" \\"Pour le Sport\\" is affected and stilted. I looked at the date of the CD and saw that it was recorded only a month before \\"Merriy We Roll Along\\" which I consider to be one of the finest Sondheim recordings available. Every artist has works which are not up to standard; the \\"Marry Me a Little\\" CD should be dismissed as one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"The product was poorly crafted, the edges uneven, and overall a disappointment.

Pedal steel star Joaquin Murphey anchors the band along with three fiddles and the ever-present chugga-chugga-chugin' accordion that was the signature sound of California country.

Other than a couple of awkward fade-ins, the sound quality on this one is pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cheesy \\"Lawrance Welk\\" of western swing...","review":"I think it might be the UN-Swinging sound of the accordian, that adds commerialism and corniness to these otherwise ok sessions. Of course it is the annoying ever-present accordian that gives these western swing sessiosn that cornball Lawrence welk sound. You are much better off buying his competitors cd's, which are much less commercial and more swinging. There is also a lack of any horn sections, or hot solos and the pedal guitarists playing isn't too inspiring and rather stiff at times. Overall these are decent sessions, if there had been less accordian playing, I would have given this three stars, but this is strictly commerical music, and lacks the idea of WESTERN SWING, mixing hillbilly music with jazz. however cooley mixed Hillbilly music(not with jazz) with cornball music, rather then swing(or jazz), though some of the songs swing, but not too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth a look into","review":"Arlen Roth, Unchained Melody...wow, what a take on this gem of a song, unfortunately only available on vinyl (& CDR) a must listen, hair raising, emotive instrumental take on a classic song.Arlen has what it takes to be one of the most respected all around players out there.

I loved it and will continue watching it until the poor dvd wears out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two reasons to get this movie; the young Liz and the music","review":"This movie is standard 1950's soap. What makes it worth a look are two factors; the splendid classical music (though I agree with one of the other reviewers that there were too many reaction shots) and the beauty of the young Elizabeth Taylor, as annoying as her character might be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not watch it","review":"Received the title just in time for a gift, and did not notice that the cd box was damaged on the back until the box was opened. My mistake was not inspecting the CD box properly when I took it out of the shipment box that seemed to be in perfect condition.Once opened and unsealed I new I could not return it. Tried to watch the movie and my player rejected it.I will purchase the movie again, but not with this seller as they should have detected the problem when packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taylor at her best.","review":"The music and interesting love story appealed to me .My wifes favoriteI particularly liked the violin and piano concertos..Should appeal to music students."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but has a few issues","review":"Good points--this unit can go 24-36 hours without refilling the tanks, and seems to crank out decent moist air. Bad points--each 2+ gallon tank when full, weighs about 20#. Handling a filled tank is not for the arthritic or weak-armed;it's good for building biceps. Tank \\"handle\\" allows only fingers in it. Fan on high is a bit noisey. Also the occasional glug-glug, glug as the reservoir fills is, at first, disconcerting--sounds like a drain backing up, or if you've a cat--the cat is about to dislodge a hairball! Overall though, it seems to do its job. Filters are cheaper on the Holmes website, in quantity."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't wink any longer","review":"This product is not worth the money. It worked great the first year but now will not wick. It just blows dry air around. I have cleaned it as directed and changed filters. It has a great warranty but when I called and asked to get a replacement through Holmes, I can't get one until sometime next spring. Why can Amazon and other retailers get them? Oh well, will look for some other brand now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply manufactured, awkward to use, looking for replacement","review":"I came here to read reviews because I just filled this one with water I think for the last time( I have to run upstairs and check if it is leaking).Rubber gaskets on tank covers just crumbled and it does not stop water from flowing continusly. One is still working and somehow plyable, so maybe it will work for a few hours,but definitely I will not leave it overnight. Had to empty one tank to prevent overflowing. It is my second winter of using it.I have had humidifiers in my home for over 15 years now, and find Bionaire used to be the best. I say used to, because they do not make the models I used to love any longer.Giving it 2 stars since it lasted for two seasons unlike others that had to be replaced every winter.It is noisy, very awkward to fill with water, cheap plastic with sharp edges. Not to mention terrible filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be prepared for tons of Maintenance","review":"I used this humidifier throughout the winter season and today I threw it away. The wheels were very cheap and fell off many times. The filters/wicks last anywhere from a week to 20 days. You have to add Anti-bacterial and Anti-scale solution to the water every time you fill the tank. If you don't, you'll have a foul stink in a matter of days.I've switched to a smaller ultrasonic version. So far I'm much happier with the results. This Holmes model sucks! It requires way too much maintenance and the cost for filters and water treatment is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"eats filters like a pig","review":"The humidifier works great but filters only last about a week or two, thenit just blows cold air. I think companies in America need to go back to the old idea of making quality products that last and distance themselves from the poor quality and greed that is killing our country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wagon rolls on into half knots","review":"Wagon is Ben Davis, Chris E. Peterson, Danny Kathriner, LEn Small, and for a few years also Steve Rauner. Ben did the legwork to get Lloyd Maines on board to produce (and sing a little and add his golden touches on pedal steel) this CD \\"No Kinder Room,\\" our second recording (1996). We recorded the tracks live, all in different rooms of Cedar Creek Studios, in Austin, TX, and when we did nail a recording, Lloyd would nod his head and let us know, \\"that was in the pocket, boys.\\"The other Wagon CDs are \\"Soon\\" (1993), \\"Anniversary\\" (1998), and \\"Beauty Angel Queen\\" (1999). We toured in support of our recordings, but ultimately, other career pursuits and budding families resulted in hitching the Wagon indefinitely......but Danny and Chris have continued on in a project known as \\"Half Knots,\\" and their first self-titled CD (2005) can also be found on Amazon. We have presently completed the tracks for the 2nd Half Knots CD - should be released in early 2007."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly recommended classic","review":"DISCLAIMER: I grew up with Ben Davis and Steve Rauner, two of the members of Wagon. Haven't seen them in years, though.That said, this is a great, great album. Great lyrics, great songs, and especially great fiddle playing. Predominantly intraspective in tone, there are a couple of rockers like the stand out \\"She's Alone\\" (\\"She's working out every other day before coming into work at eight; she's alone, she's alright, she just fine.\\") to change things up. The only weak song is \\"Downtown Larry Brown\\", which is a little too tinged in liberal guilt for my tastes.Plus: for the last several months, milesofmusic.com has been selling this album for just $5. Until they start handing out copies of Sgt. Pepper for free at every street corner, there is no better musical value for your dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Just Don't Get It","review":"Sorry band members and friends who gave yourselves 5 stars, you're just not that good -I like bluegrass, alternative country and the Grateful Dead. This CD is a little bit of each of these, but not exactly any one of them.This CD just doesn't work for me.When visting, Amazon sometimes pairs this with Peter Bruntwnell's \\"Normal For Bridgewater\\", and sometimes with Farmer Not So John's \\"Receiver\\". NFB and Receiver are two much better albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensible for Arthritic Hands","review":"Have pieces of Dycem all over my house -- for every tough opening job -- door handles, jar lids, etc., ETC.

Wish that it could be purchased in different size pieces but it worked well for grandson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music does not age","review":"Sure this album has it's very cheesy moments musically (with the programmed drums and offkey backup singing) but underneath the 80's radio rock aestetic is a very solid album of pure emotionally driven rock. Certainly not up to par with Mr Reed's other work, but in what I consider his weakest decade (The Blue Mask is the only work from the 1980's I really feel is essential)this is still a very strong album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"Remember getting this one on vinyl when it came out. Several tunes here are my favorite Reed songs. It may not be a \\"Sally Can't Dance\\" or \\"Street Hassle\\" but its very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll second that: Reed's worst","review":"What else can I say about this album that Mr. Caratsas hasn't said? Horrible use of drum machines, poorly written and arranged music, bad lyrics, uninspired performances--this has it all. This is the only Lou Reed album I can't even sit through (not counting \\"Metal Machine Music\\", of course).I guess I like it a little better than Caratsas. I'd give it a star and a half (rounding up to two). I like the droning guitar in \\"Video Violence\\" and a couple of the other songs are not completely terrible, but no one needs this album, not even hard-core fans. For masochistic completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Reed's worst albums.","review":"This album is so bad, it's hard to review it without feeling like a mugger of old ladies. I mean, it just plain stinks, and to belabor that point is like kicking a man when he's down. No--a puppy! It's like kicking a puppy when it's down. Yeah, that's it.\\"Mistrial\\" must have been one of those contract-ending things because such little effort appears to have gone into it. There isn't even a real drummer on most of the songs, but some terrible and uninspired drum machine programming! The songs themselves are among Reed's worst--one recalls the stories surrounding \\"Sally Can't Dance\\" (which is leaps and bounds better than this crap), and how Reed scribbled down the songs in a cab on the way to the studio. If only he had been so thoughtful this time around! Like I said, this is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"video","review":"I really should have returned this video, but i jsut didn't get around to it.

Personally, I like books that get to the point quickly and does not ramble on and on. Great anecdotes that make the point. Patricia has a very friendly tone and her cheerleader personality comes through without sounding fake. She is a true believer in herself and shares with her reader SPECIFIC WAYS to do the same. The book does not apply only to people in the sales profession. If you are just waiting around to get recognized or promoted, this book is definitely for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"There's a section missing....but I still use it and enjoy the compact size and the lengthy description and scriptural references!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Research about this book before you order","review":"This book has deceptions. Beware of false books and study tools. Zondervan - Publisher of NIV and other fake Christian books is evil! Dont let this bible dictionary lead you away from the real truth. Read the King James Bible and beware of false teachings and prophets. This book may have some truth, but it is mingeled with lies. Study for your self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aide to the Bible","review":"This book helps explain so many of the phrases, terms, locations, items, etc. in the bible. It is enjoyable to just thumb through it and stop on a word, and say \\" ghee, I didn't know that\\" I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT \\"See This Movie\\".","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've seen. It's only not worse than \\"Date Movie\\" because it's not epically unfunny (it doesn't take a crack at being humorous...I don't think?). It's uninteresting and doesn't make sense. The plot, what is it? The resolution? Seth Meyers is still hot as hell but I wouldn't be surprised if this sucky movie took home a couple Razzies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty hilarious, but over the top","review":"This entire little film made me smile throughout. I half-expected fighting to break out between the warring couples, but they never come to blows. They do, however, eviscerate each other with words as they come apart at the seams in a meeting that starts friendly, but soon turns ugly over whose child is at fault for a playground fight. It's fun to watch the shifting dynamics as the men side with each other, and the couples come apart, but not for long as the ground keeps shifting under everyone's feet. Jodie Foster is perhaps the most cartoonish, the veins in her neck about to explode as she turns on the rage. Kate Winslett's projectile vomit onto the coffee table was very funny. It's all over in 75 minutes, just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Sometimes you have to think a whole cast of oscar winners that can be an awful combination but not at all great Jodie Foster and Kate Winslet that was great they should have gotten them in a movie together a lot sooner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamster?","review":"Heads up: Be sure to watch closely the kids playing in the park in the opening scene.You will laugh throughout this movie as you watch the turmoil unbelievably escalate. Starts out as a civil discussion between parents that stems from a dispute between their sons. Darkly comical, absurd yet revealing as to how the simplest and most innocuous words are interpreted by others. Quality acting by everyone (well, the guys don't do much in life anyway so don't expect them to do much here) and especially by Foster - what range she has.Would be five stars had the writers scripted an ending where the parents throttled each other and in their last breathing moments they catch sight of the hamster walking through the doorway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Like","review":"This movie is an hour and a half of fighting that is just frustrating to watch. I did not like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not Virginia Woolf","review":"Hmm.Even though the script provides all the necessary elements for a great movie, Jodie Foster (who is normally so capable), overacted annoyingly and remarkably badly, whilst Kate Winslett (equally capable of wonderful work), did not manage much better either. John C Reilly gave a good and controlled performance, but the other male actor also failed to improve the problem.Perhaps the problem lay with the direction. I don't really know, as the film could have been superb. I just realize more and more how difficult it is to get everything just right. \\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" comes to mind in this context, a movie where parties confronted each other with equal intensity. Only there the mix and the acting was spot-on and the direction masterly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have to say that I respect Roman Polanski as a director and I have often found that I \\"like\\" (not love) his movies, but this movie just fell flat for me. I thought it was going to be witty, cynical,sarcastic and funny. It was anything but those things. I thought it was boring, boring, boring. There was not anything funny about this movie, just two couples bickering over nothing but their ailing relationships. I would not recommend this movie, unless you need something to help you sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bland, I couldn't make it through the movie.","review":"4 people, arguing over their petty children's scuffle.

I expected so much more with such a stellar cast but alas NO, it was a tough 75 minutes.Then again i thought Tower Heist was unfunny too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star cast, crap story.","review":"Don't let the star cast fool you. The story line is weak, the writing is crap and it is overacted to try and make it mean something. Very disappointing and the title is the only believable part of the movie...

Waltz is fabulous (could watch the guy read the phone book), and Foster and Kate Winslet hit it out of the park.

Despite an impressive cast, however, the conversation and movie is unrealistic and stagey. The characters seem implausible and one inconsistent. Like always, Kate Winslet is awfully nice to look at and there is something there, so not a total loss, but definitely not a recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Witty and Intellectual Film...","review":"If you haven't allowed garbage reality television to rot your mind, or you can handle a film in which the dialogue is the most important piece, dare I say, akin to reading a novel, then you will love this one. It's hilarious, it's intellectual and it will have you laughing in hysterics.

Part of this strategy of ripping off a gullible public is to spend almost no money on support. For example, the SCREEN is not covered under the warrany. That is a full 50% or more of the value of the computer. This flimsy product with a poorly designed, akward keyboard, showed a crack in the screen within a few months of very light use (I am a Mac user mostly). This was without travel or injury of any kind. Guess what, warrantly doesnt cover this, because it couldnt be defective, cause its a Sony! I have had Sony camcorders, TVs, you name it.

If you've ever done any animation before, don't buy the book.Compared to other Flash books and material out there, this book doesn't hold up. The author's own work is only average at best, as he ever states in the intro. \\"...I'm not the best, not ever ranked\\". For anyone with experience, this just isn't the book you're looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another geek who thinks he can draw!","review":"It's high time some real animators wrote a book about Flash animation.

The writing is masterful, compelling, convincing, and inspiring. Not to be confused with the theosophical movement of Blavansky, Besant, etc., Dr. Versluis' \\"Theosophia\\" takes the reader through a journey of esoteric Christian thought. The work of Jacob Boehme is perhaps the most significant \\"eye-opener\\" here, for it is in this study that one may begin to appreciate the \\"inner dimensions\\" inherent in the Christian faith, allowing the seeker to remain faithful to doctrinal elements of Christianity while not succumbing to \\"new age\\" so-called theologies. For this reader, a totally new world was unveiled thanks to the author's perceptions of gnosis."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure of a Book","review":"Arthur Versluis does a remarkable job here. He informs the mind while moving the heart in the direction of what it longs for. This book goes beyond Christian concerns while doing them deep justice. It's a special book in my library and I highly recommend it. In many ways it's alive with the breath of Sophia."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to be a fan of twista...","review":"Untill he made the mistake of signing with cocka-fella.

To me this CD is crap, with a few good songs, but the rest is unbelieveable. There is not one guest apperence by any of the Legit Baller family, and twista raps about clubbing and women through-out this whole CD.

What did Kanye West do about it? Michael Jackson cleared the way for black artists who can now appear on MTV, thanks to Michael Jackson. Twista should show more respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay.....kinda","review":"I always wondered what happened to Twista and his Speedknot Mobstaz crew. Twista is probably the fastest rapper in the business and it is definately a breath of fresh air in comparison to the huge number of slow, raspy, mumbling rappers of late. No doubt, the best beats of the album are the two songs produced by Kayne West, \\"Slow Jams\\" and \\"Overnight Celebrity.\\" The problem with this album, however, is huge inconsistencies with quality beats and extremely cliched songs such as \\"Like a 24\\" and \\"Badonkadonk.\\" If I hear the line \\"I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind\\" one more time in a song, I will shoot myself. The equally horrible \\"Hope\\" has some of the corniest and predictable lyrics I've ever heard (even with the great Cee-Lo on the track) and seems like a poor attempt to get even more radio play (on par with less corny, but still lousy 'Where's the Love' by BEP)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wack & boring & soft","review":"I used be into twista before he sign with roca-fella which he basically sold out and became a r& b arist not a rapper.

His first album, \\"Adrenaline Rush\\" was nothing but pure heat and \\"Kamikaze\\" is no different. His style is so original and unique. From him rapping so fast you can't understand what hes saying to him slowing down the pace, no matter what he rips the track apart. There was only one track I didn't care for and that was \\"Badunkadunk\\". But besides that, this album is classic.Songs to check out:1. Kill Us All2. Slow Jamz3. Lovely Day4. Like A 245. Hope6.

While is wicked fast tongue sets him apart from all the other emcees, to listen to it for an entire album is asking way to much. In fact, he sounds most at home on slower tracks such as \\"Slow Jamz\\" with Kanye West & Jamie Foxx & \\"Sunshine\\" with Anthony Hamilton, where he still insists on his trademark rapid delivery. Its worth checking out for appearences by Ludacris, R.

The one thing I didnt like about this album is the constant \\"Kanye Westish\\" sound. If Kanye West didnt produce the beat, the beat would sound like he did.

It kind of reminds me of the James Bond series when it first came out - Sean Connery IS James Bond! Well folks, make no mistake about it - Clayton Moore IS The Long Ranger. I hope that the rest of the series is published.

Indeed, only about 1/4 of Freshmen in high school are truly capable of abstract reasoning, let alone the younger children.

That means I had to remove the cover, and I pulled and pulled, cut my skin, and left a imprint on my fingers because I struggled so hard to take it off.The second part of the battle was putting it back on! Because it's such a \\"perfect\\" fit, it took my dad and I another 8 minutes to squeeze the phone into this and zip it up properly.Unless you never plan on taking out your battery or sim card, then this is perfect, it really does become part of the phone.

I drop my phone about once a week and do not have a single scratch on the phone thanks to this case. Only bummer is it does not come with the swivel clip.

It is exciting but challenging as it makes the case for Consciousness to be non-local, that is, outside relative physics and our minds, which experience it. Painstaking explanations revealing the inability of Standard Model Einsteinian physics to operate on the quantum level grind the imagination, but leave one with the clear understanding that indeed the simplest explanation for Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is that Consciousness is likely the prime mover of all creation, and we lucky beings get to play in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's watching - through you!","review":"A good book - well ahead of it's time.

I would also recommend \\"The Science of G-d\\" by Israeli physicist Gerrard Shroeder. I am constantly surprised by the number of individuals that seem threatened by different concepts of reality. I am an environmental scientist and not a physicist, but I keep up with many of the current trends in physics. Considering the fact that it has been proven multiple times in reputable physics labs that reality can be affected by consciousness. I didn't feel this book was a big leap. Anyone that studies up on laboratory experiments involving photons and observation would be doing a disservice to science by not at least acknowledging that the mind can exist on levels beyond physical synapses.How else could physical observation by an intelligent mind effect the ultimate outcome of any individual photon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"HAIFA ALI","review":"My order not yet received. I need propper feedback from your side . Already a month passed since it was shipped .Kindly advice ."},{"rating":"1","title":"MONISTIC Idealism? Hello!","review":"The problem I find with Goswami is his choice of terms, particularly \\"monistic idealism.\\" According to my education, \\"monistic\\" means you believe in one kind of substance, namely matter or soul substance. If Goswami admits the reality of matter, as he does in the first chapter and even implies in the subtitle of the book, then how can he call himself a \\"MONISTIC idealist?\\" The term denotes that he must believe that mind or \\"consciousness\\" is all that exists, but he hangs himself by allowing the reality of matter. So, he's really a DUALIST after all.Don't waste your time on this book. For a better example of pure idealistic monism, check out George Berkeley (you can find him in a book titled _The Empiricists_), or go back to the Hindu and other Indian sages upon whom Goswami draws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Beware of this book.

Personally, I prefer the early-'70's sound that he provided; this CD, while good, is more reflective of his later '70's-early 80's sound. But, there are a few songs here that harken back to Johnny's traditional country sound, which makes this a must-have album. The best number here is \\"Corpus Christi Bay\\", a true redneck reminiscing song if there ever was one....noone could pull this number off except Johnny. Other notable mentions are: \\"Big Red Sun Blues\\", \\"Every Night About this Time\\", and \\"When it's Your Turn To Fall\\". Although modern \\"Country\\" Music has reverted to a Boy-Band, Pop-sound, I hope Johnny Rodriguez will put out another album soon.

How he gets into that problem and how he gets out provides a particularly entrhalling text. I really like this type of nove.Seems like one always wonders what happens next. Like we all do, we try to anticipate and hope that the next turn goes both his and our way. The book is something like a mystery story with the expected twists and turns but with a lot more. It gives one a chance to assimilate the advance of the story without the confusion, because of too many sub plots.Mr. Lunsford's style of writing is very appealing to me. Somewhat like the old Mike Hammer novels. The Bob Burton Bounty Hunter books. Speculation is not there when he says something. He just spits it out. Some vernacular, colorful words and such.You will not mistake his meaning.If you don't like this book you don't like chicken soup.A new fan of this gentleman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Western Civ.

Heather Myles' strong voice and choice of top notch material does not require the lush production that is currently in vogue among most female country singers. I can't think of another female singer to which she can be prepared. Mandy Barnett's voice may be stonger but she continues to record sub-par songs. UNTAMED is more like listening to a female Alan Jackson CD. The instrumentation and voice inflections in a majority of the songs are close to those found in Jackson's most recent releases. A few of the uptempo swing numbers (Cadillac Cowboy and Gone Too Long) sound like Mark Chesnutt songs and the highlight of the CD (It Ain't Over) could have easily been recorded by Tracy Lawrence. The arangements are very well done and feature guitars instead of the ever present piano - thank you.

They should've done that when they re-released the third CD (Red Cover) on the Splitfire label. I have the Original RCA Red Cover CD with track 6 \\"Six String Fever\\" which I bought over 10 years ago in Guam for only $6.99 (BRAND NEW).

Same music every song, songs differ in the three or four word title they repeated over and over again. No versus, just the title repeated for 3 1/2 minutes. Here are sample lyrics...\\"Blondes in Black Cars, crusin down the boulevard, blondes in black cars i see them, blondes in black cars [garbled] [garble] for sure...\\" Plunket's voice is so low in the mix here, and on Loud N Clear, that you can only make out the three / four word chorus.

Hap'nin' is a lively instrumental funk with a great drum solo at the top, lots of Fender Rhodes and a touch of wah wah guitar; Pass Me Not is a pretty good gospel tune!

With a flash of executive producer Steven Spielberg's brilliance, and more than a healthy serving of the fiesty beauty of Catherine Zeta Jones, a rejuvenated Anthony Hopkins and a sultry Antonio Banderas combine to produce one of the most truly entertaining films of the year. Everything in the The Mask of Zorro is cliched, but so shamelessly as to only add to the swashbuckling adventure which grips the attention. Laughs and tears, they are all part of the package. It is not hard to find gaping holes in a plot - certainly Oliver Stone would never have it - but The Mask of Zorro is not a film where the plot is so massively important. Every moment of the film is engaging, breathtaking and exciting. Indeed, it is an exhausting experience. Experience it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whole Lotta Fun!","review":"Now here's an action movie where, despite a lot of fighting, nobody gets hurt except the really bad guys!This movie is just plain fun! Antonio Banderas is a manly gentleman, but vulnerable. Anthony Hopkins is.. Anthony Hopkins! He's captivating as usual. Catherine Zeta-Jones is incredibly beautiful and mesmerizing, and nobody looks finer in pre-usa California costume. The rest of the supporting cast does well too, and the casting well matches the script.This movie has charm! The music is wonderful. The costumes and other production design elements are well done, and the casting is superb. There is a lot of action, a lot of humor, a lot of drama, and all in all, it's a light hearted romp through pre-statehood California, centered around that wonderful hero called Zorro!

Well, the world is full of interesting people... Overall, this is one of the best quality DVDs I own. Picture and sound are amazing. Banderas is definitely the best Zorro of all times. His nemesis is a very compelling sadistic killer. The level of violense is precisely suitable for 8-9 years ols kids (at least it shows that if you stick a pointy metal bar into a human being, there is pain and blood). My son loves it very much and watches at least once a month. An I just cannot help doing it with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, Not Bad at All.","review":"I think this was a wonderful movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones turned in a masterful performance as Elena, Zorro's (Anthony Hopkin's) Daughter.She almost had me convincd she was Spanish instead of Welsh.Antonio Banderas was a wonderful Zorro, he had you cheering for him all the way. As Don Alejandro, he was suave, sophisticated, and positively charming.Banderas and Zeta-Jones' chemistry amazed me, Their dance scene kept me staring,their \\"battle\\" was enamoring, and the confessional scene awed me. (Maybe she should have married him instead of Michael douglas)Don Raphael and Captain Love are marvelous villans. Anthony Hopkins is a suprisingly good Zorro. Don't rent this movie, buy it! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Revival","review":"Created in 1918, the character of Zorro has captured romantic hearts and adventurous swash-buckling connoisseurs alike. Who can resist a scamp of a man who rides a wild steed, sears a \\"Z\\" with his , dare I say it, phallic sword, woos the women, and fights the good fight?In this \\"Mask of Zorro\\" remake, I was totally enthralled by the lush costuming. A mask may just be a mask, but when worn by Antonio Banderas as he playfully disrobes Catherine Zeta-Jones whilst verbally and physically fencing this beauty, a deep sigh is indeed called for.Anthony Hopkins, as an aging Don Diego, is wickedly subtle while training his hand-picked \\"new\\" Zorro. And the action packed adventures swarm on with renewed vigor. I liked the 1940 version with Tyrone Power and Douglas Fairbanks--I love this romantic revival.A fun, flashy, film to escape with.Thank you for your interest & comments--CDS"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great !!","review":"I saw this on the big screen and on video and I loved it both times.Excellent story line and a beautiful girl what else makes a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopkins shines, Banderas struggles","review":"As always, Sir Anthony Hopkins turns in a fine performance, this time as the legendery Zorro, now nearing retirement. Banderas, as his unlikely protoge, delivers an admirable performance -- but struggles to avoid being overshadowed by Hopkins's overwhelming presence onscreen. Catherine Zeta-Jones provides much needed spark as the spunky daughter of an evil general, and more than holds her own in this swashbuckling adventure.The script combines witty dialogue, for the most part, with believable conflicts -- and a noble storyline which is quite engrossing. The cinematography is breathtaking, lending a sense of realism to an otherwise mythical legend.If you like high adventure, romance, and have a dry sense of humor, this film should be well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sword fights.","review":"It wasn't bad.

Great stunt work and larger than life heroes and heroine. The picture and sound quality are excellent but having seen the original film we were really disappointed that two important scenes were cut out. The first when Elena hears suggestions that she is someone else's daughter and the second when the young Zorro has a private meeting with Captain Harrison Love and is shown his brother's head in a jar (and the edit here was very badly done). The removal of these scenes made two subsequent scenes rather odd. I thought that when I bought a DVD I would be getting the movie. This is clearly not the case. Despite this shortcoming of the DVD version it is well worth having in the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I liked this movie.I even liked Zeta-Jones.One thing I didn't like was that every scene with Zeta-Jones has her face smeared and caked in makeup.Is she really that ugly beneath the crap? I mean it's ok to have her presentable but not so presentable she's fake.They should have even thrown in a scene where she gets out of bed and her face is in pristine condition like the makeup is part of her for an even more fake approach.But still a good movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"The One To See!!!!!!!!

This movie features Anthony Hopkins your Haniball Lecter guy and Antonio Bandras who is a very unique actor.

I don't *need* in-depth characters or high artistry in order to enjoy a film, but the Hollywood fluff of the 90s just strikes me as fundamentally awful -- it consistently tries WAY too hard to be funny, cool, and exciting. Raiders of the Lost Ark was good Hollywood fluff. Robin Hood was decent Hollywood fluff. This is painfully sub-par Hollywood fluff, but it is slightly redeemed by the qualities I mentioned at the beginning of my little ramble.

The choice of Antonio Banderas (rightfully dubbed \\"flavor of the month\\" by Siskel & Ebert), however, is perfect. A cliche-ridden replica of most \\"action adventures,\\" this is a fast paced film with a few laughs and thrills that adds NOTHING new to the genre. Perfect if you like mindless action entertainment - a la Desperado.

After viewing this movie on DVD I have to say I was very surprised by this movie, there was plenty of great action and sword dueling without blood or extensive violence. James Horners score and the sound editing is a great treat to 5.1 viewers and the picture is crisp. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie does a great job of not provoking thought","review":"Completely predictable Hollywood version of the famous swashbuckler, the focus is on the snappy one-liners and the sweeping swordfights. But somewhere between bending over backwards to make sure that we take Zeta-Jones' character seriously (she's from the 1800s, but has the confidence and power that a modern gender-conscious audience demands) and bending over backwards to make sure that we take Anthony Hopkins' character seriously (he may be an old drunk man, but he can fight like the devil once he finds his inspiration), this movie lost me."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"When I heard about this movie I was excited because I loved Zorro. But when I saw this I thought what the hell were they thinking. Zorro needs a smile of that of a fox. very misleading. The basis of the movie wasn't even good. You need something where you can really think is he really zorro or does he have a twin. I didn't get that from this. I never thought I would not like a zorro movie but when I saw this I hated it right from the start. The only other movie I hated of a zorro type was the gay blade I mean that was the stupidest movie..So my final word on this movie is that I hated it and I don't reccomend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"This film is basically a collection of cliches and set peices from just about every action/adventure movie ever made.

The action scenes aren't badly done, but the movie is very, very predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"I watched this movie on a 16 hour bus ride from Washington DC. It was absolutley no good. The plot was confusing, and the end was just creepy. The younger Zorro was pathetic, and the older Zorro was too weird. I would not reccomend this movie to families, as there is much violence. There was some historical reference, but not enough to consider this movie historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairbanks Would Approve","review":"Anthony Hopkins is the real Zorro and Antonio Banderas is the young bandit he grooms to take his place and to fight against the Don responsible for the death of his wife and the taking of his daughter. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Hopkin's daughter who has been raised as the Don's child.The three stars are all excellent, bringing both their dramatic capacities and a comic touch to each character. The story is engaging, with amusing dialogue and interplay between the leads. The action is well staged and punches up the story. All in all, it's great entertainment and a well made film. I suspect Douglas Fairbanks and Tyrone Power would have approved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellente!","review":"This movie was the perfect mixture of romance, action and adventure.

Those who enjoyed Indiana Jones will surely love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinematography","review":"Great movie and stunts. Cathrine Zeta-Jones is great and so is Anthony Hopkins. I think Antovbe (or whatever his name is) was good too. But it can get a bit legthy, but that's just because I've seen it about 9 times.

This one is the anomole. It's the worst. Because it has two fans, instead of the one fan 10-gallon HM3665-U, at medium or high speed the fans start an acoustic war between each other. This results in an absolutely intolerable vibration that you can not suppress or control. I work in a sound proof sound studio at my job, and I'm getting complaints from people who can hear it right through the walls!TAKE A PASS ON THIS ONE. They've got some bugs to work out.AND DO NOT EXPECT HOLMES CUSTOMER SERVICE TO HELP YOU WITH ONLINE ORDERS!!!They are inferior for customer service. They'll simply put you off as long as they can until you've hopefully forgotten about your problem, or have just given up.

The warm mist type is much quieter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Piece of Junk I Have ever owned","review":"I bought this and brought it home, set it up and turned it on. I went downstairs and thought that someone was doing constriction outside. One of the fans continually droned and vibrated; causing so much noise I could not use it. I thought it was a fluke so I sent a message to Holmes which they did not respond to. I returned it and replaced it with another identical model. I set it up and turned it on and was satisfied. I went to bed only to wake up to it turning off and on and from high to low. I looked at the display and it was alternating from a humidity level of 40 all the way to 75, and all numbers between. Also it was randomly cycling between all levels of power. I turned the unit off and went back to bed. To my surprise it turned itself back on and again cycled through different power levels and modes.

There are two different modes: a high/medium/low and an automatic on/off depending on the room's humidity level (it sounds like a really good idea, right...). The first, always-on type setting is very loud. The other, automatic setting is intolerable. If you do purchase this, make sure you have a spot planned for it where it will not be near bedrooms since you can hear it through closed doors and walls. The one star that this equipment gets is for the fact that it can pump a lot of water out really quickly. Other negatives are that it's really hard to fill without using the bathtub and that you can't rest the water tanks on its top when you're filling it (they're inconveniently curved, so you have to hold up most of the weight of the water tank while trying to finagle it in the bathtub)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This is a great product.

Now, the case falls to either side, making it very cumbersome and uncomfortable to carry around. The best thing is that Protec expected me to pay to ship it to them to fix it when the case should not have broken in the first place.

In addition, the design results in water condensing and ending up on the floor. Thirdly, the after filling the tank, it was usually very hard to get it restarted - impossible to get the empty tank to turn off. Last, the design makes it hard to clean the heating element after a while. The element has a non-stick coating but this coating disappears over time.

Another button makes it breath like Darth Vader, and the last button turns on the internal microphone.

The first one was used no more than 10 times when it decided it wouldn't turn on any more. That blender was only about 6 months old and Target allowed me to exchange the defective one for a new one. The replacement is about a year old and also has been used no more than 10 times. The last 2 or 3 times the blender worked there was a strong electrical burning smell, which I thought was the \\"newness\\" of the blender showing. Obviously it was in it's death throes because these blenders are good for single digit uses. The replacement blender has failed in the same way as the first by refusing to turn on. When it works, it works fine. Just know that when you buy this blender it is a disposable item. You will pay approximately $10 per blend and then it will die when you've covered your purchase price.

And while Brink and Boston Low remain true to the game, Maggie has turned characterwise from a serious, no-nonsense, self-reliant reporter to a giggling, silly high school senior.The descriptions of the ancient alien machinery is uninspired, and the beauty of the world that comes across in the game is noticeably absent. Brink's crystal madness is understated, and instead of becoming a raving, screaming madman, as he does in the game, he sort of states that he has a problem with Boston Low and lets it go at that.

I have had other electric toothbrushes where the batteries get corroded and the brush becomes useless, but the Sonicare has a sealed compartment of rechargeable batteries, so that is not a problem. This was great for when I had braces, and it is really awesome now that I got my braces off. I know that these brushes are pricey, but they are worth it. Once you use this brush, if you go back to using a regular toothbrush you will realize how dirty your mouth still feels afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Expensive","review":"I have had my Sonicare toothbrush for about two years and it recently stopped working. I am assuming that the battery is dead. The Philips website says you can not replace the batteries. I paid $130 for a toothbrush that lasted about two years. Add on the replacement heads and it is well over $200. Also, the brush is not environmentally friendly. I have the charger base but can not just replace the handle if I chose to do this.

I see the price has dropped on the 4300 to around $79. A friend has the 7300 and the ergonomic design of the handle and skinner brush head makes it really much more comfortable. But on the other hand, some people like larger things stuck in their mouth, so it that's the case, go for the $20 savings and get the 4300. All I can say is, I want to go brush my teeth right now.

My only surprise with this one is the brushes themselves; the heads are smaller (that's a good thing), but the bristles seem to be firmer (not so sure about that), and that's true of the more colorful compact heads, too. But the old one kept me out of the perio's chair, and this one will too, and that's what counts.18 months later: The on-button has a flexible covering that has now perforated at the top, allowing moisture to get inside the barrel.

The first time I thought it was a fluke but after 3 times I am wondering what the heck brand of batteries are in these things.

Now I know better.","review":"I used the Sonicare Elite for several years, buying the hype that it was cleaning my teeth better than I could. But then my dental hygienist pointed out that it was also brushing away the base of my gums with its back-and-forth action--she showed me the linear ridges it has made in my gums. I don't apply alot of pressure when brushing, so this was upsetting, especially since the damage is permanent. She'd been trying to get me to switch to the Oral B for ages, so when my sister-in-law (also a hygienist) recommended the Oral B, I went out and got one. The circular action doesn't wear away the gum line, and my teeth are significantly cleaner. Even though I floss every day, I still had plaque build-up behind my bottom front teeth with the Sonicare. With the Oral B, it's gone. And with the variety of brushing styles that automatically switch when you change a brush head (several options are included!), it's a lot more bang for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Actually, great brushing action.

All I can say is \\"wow!\\" I used to brush once a day (I know, bad me) and floss about once a week (bad me again...). Now I'm using the Sonicare about three times a day because it's JUST THAT GREAT. When I'm finished brushing, my teeth feel brand new... it's exactly (as a previous reviewer noted) like I've just gotten out of the dentist's chair.

I've been using Sonicare for a bit over 10 years and never had any problems other than poor battery life.

My dentist and I agree that Sonicare product use improves dental health, making regular checkups & cleaning a minor event (compared to previous de-scaling and stain removal sessions). Two minutes is more than enough to complete a thorough brushing. Ease of use encourages more frequent brushing. Important to remember that even a Sonicare is not a substitute for flossing into the deep gaps between teeth. One suggestion for users: Invest in a roll of white teflon (plumber's) tape to wrap the threads where the brush assembly screws into the handle.

The pacing of the book, the action, the intrigue all top notch mystery.Jane Whitefield, a Native American type of guide, a strong independent women, steeped in her families traditions. She thanks her ancestors,she thinks of the lessons taught to her, and uses them in her everyday life. I loved the Native American heritage that she respected and remembered.

First of all, it starts OK, but then turns into a liberal rant for the last half of the book. In almost all cases, Thompson's wild and repeated predictions about the fall of Republicans never come to pass. In fact, not one of them came true.It is a shame that a man with such insidious ability to write from the gut would allow himself to slide into the dark, slimy Left side of politics, all the while failing to report-much less admit-that the Left was as much if not more corrupt than the Right.I would pass this tome of incoherent bloviating.

The songs date back to 1962's A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum, through to a song written for the 1987 London production of Follies. Cleo uses the songs to cover a variety of characters and styles, expressing her versatility in no uncertain terms.Highlights for me: Liaisons; No One Is Alone; The Miller's Son; I'm Still Here - the slower songs basically.My one regret about this collection is that Cleo missed the golden opportunity of recording One More Kiss with her daughter, Jacqueline Dankworth. That's a minor regret though, on a very good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Sad, Saucy, Haunting...Memorable Genius!!","review":"When Cleo sings Sondheim, and that instrument of hers meets up with that genius of his, it just takes your breath away.

I didn't listen to the album much when it first came out and now I can see why. It doesn't hold up well.Yes, it's well produced and the performances are top notch. The songs, however, are bland pop music.

Referring to this product as 'waterproof' is criminal as everything I placed in the holder was saturated with water; even after dumping it out and resealing throughout the day it continued to fill up with water.

The way the bowl works is great. Where the product fails is the carry strap. When I filled the bottle about 3/4 full with water, and carried it on my shoulder with the strap, the bottle fell off.

I keep it in the frig so the water is cold; the top is wide enough to put ice in it also. All in all, it's a great product. My only concern is that the bowl might break off eventually.

The concept is nice as there is a cover attached to the water bottle which flips inside out to act as the water bowl. It takes a bit of effort to flip the plastic inside out and when it's cold outside, the cover is even more difficult to invert. When we went hiking with this water bottle, I put it in my dog's backpack. After about 30 minutes of hiking, I pulled the water bottle out only to find that a third of the water had leaked out. I thought that I had closed the top tightly but maybe not tight enough. I haven't used it since so I can't say for sure if the bottle just leaks or if the top has to be super tight to prevent leakage.

Anyway, I left the bottle in the back of my car while I went to PetSmart with my dog for about 45 minutes. When I came back to my car to retrieve the bottle, the bowl part of the bottle had melted itself into a completely useless form that wasn't able to hold water anymore.

After using it one time, I could tell a difference. My teeth felt like they had just been polished at the dentist office. After using it for ~ 1 month, my teeth are consistently cleaner. The sensation of brushing with the Sonicare system is odd, seeming as a combination of vibration and pulsations at your teeth and gums.

Get the Interplak toothbrush with the rotating bristles, not the round \\"Oral B\\" style head.My family has used Interplak brand since the 1980's and we have had fantastic success - imagine cancelling your curettage appointment and reducing the number of cleaning visits you need...etc. (Don't tell my dentist that I don't floss - I just use my Interplak!) We tried a Sonicare & were horrified. These are overpriced and they don't leave your teeth with the same clean feeling you get with an Interplak."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke, I tossed it","review":"I bought this for more than $150 at my dentist. It worked well for about a year, though it does get pretty disgusting beneath the top half without fairly intensive cleaning.After about a year of use, however, the switch broke. It wouldn't turn off or on reliably. Now I'm SURE Philips would have happily replaced it under warranty. The problem is, I can't be bothered with a toothbrush that adds that much complexity to my life. An iPod breaking is bad enough, a $100 plus toootbrush breaking is the proverbial straw.It also didn't magically prevent the age related recession of my gums -- if it had I'd suffer the time drain. As it is, it's back to the old toothbrush. I'll spend the time I save dealing with the warranty on better gum care.It gets two stars because it does have a warranty, I just can't stand to deal with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Replacable Batteries","review":"I bought my Sonicare about a year ago, and only used it maybe 6 months of that year.

Since \\"upgrading\\" to the 7500 I have gotten 1 cavity (on a receding gum area) and a detached gum using the \\"new model 7500. I attribute this to a smaller brush head which is a poor design that \\"overvibrates\\" on a smaller area loosening up the gums causing them to recede. The original Sonlcare cleaned over a wider area with a flat brush to evenly spread out the vibrations. I wonder if the original inventor had a hand in this \\"improved\\" model?

According to Sonicare the battery will last 3 to 5 years. Ours lasted only 3 years despite using non-peroxide toothpaste and only cleaning it with water and a towel. So be warned, when you invest $100 into a two-headed toothbrush set and another $20 every six months in new heads, this gimmick may last you only three years. You will be left with two perfectly good toothbrush heads, a well-functioning base, and a dead battery. According to Sonicare at this point all you can do is throw it all away (who cares about our growing mountains of garbage and future generations?) and buy - a new Sonicare!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"I had such a nice experience with Sonicare that I felt compelled to write my 1st ever review on Amazon.They have great customer support- they sent me a new brush after my 1st one failed within the warranty time period.

The dentist had put me on a 4 month schedule to make sure he kept a good eye on it. I got the Elite about month ago and went in for my appointment yesterday. My 8 pockets had decreased to 5, 5 to 3 etc. This was the first time in the last 5 years they have decreased. The Elite seems to have cleared up my problem and only after a month. I never used the old Sonciare but I have been using a cheaper competitive model so I have to say this is far superior based on the results. My teeth also feel much cleaner and the smaller angled brushhead make it easy to get the backs of my teeth. Sonicare took a long time to update their model but they obviously weren't just sitting around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonicare Elite 7500","review":"This model of the sonicare does everything it claims to do, and it does it well. It seems to have the lasting power and all of the \\"subtle\\" features which allow for accurate timing and duration of tooth brushing. Additionally, the \\"ramp up\\" feature for new users is a nice touch to get people comfortable with the vibrations.This is the second Sonicare toothbrush I've owned, the first one lasted seven years and the battery finally stopped holding much of a charge. I would definitely buy additional toothbrushes of this type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying maintenance etc.","review":"Owned an Oral-B for 10+ happy years. Attractive pricing on Sonicare caused me to defect. Totally regretful. It thoroughly puzzles me that a design of a medical appliance causes a colossal harbor for bacteria/mold. Consumer needs to take the thing apart each week and resort to Q-tips etc. to at least ensure visual cleanliness. Fact is, growth of the nasties commences immediately whether it's visible or not and compounds with the number of uses in a given period. This same weird design accomplishes an ongoing revenue stream for the manufacturer because the screw-on brush head unique to this product is very expensive to replace comparatively...especially on the recommended schedule of every three months. That said, the cleaning action is quite good. But then, so was Oral-B's. And the closed design and cheap brush heads far exceeded their Sonicare counterparts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product plus Great Customer Service","review":"My husband and I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for about eight years. My hygenist is bored with me now since there's not much for her to do when i arrive for my twice-a-year cleaning. The days of her chipping and scraping around on my teeth are history. Anyway, after all those years the toothbrush handles finally began to wear...weren't holding a charge well anymore. So, we upgraded to one of the newer models, which ARE even better than the originals. Then, about three months in, my husbands' began to sound really loud, and the vibration of the brush wasn't right either. So he called Sonicare customer service, explained what was going on. They apologized for the problem and said they'd send a new brush handle right away. Sure enough, one week later the UPS guy delivered it to our door.

It feels kind of funny when it is brushing, but the manual says you ge tused to that. The manual also says that it beeps when you turn it on, and after every 30 seconds of use. It *does not* beep at all. I called Phillips and they told me the manual is wrong and there is no beeper built into it. The Quadrapacer feature just makes the toothbrush stop for a second or two - it does not beep as the manual says. It is not a big deal, but the first time I used it, I kept it in one part of my mouth waiting for the beep, which never came. Just something to be aware of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Once acclimated to this product, brushing becomes an adventure.

My only complaint is that the tracks are not in chronological order--somehow the album starts with \\"Satellite of Love\\" then segues to the Lou Reed Lp, and then Berlin.

Many many years passed, and then a man who could not really sing did a whole new song that went by that title (Lou Reed once wryly commented that his own work could be considered rap--after all, it was of roughly the same tonal range).

The quiet-close is facilitated with dampened hinges. The closing works as described, albeit a little slow. You can always force it to close quicker. The dampening would not affect women, as they can just use their weight to force the seat close and do their business. However, the dampening still occurs when you're opening the toilet seat. For guys, when lifting the seat, the dampening causes a bounce-back. This bounce-back, along with gravity, will cause the seat to start to close.

I was not using undue pressure - it just snapped. And although the part easily unscrews from the aluminum base - there is no repair part.I'll buy a screw-down clamp and cross my fingers. The engineering on this part needs improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly engineered... shame on Minn Kota","review":"I purchased this quick release for my boat and ne Minn Kota Power Drive because of Minn Kotas great reputation. This item never made it passed my living room before I decided to ship it back to Amazon. The directions from Minn Kota were poorly written and I was trying to figure out what was the front or back side before I mounted it on my boat. I put the cover on the base and it would only go on in one direction by design. It went together hard and tightly as if it did not belong together. Okay once together, the cover would not come off the base when I released the quick release lever! I had to pry it apart with tools from underneath the base. If I had bolted the base to the boat, I would have not been able to realease the cover and would have to remove the nuts from the bolts and then remove the entire base. This is a badly engineered item from Minn Kota. I returned this item and used a different quick release from Minn Kota."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy & not what I expected.","review":"I have used a Sonicare that has the liquid toothpaste for about 6 or 8 years.

The first two paused every 30 seconds so you'd know when to move to another quad, the latest more expensive version, not the top of their line, though, just runs without the 30-second alerts. And, of course, they'd rather you paid for a new one rather than change batteries. I imagine the top models have the 30-second feature, but I'm not about to pay double the price. Just have to suffer, I guess.

Don't expect any support from the company, since they are owned by Philips, which has one of the worst customer service records on the planet.

I don't remember the older one's model number but the Advance 4100 is identical in size and operation. Once I was able to extricate the components from the infernal clam shell packaging, no small chore, the brush was ready for use. The only thing missing on the Advance 4100 that was on the older model is that the Advance 4100 runs for a continuous, uninterrupted two minutes while the older model beeped every 30 seconds during a two-minute cycle. The periodic beeps give one an idea of how to evenly brush all sides of the mouth. Other than that, and the diabolically designed packaging, the Advance 4100 product is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best Sonicare","review":"If it works WELL, why try to change it? I made the \\"mistake\\" of buying one of the newer designs of Sonicare toothbrushes, and I've been nothing but disappointed with it.

It wasn't \\"broken\\" and why \\"they\\" tried to change it, I'll NEVER understand. The Advance 4100 is the \\"right\\" choice. Don't blunder into those newer designs.

Couple of things to keep in mind, it is (like any power toothbrushes) a little messier than a manual toothbrush especially when reaching the back teeth. The brush should be removed and rinsed after each use as liquid runs down into the base area of the brush.Only problem, one of the tiny magnets on the end of the brush came loose somehow and stuck to our sink fixture. We didn't notice it missing right away and the next time the brush was used, it didn't seem to be vibrating much. We thought the unit was defective until I noticed the missing magnet. Stuck it back on and it worked perfectly; although, it must be in the correct orientation. Seems like they are simply magnetically held in place, maybe they should be superglued as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good electric toothbrush","review":"I have had my SonicCare for over 2 years now and it works terrific. I like that it shuts off after two minutes because I know I've brushed long enough. I always turn it back on and finish up, but I know how long it's been. I do not like to buy the replacement heads because they are so expensive, but I guess it's worth it. I have taken mine on several vacations over the past two years and I've never had a problem with losing the charge. I leave my on the charger whenever I am home and using it on a daily basis.

You just hold it in place and let the brush do it's magic. I love it. But it does have one flaw that I am surprised that Sonicare has not address yet. Where the brush stem connects with the head can collect water (or saliva, ewww!). And with liquid pooling in that area, leads to mold.

After all its your teeth and you show them everytime you smile. They are worth it.Bottomline, I love this brush. I think it is better than a spin brush just for the fact it seems to move the way one generally brushes. It does feel good after brushing. The charge seems to hold quite good.The bristles are quite firm and seem to perform quite well. I have been using this for over one month and all the bristles seems to be in fine shape.

That makes it even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries not replacable","review":"The Sonicare works well and has improved the check ups for all of us. We have 4 units and the oldest failed just after 2 years. (just out of warranty) We think it is the NiCad batteries which have limited life and always develop a \\"memory\\". Checking the manual, website and contacting Phillips we were told they cann not be replaced. We were told how to remove the double AA batteries, but the unit is designed so you destroy it in the process. So the bottom line is you can not change the batteries and it is an expensive \\"throw a way\\" product which could easily be designed to have replacement batteries. So if you buy one be prepared to replace it every 2-3 years. This also means more waste and many will be thrown away with the batteries which is an enviromental disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Replaced old 4100 with new one BUT they neglect to say that this model no longer has the 30 second timer.

In the past year, I've gone through 3 of these toothbrushes and they keep vibrating themselves to pieces!Mine develop tiny cracks that then spread like a car windshield due to the vibration, resulting in the brush falling apart (and no, I didn't drop them). My 3rd brush just fell apart tonight! I'm assuming that there are microscopic faults in the plastic that are susceptible to the vibration, and then spread.I really like the brush, but so far, I've spent over one-hundred-fifty US dollars in the past year on them and I hesitate to buy another one.Has anyone else had an experience like this or am I just cursed?

It is great. I love how clean it gets my teeth. Since I have had one and have made an effort to also floss nightly, I have not had any cavities. Definitely takes the stress out of visiting the dentist...and I have had many cavities in my lifetime.This time I bought 3 sonicare toothbrushes, One for me and I gave them as presents to my sister and boyfriend. They love them too. My sister has gum disease and she says it is making a huge difference and my boyfriend uses smokeless tobacco and he also says it is helping. Says his teeth feel clean even right after waking up.Definitely recommend the sonicare toothbrush! But if you can get the one with the quadpacer. My original one had it, this ones does not. It just beeps to tell you when to move to the next area of your mouth, doesn't sound important but it does help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement","review":"We ordered a new Sonicare to replace the one that had given us over five years of daily use by two adults.Another plus of the Sonicare is better check up reports from our dentist.

This work can lead the reader to a direct experience of ones self without the need to learn any new technique or philosophy. A new approach to self-realization that is based on realization of the truth of ones true nature. Highly recommended for anyone seriously on the path!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another angle, and a direct one.","review":"This book breaks away from many of the typical self-help genre by offering the reader a variety of direct and brief perspectives on the empowering truths that many people fail to recognize about themselves. Insightful, gripping, opinionated. Repetition may be an ideal feature for most casual seekers, but this work is for the big-boys (and girls)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Letter","review":"I purchased the letter \\"b\\" but when I received the package, the ribbon was stapled on upside-down making the letter look like a \\"p\\". It looks great other than it being upside down. Because of the price, it is not worth sending back and waiting on another one. It would be less hassle to just fix it myself. This is a great product, but I suggest buying it in a store (I think Babies 'R Us sells them) to avoid receiving the wrong letter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The softer side of Peter?","review":"If you're a veteran fan of Peter's, you probably already own this one, but if you don't you should be prepared for a soft, eerie, occasionally sentimental breath of lusty, romantic Peter Murphy.A friend of mine jokingly referred to this particular album as \\"Goth Lite,\\" with apologies to Peter's other fine releases... I thought it was funny, but the album really does need a few really quality listens and some time to grow on you.Don't get me wrong, Peter's voice is simply amazing on this album, and \\"Our Secret Garden\\" is a very pretty song. If you're completing your collection, get this album and listen to it on a rainy day for comfort. If you're just getting into Peter's work, try \\"Wild Birds,\\" \\"Deep,\\" or the new album \\"Dust.\\" This is a wonderful recording, one that is perhaps not my very most favorite of Peter's, but still very dear to my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"My ultimate favorite album!!","review":"I absolutely love it. I can't decide which song is my favorite, all of them is full and complete, great music & lyrics. Song by song it's changing my mood, very emotional, deep and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"A massive disappointment","review":"There's only one good song on this album, and Peter Murphy knew it. That's why he sarcastically titled it \\"Hit Song\\". The rest of the album is impenetrable, gawdawful noise. I suppose it's inevitable that the ten people who liked it would end up giving it positive reviews, but there's a reason why \\"Holy Smoke\\" basically killed Murphy's career. After Bauhaus and the PHENOMENAL \\"Deep\\" (which you should stop reading this review and buy, right now, immediately) it looked like Murphy was on his way to superstardom. \\"Holy Smoke\\" put a bullet in the head of all that, and Murphy has spent the 20 years since in virtual exile. It's almost as if Murphy was literally afraid of the success he was achieving, and felt like he had to do something to avoid stardom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy","review":"Not one of Peter's best. Seems very raw to me.

It seems his intention was to make a sequel to Deep--while allowing himself to test new waters musically and vocally. Aside from the good \\"deep\\"-era B-side quality of Keep Me From Harm and You're So Close..this CD has too many self-indulgent embarrsing moments (most notably Kill The Hate). Only for completists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer.","review":"I like Bauhaus a lot. I like Love & Rockets, Tones On Tail. I like Murphy's Love Hysteria and Deep.Holy Smoke? I don't like it so much. Wimpy is the only word I can think of to describe it. I'm not going to say you need to get this to complete your collection of Bauhaus/Murphy stuff, because quite frankly, this album is a giant turd. Only blind fanatics find something to enjoy in this recording. I'd rather pop in an old Bauhaus cd any day of the week than this over-produced garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Y-wing, AWESOME!","review":"It's another Y-wing, which is great and all. But since the new SW toys have been comming out in the 90's isn't it time for a rebel transport? We've seen a dozen different or re-re-released X-wings, a couple of each other ship. If you haven't gotten at least one yet, it's your loss. Let's move on Hasbro. Jabba's Sail Barge would be great, even if it is 100 or more dollars. I'm sure we could scrape up the pennies to buy it. With the Sandcrawler comming out, I'm sure something can be done off-scale and affordable. Heck other toy companies are making 1/6 scale tanks for 350 a pop, and they're flying off the shelves.

They were written, and re-written 100 to 400 years after his life on earth. Also, many of the books were edited, left out and re-written by Constantine and others to adhere to their own personal beliefs.This documentary is absolutely wonderful at showing Jesus as he was as a man. Instead of the stories told in churches and expanded on over time. The only person who would object to this, are people who only believe what they have been taught in a building on Sunday morning.

When people disbelieve the record of an historic event by those who were there when it happened, and proceed to build a history based on modern opinion, they do err. And to add insult to injury, these moderns love to present their edited versions of history as \\"historic\\" and scholarly.The record of Jesus of Nazareth is found in the New Testament, written for the most part by those who were there with Him. Those who do not like that record (hate the truth?) would be far more respectable if they would simply and honestly admit that they do not believe, instead of inventing endless non-historic versions.Honest seekers of the historic Jesus would do well to start with the New Testament of the Bible and then read the writings of scholars who remain true to the record.Nice try, Mr. Jennings, but your search seems to have led you and will lead many others astray from the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Duped!","review":"Unfortunately, Peter Jennings who I really still like, was duped by so called \\"Bible scholars\\" called the \\"Jesus Seminar\\". Sounds good, but underneath it all, this video promoted their biased belief that the historical Jesus and the Biblical Jesus were different. Rather than being duped as Mr.Jennings was by both titles, prestige, and the rather seemingly innocent sounding name of this group--\\"Jesus Seminar\\" your money would be better spent in the name of \\"a journalistic investigation\\" by viewing the DVD, \\"A Case For Christ\\" by Lee Strobel who himself was a Chicago Tribune reporter and self-proclaimed atheist. In the \\"Case For Christ\\" real \\"students\\" of the Bible are interviewed and you can make up your own mind about the matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of a Great Legacy","review":"I wanted to give this video five stars for one, in order to thwart the religious zealouts who feel by their one-star ratings there are absolutely no redeeming qualities to this report and who hope to discourage others from buying it, and two, to pay tribute to the late Peter Jennings and honor what will now be seen as part of his enduring legacy. He had the curiosity of a child and the doggedness of a pitbull, and I could trust that he pandered to nobody in the search for truth.

His \\"The True Believer\\" was mandatory reading for all students. He was a master at breaking down the facets of the human psyche to help us understand the human need for a cause, a vision, a personality - devine or secular - in which they can transfer (and shed) the inperfect self. This book is a follow-up to his other works of that genre. I still have them and read and reread them when I've needed to refresh my own perspective of the \\"Mass movement\\" and their fanatical followers. Here was a longshoreman who was invited to the White House by President Johnson to chat with him about his world views.

I purchased the Nikon D200 body thinking I could use my existing Nikon suto-focus lenses and flash. I read a review of the new 18-200 lens designed for the D200 and couldn't pass it up. It's great! I'm getting wonderful sharp pictures. The optical anti-vibration feature seems to really work. My only complaint is that Nikon has reversed the positions of the focus and zoom rings otherwise I would have given it 5 starsl. There is no aperture ring on this lens because it's adjustable from the camera. There isn't a macro setting either. Although the lens is a bit heavy, it's worth it to get the obvious picture quality! The lens feels sturdy in the hand. I've noticed some extra resistance operating the zoom while pointing the lens upward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy workmanship","review":"When I bought this lens I noticed that it was made in Thailand. That should have been my first clue. Like all the \\"newer\\" Nikkors it is made with a lot of plastic. After one month of shooting (about 2000 actuations) on an assignment in Japan the zoom stopped working smoothly, then stopped working at all. It also will not stop up or down. I have a lot of other Nikkor lenses that are much more solidly made, but some of them can only be used in the manual mode on my digital cameras. I'm sending it to Nikon's repair facility tomorrow and we'll see what happens. Hopefully they will repair it quickly. It's more than annoying to spend almost $1000 on a lens that fails. This is the first Nikkor lens I have had in 26 years of shooting that has given me any sort of trouble. I guess I was do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nikon Admits Lens is Defective","review":"This lens is seriously flawed. There is not enough friction on the zoom. If you are taking a picture looking up or down, the zoom will not stay where you set it. I have contacted Nikon about the problem, and I was told to carry masking tape with me. Once I set the zoom where I want it, I am supposed to tape it in place. I sent it in to Nikon for repair, and I was told that there is nothing wrong with the lens because all Nikon 18-200mm AF-S VR DX Zoom lenses behave this way. In other words, all of their lenses are defective! I know a professional, studio photographer who grudgingly tapes his lens, but I use my camera in the field.

Finally I received an email today that \\"we have cancelled your order since we can't get it for you from our sources!\\".I guess the lesson I learned is that never order anything in high demand or not available to ship immediately from Amazon.

When the price dropped back down out of the stratosphere, I smashed the piggy bank and grabbed it. I'm glad I did. If you are hitting the end of the 18-55 lens and wishing you could get in just a little closer with each shot, you will love this lens.I've had no problem with creep or excessive stiffness. It is a bit bigger and heavier than the 18-55 but nothing unmanageable. Though it does kind of dwarf my little D40. But I'm ok with that.I haven't used the VR much, so I can't speak to that yet.

Obviously, the photos are amazing quality, but I cannot stand the lag time in between pictures! Even with the VR switched off, the sensor must be so fussy--I can't take the pictures when I need or want to. That can be a big problem. There is minor distortion at 18mm, but there is that with any wide angle lens, so I am not sure if that is even an issue. There is a tightness throughout the zoom and then suddenly a looseness at 200mm. All in all the only good telephoto/wide angle lens you can find for this money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed Lens and bad workmanship","review":"I brought this lens in 2007. First I noticed that when the is lens pointed downward it moves. So you have to hold the lens still and the camera.

By the way, I think the pictures are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest lens bargain from Nikon ever.","review":"I bought the 18-35 zoom 3 or 4 years ago, and it was great. Several years ago I bought the 18-70, and it was also a great bargain. The 18-200 replaces the other two, and in addition is a better lens for most subjects! What do I mean by better? I mean that 8X10 prints show no flaws that are attributable to the lens. However, there is some barrel distortion at short focal lengths, so be careful of architecture. The VR feature works extrememly well, and makes up for the slow aperture at the long end at least for static subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"great lens","review":"i waited a long time before buying this lens..im very happy i finally did.amazing zoom range. the only lens you'll ever need!

The VR on this lens works great and has saved me from many blurred pictures, esp. in the 200mm range. In 35mm format, this lens is 28-300mm which is a really good zoom-telephoto lens. The quality of the pictures is great, and being an AF-S lens, it has the built in silent wave motor (SWM) which gives very fast and accurate focusing. As it is not a fast lens, it may be a bit handicapped in low light situations, but if you are taking an event, a flash would make up for what it lacks, and if you are taking night shots, a tripod would do great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens!","review":"This lens is wonderful!

My Nikkor 18-135mm did not have this issue. However, the 18-200mm VR does suffer from this (known as Zoom Creep). As long as you're aware of the issue, you can work around it.

Many dealers advertise for less, but try and buy it from them, they either don't have in stock or try to sell you everything separate (lens hood, lens cap, lens case, etc. By the time you order everything it cost more that others.The lens is awesome, The vibration reduction is outstanding. I consistently get sharp photos at 1/15 at 200mm. I have taken many sharp photos at 1/8 but not as consistent. You must hold camera stable to be able to so this. There is some barrel distortion at the extreme end , but very acceptable. Some vigneting at some stops but again, totally acceptable. I shot with a D70. Buy this lens its the only lens you'll need!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect replacement lens","review":"Prior to my purchase of this, I was shooting with the Nikon 18-70mm (DX) and Sigma 70-300mm (35mm). Changing lenses was always a chore and the issue of sensor dust gets more prominent with each lens change.The 18-200mm is a very sharp lens at all focal lengths. The slight barrel distortion at 18mm is hardly an issue to me as my shooting varies over all the focal lengths. The DOF at f/3.5-5.6 is sufficient enough to isolate the subject from the background.Being a user of the Nikon Coolpix P4 before I switched to a D70s, I'm glad to have VR back. VR-II works as advertised and allows me to shoot at up to 4 stops lower than could have otherwise been possible. This is invaluable for long range shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW...What a lens!","review":"This Nikon lens does it all!

I hardly had it for 20 days, so I am sending it back to amazon and getting a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"there are better alternatives","review":"I compared Nikon 18-200mm, Sigma 18-200mm and Nikon 18-70mm/Nikon 70-300 mm side by side. At the same focal lengths, Nikon 18-70mm/Nikon 70-300 was better than the Sigma 18-200mm and the Sigma was better than the Nikon 18-200mm in terms of image quality (sharpness and color saturation). If you like the convenience and want to have a wide range zoom lens for your DSLR. The Sigma is better. Alternatively, an advanced all-in-one camera like the Sony H9 or Sony H50 will give you as good or even better picture quality as well as other important features (e.g. wide zoom range, high shutter speed, high ISO, etc)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dust Magnet","review":"Not a good lens for the price. Just got a couple of weeks ago and it has collected more dust in the internal glass than my camera's sensor. It's unbelievable the poor build & to think you pay $600 plus for this lens.

I'm using it with my D300."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nikkor lens that is everything it's cracked up to be!","review":"This vendor got the lens to me just in time for my trip to Argentina. Despite my lack of experience using the lens with my D-200, I got some fantastic photos. I was able to take the one lens and leave the wide-angle and 50mm at home, just as advertised. There is some lens creep, and some tight spaces are still better opened up closer to 12mm, so other lenses are far from becoming obsolete, but if you would rather carry just one, this is your baby. Its wide range (18-200mm) just makes life that much easier, or makes photos possible that you might not otherwise have bothered with... ducks on a fairly distant lake shore in freezing weather, for example!Highly recommend lens, vendor, and Amazon for ease of purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners and if you only had one lens","review":"When I first started with DSLR photography I was stoked about this lensI got it and could not be happier. 18-200mm fast, take it with me everywhere. It sat on my D40 then my D200Then as a photographer I began to grow. I wanted faster lenses, Prime lenses, etc. Since then this lens has sat in my bagI got a feel for how I like my pictures to be taken and what I needed was something faster. If i wanted zoom I wanted something further.Also since i will be moving up to the FX body soon this lens will be useless since it is a DX lens.As a customer decide if what you plan on doing is moving up in photography and taking it to another level,or being happy with prosumer DSLRs with DX lenses.If it is the latter, get this lensOtherwise invest in fx lenses that will grow with you and this expensive hobby"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lense look at my pics","review":"This lense is great because it allows you to move arround at any event and capture a wide variety of shots from wide angles to zoom up, seriously it's a great lense, no it is not as sharp as a 17mm-55mm F2.8, but again it does not cost $1,250 either for wide shots only, but hey I'm just a guy who loves to take photos, you could see my work on myspace or model mayhem find me using this email address [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good walk around lens!","review":"I use this lens a lot when I don't want to swap out lenses and if I know I will not be a low light situation. The VR is great and allows 2-3 stops further than without it. Mine did not have lens creep at first, and then it started creeping after a few months. Too bad Nikon didn't put a lock on the lens barrel. I use an optech camera pouch everywhere I go anyway; when I am not shooting it's in the bag, so the lens creep doesn't bother me as much as it may bother some others. For the convenience of not having to swap lenses, and quality of photos I get, it's worth it. It's not the 70-200mm 2.8 type of quality, but it doesn't cost $2k either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Versatile lens but poor optic quality","review":"This is my personal view of the lens that I have used for over 3 months. I paid a premium cost for this lens since it is always out of stock and I need the lens for my hiking trip in Yosemite and Canada. I have to agree that the zoom lens range is awesome and it is 1 lens for all activities. The optic quality is poor if you compare it to AFS Nikon 18-70mm. I have many Nikon lenses and I have to rate this 2 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding all-rounder","review":"Prior to buying this lens I had the very good 18-70mm as well as the 70-300mm. Problem was most times I went anywhere that wasn't specifically a \\"shoot\\", I'd only take the 18-70. Often times 70mm was just too short, and my 70-300 just wasn't getting used.Enter the 18-200. A lens for almost every situation. No, its not perfect. It has some non-linear distortion at the wide end, but for most times its good enough. Its a relatively compact lens, the VR works outstandingly well, allowing handheld usage as low as 1/6sec.This is the lens that goes on my camera when I don't know what to expect. Great for travelling, great for events. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lens, but you may need an external flash unit","review":"No question about it this is a great lens. But be aware that if you plan on using it with your built-in flash, at wide angle there will be a dark spot on the bottom of your pictures because the flash is so close to the lens. This is not a problem for hot shoe mounted flash units such as the SB-800. So while this lens as often is touted as a good \\"travel lens\\" you may still have to carry a flash unit along. Not a big issue, but something potential buyers should be aware of.Also, you may want to purchase thin lens filter (e.g. Hoya Pro series) to avoid vignetting of wide angle shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"review if partnered with d40","review":"it\`s pretty closed to 5 stars but not perfect because it is too heavy for d40, probably perfect for other bigger nikkons which i dont have. makes it a good everday lens...very flexible but again...heavy for my d40 and seems a poor balance.. pictures come out great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Lens!","review":"I love this lens!

No big deal, I just grab the focus ring and shoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good range, not sharp throughout","review":"I like the range it offers: flexible and convenient to use one lense in the field. It's not as sharp as I expected, plus it extends out when zooming in, increasing the likelihood of dust getting inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piece of equipment.","review":"Got this lens with my Nikon D300. After reading the reviews I was a little worried I would have some of the issues reported by other users here on Amazon. But after getting the lens and using it for the past few weeks I am very pleased. The lens is quite heavy but feels sturdy and is well balanced with the larger D300 body. The autofocus is fast and accurate and the resulting images are sharp with nice contrast and color rendition. Its great to go out with a single lens that can cover a wide range of shooting situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nkon 18-200","review":"Very forgiving, flexible, light lens with great optics.

And it did the same for my daughter when she saw it some years ago, when she herself was 7 (child abuse? no: she's a sane 21-year-old now). As reviewers below note, it's a pretty sappy comedy, but amusing for all that. And if you're a kid, the zombies are SCARY! And the hypos full of zombie juice are REALLY SCARY! So: watch this for mindless fun if you're an adult, or show it to an impressionable kid for a creepy thrill. This gets 5 stars for nostalgia value (for me)-- your mileage may vary...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombies on Broadway Not one of Lugosi's Best","review":"This movie is a strange little video featuring Alan Carney, Wally Brown and the \\"star\\", Bela Lugosi.

The gangster sends the two daffy guys to the island of San Sebastian to find a \\"real\\" zombie for the opening. Bela Lugosi plays the mad scientist who creates zombies on the island. The plot is pretty predictable as the two PR guys get into one misadventure after another in the land of voodoo. Lugosi has become a caricature of himself by the time this movie was released in 1944.

This movie come out in the peak of pre-college frat-boy films such as ''American Pie'',''Bring it on'' and ''Get Real'' but in it's urban turnout and hip-hop genre it was only proper to make one. Deon Richmond really makes this movie, he adds meat into the bones of the chuckling. Mostly because he is funny without much effort - and Stoney Jackson adds a nice antagonistic humor to it just to balance the scale. Anyone can relate to this film - it starts out funny and it's tone gets mature withing it 3rd stage. Indicting that it's okay to have our heads in the clouds but our feet need to be planted on solid ground. A keeper nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black films' nadir?","review":"The only highlight of this movie is turning the channel.

She forces the daughter Billie(Cassandra Kane) to sleep on the sofa while she entertains men. She loathes her daughter for ruining her life. While Billie is afraid of the outside world, she is forced to leave the house because she is hungry, a simple trip that becomes an adventure. It is a story of how abuse, alcoholism, and madness runs in a family.I didn't like the plot, the characters, the acting, or the dialouge. It reminded me of a bad 70's drive-in movie second feature.

I agree completely with the reviewer \\"Helel\\" in that it's childish and dull. There is hardly any story and the main character is uncharismatic and very juvenile. Some good parts like Ethereal Queen and Valkyrie show how superior those games truly are.Star Ocean 3 is much, much better than this third rate game which fails to deliver on so many levels. The goofy behaviour is just awful and makes you think this is aimed at those 12 and under. There are almost no interesting fights, and some very dull enemies.A real disgrace to the name of Valkyrie Profile and Star Ocean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This is one of the most memmorable ps2 game that I have ever played beside from Dragon Quest 8. it took me over 50 hours to do two sides of the stories thats right 2.

It is not an amazing or mind blowing game with all kinds of new widgets and such. It keeps to a basic rpg format and story line, but has a sense of humor that you will not find often enough in these sort of games. While the story line is not very original it keeps me interested.

This game. HAS NONE OF IT. I trudged myself to finish this game because I couldn't return it and I must say the game is COMPLETELY horrible. The sole reason why I'm giving this game ONE star is because the storyline was kind of interesting. However, the ending was horrible and if you really want to know what happens in the game go to radiata stories wikia and read it.The battle system is boring, with only two real commands you can only use to attack. The main character is arrogant and does NOT mature at all throughout the story. The world map is horrible too because enemy encounters are almost unavoidable because of the narrow paths.I am warning you now. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I wasted 9 dollars to buy this and I STILL REGRET IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly appaling","review":"Tri-ace made good games once they were called Star ocean and Valkyrie profile. This poor excuse is way below them in terms of quality.It's a very childish and immature game, not a patch on the seminal kingdom hearts, It's not surprising that kids seem to be the ones enjoying it the most. It has a dull battle system unlike SO3 and has an almost non-existent storyline.

Also the combat was really lame, it was one button and if you hit a guy enough times you could do a power hit... yeah super exciting, but it was really boring and the whole game looks really cartoonish, like kingdom hearts... another bad game if you ask me who thought it would be could to put final fantasy and disney together?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This game was really bad and it [...] If you ever think of uying this game remember that it wont worth your money.

(I actually don't know - I wasn't born yet). Yet this is a fabulous (if mistitled) recording. It certainly isn't difficult music to like, though it did take some time for me to warm to Ad Lib in Nippon. There is a certain color to the tunes that only a larger ensemble can provide. The playing is very polished, but still sounds jazzy and at tmes exotic. My favorite tune is probably Tourist Point of View, but it seems everyone has his own pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it away","review":"Living in Australia it is very difficult to obtain regency romances and it is therefore doubly disappointing when a book is as poorly written as this one.It started well enough, with a tall misunderstood heroine and a clearly delineated hero, tantalisingly in absentia for several chapters. Small solecisms such as calling a lady of quality a 'bird of paradise' (slang for a courtesan), whilst annoying, are minor details. From there on it goes downhill.Character development is minimal, unlikely situations abound and the continual bandying of bad-tempered words gives a disagreeable tone to the whole story. Oddly enough, considering that the heroine's flaw in the eyes of society is her height, another unlikeable character is continually ridiculed for her weight. Regencies need an underlying good humour and light touch to succeed and this one was tedious indeed. It went straight into the charity bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's something here.","review":"An extremely esoteric, bizarre, rambling disc that will most likely sound like random crap the first 80 times you listen to it; gradually it starts to sound like something else. I'm certain now that that something was intentionally put there, but even having owned this disc for over a year, I don't think I fully understand it. The combo of clattering drums and flailing bass and alternately shouted/whispered vocals is weirder than any free jazz I've ever heard. There is a unique energy here I've never heard anyplace else, though. 1000 years could go by and I doubt anyone would ever make an album like this again.

The \\"He and I\\" of the title might as well be two close friends commenting on all the details of life and faith, without heavy theology, but with a delightful freshness. \\"He\\" is the voice Gabrielle Bossis hears in her mind, and believes to be the Lord. I devoured this book in a matter of days, though it is written like a diary with entries over several years. I found myself feeling bereft after I finished it, feeling the loss of \\"my Jesus\\", as he asked Gabrielle to call him.

It is so sweet the way the Lord tells Gabrielle how much he yearns for her love and companionship just as we all yearn for someone to love us and notice us.We are all seeking for attention and yearning for that special love, and this book is a confirmation that there is Someone to love each one of us in a very special way. While it was Gabrielle who heard the Lord's voice, this book was meant to reach out to all of us. When you read it, you feel as if you are being watched tenderly by a sweet invisible presence that yearns to love you."},{"rating":"2","title":"He and I","review":"He and I is one of the most motivating books I have read in a long time.

On this watch, though, you push the stem in to set the watch. And when the stem is in, the watch stops! For a while, the resistance was great enough that I never noticed the backwards orientation. But after a couple of months I began finding my watch stopped several times a day. It has gotten to the point that I'm setting my watch nearly every time I look at it! Not exactly a desirable characteristic in a chronometer!Too bad, as this was a very pretty watch.

The meandering mish-mash of drum machines and random samples (pun intended) is not what I call entertainment. Most of the songs, if you can call them that, are unrecognizable and seemingly unrelated to originals. They even have the gall to include a track from Random! If you are a devoted Numanoid, and have to have any and all material that is even in the least bit associated with Numan, go ahead and buy this.

I have the Sony PS3 hooked up to the TV via HDMI, and I have the digital optical out on the TV going into this receiver and the surround sound is great on Blu-ray and PS3 Games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Theater System!","review":"Great system. It's as advertised. Can't wait to get it set up permanently down in the family room!It's now Jan '09 and I love the system. The only \\"con\\" I have is something that I saw critiqued earlier. Who was the engineer that designed the speakers? God what a mistake. They would only stand up on a hardwood floor, with no breeze .... MAYBE!! My guess is he never set it up and tested it. I would put that engineer in the \\"box\\" that I put Tech Writers in! I plan on mounting small plates to the bottom of some of the speakers and that will solve my problem. I wouldn't recommend this only because of the speaker shapes. Otherwise, I love the setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems so far!","review":"Ordered this to go with a new Samsung 56\\" LCD DLP also purchased right here. Easy hookup plus the remotes are the same for both units. To tell you the truth, I have not used it for anything but DVD playback so I don't know yet what CDs will sound like. When we built our home 13 years ago, I recessed 4 Bose speakers high in our very large livingroom and have hooked them up to the HT-X70, along with the center channel speaker and the sub woofer. When watching an action movie with explosions and other warfare sound effects, you can FEEL the sound as much as hear it--it's great! The DVD player makes our regular DVDs really come to life with sharp, vivid images. For $300, I could not be happier with the purchase, plus the shipping was FAST and delivery trouble free! I would not hesitate to use Amazon again---very happy and satisfied with the whole experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"lemons","review":"Great system if it worked properly. Our first receiver would play the sound and video out of sync and would take forever to load one time and load it right away the next time. We exchanged the first one and it worked a little bit better but would make a loud humming sound, and would skip randomly for no reason with brand new media. Everybody seems to love samsung but we've had bad luck with this brand. Had a camera that died right after the 30 day warranty was up. We took the system back to the store and will never buy this brand again no matter how nice it may look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Femcee ever...and not just out of the ones you don't know","review":"This Album is in english, but she raps in 2 languages for a start, the other being her native Swedish. This album has 100% on all tracks and the album has a kinda hippy Da.I.S.Y age vibe too it. So this would suite the fans of jazzy poetics. Standout tracks being Hush Hush, The Royal Hunter and Nothing is Not. Check youtube for samples and all I will say is, this is one of the few albums I would be glad to pay the highest Amazon Price for.Trust me on this one, my tastes Range from DJ Shadow to the artists he sampled like Pekka Pahjola and Nirvana(the 60s UK Band). From rappers like The Stones throw Collective to metal bands like Toxikk and Destruction, so I have a varied taste and should know one or two things about music.Though this may not be for all tastes, fans of the jazzy hippie hop kinda flavour will love this to death!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly formatted and no TOC","review":"This is a free book so you can't complain TOO much, but I wasn't happy with it.There is no Table of Contents to help you navigate. There is no cover image. The chapters bleed into each other. And overall it is just poorly formatted.If you don't mind these things then go ahead and download it. After all its free!But if you end up not liking it I would recommend going with one of the paid anthologies. They are not that expensive, they have the complete series, and they are generally formatted better.The one I went with isWizard of Oz Series: 15 Books, Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Marvelous Land, Dorothy and the Wizard, Road to Oz, Rinkitink, Tik-Tok, Emerald City, Ozma, Lost Princess, Patchwork Girl, Glinda of Oz AND MORE!and I am extremely happy with the purchase.Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is wonderful!","review":"I bought this book because my sons and I (6 & 8) have been choosing classics to read through.

I like it because the situations seem real and so do the characters. I think my favorite is the Tin Woodman and Dorothy. The book is about Dorothy, her dog, and three other friends. They are determined to go to the Wizard of Oz (sound familiar?). It's very different from the movie, though the movie was great too. I love Judy Garland.This actually isn't my edition, all though it is a Dover edition. The illustrations by W. W. Denslow are the best ones that I've seen and it's just really a good book.

The main thing being the fact that Dorothy (who is supposed to be, i believe, 8) was played by someone who was definitely NOT 8. Not even close. Originally, Shirley Temple was supposed to be cast but the studio would not lend her so judy Garland got the job. The movie is very different from the book.

It's that good. It proves the notion that record company executives are idiots; How could they have let this sit in the vaults for 35 years? It's recorded on the last night of the Fillmore West's existance, and Santana was the closing act that night. The band was on fire and the recording and mixing is as good as any live performance you'll find - even being as old as it is - it's a jewel! It's basically a live version of the third album (which is the first disc in the set), but it blows it out of the water. I'll go so far as to say that this ranks up there with the greatest live albums of all time.I've never been a big Santana fan, and this is the first Santana CD in my large collection, but this CD changes that. I'm looking forward to getting the first two albums now. Where have I been all these years?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana III","review":"This is my favorite album of them all,Great thick guitar sounds for that time this album is amazing,plus the live versions for any SANTANA fan that was there when this came out this is a treat a lot of people don't know the Santana from the 70's,that wasn't comercial music at all,that was the real deal I recomend this 2 CD package!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Head supports became unglued","review":"I purchased this helmet for my three year old.

But I bought it anyway because it was on sale, and I like to have everything Romanov. But as it turned out, it grew on me like a fungus. Now it is one of my treasures, I look through it often, it is so full of pictures of artifacts you won't see in any other Romanov book and it thus gives color to a world that is otherwise in black and white. Pictures of the members of the extended family were also fascinating and also got me interested in them, though NAOTMAA are still my favorites. What a pity I didn't get to see the exhibition, but this book is I think as close as you'll ever get to the real thing, unless you get the chance to see the palaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"poignant and exquisite details of a vanished world","review":"This book is one of my treasures, and a must for anyone wishing to know more about the lost world of Tsar Nicholas and Alexandra.

The notes are also extremely well written, adding to the pleasure of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"'After The Storm' (Receiver Records)","review":"As some interested parties might ask when they spot this item, what on earth IS this release? Looks to me like a cheesy split CD. Thank goodness there aren't too many of these around. You get four (4) New York Dolls tunes plus four (4) Sex Pistols cuts. I, mean what's the point here? For die hards and no-life collectors ONLY. I could just see a copy of this CD in some run down used record store with a steep price tagged onto it, with the lame-ass employee claiming, \\"It's a collector's item\\". Give me a break people, they're ALL collector's items, right? I don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dolls London Recordings","review":"These were the second demos recorded by the Dolls.

Poorly recorded and produced it just seems like this band could have done more with this material than they did with this release. Honestly I have heard better recordings from unsigned garage bands than this CD! MxPx is a great band that seems to be around past there time in the spotlight and this album really shows the decline in there music. I don't reccommend this CD but I do reccommend picking up everything before this CD and Before Everything & After."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a new punkrock release that's actually good...","review":"So punkrock's not dead after all.... MxPx proof it to us on their latest release \\"panic\\", I find it a breath of fresh air. I don't really know their last records, but I heard they were really mellow. I do know \\"Life in General\\", wich was a REALLY fast mean loud record. The new one qualifies as punkrock to me as well, although it's more radio friendly, at least it's not as bad as the latest No use for a name, NOFX or dare I say Bad Religion?For a normal release its okay, for a punkrock release in 2005 - its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure awesomeness","review":"Its almost mind blowing to think that MxPx has put out so many cds and was still able to amaze and awe me with this one! It has a little bit everything for everybody. It has a touch of past MxPx while perfectly combining their newer styling on \\"Before everything and after\\". Some fans didn't like the change that was made with beaa and some new fans didnt care to much for their older stuff I think this album is a happy medium which please both old and new fans. It sounds even more amazing live so check them out on this summers warped tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panic","review":"At first I thought this album would be a lot like Before EVerything and after which I was sorely dissapointed with but this album is so much better. I would say this is at least in the top three of the best albums they have done. I have been listening to them since their start and I was going to give up on them but this album helped me believe again. It has more punk songs with hardly any bubble gum pop and even some songs on here suprised me with how hard they are. Buy it what do you have to lose!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"I own around 15 mxpx cd's, and like all of them, but I have to say that this is their best cd so far, and it still sounds like the classic mxpx i love. its a little bit darker than their past cds, some fast, hard songs, some slow, but it all flows great. its an awesome record"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"When I first bought this album, I thought it was okay. I was used to songs like \\"Punk Rawk Show\\" and \\"Chick Magnet\\", so this was not what I expected. After a week or so I began to like it.After buying the previous album \\"Before Everything and After\\" I realized how much better Panic was than that album. I listened to Panic again and loved it.The album starts out with the fast song \\"Darkest Places\\", which goes to the next song \\"Young and Depressed\\". The lyrics for that song are amazingly written! More great songs have the classic MxPx maturity (mature in a good way), only with a darker touch.If you liked oldschool MxPx, you'll love this. It may have to grow on you, but once it does it will be one of your favorite albums ever. Give yourself a treat and buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Need To Panic","review":"This cd is MXPX at their best. I have always been a huge fan of MXPX and of all their previuos cds. The thing that this cd does best though, is that it is basically a mixture of everything MXPX has done before. It is a completely new sound for them, but this cd mixes pop punk songs,like \\"Call in Sick\\", and hard punk songs, like \\"Get Me Out\\". This cd is a great start for anyone who has not heard MXPX before or anyone looking for an all around good rock album. Buy this cd, you will not be disappointed. Trust me, I have had for almost 9 months now and it still blows me away. In fact, I have listened to it twice today. Again I will tell you to buy this cd, you cant go wrong with it and it has a great price.Thanks for reading and happy listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MXPX good punk rock","review":"This is probably one of the best ablum of the last few MXPX ablums. Everyone sounds great vocals, gutiar, bass and drums. Also hear the bass alot more. Great sing alongs and power punk songs. Alot of rock and not so much just straight punk the whole time. If your a fading fan of MXPX, this ablum should bring you right back up. I know it did for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chaos, \\"Emotional Anarchist\\" style; Panic!","review":"I have been blown away once again. Mxpx managed to make another album that ranks with \\"Life in General\\" and \\"Before, Everything & After.\\" Panic is so different than any of their previous records and is lyrically something totally new. The song \\"Emotional Anarchist\\" has to be my new favorite song. I could listen to it all day! Also, I heard the song \\"grey skies turn blue\\" on MxPx's accoustic EP and thought it was decent. The 'non-accoustic' version on this record makes my heart beat and blood flow. The Keyboard part alone on \\"Grey Skies Turn Blue\\" sends goose bumps through my body! It is just amazing! The whole record rocks and is a definate must have in anyone's CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panic = Amazing!","review":"Mxpx has come out with a truly amazing cd.

Snug fit; sizing is accurate but keep in mind it's a form fitting jacket. Order up if you want it to be roomy. Great for running as it's so lightweight. Love the thumb holes, hoody and pockets. Wore it out with at t-shirt in below 30 degree weather with a scarf, hat and gloves and was totally fine. I've also gotten lots of great compliments on it. It's a durable product; I'd expect it to last a long time.

I have used this guy's methods since 1972, when I got my first dog as a young adult and had to train it myself. I did what he recommended, and it worked. There is nothing in there recommending harming a dog - it all makes sense.I had a Golden Retriever - in a city (Boston), and the lessons she (and I) learned from the methods in the book - quite literally - saved her life. I could send her on the dead run, and stop her with a command; she would walk next to me - in traffic - and stay in a \\"heel\\" position; when I went to graduate school, she would stay in a \\"down\\" position on the steps of the Library for an hour.Great Book"},{"rating":"2","title":"great step by step","review":"great basic obedience training methods.

Any method is only as good as the trainer using it, and if you have poor timing or inconsistent communication (as most of my dog class participants & all novice trainers do at first) the only damage you do to the dog with motivational, reward-based training, is that it takes longer to train. On the other hand, I am faced with at least one case a month of a fearful dog who was trained with techniques similar to Koehler's that is now dangerously aggressive.

I have tried numerous other dog-training books with little or no success with my stubborn Chesapeake Bay Retriever. You must read the book from page one or you may think the training is extremely harsh and cruel, but it is not, the training methods will make your dog understand that when you talk it must listed and obey. I now walk my dog at the healing position with or without the leash, she sits and stays even when there are numerous distractions (I can even pull on her leash and she will not move without a voice command), she retrieves on command, she comes when I call her, and I can go on and on. People always ask me where she was trained and are always surprised with my answer. This is a win/win situation, because she is such a good dog I take her everywhere and that means she spends less time alone.

I found this book to be very harsh, loaded with sarcasm, and the author nasty toward other methods of dog training.

My dog was trained \\"Dog Whisperer\\" style (check out Cesar Milan's book!) and she's a very well trained puppy at 8 months, which just goes to show there's more than one way of doing things and you don't have to be harsh to be effective. I'm a teacher and I've found that it's not just people who grow and learn best with praise and encouragement, it works for dogs too.

This book is archaic. The methods are outdated, and while some may say that this style of training worked for their dog, there are plenty more who would point out that this type of heavy handed training created more problems then it ever solved. There are, quite simply, too many good dog training books on the market to bother wasting money on this one. If you want to train your dog using fast, fun, and friendly (believe it or not, you can actually train your dog in a friendly manner, something Koehler seemed to have missed out on) manner, check out titles by Dunbar, Pryor, Arden, Jones, to name just a few.

I bit of a startle or mild pain is not a bad thing. But, when I got to page 38 where he advocates using a length of washer hose with a wooden dowel in it to strike a dog on the muzzle to correct some biting behaviors, I reached my limit. If you are trying to save yourself from a dog attack, then fine. But, this is supposed to be a correction??Maybe I am just a too tender-hearted person, but there has got to be better ways than this.

However, he did learn his commands. This method might work for a tough type of dog. But do NOT subject a sensitive dog to this, it WILL be counter-productive.

It seems that by using some of Koehler's methods you could win the battle, but lose the war;that is, you stop the behavior, but the dog doesn't like you anymore.What point is it to have a pet that doesn't like you or is afraid of you?Does submissive urination make for a better dog? Also, many professional trainers don't recommend painful punishment techniques for beginner dog trainers.Incredibly, this book lacks any discussion of socialization - essential for preventing fear aggression.I also question Koehler's assumption that dogs have evil, vindictive motives.I would recommend \\"The Culture Clash\\" by Jean Donaldson.

People who say that this method is inhumane has not read the whole book. This method is used as a last resort for many difficult and aggressive breeds that other methods have failed.

The influences are many and varied, but the overriding one is country and folk blues - but with a real modernist twist and some great production effects. The opening track I heard on the radio and it alone made me buy the CD; it sounded to me a great deal like Alison Kraus's band Union Station, whom I love, and could listen with or without Alison (great though she is) anytime. But Chapman was also sort of darker and a little wierder - he evidently brings his own shtick to the tradition, in particular some really interesting percussion sounds and rhythms. Often in these compositions (which are exclusively instrumental, btw) there are mesmeric passages which are almost Reichian. All told, a wonderfully creative and inventive spin on the Grand Old Opree."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for web designers.

The hangar is durable, what more could you want? a tow truck for the love of GOD? :-) C'mon, it's only a few dollars and worth much more!.... I wanna hear the \\"buy with one click\\" CLICK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and convenient","review":"I just took up violin to learn with my kindergarten Suzuki-er. I figured we would be more inclined to practice if the violins were easy to get to so I got this for mine (4/4) to try it out. The violin sits in the hanger nicely and the bow hangs the way it should. Installation was done by my husband but there was no swearing so I'm assuming it went pretty easily.I wasn't able to find the smaller size on Amazon for my son's 1/8 violin so I tried it on this one. His will sit in this hanger without hanging on the pegs though it's not as secure as with the bigger one."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are leaders, yes - now hear us roar!","review":"This is a wonderful book that should bolster the confidence of all the women who read it. But I would add one very important item: women show far too much humility about their talents and skills. If we want people to value our skills, we must first show that we value ourselves - by making sure our accomplishments are visible to targeted audiences. If we want people to hire us, buy from us, and invest in our companies, they have to know who we are, what we have accomplished and why they should do business with us! Self-promotion is not bragging. It is a valuable business tool that careerwomen must add to their strategies for success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent insights on female leadership qualities","review":"The author captures many of the unique aspects of female leadership missing from corporate America -- in its old and new economy iterations.Wachs-Book uses clear examples to illustrate how specifically \\"female\\" problem-solving attributes can enhance a comany's leadership portfolio. Her commentary on women's rule-creating and not rule-following qualities rings especially true.This is an excellent read for people participating in the process of creating and evolving their organizations' senior management teams."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best book I ever read. A MUST READ!","review":"I loved this book. I usually read fiction but this book captured my interest right away. I especially enjoyed learning about the backgrounds and personalities of these intriguing women. Wachs Book has done thorough research and has made clear the parellels between these \\"new paradigm leaders\\" from whom we can all learn something. Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to prove her point","review":"This book is easy to read, but it's not well written. That aside, Book fails to prove her point that what makes female leaders so successful is because of 'unique female' traits. In fact, other than the usually female stereotyped traits of 'compassion, collaboration, and empathy', which men, too, can learn, the other success traits: courage, being a good listener, seeing new opportunities, etc. are not innately female. It's almost insulting to get to the end of the book and see that she has just slapped short shallow bios of female executives, probably the ones who declined an interview with her. The biggest shame of this book is that the women profiled are incredibly admirable for what they've accomplished, but not 'just' because they are women."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sexist and sad book","review":"Why women should buy this book? Are they really in need for this kind of \\"confidence boost\\" or we already know that women can compete head-to-head with men?My advice is simple: If you need this book, then you should look for a career where you don't need to compete with anyone, neither man or woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I have to make my entrance right now!\\"","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews; in that, Johnny Depp delivers yet another tour de force performance. And if you're a Depp fan (and I am) then you'll enjoy this movie. If; however, you are not overly enthusiastic about Johnny Depp then you will not have the patience to sit through this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo.","review":"I am in absolute awe over this film. The Libertine is pure genius. I simply cannot believe how wonderful it is. Generally, I have to watch movies in several spouts. This movie had my attention the entire time.(You can read other reviews for a synopsis.)The acting alone was marvelous. It was like speaking in rhyme. I could almost close my eyes and hear the orchestra playing the character's melody. I open them again to see the words floating out of a lavish Johnny Depp's mouth. It is marvelous! Johnny Depp is a fantastic actor.I cannot believe that this is the first time I have encountered Samantha Morton. Where has she been hiding? Her performance as Lizzy Barry alone warrants a standing ovation.Great acting. Great Film! Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking speech","review":"I loved the entire movie. It is a Johnny Depp fan/English major's wet dream but other than that there is a scene near the end between Johnny and his wife when he is begging to come home that is incredible. I think it is one of his best moments on film. I loved the realism of the set, the filth and beauty of that time-the costumes etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Style. No Substance.","review":"Because I love Johnny so much I'm going to forgive him for this one. For all of it's fantastic costumes, seedy lighting and controversial subject matter this film was suprisingly bland and painfully slow. I would say it's about 40 minutes too long. I give two stars. One for Johnny and one for Malkovich. Both are fantastic actors and I think they did the best they could with this. It's a shame it's so poorly written because there's so much potential. Great actors and a fascinating subject matter. There's absolutely no chemistry between any of the characters and it's a completely forgettable film. About as interesting as listening to Uncle Ed relive tales of his wild college days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feh!","review":"What a thoroughly nasty movie this is. Was that really the intention of those who bear responsibility? What was Johnny Depp thinking? Did I detect a (self-mocking?) hint of Jack Sparrow here and there? I used to think J.D. could do no wrong, which is why I bought this in spite of the negative reviews. Even the sex is about as unerotic as it can get, sort of like the daydreams of particularly repulsive virgin adolescent boys. Is John Malkovich hiding under all that make up? Well he might."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly developed story, horrible cinematography","review":"Like many of the reviewers, I am a fan of both Depp and Malcovich, and that is why I watched this movie. It never came to a theatre near me and now I know why. This screenplay was poorly written and the storyline did not develop in a clear and concise manner. I was often left confused, wondering what had just happened, because is was assumed that the viewer had complete knowledge of Rochester's life prior to viewing this film. I couldn't decided whether the story was focusing on Rochester's life or on his love affair with Elizabeth. Whichever it was, neither storyline was developed enough and it resulted in a dull movie with very little in the way of entertainment. The cinematography was awful. The picture was grainy, leaving me wondering if I had forgotten my glasses or that, perhaps, I had rented a bootleg copy of the film. While the acting was decent, nothing could help the horrible story and even worse cinematography. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, surprise","review":"Im really astounded by how well this movie has been rated. I love Depp and I thought it was terrible. I think he wanted to do something a bit different and dark but this movie is just sort of pointless. It's about the English restoration and the rebirth of the theatre during a time when sex and murder and general taboo subjects were unacceptable but rampant. It takes the nature of the period to the extreme and was overall terrible. It acted like it was very profound but conveyed very little. It had potential to be an incredible movie but if you're looking for a Depp fix- just pick up something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped, overestimated, overdone","review":"First of all, let me start by saying that the only reason I didn't give this movie 1 star is because the acting was good. However, without an engaging plot and with the overextended monologues and dialogues, as well as the dreary sets and general lack of beauty except for some very brief scenes, this movie is not in the least bit entertaining. I watched all the way through waiting for something to happen, but nothing really did. To be honest, it's very boring, and not even the very fine Johnny Depp or the touted importance of the subject-matter could save it.Watch it only if you're an insomniac. It might work better for you than Lunesta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darkness Abounds","review":"I did not enjoy this movie. The actors were interesting to watch, but the movie as a whole was too dark for me. There was nothing beautiful or light or pretty about the life this film displayed.It showed a dirty, filthy time filled with dirty and filthy people who seemed very selfish in their conquest. Even when the main character wanted to be profound, it lacked something but I'm not sure what.The Libertine was not an enjoyable experience for me. It was dark and a bit empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, dark, sad","review":"I found the movie very boring. I fell asleep twice before I could finish the movie. I was very dissapointed because I love Johnny Depp's movies. This one needs to go into the trash and stay there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discusting","review":"I would have rated this movie lower, but you didn't have any negative numbers! I love Johnny Depp, but this movie was revolting, discusting and I was terribly disappointed. I'm sure it was accurate for the time period, but depravity is not my cup of tea! Guess I'm a prude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Movie","review":"I saw all the revies for this movie and was expecting a dark enjoyable tale about a libtertine. I was strongly mistaken. Johnny Depp is a great actor with great abilites, but this is the worst movie of his I have ever seen. Even his \\"cheesy\\" movies were better than this. The rated R rating is light. I couldn't believe how pornographic it was. Even in Quills, it wasn't as raunchy as this. Don't waste your money or your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag me with a spoon!!!","review":"I found this film to be a total waste of otherwise good talent. It should be rated X. I didn't know \\"Johnny\\" could stoop so low. It made me want to barf!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark, sickening, and depressing masterpiece!","review":"After the long awaited release I have finally seen it. Despite the critics review I found it very interesting and loved Johnny's performance, it is definatly one of his best and darkest roles. Samantha is also very very good and plays the passionate actress better than Jane Eyre any day. If you are grossed out easily I wouldn't suggest this movie, but if you are a hard core Johnny fan suck it up and watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did He Make This Movie???

No wonder I never heard of it. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for Blu-Ray release","review":"This film is an awesome display of Jonny Depp's talent. His final speech to save the King in the House of Lords is worthy of critical aclaim. True, this is indeed a very dark film. But, Depp comes through in a way we have never seen him before. I hope he is given another role which gives him the chance to exercise his considerable talent.Marcus"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is an amazing movie on all levels. This is not a \\"Hollywood\\" movie so if you want great battle scenes and explosions this isn't the one for you. This is a great piece of historical fiction based on an extremely interesting character. The sub plots weave throughout flawlessly instead of distracting. Even the bit parts were played to perfection. How it makes it's final point is intelligent and heartbreaking. Top 10 movies of all time for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film that's Hard to Recommend","review":"Depp's character begins the film telling us that we will not like him, and spends the rest of the film trying to prove his point. Unfortunately, the lower the chatacter sinks, the more pathetic he becomes. Tour de force performance by Depp (again).This is one of those films that I loved but cannot recommend. It's definitely a matter of taste and temperament whether one would like this film. Even die-hard Depp fans may have some issues, but if you're willing to brave the journey, I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was hypnotized....","review":"Johnny Depp has gone from obscure guy on 21 jump street to sheer brilliance onscreen. This man is one of the best actors because he takes risks and believes in what he does. I was riveted, and couldn't take my eyes off him for a single second, even when it become hard to look. I wanted to be one the women he was with if just a second. This movie's cinematography is brilliant. It was shot as though you were looking at a colorized silent movie. Dark, ugly at times, but always hypnotic and not easy to forget. This movie is a sheer triumph of what superb acting can do to bring compelling historical figures lives to the masses. See this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Normally A Fan Of Period Peaces","review":"But, upon seeing this on cable more than once, Johnny Depp gives an absolutely mermerizing performance that has to be seen to be believed. I can't see any other actor out there who could do with this role what Depp did. Great writing for Depp and he delivers. This film is a true chronicle to sly debauchery and you won't find a better messenger than Johnny Depp in this role. One of those rare movies with a great beginning, middle and ending. If you are like me and might be prejudiced into thinking it isn't your cup of tea, give it a chance. The worst you will see is a performance worthy of an Oscar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mud and Poetry","review":"Lit by candles during overcast weather; almost as muddy as Mel Gibson's Diggervision flicks. And you'd better love 17th-century poetry.For a more interesting version, look up John Wilmot, 2nd earl of Rochester, in Wikipedia, and read it.It's a lot more fun. Although Johnny Depp with a silver nose IS interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denise Adkins","review":"It was stupid. Johnny Depp has done better.

HIS CHARACTER IS SO BAD THAT YOU CAN'T STAND HIM. HE PLAYS THIS ROLE SO WELL. GOOD MOVIE THOUGH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive piece of bawdy tragedy","review":"This is a very entertaining film with great acting. The story is slightly OTT but has some great moments in it, especially between Johnny Depp (a great performance from him) and either John Malkovich or Samantha Morton, who are also outstanding.This story draws you in & in places repels, but it's very entertaining and pretty dark. Recommended.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depp Delivers Depth","review":"True to form, Depp delivers The Libertine facet by spellbinding facet. Set in bewigged 17th Century England, Depp's Earl of Rochester stands out as the real deal among many posers. Emphasizing a connection between the royal court and art which has since faded into decadence, Rochester's well-being relies on how he weilds both his talent and his philosophy. Underneath a choatically cynical and rebellious narcissistic image lies a true passion for both art and romance, used in the classical sense. Malkovich is perfect as the King, and it is a pleasure to see some stars from \\"Coupling\\" in the cast. Passionate, romantic, poetic, artistic and debauched, this film made me think of nothing so much as the rock 'n roll world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave a record?","review":"THE LIBERTINEa movie starring Johnny Depp, Samantha Morton, John Malkovich & Rosamund Pike about the 2nd Earl of Rochester named John Wilmot. I'm not certain what I think of this one. I enjoyed the sets & costumes & the acting even more so. I'm just not certain why anyone would make a movie about this life.It seemed predictable & basically worthless, requiring no insight whatsoever. Why leave a record of it? The most fantastical part of the movie was that there was skill & talent displayed in it's making, but apparently to no end at all, unless as a mindless machine records history. It was a strange movie-going experience for me. I can't think of a single aspect of the story that is worth repeating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depp at his best","review":"If you are a Johnny Depp fan, this work of art is by far at the top of the list. It is thrilling to see an actor so very talented and it is my opinion that there is no one in the field today that could have pulled this role off. It is indeed no comedy, and as dark as the night but to come away from the theatre unable to stop raving about his performance puts this movie on my list of viewing over and over again. It should have been an oscar for Depp. You may have never heard of the poet or of his short and sordid life but you WILL remember Depps protrayal of this man. True to life in costumes, scenery, props, conditions of the time and even down to the lighting. They may not be pretty or to our liking but the morals and lives in that period of time have been documented in history. Have an open mind, concentrate on Depp, his talent, go back in time with him in this period film and you will find out your answer to his question, \\"How do you like me now?\\" Yeah, he's got my vote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting but awful plot and filming.","review":"The filming was grainy and at times brown tinted probably to give the movie an old feel to it. I thought it hindered this movie which should have been filmed with a brighter lense and without grain. As I believe the grainy filming distracted from the complexities of the costumes and atmosphere.John Depp of course is probably the best actor around these days and he did a great job acting in this movie.The problem with this movie was the plodding plot. The boring and cold relationships with each characters and the lack of action were also other problems. At times the movie was redundant and it dragged on for too long.This movie represents a typical tragic romance with little actual love or lust and a lot of disease and death towards the end. Basically it was hard to feel any sympathy for the characters in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Acting, Dark Movie","review":"Johnny Depp gives another sterling performance, this time as John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester, and there are strong performances by John Malkovich and Samantha Morton, but overall, the movie is dark and disturbing. But I suspect that's what it was supposed to be. Critics may love this movie because of the performances, but I doubt many viewers who just want to be entertained will like it. While the performances are first rate,the movie is curtained in despair, much like the lead character.I didn't enjoy this movie, but I didn't turn it off, either. Johnny Depp was just too intriguing, and the interplay among Malkovich, Depp and Morton, too complex and fascinating. There's good dialogue in this movie, realistic settings and great costuming. But it's not a fun movie to watch. If you're looking for an uplifting, fun evening, skip this one. If you want to watch experienced and talented actors performing at their best with an intellectual script, this movie is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"An interesting paradox for the period drama fan, is your allegiance to the genre strong enough for the [...] to become defensible even though it's essentially the antithesis of the kind of sensibility you must have like the genre in the first place? If I didn't know better I'd wonder if Dani from Cradle Of Filth had some part in writing or directing this. Honestly though, your average 90s action blockbuster has longer more graphic sex scenes than this film. The majority of the [...] is verbal. Is the John Wilmot character unlikeable?

I hate even giving it one star, but I have to say that although his character was totally without one redeeming virtue, Johnny Depp is a superb actor. Perhaps that is what the film makers were going for, but I had no feeling for any of the characters. How could you care what happens to these people? He tells you at the beginning of the movie, 'you will not like me.' How I wish I would have listened to the warning and not wasted my couple of hours watching this pus infected piece of garbage, and I hate to see people deceived by the high rating.

It's hard to articulate exactly why, since Chris is so uniformly masterful with his guitar technique and his famously smooth/gravelly voice. I guess it's largely the song choices, which are a teriffic blend of traditional blues covers and his own soulful compositions.

And I totally understand why. The illustrations are muddy, muted, and boring. The figures blend together like a bad watercolor. That wonderful Seuss visual whimsy and humor is nowhere to be found.

She will already hear messages as she gets older that black and brown are negative. I did not want to start impressing on her these messages at home. I'm disappointed that Seuss would present such negative words for these colors that are used to also describe groups of people. I'm shocked by the insensitivity to issues of diversity, especially as this book was published not so long ago, relative to his other books.

It is not silly, irreverent fun. It's about the different moods we all feel and he uses colours in a brilliantly symbolic way and few but powerful words that any child can easily relate to.The gist is that we're all human and as such we have varying moods. Silly. Sad. Gleeful. Mad. That being a human is being a rainbow of moods and that's okay.I love this book and its message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Community Space","review":"I constantly pull City People off my shelf to reread sections. The book takes snapshots from city spaces (including the press) and shows how these community places help form an understanding of society. The public spaces examined include the department store and the ball park. Barth ties the different spaces together through the press and how each of these components help enculture new members to this society. The ball parks for example give immigrants a central forum communicate with others and a common bond to share with others.

They're cheap and that's the extent of their value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!!!","review":"So you know, these are not permanent. Not even semi-permanent. There is no adhesive, you have to wash the screen with windex, etc then stick the 'protector' on. This may be quasi-ok for glass screens, but matte screens like on my camcorder it is a miserable failure. I put one on my Canon a710, put it in my camera bag and 20 minutes later when I went to get it out the protector was halfway off. Don't bother with this product. And to be clear you don't get 13 protectors, you get 3 large sheets, a wet towelette to moisten a dry one to clean with and a squeegee to get air bubbles out. Too bad they didn't include a product that worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not permanent","review":"First, you won't get 12 screen protectors. You will get three lousy screen protectors, that, if your screen is REALLY small (about 2\\"), will be cut into small pieces that may give 12 screen protectors. They come off really easy, they are exactly as the screen protectors that came attached to your cell phone screen, or your wrist watch, or whatever needs some protection, but no, they are definitely not permanent. For the price I can give'em two starts, but I would strongly recommend Fellowes screen protectors over these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to put on","review":"I used films on two different types of Palm PDA before. Those were custom fit type. This one needs to be cut to size and very difficult to apply. The film is thinner than the ones I use for Palm. It is easier to tear and difficult to get rid of air bubbles. I use this on the LCD screen of a digital camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, frustrating to use","review":"First off, these screen protectors are practically obsolete because modern camera screens can be twice the size of the template sizes; one must draw by hand the correct size. Upgrading the templates of these would save half the work. And, after I finally got the right size applied bubble-free, I gently slid my camera back into the case only to find that the screen protector had peeled off in the process and lint from the plush inside of the case was now stuck all over the exposed plastic. Not only that, but these plastic protectors scratch easily. Personally, I have bought so many of these things that I have decided to go without a protector and be extra careful. I suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screen protector - good but only for cameras","review":"Works really fine on my camera (Nikon D50) LCD.On the other hand it worked terribly on my PSP (eg. changed some colors) and I had to take it off. I tried to use it on my mobile phone, but it fell off itself after a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect too much","review":"I expected too much because of the review from \\"R. Baker (Atlanta, GA)\\". This product is not up to speed -- the sheets will be partially wasted if your camera has a 2.5\\" screen like the SD450 and SD550. You'll have to do the measuring and cutting by hand, because the dotted lines on the back aren't made for 2.5\\" cameras. The three sheets can be cut into three 2.5\\" pieces each (and four or more if your screen is 2.2\\" or less).Mine also wasn't packed well -- one of the sheets had a folded corner, rendering that corner useless.Other than that the product is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product, but don't expect multiple uses","review":"As other reviewers have written the first thing I noticed is that there are only 3 sheets, not 12 as the title implies. The way you achieve 12 sheets is by cutting them in fourths which makes them too small for my camera. I can get 6 sheets effectively. Furthermore, the kit comes with a wet cloth to clean the screen before applying. The drawback is that the kit comes with only wet cloth, so unless all 12 (or 6 or 3) protectors are applied at once, the single will only be moist for the first application. Finally, I agree that it is very difficult to apply these cleanly.This product works great for a single use if you have the patience to apply them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I had used this product on my digital camera (Canon Power Shot) a year or so ago, and bought it again when I got an iPod Nano, since I had heard the screens could be easily damaged and scratched. I used the screen protector and put my Nano in a silicone case, and ta-da! it's completely protected from my clumsiness. (well, mostly.) The screen protector is easy to use and works quite well.

You must trim it to size on both sides and then carefully place it over the screen without air bubbles to distort the display. Both tasks both daunting and unsuccessful in my two attempts. Had I not used two of the protectors in making these attempts, I would have returned the item for a refund.Instead, I simply added the cost to \\"education\\" and went on about my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"This product is inexpensive and easy to use.

The problem is they all have air bubbles under them. I tryed to work them out with the supplied squegie and by re-installing them but a few air pockets remain. It makes the screen look bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for cameras with larger screens","review":"I purchased this product to go along with my Canon Powershot SD550. It looked easy enough to apply at first. There were nice little lines drawn on the screen protector, showing you where to cut for certain screen dimensions. However, 2.5\\", the size of the SD550's screen, was not one of them. The premeasured lines only go up to 2.2\\".You can try to wing it and measure the old-fashioned way, but if you're off a hair, it won't fit the screen, and the corners of the proctector will annoyingly begin to peel back.I'm sure this works fine for cameras with smaller screens, but it would have been nice if the product descrption could have mentioned screen size limitations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I bought these because of the price and supposedly you get \\"12\\" for such a low price. Three things you should know about them.1) You don't get 12, you only get 3. On the back of each sheet, is a template that helps you cut each sheet into 4 smaller sheets, hence the \\"12\\". But no camera made today could use such a tiny size sheet if you cut it. You can probably get 6 sheets though if you cut them in half. The actual dimension of each sheet is 3 1/8\\" x 3 7/8\\".2) These use a glue of some kind to stick them to your screen. It looks fine when you put it on, but I hope I can remove this glue at a later date when I need to replace the protector. And I hope it doesn't damage the screen. I will look for a \\"static\\" kind or protector next time.3) These protectors are fairly reflective. I put one on a GPS in my car and I can hardly see the screen anymore on a sunny day. I would definitely recommend an anti-glare protector.Hope this helps someone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for its purpose","review":"I bought these for a Canon digital camera. Seller offered to cut these to the size of my camera's LCD, but I was unable to find the exact dimensions, so I was sent a few uncut protective films, and did the cutting myself. Worked like a charm--I put one of these puppies on my camera, and now it feels protected, and doesn't materially change the clarity of the LCD. No glue or anything needed to make it stick, it just does, and well.All in all, I'm glad I made the purchase to protect my investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMMON SENSE SOLUTION...","review":"After trying this product and being completly unsatisfied with it after finding all the faults listed in past reviews I decided to try a little experiment.First I measured the LCD screen on my Canon Digital Rebel XTi with a ruler and mapped them out on a piece of paper. Then (on the same piece of paper) I drew the dimensions of the LCD screen so I had a drawn out square the exact size of my screen.Next I took a piece of Glad Cling Wrap and laid it down over the square on the piece of paper. After taping it down so it couldn't move, I used a picture (rotary) trimmer to cut out the saran wrap laid over the paper square.I then had a perfectly sized protective sheet for my LCD. I simply laid the saran wrap over the screen and had a better protector then the Digital Concepts product. And it was free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for money, glad I got it!","review":"This kit had 3 large sheets of screen protectors. There was enough to cover the screens of my 3 Canon digital cameras and there is still one and a half sheets left over. You do need to cut the sheet to the right size - some screen sizes are marked at the back upto 2.2 inches. For a larger screen you will have to measure and cut which I did for my 2.5 inch screen.The only annoyance was teeny tiny bubbles were still left on the screen even after using the squeezee card to take out bubbles. They were only visible when you look at the dark screen though, as soon as the screen is lit they disappear, which was fine by me. I double coated my SD450 as it has supposedly a pretty delicate screen and I feel much more confident carrying it around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!! Caveat Emptor!!!","review":"1.

And with the Amazon subcription discount makes this an even better deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philips heads are different than old Sonicare. BUYER BEWARE!!!","review":"I have purchased over 500 items on Amazon and have never felt compelled to write a review until now. Philips must have bought out Sonicare but their so called \\"newer\\" replacement heads are deficient compared to the older Sonicare models. These are much smaller with an extremely tiny brush head. I'm supposed to pay the same price for crappier hardware? I can't find the older models anywhere so I am stuck with this unless I replace the whole model. Might look for another company now for my electric toothbrush needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality issues with Amazon shipped Sonicare toothbrush replacements","review":"I've ordered Sonicare replacement toothbrushes from Amazon twice. The first time, the magnet fell off one of the toothbrushes within 3 days of usage, so I sent the item back as defective. A few months later, I braved the chances and ordered from Amazon again. This time, while the issue is not as bad as a defective magnet, so the toothbrush head is still usable, it has enough issues for me to not be completely happy.I've been a Sonicare toothbrush user since 2002, and I haven't had any issues with toothbrush heads purchased in a regular store. I'll let you judge for yourself whether two defective purchases in a row is a fluke, but I can tell you that I am not ordering this item from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design needs to be reworked","review":"I bought these replacement heads for my Sonicare elite e7300. The first one broke within the first month's use. (One of the two metal legs that hold the magnet snapped.) The second head is working better, now that I've discovered why the first one broke. It appears that the head magnet is too close to the handle motor magnet. This causes the head magnet to vibrate loudly and eventually shear. The design flaw is either the magnet being too close or the plastic tighten cap not fitting properly.If you purchase these heads and the cap portion vibrates loudly, unscrew and re-screw the cap on until it doesn't vibrate so loudly. This will prevent the metal legs that hold the magnet from snapping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality has gone down to nothing","review":"I bought my first Soniccare toothbrush about 4 years ago and loved it. I finally had to replace it as the battery finally gave out. It would go a week without needing to be recharged, using it twice a day. I bought an e-series to replace it and I am so dissappointed. The battery lasts for one brushing, thats all. Even if it is charged and taken on a trip, being out of the charger for half a day the battery is dead. I thought paying $100 for a toothbrush they wouldn't skimp on the quality but I was wrong. Then assuming I must have bought a defective one, I bought a second and it is exactly the same. Also when I brush my teeth in the morning, the battery isn't charged up again by noon. For the price, they shouldn't have skimped on the battery, I am so dissappointed in Soniccare, I will never buy another, in fact, if it was on sale for $2.99 next to a childs toothbrush I wouldn't buy it as it is totally unusable...Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philips Sonicare Elite Compact Replacement Brush Head","review":"Even though this is a correct replacement head for E-Series Sonicare, I found the brush head to be too small.

This quickly causes a gunk build up in both the brush head base and the unit. It is almost impossible to get it into all the crevices to clean it thoroughly even with Qtips and other implements. Eventually, you see mold and bacteria developing and this is not sanitary.I don't know if the Oral B product is designed more effectively but I'm going to check."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky, gunky mess...","review":"The newly re-designed brush heads allow build up of gunk inside the toothbrush.

I used Oral-B power brushes for years but I finally gave it up because the replacement brushes were getting expensive and it was time to try something new.My mouth and teeth feel cleaner using the Sonicare versus the Oral-B. I also find it easier to handle.

The thin wand makes is so much easier to reach those back teeth. Accidental contact with a tooth doesn't make me worry about the Sonicare chipping the tooth. I can feel my teeth are cleaner after brushing, and it doesn't take as long to get there.If you're using the old Advance brush heads, do not hesitate to purchase this product.

The only way I manage it is to either soak the base of the head in mouthwash, or thoroughly clean it out with a q-tip (or both). Either way, the mold just accumulates again pretty quickly. Also, my harsh cleaning methods have caused the metal part at the bottom to rust, which creates a whole new set of problems. Even with all of this, I still can't clean every part, so the mold is never completely gone. It is just so disgusting to think that I am putting these things in/near my mouth ever day.

As far as the seller is concerned, I have no complaints about the order -- the packaging was adequate for the product to arrive in perfect condition, the duration was within Amazon's agreed upon time, and the price is the lowest I've found, both locally in stores and online.

What a mistake! The store brand heads were useless in less than a month of use. The magnets that connect to the base kept falling off, the heads were not as fine as the Sonicare, and the heads at their best never worked as intensely as the original Sonicare ones.Now that we have the original Sonicare heads our teeth feel completely clean and fresh from the dentist again.My only request is that they make the color rings more varied. My eyesight is fine and our bathroom is well lit, but I still have to hold the heads up to my face and compare them side by side to tell which one is mine.

Yes, it's pricey, but it may be worth it. What WASN'T worth it to me was the thought that my perfectly servicable \\"Advance\\" had become obsolete, and replacement heads for it were scarce as hen's teeth. It may have been worth it to buy an expensive toothbrush once--but I wasn't about to do it twice. I was greatly relieved to find that these brush heads fit the Advance just fine. They are smaller, and some people like them that way. I really don't care, though, if pressed, I would call them an improvement in getting around the corners of my mouth. They certainly work fine.

I was a bit skeptical about an \\"electric toothbrush\\" thinking it was merely a gimmick for people too lazy to even exert any effort to brush their teeth. It took a few days to get used to the tingling vibrations when using the brush, and I quickly learned to not remove the toothbrush from my mouth while it was turned on (toothpaste splattered all over bathroom mirror, etc). This toothbrush is easy to use and does an excellent job. I have noticed an increase in the whiteness of my teeth.

My teeth feel very clean after each brush and I love the timer feature because I always want to stop brushing and now I'm forced to wait until the toothbrush stops vibrating. I recommend that you don't push too hard and just let the toothbrush do its job so the head lasts longer and you don't damage your gums/enamel. My friend used to brush her upper gums with force until her nerves started showing (and she had to get cadaver gums sewn on to cover it). Also, I recommend that you tilt the toothbrush up when you brush so the toothpaste doesn't get inside the toothbrush where the crack is in the middle.

It cleans much better than a standard toothbrush and even the Oral B electric. You initially watch the brush on your teeth in action and think nothing is being cleaned, but it cleans completely and removes all tea stains!I recommend not boiling as a means of sanitizing. I mistakenly added this to my son's routine pacifier cleaning (boiling in hot water for 5 minutes).

I thought a carousel would be great for mixing up a variety of music cds. I'm not into the multiple movies, but mixing them would be fun. However, I learned thru the thick manual that the random play only works on the active disc, not thru all seven. Thats when I started packing it up. It had a few other quirks, too. There are seven lights across the front to represent the discs, the one playing flashes continuously during play. Not very nice in the dark during a movie.

The unit has now been in the shop for over 2 weeks as they try to \\"get parts\\", \\"new chips\\" and \\"reload the firmware\\" whatever that means.This will be the last JVC product I purchase.Buy a product from a vendor who stands behinds their equipment.

I mean the song and video were street and it reminded me of a time when hip-hop wasn't all about bling bling, girls, money, cars, etc. But after buying it yesterday for only $6.99, I have to admit they got me. Other than the two premo joints and one other song, I couldn't believe what a waste of my money this was. I mean they did songs songs with Swizz Beats, Busta Rhymes(who by the way hasn't been hip-hop since 1998), Foxy Brown, and Teddy Riley.

This great concert, dynamic in picture and sound, is a great introduction to Utopia's brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tribute Song and Great Single","review":"Most people bought this CD because it was his tribute to Princess Diana. The re-written lyrics were genius, although it would have been nice to have given tribute to Princess Di with her own original song. Either way, it was a great song.\\"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\\" was also a great song, although it may have been overshadowed by \\"Candle in the Wind.\\" Elton John did a great job with both songs.I'm amazed at how long ago these songs were written...and that Princess Di has been gone for over 5 years. She will be missed. Thanks, Sir Elton, for a wonderful tribute that we can all embrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"There can be only one","review":"There have been many songs that have been interpreted different ways.

They will forever be hers, as she will forever be in our hearts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpricing of this CD","review":"I have a copy of this CD that I purchased for $2.95 in 1997 when the tribute came out. I, too, was disappointed that Elton John rehashed an old song for his tribute to Princess Diana. I was expecting something original, too. I still have the CD in it's original packaging, still shrink-wrapped, never opened with the original price tag still on. How can you sell this now for such a high price? $7.95? Really?? Looks like the price was rehashed, too. I am not keeping my copy. I am donating it to charity along with some other household items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful","review":"People-I happen to love the song \\"Something About The Way You Look Tonight\\", which is why I got this single. I also love the song \\"Candle In The Wind\\".I said to myself when buying this single, \\"Oh, this would probably be a great remix of \\"Candle In The Wind\\"...I do not mind remixes, but when you alter lyrics, I have problems... If he was so close to Diana, why did he have to butcher the song written for Marylin Monroe... \\"Candle In The Wind 1997\\" was disgraceful, and I wish he left the original alone... He also left out all of the instrument accompaniments (besides the piano), which made it not as good...I suggest to many people: Do not buy this single..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful tribute song","review":"I think a couple of the reviewers here have missed the point. And regardless of what they think, I know that Diana would have been very touched by this re-writing of Candle in the Wind. Especially seeing that all the artist and composer royalties and record company profits from the sale of this cd will be donated to the Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. It's a beautiful song, and the words are just right, and this song does deserve to go down in history, which it certainly will.The cd that I have though, not only has \\"Candle in the Wind 1997\\" and \\"Something about the way you look tonight\\", but it also has \\"You can make history (Young again)\\" on it. I'm not sure if it's just an oversight by ..., but maybe the one here does too and it's just not listed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"I'm still figuring out a lot of the functions, but damn this camera takes really good pictures.

ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as advertised","review":"Used this along side D2X and D2Hs. It performed exactly as Nikon describes it in the advetising. Focus is not as fast as D2X or D2Hs but much faster than D70. Color is accurate with excellent auto white balance. LCD is bright and gives a wonderful preview. Highly recommended unless you need the focus speed of a D2X or D2Hs. Battery live is less than D2X or D2Hs but can be expanded with the optional grip that holds two batteries. Saves files much faster than the Fujifilm S5 pro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better in some ways than a D2X","review":"This camera replaced my Nikon D2X and in some ways I like it better. The brighter viewfinder, the CCD sensor quality seems to be better than the CMOS sensor quality of the D2X. I miss the vertical grip and the heaviness of the D2X but for thousands less, it's a spectacular camera. I think it's also better constructed. I dropped the D2X on a carpeted floor from only a height of about 3 feet and it cost $500 to have repaired. The D200 was accidentally dropped in a similar manner and it was unscathed and is still working perfectly. Perhaps because it's a lighter camera. I can highly recommend this camera. I use it primarily for shooting houses for real estate agents and the tonal quality is much smoother than the D2X."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purchasing experience","review":"The seller was so professional , D200 camera is as described, quite new.Also the seller helped me out to upgrade shipping to Next Day Air since my urgent departure date with no charge.Follow up until the camera was delivered to me in time. Amazing experience.Recommend to buy from this seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific camera","review":"The Nikon D200 is a very solid piece of equipment. Its weatherproof magnesium case feels sturdy and handles well. Controls are intuitive, except maybe the AF area selector which can be confusing. The LCD screen is large, bright and clear. But the most important feature is the sensor and imaging software. There Nikon excels. Colors are accurate and can be made deliciously vivid with a menu setting. The 10.2 megapixel resolution is more than enough for all normal use, including 300dpi prints at letter/A4 size and beyond. The DX sensor format makes it possible to design smaller, lighter lenses such as the 18-200 VR which is a superb lens for all-round use. The lens has a tiny amount of barrel distortion and chromatic aberration especially at the widest end but this can be easily corrected in Photoshop so it is no big deal. Overall the Nikon D200 camera and 18-200 VR lens combination is a superb package for the high-end amateur or photography enthusiast - highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good DSLR...","review":"I found nearly everything in this DSLR. Only i experienced these two disadvantages for me:1.It exhausts batteries two times more if you compare with D70s.2.It hasn't an IR receiver, if you want to use an IR remote control, you need to plug an IR receiver to hotshoe and connect it to 10 pin socket of D200."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome camera","review":"The title is all you need to know!

The image quality so far seems at least as good as my D80, but in a body that feels so robust and sturdy by comparison.Getting used to the menus took some effort, because there are so many more settings than my D80 had, but in no time at all I was ready to create a few test photographs.I'm loving the PC sync port, and I'm looking forward to this camera's debut on a job next week!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great camera perfect for Pro's","review":"This camera is of course part of the Nikon DX family of cameras which some pros avoid due to the smaller sensor size. The reality is that for most people you really don't need the FX sensor, and they really haven't released an FX camera yet worth buying. The metal body construction makes this a heavier and very robust camera capable of taking a few bumps along the way. The prostyle controls make shooting in a fast paced environment very doable as you are rapidly able to change your ISO, Shutter Speed, F-Stop, or shooting bank. Since buying this camera I have taken literally tens of thousands of shots without a single camera failure.Though the D200 is not Nikon's newest camera, this is still a camera that will serve you well for years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon D200 Review (to replace D100)","review":"I was completely delighted with the D200. The controls are more intuitive, accessible than the D100. The main reason for upgrading is the difficulty I was having slaveing SB800 and SB600 flash units off the built in flash on the D100. Its a snap with the D200. Also, the auto ISO feature has been great by allowing me to quickly take photos in low light without a flash. I'm glad for the option of JPEG+raw.A few negatives: Its noticeably heavier (take it hiking a lot) but I assume (I hope) more rugged. Of course, its pretty pricey but now I'm glad I went for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Rugged and Takes Great Pictures","review":"I love this camera. It produces consistently great shots, is intuitive to use and all the controls have a positive, solid feel to them. I had the misfortune to accidentally kick mine down a flight of metal stairs. The lens did not survive, but the camera's rugged, rubberized body came through without even a cosmetic scratch. I doubt that too many other cameras could have survived such stupidity."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first DSLR","review":"A great choice for first time buyers. This camera is easy to learn and it has advanced features that you can learn as you go... and when you master these you will realize that you are shooting like a pro.The vast array of nikon lenses and accessories were a big selling point for me as was the ability to control Nikon speedlights remotely via the camera for some really great shooting setups.The D200 is my dream come true. It provides all the professional features that an amateur would want at a price that is affordable.The D200 incorporates most of the latest enhancements available in digital imaging including a 10 megapixel censor, MATRIX II metering, detailed battery indicator, large buffer for continuous shoots and much much more.Buy this Nikon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Winner in My Book!","review":"I have owned this camera since it first came out.

I'am a happy camper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon D200 Camera","review":"Excellent Camera, and I got it for a great price, especially compared to what other stores were offering it for. I was already an owner of a D100 Nikon, so when this camera came out, I was very interested in getting one. The price around Christmas started at $1500, but I found it for $1249 on Amazon (on a reduced price sale, of course)- I was kind of astonished and didn't hesitate. Fantastic bargain on a great camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem from Nikon","review":"I had a very hard time deciding between the Nikon D200 and other digital SLR's with similar features, but I am very happy with my decision.

The background noise that came through from a presentation that was held in another adjacent room was disturbing and distracting. The pictures, these were all pctures that this dvd showed, were of poor quality and were not long enough left on the screen to look at it properly; like I mentioned before, it looked as of the presenter was afraid that they would run out of time ! Some of the same pictures shown in the so called bonus part of this dvd were of much and much better quality, but there were ONLY a couple of extra pictures that this \\"bonus\\" program presented.

I have 4 of their books and yet whenever I want to look up a plant I've seen in a nursery I rarely find it in these books. This is not the book you want if you are hoping for a good resource for roses. This is a guide book, when you want to look up a rose you saw at a nursery to find out a little more about it. The book divides the roses by class so if you are like most people and looking to buy a hybrid tea this book has fewer than 100. There are thousands and thousands of roses on the market, the odds that you will find it in this book is nil unless you are looking for Peace or the most common.

What with the Vatican's continued talk of canonizing Pius -- in spite of its much-ballyhooed (by the Vatican only) talk of repentence for centuries of murderous anti-Semitism -- this is a timely play and should be read widely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denial Adds To Guilt","review":"\\"The Deputy\\" is based on documented factual history. In what may be a matter of loyalty to their faith, some Amazon reviewers have claimed that Pope Pius II DID speak out.Such loyalty is understandable when the actions by a leader of one's religious faith are being examined. Hochhuth's vehicle both causes AND thwarts their denial.Historic objectivity very often conflicts with religion and faith.There is far more evidence of Vatican appeasement and toleration of the Nazi movement prior to and during World War II than any protesting. \\"The Deputy\\" merely dramatizes some of this.Hochhuth's dramatizing of history does not render it fallacious."},{"rating":"1","title":"But it's not true","review":"The Deputy is a fair to good play, considered as a piece of drama. There's tension, conflict, and a good denouement. The problem is that some people think it's history, which it's not. Most of the characters are fictitious. The speeches are not historical. The venal portrait of Pius XII completely contradicts history. It is astonishing to read previous reviewers still treat this work as history. Pierre Blet's recent work, based on Vatican archives and diplomatic cables, shows without a doubt that Pius XII spoke out hundreds of times against the Nazi persecution of the Jews and that he and his diplomatic representatives personally saved thousands of Jewish lives.As a play, it has its merits. But as fact, this is Oliver Stone territory. As a a piece of history, this is nothing but an anti-Catholic fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fantastic Deputy","review":"Hocchuth's play is a piece of anti-Catholic fiction. The characters, the speeches, the accusations are fictious.In fact Pius XII protested repeatedly to the German authorities about the persecution of the Jews. He did more than protest. He personally hid thousands of Jewish refugees in Vatican City and at Castelgandolfo. He encouraged the convents and monasteries of Italy to hide thousands more. Vatican diplomats saved many Jews by providing passports, fake baptismal certificates, and safe conducts. It is indisputable that the energetic interventions of Pius XII in Hungary and Romania saved tens of thousands of Jewish lives. But in Hochhuth's play a fake Pius XII struts around the stage in a daze over stock options.If you want the facts, try Pierre Blet's splendid new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-historical rubbish","review":"Based on Herr Hochhuth's emotive arguments, one might suppose the Roman Church was also responsible for both world wars, the Great Depression and the influenza. This is not a book worthy of serious discussion by intelligent people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Libelous slander","review":"I was tempted to write a long review, pointing out how this play is merely a tissue of lies, using quotes from both Catholic and Jewish sources that prove that Pius XII saved millions of lives in the Second World War, both Jewish and Gentile. However, I think this quote will be more effective. It is from the book _Hitler's Pope_ by John Cornwell, obviously not a friend or supporter of Pius XII:\\"[The Deputy is] historical fiction based on scant documentation...[T]he characterization of Pacelli (Pius XII) as a money-grubbing hypocrite is so wide of the mark as to be ludicrous. Importantly, however, Hochhuth's play offends the most basic criteria of documentary: that such stories and portrayals are valid only if they are demonstrably true.\\"If one of Pius XII's loudest critics dismisses this work as rubbish, can anyone really believe that it portrays the truth of the matter?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Catholic Slander from Johns Hopkins","review":"I wonder if Johns Hopkins University Press would publish the \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\" or \\"The Klansman\\" or any other works of bald-faced Hate and Bigotry? Of course not, because such \\"literature\\" is unworthy of publication by any university press. Yet Johns Hopkins sees no problem with publishing \\"The Deputy\\", a slanderous, FICTIONAL play about Pope Pius XII, written in the early 60s by an anti-Catholic German Protestant, who, presumably, was seeking to absolve the blood-drenched soul of his native country by shifting the blame for the Holocaust to the leader of the Catholic Church, several million of whose members also perished in the deathcamps at the hands of jackbooted creeps from the author's own Germany. For a GERMAN to blame the Holocaust on the Catholic Church is not merely absurd, it is sickening. It is amazing how the cancer of anti-Catholicism thrives in our American universities. How long must Catholics put up with Intolerance?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing, historically obtuse, obsolete","review":"Some works of literature wear well with time, and some do not.Understandably, The Deputy was quite a red-hot item 40 years ago, when there was a certain frisson in criticizing a recently-deceased Pope, and not a great deal of historical work had been done to analyze the opposition of the Catholic Church against Hitlerism.But now, at the beginning of the 21st Century, a wealth of actual documentary evidence can take the place of the fictitious imaginings, sceptical conjectures, and whole-cloth fabrications which make up the basis of this play.At the time of its writing, it must havce seemed daring and challenging in a disturbing but healthy sense. Now it looks more like, at best, sophomoric propaganda, and at worst, like a new and deeply unattractive variation on Blood Libel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction can be and here is true to life -I've been there!!","review":"I am disgusted with the two reviews on this site. This book is based on years of painstaking research and in no way an attempt to wash clean the bloody hands of the protestants by shifting blame on Rome. Protestants can be very arrogant and the comments are a sad example. This play is a touching masterpiece. It simply describes the truth and the many-standard morality of which our society is still quite capable. Very worth reading and performing in my opiniion. A work, in its own way more valuable and superior to the diary of Anne Frank. It is fiction but as true as Tolstoy's War and Peace (also fiction)."},{"rating":"1","title":"its nice","review":"It's a big watch.

Sometimes it's hard to keep the right mental attitude and keep your training moving in the right direction. In Train Tough, author Mark Bender definitely kicks your butt into gear and gets you motivated to challenge yourself, overcome counterproductive attitudes, and truly see what you can do in your athletic pursuits. He trained 10,000+ soldiers for Operation Desert Storm--so I think he's amply qualified to get the rest of us off the couch and out of our less-than-effective training ruts.

The gun is rated at 60-100psi. I've found that it works best around 85-90psi. I initially set it to 60psi and it didn't always want to shoot a staple. Bumping it up solved the problem. Every once in awhile it would blank fire but not too bad. Also, I found that it doesn't like it if you put in a couple of different staple group (I guess that's what you would call it). It works best with one long continuous group.I give it a 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stapler for the money","review":"Nice little stapler for the money. Works great for stapling fabric on flat surfaces. The design of the safety tip ensures that your staple is a few millimeters behind where the safety tip meets your work piece. This makes it very difficult to use in tight spaces. I did experience several misfires where the drive pin that deployes the staple didn't fully tract once a staple was ejected, forcing me to have to open the staple magazine and manually push it back to the \\"ready\\" position. This seemed to happen regularly when attempting to use in tight spaces, but not so much on flat open spaces where the safety tip could be fully deployed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick overview","review":"Stapler was used to staple a motorcycle seat cover to a plastic pan.

It has turned me on to more great rides than I can begin to talk about. A few friends and myself made the trip up to Flagstaff over the weekend and did Little Bear Loop described in the book. What a great ride. So much hard work getting to the top, but so much reward coming back down. I ahve also sampled most of the Phoenix area rides where I reside only about two blocks from the Pima Canyon Trailhead at South Mountain. Nothing like riding out of the garage!

The cartoony maps are spot on accurate plus there is tons of other info included in every ride.

The skill and effort ratings are way out of wack. The time estimation is so off you have to wonder whether the author rode a motorcycle on some of the trails and if he hiked the others. An example , in his description of one trail Cosmic Ray claims there are no big climbs however there are many huge climbs that switchback all over the place. It says it takes 3 hours to complete this trail, but when we rode this trail it took us over 4 just to get halfway and at halfway we couldn't find the trail and had to take pavement back. I would say buy this book just for a list of trails but get a supplement book to check the routes and the times or you will get stuck outside after dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I would definitely not recommend this book. The language to describe rides is totally ridiculous, most of the words are made-up, not just mountain bike lingo but straight out of thin (probably smokey) air. This makes it difficult to know what the trails are actually like. Also, the maps lack any topo information and the names of key sites such as trail heads along the trail are not included. The difficulties are inconsistent and often don't make sense. In combination with the made-up descriptions there is no way to tell what a trail that's skill level is rated as \\"XXX Expert\\" means. Directions to trailheads are also pretty much nonexistent, if you aren't from the area you will need another map to find your way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Guide","review":"I've read and ridden every trail in Cosmic Ray's guide. If you love to ride twisty single track with an occasional rock, rut or root to challenge your skill, this is the book for you.

If you want the best of the best trails, this is the book for you.On the other hand, if you are like the reviewer who dissed Fat Tire because you encountered a rock, hill or mud, you should stay safe at home and watch a mountain bike video.

They are winding down a decade-long partnership creating mediocre monster stories and the style and content of those stories bleeds over a bit.HOWEVER, In these gems we first meet Dr. Doom, the returning Golden Age anti-hero Sub-Mariner, the Skrulls and so much more. The sheer volume of creativity here is staggering...and it doesn't even peak for 5 years! This ain't the best but this is where it starts. Right here, on these very pages, is the beginnings of what Stan rightfully dubbed the Marvel Age of Comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World's Greatest Comic Magazine!","review":"These are the stories that started the \\"Marvel Age of Comics\\".

The fiber mop cover gets wet from steam and develops a suction like adhearance to the floor. The cord is too short (must use an extension)and the mop head is floppy. Directing it to a specific area (i.e., under cabinets, around toilets) is difficult. I bought this 2 years ago and there may have been some improvements since then. If not, another drawback is that the mop cannot be turned off without unplugging it.

No muss no fuss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steamboy Customer Service Very Poor","review":"I have had numerous problems with this steamboy. The plug has broken two times and my last problem involved an electrical fire where the cord attaches to the machine body. Apparently, as I was told by Steamboy, all the back and forth movement will cause the wire to become detached and this is why an electrical fire occurred. Because my machine is out of warrantly (one year) they will not replace the machine. Customer service is sorely lacking from this company. I will buy a product made by a different company as I now must replace this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves floors wet!","review":"One star is too much for this thing. This is advertised as easy to move across the floor but they accomplish this by making the mop pads thinner. Because of this, they get saturated quickly and the floors take a lot longer to dry. Get the Bissell Steam Mop (If you can find them) My first one lasted 5-6 years before it stopped working and I had to try something else. The pads are much thicker and more of a terry cloth material. The floors dry much quicker and I can't tell the difference between the two as far as requiring less effort. Returned this one after 1 use because I knew there was a better product out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steam Mop","review":"This product does not perform like it states in the detailed description.

I purchased the Steamboy in June of '07 and several months ago it broke. The bottom plastic triangle part where the screws attach shattered. I don't think that the plastic was made to withstand the heat that the mop produces and broke after about 2 1/2 years of using it. I don't think this is acceptable for the price of the product! Also I found the length of the cord to be an annoyance. I wasn't able to get very far in cleaning until I had to unplug and move it and then wait for it to be ready to steam again. I recently bought the Shark steam mop and have been happy with it. I would never buy another Steamboy, the concept was a good one but the product quality is shabby and there are better products out there. This one is not Reliable like the name says!

I had done quite of bit of research before the purchase so think that I made a good decision. I have dark colored tile floors and most cleaning products leave a dull looking floor. With just the steam the floors are shiny and clean. I liked it so much I just purchased one for a gift for my son. I gave it four stars because of the short cord.

It leaks all over and leaves floors soaked. You cannot use it on hardwood because of how much water it makes. The steam comes out of just one jet so it does nothing. It does not even get the whole pad hot barely warm on the outside so there is no way it sanitizes anything. You might as well put hot water in a bucket and use a mop that is about how well this sanitizes. It is only hot in the middle where the jet is which is about 2\\" area. This is just ridiculous. The jets need to be all over the area and more than one. So the stated temperature is not true it does not reach that. I measured steam temp not even close to stated temp. So other steam cleaners that are 212F are probably better at sanitizing if they have multiple jets spread around the whole surface of the head of the steamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Swivel head collapsed and cracked apart after very light use.

They all said it looked like another stupid, gimmicky product, and they were right. The idea of steam cleaning is great, but this product is a huge letdown. It leaves far too much water behind and you still have to get down on your hands and knees to scrub any time you have anything substantial on the floor. I am fairly tall and the steam cleaner hurts my back after just mopping our small kitchen. I find I have to lift the product up and drag it towards me in order to not leave a trail of dirt.

Of course, this is all augmented by having a powerful storyline behind it all; this was an incredible introduction to the new story arc.

It survives even in full screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can not say a bad thing about this heart warming film.","review":"This film is one of the sweetest I have seen in a long time. Just hearing the song 10,000 miles makes me want to cry. It is a wonderful story of a father and daughter coming together after the death of her mother. Jeff Daniels was execellent as the father.

I enjoyed it very much, but wished that a brief scene or two had been reconsidered by the director. In particular, I did not like it when the game warden was about to clip a wing of a gosling, and the daughter just goes \\"ballistic,\\" bonking him on the head with a pot or some such object, then screaming bloody murder. How does her father respond? He roughs the guy up ,then throws him out of the house. Later in the film, we are given a scene that intentionally paints the U.S. airforce as \\"over-reacting\\" to the imagined \\"threat\\" of the father and daughter flying the geese home. Seems the father over-reacted, too. Hope parents take the time to tell their kids that, no matter how \\"in the right\\" you may feel about something, you don't get violent to make your points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Star Movie; Two Star DVD Release","review":"No argument here as to the fine movie that \\"Fly Away Home\\" is, but a HUGE disappointment in Columbia/TriStar's decision to release it in the full screen aspect ratio only. It kept me from buying the Laserdisc, and will so keep me from buying the DVD. It's a pity that such a beautifully cinematic movie is not offered in the original theatric ratio for full viewing pleasure. Sour grapes? I don't think so. One of DVD's intrinsic values is the ability to deliver movies in BOTH formats for viewer choice. Columbia/TriStar apparently believes that it's their decision to make, but my consumer vote says \\"I don't think so!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Movie","review":"A great story of a 13 year old girl that is forced to deal with the loss of her mother and having to learn to live with a creative nature-loving father that she doesn't know.

Luckily Tom is mechanically skilled and loves to tinker with things like gliders. Father and daughter train the birds to follow them in ultralights, and lead their winter migration, breaking more aviation rules and regulations than I could count.This is a great family movie (except for a bit of language) for those who like nature, animals, or girl power.

Yah, it's a tiny bit older sounding (a little less techno, in other words) than the new Asian Underground stuff, but that just makes it all the more sweet.The cd as a whole is half soothing, half grooving...and trust me, that makes for an insanely good time. A few of my fav. songs: Bullet Train (which has amazing bass backing up the melody) and A Toungue of Flame (which literally sounds like new age reggea with a gorgeous-voiced singer thrown in for that extra exotic sound). But the best part of the cd? Boss Tabla!! I can't even describe how terrific that one song alone is, much less the entire album. It starts out w/intricate tabla drums and steadily adds more and more until the bass beat just takes over.

You can turn your guitar into a Bass or a high pitched screaming meachine. The detune actually makes a great Chorus effect and sounds awesome on clean stuff. It can bend notes up to 2 Octaves higher (24 Frets). The harmony effects are cool but it is fixed so you can't do true scale harmonys. The design is pretty rugged and I havent had to reset mine yet.

The book is certainly above average, provides the concepts with insightful examples. Parts of it are boring and repetitive, but I guess it's OK so long as you don't read the whole book. I guess the repetition is probably because the author intended for some chapters to be read independently of others. So I should give him his due.

I could not get into the time or place or spirit of this novel. The main character never semed to gel, and as for the doctor, well, he seemed less weighty than a grain of beach sand (where so much of said jiggling occurs - the main character likes to remove her stockings and run about the beach dampening her garmentry and losing hairpins.)

I'm a big fan of Anita Shreve, and she certainly didn't let me down with this one.

The characters (especially Olympia and Haskell) are well developed, and I felt as though I knew them. Although the plot was a little fundamental, it grabbed me and held my interest throughout.

I constantly had to tell myself that this was a work of fiction as tried desperatly not to throw it across the room.My main problem with this book is the \\"love\\" between 15 year old Olympia and 41 year old John. This relationship is based purely on sex. There was nothing written to make the reader believe otherwise. It bothered me quite a bit that I was supposed to find both of these characters sympathetic and buy into their feelings for each other.Another aspect of the story that bothered me was the fact that Olympia continued to have her father's wealth to support her even during her self-imposed exile. She never had to work for anything, which I think detracted from the story.Shreve has always been a \\"hit or miss\\" author for me and this one was definetly a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL READ ~ you will love this book!","review":"This story grabbed me from the beginning and I didn't want it to end.

In particular, the language annoyed me from page 1.

I will be much more careful of this author in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fortunes Rocks","review":"I bought Fortunes Rocks because I found The Pilot's Wife riveting. As much as I liked the previous book, however, I found this one to be disappointing. Normally I enjoy visiting bygone eras in fiction, but I found the premise of the novel implausible and the story itself, boring. The end was insultingly tidy -- (don't read further without \\"spoiling\\" the end). The family is healed and reunited at their beloved summer home; and the boy, his working class parents (thankfully dead and dying), is back among the fold just in time to avoid a life sentence in a factory and to benefit from the manners, couth and education his biological parents can offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"MESMERIZING","review":"A great novel - the kind you can get lost in, especially if you enjoy high romance with the inevitable pitfalls awaiting two mismatched lovers. Ms. Shreve writes a great story with interesting characters and her portrait of the late 19th century was intriguing. She is truly a gifted writer, and I did not want this one to end....I was introduced to Ms. Shreve when I read The Pilot's Wife (an Oprah pick no less) and it is also marvelous. But I must confess Fortune is even better and shows her versatility as an author. I must read her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern day classic","review":"Shreve's best yet!!

I don't know if I ever agreed with the Olympia/Haskell relationship. Sometimes I hoped they would remain apart and that she would live life alone.

Perhaps the writing was a bit over-the-top, but the book as a whole was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointing","review":"I am a dedicated reader and fan of Anita Shreve and have loved all of her other works. However, this book was disappointing from the first page. I could not relate to any of the characters...I never felt any connection to them at all. The fact that a 41 year old man could fall in love with a 15 year old at first sight is beyond my comprehension, even in the present day, let alone a century ago. The prose is overly dramatic and there were passages that did not keep my attention at all. I hope her next novel improves upon this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A second in time with disastrous results or not!","review":"The year is 1899 and this is the story of an intelligent, well-bred young girl of 15 who falls in love with a married man almost 3 times her age. As you might surmise this is a recipe for deception and a future where both are spurned by the cultured set that were once there friends and family.The author gives us three-dimensional characters that are interesting, exuding warmth and true human qualities, as well as inadequacies. The book brings us full circle to a choice of compelling sadness and difficulty that only the \\"Wisdom of Solomon\\" could answer to. It is the story of loves lost and found, and the rising of a phoenix from the ashes of what was once an auspicious life. A well-written book by an enjoyable author, certainly worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same old story","review":"In Fortune's Rocks, Shreve presents us with your basic young-girl-falls-in-love-with-married-older-man-and-gets-pregnant scenario. Shreve continues however, to create a story after the initial romance involving our heroine, Olympia, and her struggle to find the child she gave birth to.Unfortunately, Olympia, (who is portrayed as independent but helpless, self-assured but needy) is generally unlikable. While I hesitate to say she got what she deserved, I do not find much sympathy for her or her lover who had the courage to ruin the lives of both of their families but not the courage to find each other again - in the face of it all - to be together.While Shreve is skilled at creating a sense of place, and the beach community of Fortune's Rocks is enviable, her characterizations in this novel do not ring true and lack depth, insight or interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow it from the library before purchasing!","review":"Anita Shreve is one of my favorite authors, but she struck out with Fortune's Rocks. If you want to read her at her best try Resistance, Weight of Water, or The Pilot's Wife. The style she adopts for this book is cloying and the characters so shallow and uninteresting it's difficult to care what happens to them. This is a very disappointing addition to her otherwise five-star body of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by \\"morality tale\\"","review":"Anita Shreve is pushing an agenda, but not necessarily a moral one. Yes, Fortune Rocks contains many truthes...teenaged mothers shouldn't be ostracized from society, and are still people worthy of love, but ultimately the book tries to make adultery acceptable. This book depressed me. Not only because Shreve never admits that most of the suffering could've been averted by different (and wiser) choices, but because her amoral thinking is cleverly couched between truthes and half-truthes. I also hate reading books that make hot, infatuation sex the highest possible endeavor in life, and that all else (especially a good marriage and children) should be sacrificed for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't stand it.","review":"The only reason I finished this book was for a reading group. Blech. The whole premise is the affair between a 15 year old girl and a 41 year old married man. She is selfish, and he lacks self-control, reminding me of a perpetrator at times. I could not stand this book all the way through, found the author's style of writing too flowery, and the book was just really distasteful. Of course, it all works out to a happy, if unrealistic, ending. I feel insulted after reading this- it's like a Jerry Springer show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of readable but forgettable","review":"This novel is trying to be an exploration of passion but comes off as bloodless and wooden. Fifteen-year-old fallen woman Olympia Biddeford, the main character, never comes to life, and the author's attempts to convince us her relationship with a man three times her age is a deep spiritual love is ludicrous. The book is by the numbers, and the attempt at 19th-century speak is irritating. Did not people ever use contractions in their speech back then? I cannot believe they did not, but I shall not argue with the author further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Novel from Anita Shreve","review":"I am so fascinated by this novel. I wanted to find another novel following the life of Olympia. Anita Shreve makes you feel as though the characters are your friends, family. Since I discovered this book, I have picked up all of Anita Shreve's books. She is my favorite author!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new Shreve favorite!","review":"Again, Ms. Shreve has shocked me with her strikingly beautiful prose and sadly human characters. Although the end of this book was just a little bit too filled with \\"perfection\\" for my taste, I truly found myself aching for Olympia and her lost love, and debating who the boy should end up with. To me, those are markers of a truly good story with meaningful characters, and for that, I applaud Ms. Shreve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Magic!!","review":"I've read everything by Anita Shrieve-some better than others, but this is her best novel by far. I truly loved it. You won't be able to put it down. Her writing is magical. It is so descriptive and observant, that there were moments I was completely lost in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BOOKSHELF KEEPER","review":"One of Anita Shreve's best, though I wish the book had ended a bit sooner. The difficult subject of underage passion with an older, married man is treated with delicacy and beauty. This novel was hard to put down. I'd also recommend \\"A Pilot's Wife\\" by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disbelieving and Unrealistic","review":"Although Fortune's Rocks kept my attention, the book was extremely unrealistic. The character's struggled through the book and then somehow everything came together too nicely and easily at the end.It was also really hard to believe that Haskell was in love with Olympia."},{"rating":"2","title":"May you have the good fortune to read this book...","review":"Once this book grabbed hold of me, it wouldn't let me go. I initially picked up this book because I was intrigued with Shreve's writing style in The Pilot's Wife. Again, she delivers another haunting emotional tale, which is gripping because of the author's literary talents. Shreve takes a common theme (youth plunging headlong into a romantic relationship which can only spell disaster), and with some plot twists and eloquent charcterizations makes it far from ordinary. You will be carried along the journey hoping that the characters do not create their own ruin, and then empathize when they do. The spell cast by this novel is captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had a Hard Time with Child Abuse Disguised as Love!","review":"I had a hard time reading this and feeling empathy for a 41 year old married man and a 15 year old girl. Granted, times were different in 1900 than they are today, but really! Ms. Shreve's writing is excellent. Her imagery is great. But why have a 41 year old man having sex with a 15 year old? How can most people relate to that and feel empathy for these characters?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I couldn't get very far in this book, way too many words. Just get to the point! Gave it to my sister and she got much further. But after a few hundred pages she decided she didn't like the characters or the theme and gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly Written","review":"Despite having read/heard numerous bad reviews about this book, and therefore going to it with a somewhat pessimistic mind, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Shreve's prose is beautifully composed and thoughtfully written. I did read one review that it was a story of a mollastion of a teenage girl by a 40 year old man, but this simply is not true. It is a love story and goes far beyond this somewhat ignorant comment. The only critisism of it that I have, is that at the beginning, I found the very modern style of writing anddescription hard to compare to the time period it was set in. However, as the story progressed, I found that they began to compliment each other more and more. On the whole, well worth the read, and although I did not enjoy it as mmuch as 'The Pilots Wife' it excelled my expectations by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Does Not Achieve it's Intended Result","review":"The purpose of the novel was to portray the main character as a stunning, dynamic heroine who overcomes much. I am not at all sorry to divulge the truth: the protagonist is a self-pitying martyr who throws away her one chance for true happiness. That a Victorian girl, raised among the upper classes, would make such initial mistakes as she did is hard to believe. Unless you're a masochist, don't bother even borrowing this from the library. Read Shreve's earlier, \\"Strange Fits of Passion\\", instead; it's a GOOD book."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's the point!","review":"I agree with the online reviews that Olympia's affair with Haskell is morally dispicable at best and criminal at worst. However, I think that is exactly the point that Anita Shreve was trying to make. I don't think the book was about a love affair rather the consequences of a love affair that seemed good and natural to the two perpatrators. Yes, the affair was criminal and the attraction questionable. Thus are the consequences of their actions so severe. That is the essence of the novel! Anita Shreve has artfully and tastefully rendered this complicated story to paper. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you ready to give up a weekend?","review":"If you're an Anita Shreve fan, you'll probably agree that this is one of her best -- a roller coaster ride of a love story involving a 15 year old beyond-her-years girl at the turn of the century who meets up with a (married, sigh) physician of 45 with a wife and children and what appears to be a happy marriage. But never fear...the two are drawn to each other like magnets and the rest is, well, in the book. Even though I thought this an excellent book, I can't give it 5 stars -- a little suspension of belief is necessary in buying into the idea that a responsible, respected and nearly middle-aged physician in a highly-structured world full of taboos would throw nearly everything to the dogs to pursue pubescence. I recommend it anyway. It's a heckuva read, full of twists and turns and surprises. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit for Shreve!","review":"I have read all of Anita Shreve's books...and I keep saying they are all on my favorites list. I can't decide! They are all so good, you can't put them down. You stay up at night, you make extra time during the day...This is a story that takes place in the early 1900's, but with her description, you feel you are there, you can understand the time & place. And even though things that might be a huge scandal then, might not be now...you can still imagine the truth & the scandal way back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"Buy it, buy it.You won't regret it.Keeps your attention until the end.Unbelievable characters-ones you won't forget.must read-you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Fortune' Rocks Anita ShreveI thought it was boring. Wish I had not wasted my valuable time on it. It almost became one of our Book Club choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the wosrt books I've EVER attemped to read.","review":"What Happened??? Anita Shreve has always been one or my favored Authors, but with this book she lost me after laboring through 140 pages. After making one more effort to muddle through it ~ I finally said to myself \\" That's Enough ~ I can't tolerate any more of this Awful book!\\" Please ~ If you haven't ordered it ~ DON'T! There are thousands upon thousands of really good books out there where your reading time will be better spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solidly written, engaging story","review":"Fortune Rocks tells the story of sixteen-year-old Olympia Biddeford, the daughter of a wealthy Boston family. As she enters womanhood, Olympia falls for an older man, a doctor named John Haskell. John is unable to restrain himself and enters into a relationship with the young girl which sets the course for the rest of her life.While we question the morality of some of the characters' decisions, we are, nonetheless, drawn in to their lives and the heartbreak that ensues.Fortunes' Rocks is a sad novel in many ways but in the end we see the character and determination of Olympia as she comes to terms with her choices and makes the best of her predicament."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my All-Time Favorites","review":"I read this book years ago; when finished, I read it again. It stays on the shelf where I keep the books I know I want to get to again and again. There are plenty of reviews here that discuss the content of the book, so I won't rehash that. It's the emotion of the book that pulls the reader in and simply will not let go.. not even after the last page. All these many years later, I still find myself wondering about Olympia and John, and Pierre. When I do, I know exactly where to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I feel so angry?","review":"Why do I feel so angry? It's probably because, despite the fact that I had to resist the urge to throw it against the wall, I felt obligated to finish this too-long book (450 pages) because it was selected by my book club for discussion. The premise is unbelievable, the main characters are completely unlikeable, the author's attempted use of period language is annoying (she strains, \\"as if at stool\\"), and the fairy tale ending is sickening. There. I feel a little better."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL DRIVEL","review":"I can't remember a bigger waste of my time. A hard to believe story about the affair of a privileged 15 year old girl with her father's 40+ year old respected doctor friend at the turn of the century. And the language - \\"Strain as if at stool\\" - has anyone in any century ever spoken such a stilted sentence?Of course, there's a happy ending. No permanent repercussions for what these people have done to their families and friends. And isn't sex with a minor a crime? Love conquers all as if a spoiled child of 15 knows what love is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Anita Shreve having a joke at our expense?","review":"I admire Ms. Shreve's talent and enjoyed all of her books until I read \\"Fortune's Rock\\" or I should say started to read \\"Fortune's Rock.\\" I finally abandoned it because I could not find a single character who was not totally self absorbed. The idea of a spoiled 15 year old child seducing a middle aged, married friend of her father is nearly as disgusting as the idea of the lecher consumating sex with the child.I hope this is a departure for Ms. Shreve and that she will return to the mature and sensitive themes she has explored in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"No formula writer!","review":"Anita Shreve constantly surprises and her topics cannot be pigeon-holed or even classified. Every novel of hers is totally different from her others.\\"Fortune's Rocks\\", a variation on \\"Wuthering Heights\\", is written in the style of the day---1900--and reflects the author's meticulous research and her total grasp of the spoken language of that era.In 1899, Olympia Biddeford, the daughter of an influential and wealthy Boston family, embarks on a brief but torrid affair with Dr. John Haskell, 41 and married with children.The affair is brief because the lovers are discovered, in a most public and humiliating way, during Olympia's 16th birthday celebration. The scandal that follows tears families apart and exiles the former lovers.The book is gracefully written and well-constructed in the style of the day, fairly formal and very descriptive. A polished gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the flavor of the era","review":"Since I am a big Anite Shreve fan, I started the book with a fair amount of prejudice. However, I enjoyed this tale far more than others written about the same geographic era. Only a writer of her talent can capture the essence of the era that she chose for this subject. It is definitely one of Anita Shreve's better efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand what the fuss is about","review":"I'm about 1/3 of the way through this book only because it is a holiday weekend and the library is closed. The prose is very well done but there is no content. The story line thus far has been: middle aged, married man views 15 year old girl on beach, falls in love, has minimal polite interaction with her, has sex with her. It is painfully slowmoving and unrealistic. The only part that caught my attentiion was the guy's interest in improving working conditions in the mills (a subject that was quickly dropped after a quick mention). Wish I could say better but tonight I'll be watching TV!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fortune's Rocks","review":"This is a powerful novel and an interesting take on a love affair between an underage female and a much older married male occurring in the late 1890's. The powerful forces of societal condemnation and ethnic tensions create an interesting struggle between what one wants and what one can have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fortunes Rocks Badly Damaged","review":"I received this book timely, however it was listed as new, and the novel arrived with water damage, chocolate smeared all over the pages. There were coffee rings on the cover along with several dog eared pages. It arrived very unsanitary and I tried to clear it up with this seller however they didn't respond to any of my five e-mail requests. I would never purchase anything from this seller, if they think that book was new then they must be blind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excelent Book By Anita Shreve","review":"I loved this book as much as I have loved Sea Glass, The Pilot's Wife and All He Ever Wanted....maybe I loved it more. I will agree with one reviewer that it does start off a bit slow, but I think that was important to the story...you need to get to know the characters in order for the second half of the book to take full effect, and that's exactly what I think Anita Shreve was doing by taking her time in the first half of this book. The second half definitely picks up pace. I read the last fifth of it in one sitting, and that's rare for me.I have a bit of advice...If you want to read this book and have not read Sea Glass, read this one first!!! Then read Sea Glass of course. This puts them in chronological order.ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From a native...","review":"This was a fantastic read!I grew up in Biddeford, Maine, and my favorite beach there is called Fortune's Rocks. I've lived all over the country and have yet to discover a beach more beautiful, which is why the the title of the book and it's main character, Ms. Biddeford, caught my eye. I bought Fortune's Rocks because the title made me feel nostalgic and was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. It is brilliantly written.Ms. Shreve obviously enjoyed her time in my home town and recognized the beaty of Fortune's Rocks as it inspired her to write such an incredible novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasure to read","review":"I couldn't put Fortune's Rocks down once I got into it. I've felt that way about other Shreve books and Fortune's didn't disappoint. She does an excellent job of taking the reader right there with the characters... it was though I too could smell the ocean right along with Olympia! Even though I had trouble with the age difference of the main characters I don't regret for one minute reading to the last page. It was satisfying the way a good meal is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For the First Time, I'm Disappointed in Anita Shreve","review":"I was sorely disappointed when I read Fortune's Rocks. I love Anita Shreve's novels, so I assumed I would love Fortune's Rocks as well. This was not the case.Fortune's Rocks is the story of a wealthy 15-year old girl and a 40-something doctor who cares for poor mill workers in the early 1900's. The 15-year old and married doctor become sexually involved with each other almost right away. I found this odd, because was it rare in those days for a well-bred woman to just hop in the sack with someone she barely knew, but a 15-year old? The girl soon becomes an unwed mother and the story unravels from there. It read to me like one of those Victorian romance novels I used to read when I was 12.Not recommended. If you're looking specifically for an Anita Shreve novel, I would highly recommend \\"The Weight of Water\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite Edith Wharton","review":"The author commented in an interview that she was such a fan of Edith Wharton that she was attempting to give this novel a Whartonesque feel. Unfortunately, only Wharton should write Wharton. She is the only one who can effectively write about the fall of women in a Victorian society. The protagonist of this book simply would not have done the things she did in her society, and without any seeming motivation or moral conflict. It is presumptive of Anita Shreve to compare her work to Wharton's, instead of presenting it as what it is - an engrossing, but completely modern novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I am a fan of Anita Shreve's work, and would site Weight of Water as one of my favorite books, but this overly long novel was a huge disappointment. The thought of a 14 year old girl becoming so overcome with passion for a 41 year old colleague of her father's is ludicrous. The characters came across as cold and totally unsympathetic, the dialogue was stilted to the point where I found myself laughing at passages that were certainly not meant to be humorous. Give this one a pass, I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ever happened to Anita Shrieve","review":"If you have read Anita Shrieve's The Weight of Water and loved it as I did, do not read this book. The author's previous work was a beautiful and masterful work of literature and this book is fictional trash. It reminded me of the romance novels I read when I was 12. I believe that Ms Shrieve has sold her soul to the publishers who are hoping for a screen play for a television mini-series. I was terribly disapointed in the author and know she is capable of a much higher level of writing. It's depressing to think that she has compromised her work to such a degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consuming!","review":"Shreve has written a vivid tale set in the early 1900s of a 15 year old woman coming to terms with her sensuality and fiercely protective father. The period details are intensely vivid and the novel had me engrossed from cover to cover. Shreve does not disappoint in her writing and Fortune's Rocks is a top-notch novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimental, overwrought dreck","review":"The author's style displays more determination than grace, and you can see every join and rivet in her machine-like plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I'm currently trying to get through this book. I think what's making it hard to read is that I don't have much feeling for the characters, because I find the ENORMOUS age difference between Olympia and Haskell quite disturbing.....actually it pretty much grosses me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORTUNE'S ROCKS: A Novel","review":"This was such a bad book. I really enjoyed \\"A Pilots Wife\\", but this book was an uncomfortable subject matter that has been so over done. There was not one character in this book that I liked or felt an sympathy for. This was an easy read for the beach but very bad in context. I like books almost no one else likes, but this was really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly disappointing","review":"A 41 year old molests a 15 year old. There is nothing romantic, engaging or entertaining about this sad tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"UnBelievable","review":"I saw the reviews has been from 1 star to 5 stars. Those with 1 to 4 stars definitely have no tastes for detective stories. The Maltese Falcon is by no doubt Hammett's best work and one of the best mystery detective stories. If you enjoy the book you will enjoy the film. Even if it's old it's worth watching. I read the books twice a week now. I just can't put it aside ignoring it. It's just beyond words to describe. My drooling over this book is almost synchronized with every word that I read. Hammett's not ONLY a great writer but he's EVERYTHING in a great writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Reading these reviews (while stuck at work) it reminds me of opening the Maltese Falcon fourteen years ago.It was incredible, a superb piece of atmospheric writing; I swear I finished the book with my mouth wide open, too enthralled to think of anything else.I love the ending with its hard pragmatism; compared to the romantic slush we are so often bombarded with,the ruthless logic of Sam Spade was a revelation.The film is also a masterpiece.Reading Dashiel Hammett inspired me to move onto Raymond Chandler a few days later. Dashiel Hammett is a master, Raymond Chandler had great admiration for a man who \\"gave murder back to the people who do it for a reason\\", compared to the inane plots and social snobberies of the Agatha Christie. brigade\\".I will always admire Dashiel Hammett, but my preference is for Raymond Chandler. A hard choice, but I love Raymond Chandler's hard poetical prose.They were both superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typos and incorrect words in sentences","review":"This version of the book has a large amount of typos, some of which require a bit of thought to figure out.It also has a lot of the completely wrong word appearing in sentences and collections of letters which are not words I've ever come across, nor has the dictionary.I'm sure this is a very good book, but these errors spoil it. I have never read a book with this amount of errors in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Maltese Falcon, a Classic","review":"The Maltese Falcon reads like a photo (if this metaphor makes sense) - the imagery is well-rendered without being overly-descriptive, and it really puts the reader into the scene, as it were. It was a quick read, full of action and enigmatic characters, and it's easy to see how much it contributed to the film noir genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST DETECTIVE NOVEL EVER WRITTEN!!!!!!","review":"I THOUGHT THAT THE MALTESE FALCON WAS THE GREATEST DETECTIVE NOVEL EVER WRITTEN. I HAD TO READ IT FOR A SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT, AND I AM GLAD I CHOSE THIS BOOK. I THOUGHT THAT THE TEXT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO FOLLOW, BUT OTHER THAN THAT I THOURALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. SAM SPADE IS LIKE EVEYONES IDOL, HE IS NOT AFRAID OF ANYONE. IF ANYONE OF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT DETECTIVE NOVEL THAT TAKES PLACE AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THE MOVIE TO SEE IF I FELT THE SAME AS I DID READING THE BOOK. THIS BOOK HAS GOT ME HOOKED ON HAMMETS WRITING. I LOVE IT. I COULD PICTURE THE WHOLE BOOK WHILE I WAS READING IT.

It was left open at some angle where the spine became diagonal and the book does not open normally any more. This was clearly not a Very Good condition and should not have been advertised as one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Visual style not fit for a book","review":"First, let me say that the writing is very good. I did not enjoy it as much as I hoped because it's not a true detective / murder mystery type. Spade hardly did investigating and instead seemed to stumble into clue after clue and run into a key character here and there. The writing style emphasized the characters and their expressions more than the plot. It was not quite what I expected. The writing was so good that it was very easy to imagine every scene and every character nuance, but it cannot be classified as a murder mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am sorry but I am going to have to disagree with almost everyone who has written a review for The Maltese Falcon. Whether it is because I am used to reading Crais and Lehane and found a real shortage of action in this book, or whether it was because the characters were so unbelievable (if Gutman had said \\"By Gad sir\\" any more, I may have had to slit my wrists!) I know this book is 70 years or more old, but I just didn't find the conversations realistic. Anyway, I am sure my review won't put people off once they read everyone else's five star reviews, but just a word of warning, if you are used to people like Elvis Cole, you will just be disappointed by Sam Spade."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book Thats Not All That Great!","review":"I didnt really enjoy reading this book.

I really like tadzio."},{"rating":"1","title":"great book, ham-fisted audio production","review":"This is hard to listen to. Having the actors read the narration in character was a huge mistake, creating an endless series of cringe-inducing moments. Some talented people made this, and they mostly do fine when delivering straight dialogue. But when they start describing the action in character, it goes off the rails, time and time again. There are also a lot of jarring musical bumpers that are mixed a lot louder than the preceding voices and don't work particularly well as a result. All that aside, there are some decent characterizations here, particularly Kasper Gutman."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books by the best crime writer","review":"Hammett is a favorite of mine. I have read this twice and loved it both times. I will read it again.The Bogart movie is very faithful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Tale","review":"The Maltese Falcon is a classic detective tale. The book contained several plot twists and waited to the very end to draw all the facts together. The story reminded me of last year's LA Confidential with its wit and intriguing story. It is an amazing story and so elegantly written. I gave it 4 stars instead of five because I did not like how open ended the story left the relationship between Sam and Iva and because Sam seemed to tell people he was going to use them as the 'fall guy' and they wouldn't do anything about it. I expected the characters to show more emotion, considering they were going to jail for 20yrs to Life.It is an enjoyable read and a must.

For his own good he has to solve the mystey the red-head landed in his lap.Not having seen the movie of the same name I didn't know what to expect of this story, except that it is labelled a 'classic'. I found this an easy read, and a reasonably short novel. The solution mystery wasn't obvious till near the end and Sam is a classic hard boiled detective. The original man of few words. If you enjoy a good mystery this is one you should read if only see how little, in some ways, this genre has changed over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brigid O'Shaunessy film noir lady","review":"Brigid O'Shaunessy fits into the femme fatale personna perfectly. She is beautiful, sexual, and yes, decieving, but she does what she needs to do to survive. She uses her sexual female charms to convince Sam Spade to help her at whatever cost to him. This book is beautifully written, with vivid imagery and incredible characters. It is one of the best detective fictions around, and one of the best examples of film noir so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Noir","review":"Calculating and cold, taught as the line between black and white, Hammet's razor sharp prose carves characters from the dark heart of the lonely urban jungle. All desperate for something, money, sex, love; all betting more than they can afford to lose. Daring, deliberate, debonair, devilish when need be, Sam Spade knows the town and understands the human heart, and uses this knowledge mercilessly in his methodical and driven search for the Maltese Falcon. This is a classic folks. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't translate","review":"Knowing that The Maltese Falcon is a bit of a classic in the noir genre, I wanted to give it a read. Perhaps this novel was good back when it was written, but I don't think it works today. Sam Spade is chauvanistic and almost comical at times. His language makes him a caricature. Mostly it was hard for me to take this seriously. It almost felt like a parody of 1920's detective novels. Perhaps that was the way people actually acted back then, but for me it just didn't ring true.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard time not pressing eject.","review":"Michael Prichard is no William Dufris whom I experienced listening to 'The Thin Man'. He was fabulously diverse.This book was tediously, unnecessarily, overly descriptive. At first I thought it was Prichards' stiff, non-inflexive, unimaginitive reading style that was bothering me but that wasn't the half of it! Did Hammett get paid by the syllable on this one? I found Brigids character annoying, not sympathetic or likable. I wanted to reach right through my ipod and slap her to make her stop repeating the same lame sentences over and over. I'm not a big Bogart fan but HE is more intriguing and 'lovable' than the Spade depicted in Hammetts' original writing. He seemed dull of wit and had no class. I guess he and Brigid were made for each other. I know from reading other Hammett books that he is better than this, so what's the hubub about? (The movie I guess.) Someone should have told him the truth before printing and gotten a better rewrite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blond Satan, Can I Get Your Number?","review":"Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade is a blonde satan with his own moral code which he upholds come hell or high water. Read it as a mystery, read it as 'a man who knew what it meant to be a man's ethics' and either way it'll hook you in and you won't be able to stop until you've finished. Over the years I've read this novel several times, each time gleaning something new from it. Although any mystery will lose its appeal in the respect of 'whodunnit' after you know the ending, the story about Flitcraft and the falling beam, Spade's theory of the fall guy and the priceless one-liners are worth the price of admission or readmission as the case may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The epitome of mysteries","review":"When one thinks of a mystery, one should think of this book. Sam Spade, the archetype tough guy with street smarts, tries to solve the mysterious death of his partner, finds out the truth behind the constant lies of a beautiful woman, deals with the police breathing down his neck, and deals with some vile criminals.This book grabs you with intrigue and one plot twist after another. New characters, new leads and new ideas are all constantly introduced. Is the innocent looking girl the most evil of them all, or was it the cheating wife? Could the main character himself be a murderer? What was the mysterious package? Questions that lead to riddles that lead to more questions. It's hard not to get caught up in this book.Though the book doesn't really delve deep into any character, and the fluidity of his writing may cause you to re-read a paragraph or two, this book is a short, solid, mystery that should definitely be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid picture of Indian women in Britain","review":"Meera Syal's book \\"Life Isn't All Ha Ha Hee Hee\\" captures the life of three childhood friends who are Indian living in Britain - each with different trajectories in her adult life. It is well written and easy to read. The female characters come alive on the pages through dialogue, descriptions, and their environment. However, the male characters are typically backdrops - little understood, difficult to empathize with. I loved reading it and finished it in one setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been better w/out skold.","review":"This, the last album from the once-invincible KMFDM, was created by a core of Sascha K. and Skold. Gunther and En Esch made only brief appearances, as did Nina Hagen, Ogre, and William Rieflin. This album has ten tracks, over saturated with programming from Sascha and Skold, and it all blends together after awhile. No track, aside from D.I.Y., really stands out. They also seemed to be confused as to who was singing. En Esch sings on like three songs. On some tracks, the credits lists four vocalists. They should have just started MDFMK w/out the remnants from what used to be a good band. It wasn't wise to include Skold in this project, Sascha should have waited for MDFMK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tim-Tim and Sascha Need a Beatdown","review":"So the last album was really good. Right. And the best track was Anarchy with Tim Skold, so the new album with Tim working fulltime was going to be awesome. Right!? Nope. A major letdown. KMFDM has gone out with a beep. Picture KMFDM doing acid house techno... poorly. The highlights of the album are the Ogre tracks which sound like Skinny Puppy doing acid house techno. Otherwise not worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great finale to one of the greatest industrial bands ever.","review":"This is certanly a great finale for KMFDM. Sacha and Skold make a great combo, like they did on Anarchy on the symbols album. Adios has a great mix of songs, each being different. The many guest to the album make it even better, though it could have used Raymond \\"Pig\\" Watts. You should definatly get this album.Farwell KMFDM!Long Live MDFMK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not their strongers work","review":"I'm a pretty big KMFDM fan, but adios did not live up to the band's previous work. It really lacks the creativity and genious that marked previous albums like Nihil and Angst. I just wish that they had put of a better album to end their career with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best release since Angst back in '93","review":"A great farewell album (it turned out not to be the last). Tim Skold is the best thing to have happened to KMFDM (on this album and on \\"!@$%\\" only), even though it's been sad to see En Esch go. Adios is where Sascha lets off some steam, followed by Sycophant, possibly the best track on the album, with Skold doing the vocals and beautiful, playful, poppy synths throughout. \\"DIY\\" is designed to dance to: \\"D-I-Y / Destroy what destroys you!\\". This is followed by another Skold vocal on \\"Today\\" (sensitive, sad, beautiful) and then \\"Witness\\" with, wait for it - NINA HAGEN! UFO's and whatever else she's dreamed up in her warped mind appear all over the song, very Nina! Why didn't they think of getting her to sing a long time ago! The rest of the album is so-so, I find Skinny Puppy's Ogre a bit painful and depressing. All in all, it's better than the last few original albums and worth the money. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am here to eat my words. Curses!!","review":"So, a few weeks ago i came on here and wrote a one star review of Adios. It is humble pie time, becaus i have been listening to it non-stop recently, and i have, embarassingly, totally changed my tune. I have thought long and hard about it, Adios is a great album. But I still haven't changed my mind about Nina Hagen, the woman is terrible, and the song she sings the main vocals on, which i have tried to put out of my mind (successfully, because i have forgotten the name) is an absolute travesty, ugh, horrible horrible song. But Adios, Beriet, Rubicon and the others are great stuff. Still maybe not as good as The other albums, but it is different, anyway. So different tht it took me a couple of months to get into it. But i admire their nerve, putting out an album that somehow seems calculated to annoy long-term fans. What a bizarre band."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album made me a fan!","review":"This was the first KMFDM album I ever bought, and boy was I lucky... after hearing their previous records I was wondering if was listening to the same group. My all-time favorite KMFDM songs are on this album: DIY, Witness, That's All... actually they're all pretty good, especially after comparing them to songs on Xtort and Angst. If you wanna get all their best music I suggest you also buy Retro (compilation album) and perhaps the MDFMK single with Megalomaniac on it. Well, that's all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"i admit not their best work, but my favorite","review":"I absolutely love this CD. I've been a fan of KMFDM for a while now, and I got this album on the day it came out. My favorite track is Tomorrow. That song just shows the real versatility and talent of this band. KMFDM has slowly and purposefully evolved over the 15 years they've been around. Each album sounds just a bit different. So you can't fault them for sounding different on this album than on crowd faves like XTORT or Angst. It's also no surprise that this, their last album, finds them at the peak of their abilities. One complaint I do have, is that aside from Adios, DIY, Tomorrow, Witness, Full Worm Garden and maybe Rubycon the songs are all filler. Those 5 songs are simply amazing and some of KMFDMs best work, but the rest i could do without. Still my favorite KMFDM album. Hope this helped you all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go away, Skold!!","review":"KMFDM has been my favorite band since \\"Money\\"; but after hearing this album (my friend bought it before I did), I almost had to force myself to get it. \\"Adios\\" has been out a while, but since KMFDM are getting back together and recording another album, I had to review this one since I feel so strongly about it.First of all, most of the songs were really weak; \\"Bereit\\" was about the only good one here. Second, although Tim Skold was ok on the last album (\\"Anarchy\\"), he practically took over this album; not a good thing at all. His vocal style is way too [weak] for industrial music....(check out his solo stuff and the MDFMK album and you will see what I mean....it's no wonder MDFMK didn't last). I can only hope the new KMFDM will live up to it's great past....especially now that En Esch will not be a part of it.

This was the last album they did for WAX TRAX and easily their weakest work to date.But then coming on the heels of the 1997 expletive album (which was easily one of the best industrial dance records ever!) most anything will sound dissapointing.

Adios promises to be a fantastic album to rival anything they or any other group has done before. With Sascha K and Tim Skold at the helm of this album nothing can go wrong and with vocals by Nina Hagen, the ruthless guitar of Gunter Schultz, and perhaps an appearance by former Skinny Puppy memeber Nivek Ogre this promises to be the greatest of all possible ways to say farewell to one of the greatest industrial bands of all time, KMFDM."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Begining","review":"It is true that this KMFDM album really doesn't sound like many of their better albums, and En Esch only sings about 3 words.

The book is not really much of an epic. It's the plainly stated tale of Jewish gangsters ( a rarity these days. I should know.

Other tracks, such as \\"Lunacy's Back\\", and \\"Cat Black\\", hint at his potential as a song writer and mystical lyricist, but again, leave much to be desired. All this is forgivable, of course, as most of this is demoed material, and not really intended for mass release. This is only for absolute die-hard fans of Bolan, so I would not recommend this to the casual T.Rex listener.

I'm very pleased to note that Mr. Bahr has not fallen into that category. This work is every bit as good as, and in some ways better than, his first, \\"The Black Flower\\". Once again we have the scene of the Civil War era, and there are even some mentions of characters from the first work in the second. What strikes me, once again, is the powerful imagery and language used throught this book. The author has created characters about whom I came to care deeply, and even the \\"evil\\" ones caught my attention, and evoked sympathy, in some cases. The author has captured a time and place very well, and I look forward to more works from him in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Day Thomas Hardy-beautifully written","review":"This book has been compared to Cold Mountain. However, it is not about a journey home after the war. It is about how the home town had changed, and how they can deal with defeat with honor, and how can they go on. The characters were very interesting, sad mostly. It also blended ghosts into the mix, and the last third of the book was fascinating. The ending left a mixture of hope and sadness. This book will haunt your thoughts for some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fiction","review":"This novel is set in the immediately post-Civil War period. The writing is gorgeous and the characters are well drawn and immediately engaging. Strangely enough, if done right, this would make an amazing movie. There are many scenes of striking visual humor, particularly during the ill-fated charge of Gault's bushwhackers, and these are juxtaposed with serious themes and images. The supernatural blends seamlessly with the prosaic. The end, happy for most characters, was nevertheless a tear-jerker, but I thought it worked well. The theme of the soldiers never really being able to come back, of the war being a country that they will have one foot in for the rest of their lives, is very well developed here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read...","review":"I enjoyed this novel VERY MUCH. Mr Bahr writes with such insight that I felt I was there, and it was such a revelation to me. It goes way past the known facts into the lives and feelings of everyday existence of the people at that time. Read it and prepare to live a slice of the real Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable characters, leaves you thinking","review":"It's not often that a book resonates years after you read it.

Bahr does a superb job of painting the tensions which were common to the South in the wake of the Confederacy's collapse.

Not all children will do well in an inclusive setting. Therapies and professionals put their heart and soul into helping and providing the appropriate services for each individual child. Children with disabilities can and will make progress if they are provided with interventions that are evidence and research based, and carried out by trained personnel.

About 15 minutes after putting our son down for his nap, he started screaming. My husband went in and found my son wedged in between the sleeve (NOT the blanket) and the mattress itself. Our son had opened the back where the velcro was and crawled into the space between the outer sleeve and the mattress. He had wedged himself in and couldn't get out. The valve was leaking air(he had apparently opened the valve), thus the mattress began to deflate. If we had not heard him crying, he probably would have suffocated.

The cosmos of Moby Dick is presented in light of the puritan world picture which denies the open and honest exploration of the untamed beauty of creation. This in depth penetration beyond the glassy surface, of what some have mistook to be merely an adventure novel, reveals the mystery that Ishmael is so hungry to experience. Faced with the figure of Ahab, whose character is revealed in very short bursts of narrative clarity, Ishmael must wrestle with the corrupted view of Leviathan bestowed on him by Ahab and the indifference of nature. Dr. Cowan's book is good for any serious scholar of literature who faces the problems of a withering Academy. I entreat you to explore these exiled waters to come to a deeper understanding of the American Myth which is so important to the restoration of our culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Time Mom in WI","review":"These yoga DVDs are terrible.

And this entry is no exception. Raymond Benson is a lousy writer of the regular Bond novels, and his novelizations are far worse since to begin with, they are novelizations. It's a shame really, because Christopher Wood and John Gardner actually rose above the standard movie tie-in book with their own novelizations of earlier Bonds. But Benson is an out and out hack. (Somewhere in Tomorrow Never Dies he actually writes a sentence like, \\"The car was completely destroyed.\\") I would recommend this book only to die-hard Bond fans that buy all of the books. Otherwise keep away from and from any book by Raymond Benson. He is destroying the Bond literary franchise with inferior product. His writing is FAR worse than anything John Gardner ever penned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not bother","review":"Okay 007 fans, this book was a waste of time.

Blindsides new stuff is not as heavy as their old albums. This album has 4 really good songs ( pitiful,caught a glimpse,sleep walking, and cute boring love) those are the hardest songs on the cd.

The band takes their sound forward, though still reminicient of their first, self-titled album, still forging ahead into new hard-rock territory. \\"Silence\\" will not dissapoint any devoted rock fans, although their sound does depart from their significantly more aggressive 2nd release, \\"A Thought Crushed My Mind\\" which has caused some indie followers seem to label this release a \\"sellout\\" record.

I like every song on the album, though a few stand out. Pitiful, time will change your heart, midnight, and she shut your eyes are all unique and excellent. the last song on the album, silence, is a transcient piece that will sooth you to sleep after you've completely drain yourself and are nearly passed out on the floor. if your a fan of rock, you should have this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD i own","review":"My new obsession with this band all happened because of a mistake really, i tried downloading purify from metallica's new cd but it was really pitiful with a different name.What can i say, i love this band and their cd is awesome.

Blindside blows complacent rock bands out of the water. I've never experienced such talent in a hard-metal band. Their music is far from dry; they take their music seriously--every track is listenable. I've come across one of their music videos on a dvd under the other record label they were under---excellent. I love how this band isn't afraid to be themselves. They aren't afraid of being creative--They're bold; I totally respect that. It's cool how they're Christian without being bound by the Christian stigma and so musically cultivated. Be careful if you buy this cd used--some z-shop merchants are selling promo cd's (they're stamped on front)--selling promo cd's is prohibited even though they may be brand new. Promo cd's also usually contain less art and pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected, but good","review":"Well, the first thought that comes to mind is to encourage all blindisde followers to get the cd in order to support the band, but also cuz it'll be the last bit of hard rock you'll hear out of them most likely. I'm sadened to see it happen to another great band. As a follower from their first US release, \\"blindside\\", i have a fairly decent feel for their style and realize that like many other bands they are beggining to conform to the radio friendly standards. Do the music videos have to be on mtv?! no, let's keep the music real and raw. Blindside was a GREAT underground band, but i feel has lowered their standards to attract more people. Once again, good cd, but if you want real music go for their first 2 releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bland paste","review":"Nothing really struck me on this album as original. Their musicianship wasn't terrible, just uninspired. I've heard the occasional screaming vocals before, and done better.While I continue to search for new music, I have encountered dozens of standard sounding rock bands that don't thrill me.

Well Blindside changed that a little for me. They have this sound that many christians lack and that's being different. Their music is a mixer of hard core-incubus. His voice comes out at different levels making it fun to listen to. I'm still looking for that christian band however that will me blow me away like incubus,coldplay,radiohead, and other secular bands have. God save."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swedish Rock and Roll to Ponder","review":"Blindside's third LP, \\"Silence\\" combines raw emotion and power. As I listen to this album it's obvious that the listener is getting a glimpse into the heart of Blindside. The topics range from personal pride, to superficial love, to Ultimate Reality. What sets Blindside apart from many bands is their realness. There is substance to each song. Some cds have lyrics worth pondering, this is one of them. If you like to be challenged to grow in your thinking, Blindside is for you. The music of \\"Silence\\" is lighter than past Blindside efforts, but is still very good. Christian's raw scream can still be heard on almost all the songs. But it's his unique, Swedish singing voice that draws the listener in. The production on this cd is really good, clean, but not over polished. They don't sound like a band in a plastic box, it's real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've heard in a long time","review":"I have been listening to all the normal music that I do, Living Sacrifice and Project 86, mostly. I haven't bought a CD this refreshing in a long time. It's something that no one else has done recently: A singer that sometimes yells, and sometimes doesn't, which is accompanied by hard rock. My favorite track so far would have to be Silence, track 13. Blindside is a lot like Taproot in the way they sing. The guitars are like Project 86's. The drums are somewhat like Trust Company's. This CD is a nice hypbrid of everything ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blindside Is So AWESOME!!!!","review":"This album is great. I like it start to finish. Here's proof that better music comes from other countries, mainly Sweden, from which this band is from. They're so awesome, I can't even begin to explain. If you haven't seen the \\"Pitiful\\" video, you need to download it or something. Christian Lindskog has so much energy in him. I can't wait until I can actually go to one of their concerts.I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT!!!My favorite song is \\"Caught A Glimpse,\\" closely followed by \\"Time Will Change Your Heart.\\" But all the songs rock! I have all their CD's, but this one's my favorite. But there's not one of them that don't shine through or fail to impress.If you like this band, you need to get the documentary DVD, Ten Years Running Blind. It's got some funny moments, and really digs deep into their starter days. Plus it's got a few concerts on there.Check this band out!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"If you have already purchased the noritake colorwave dish sets, then this sugar bowl is a great investment.

Gives you all you'll need, including SOME different screws and SOME pocket hole plugs. The instructions are detailed if you've never made a pocket hole the settings are easy to use. This is my first Kreg product and it looks like they make well designed and durable products.

After watching a few video's on this product I needed to try it out. Even though the instructions are easy to read, let me tell you it is easier to use than trying to listen to everyone tell you how.I love using this Kreg R3 Jr. pocket hole jig. It makes working on the projects easier. The jig is small and can be used just about anywhere. I like the case it is in. You can take it with anywhere.I want to buy the extra clamps to go with it.

You won't regret buying this product if you do woodworking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have bought sooner","review":"Had several frames for various projects to make and found my homemade jig to cumbersome. So I did some research and settled on the R3 Jr. Now with all but one project finished and upwards of eighty joints made, I have come to appreciate this jig and all the added features. It is a well designed and made jig. The instructions in the user manual are clear and the drawings informative. Even what I thought of as gimmicks, the measuring guide in the case for example, turned out to be very helpful and time saving. The jig, when set up right, works great. Also much appreciated were the different screw sample packs. They convinced me to stick with the Kreg screws and not the ones I wanted to use originally. Over all, I'm very please with jig and would gladly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the glue","review":"Have you ever wonder why didn't I came up with this idea?

The case is just the right size and keeps all the parts in one place and safe. And at this price, just fixing one thing can pay for the jig, bit, screws, and everything else. You never have to worry about drilling through or damageing the exposed side of furniture. I'm very happy.

Looks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome little Jig","review":"I purchased this jig to make a farm table for my wife, it was our turn to host Thanksgiving and we didn't have a dining table big enough for our family, so I decided to make one. It made the assembly so much easier! Didn't have a single board crack on me. It was the first time I used it so I was reluctant to even purchase it but boy am I glad i did. Only thing is I wish I would have bought the bigger one because now I want to make other projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"I'm a beginner with woodworking, and I bought the R3 for it's low price for a few projects. It's really easy to use, and after reading through the instruction booklet once, I don't have to look at it again. I've used it to make pocket holes to replace L-brackets in a project and to improve some cheap particle board furniture, and both are now much more sturdy than they were before. Needless to say, I will be using it a lot more, and I'll buy another whenever this one wears out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely love this jig!","review":"I'm currently building a media center for my family room, and I bought this pocket screw jig for helping me build the face frame of my cabinets. However, I've discovered that I can use pocket screws just about every where in my construction! I'm using pocket screws for the shelves, sides, top support, every where! With these screws you don't need to use clamps, and the joints are incredibly strong. With some glue and screws you can keep building and you don't need to wait for the glue to dry.I'm very happy that I purchased this jig, as it works great for drilling pocket screw holes. You do need to use the special pocket hole screws (not regular drywall screws), but they are reasonably priced considering how much time they save you in construction of your project. This jig, will definitely be one of my most favorite tools in my wood shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect tool for the job.","review":"I purchased this pocket hole jig in order to complete my first real quest into woodworking. I was building a sofa table featured in Wood Magazine. The fastening method used was pocket hole screws. The Kreg system was the only one I found mentioned consistently in many web searches. It is not that expensive and figured I'd give it a shot. The system performs as advertised. Clean, fast drilling. Makes solid joint connections. I was particularly impressed with the little case everything comes in. Has the instructions and information on what settings and screw sizes to use on a nice sticker right inside the box...no instruction book to lose. The only suggestion I can make to anyone is to buy extra screws. This kit comes with about 10 of a few different screw types and lengths. I needed 16 for my project and had to settle for a slightly smaller screw size for some of them. I quickly ordered a lot more screws. Great product though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"This mower has been in the shop twice per summer since I purchased it. Every time for the same issue. The blade clutch system requires adjustment. It is covered by the warranty, but it's very inconvenient to take it for service (20 miles away and 2-4 week turn around time). When it works, it cuts grass perfectly, but the blade clutch (a great feature in theory) just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Paid for Sore Thumbs & Faulty Assembly","review":"I purchased this mower after waiting for my Lawn Boy to die (it lasted 10 years). I had high expectations for the product given the reputation of Honda Mowers. I was very disappointed when a persisent gas leak discolored my mower deck. It turned out that the sealing gasket in the gas tank was not installed at the factory. Also, the Smart Drive leads to thumb fatigue and discomfort. All-in-all, an average performer at a premium price. Enough that I am done with Honda branded products, including their automobiles as Toyota is an always good buy.This paragraph comes about a year later than the previous information. My mower is now non-functioning due to a manufacturing defect with a spring used in the Roto Drive blade engagement system. I just discovered that the spring is subject to a recall. I wonder what the next problem will be with this overpriced, sub-standard product. Do not buy Honda lawnmowers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go ahead - dig that groove...!!","review":"Can't believe nobody has reviewed this album.

Then dig that groove!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Toys Dolls first album - a classic!","review":"Released in 1983, I don't know why it took me over 20 years to get or hear this album. These guys are one of the top 5 punk rock bands of all time, in my opinion, and should be more well known in the U.S. than they are. As catchy as the Ramones, with better guitar playing (sorry Johnny), this album is full of classic Toy Dolls songs that they still play to this day. You won't be disappointed. Now go buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Product and Honest Condition","review":"This was the first product I received from an a large order from four or five suppliers.

Awesome service is all I can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"My beloved first band...","review":"Years ago, before I was really into music, my brother gave me a casette copy of an album by a wierd punk band. The cassette was probably about a 5th generation copy, was listened to about a million times, but nevertheless turned out to be the first album that I ever owned (but it was a copy, so I guess I didnt really own it ;-) ) and loved. That album was Dig That Groove Baby by the Toy Dolls.

For example: Potato Lasagna of Wild Mushrooms with Herb Sauce (page 130) left me with an uncooked taste in the potatoes. I am now wondering if something was left out of the recipe. The Garden Paella (page 128) turned out bland and not very tasty. I can not believe that Mario Leon-Iriarte is serving this at his resturant. Overall, the recipes look great, but I'm suspicous that the author didn't try them out before publishing this book.

I'm a Ph.D. student and have lots of big books and loaded these up and they're just fine. Smaller items might not sit well on them but you can always put them in a plastic container.

They upgraded the combat system by adding drives but they made the summons less fun to s fight with. That's just the combat system the graphics's are just amazing especially at the ending. They add some new characters as well as keeping some old ones. The storyline is so complex that it would take me a very long time to finish. The characters are very complex as well. It is a very long game (which is a good thing). The music is very fun to listen to and the voices in the game are very well-done too. All in all this is a must-have for all PlayStation 2 owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Game","review":"I got this game for Christmas last year, and I'm still playing it. With all the awesome mini-games, sweet combo attacks, intense boss battle, and new worlds to discover, who says that it should be horrible?

There is NO GAME HERE. Mash on the X button and move on. I know 10 year olds who would get bored with this gameplay. Whats worse, the story- whatever little there is, unfolds very very slowly. Most of the time you go to worlds that re-create the films they came from with wierd battles that make no sense. The sped up versions of the worlds' story make for an experience not unlike seing the Beauty and the Beast 17 minute show at MGM Studios. Only difference is it is experienced for multiple films and in video game form. I think the characters in the prologue showed the most intrigue but alas they arent to be the center of the story. Ignore the Disney freaks here- the only thing worse than a lame Disney sequel is a lame Disney video game!! Stay away from Kingdom Hearts II."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Fun!","review":"It's an addictive game.

Althought I first thought this game would be kinda childish. But, although there is an element of childish cut-scenes, it only adds to the overall accesability to all ages and audiences. The battle controls are fun and easy, with tons of cool colors (yea, I like colors). The programmers of this had to be in-depth, for example, in a cut-scene, if you change blade or shield or magic staff, you see it in the cut-scene. The graphics in this game are top notch, which is expected from final fantasy makers. The game takes you to places in the disney universe that you always wanted to see, like the underworld and even disney castle. The cut-scenes can be quite annoying though, including the classic disney \\"your my friend\\" speech A LOT!!! And you have to watch them to get whats going on. Battle gets really easy after awhile, so I just run away from enemies. But still, if you want a break from evil m-rated games, this is the PERFECT GAME. I hope this helped yall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Kingdom Hearts II is an amazing game. The graphics are great and the voices are as well. Though, it's not surprising. It's Square Enix's work.Almost everything in this game is perfect. Having to fight with the Final Fantasy characters was fun and the story line was somewhat confusing but not very. If you've played the first game, and didn't play the GBA game, you can still make it out.The only thing that really disappointed me about this is game is that it's a bit short. It was said to be 100 hours of game time though, many of my friends and I beat the game in less than 50.

It's a great game and well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Off beat game","review":"Kingdom Hearts 2 was a well put together game. The controls are a bit different from the original. As well as the new reaction commands being put into play this is a new style for RPG combat. The story line is also a bit off key from the original. The way that you have to unlock the worlds to get to the next one is a bit off key do to the fact that it was you in the first one who locked all the worlds. Even if your not a kid or are not into Disney I would still give this game a try. So overall I would give this game a 9 on a scale of one to ten"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great place to visit, but . . . . .","review":"I loved the first game. I found myself really sucked into the whole world of Kingdom Hearts. So, needless to say, I was thrilled to get the sequel, but I was a little let down. The characters are great, the art is top-notch, the voice acting is SUPERB, to say the least (some of the best voice acting I've ever heard, in fact) but I feel like the worlds sort of fall flat. They are a little boring. The Lion King world, for example, is just a flat plain, and then a path through a gorge, then a path through a canyon, then a path through a forest . . . you get the idea.Also, the came is outrageously easy. All you have to do to win almost every battle is hit X over and over.

Maybe they made it easier so younger kids could play. Even in difficult mode the game tells you what to do and where to go. Kind of Stupid I think. No Challenge at all. And after you visit the worlds once you visit them one more time, but they are so easy.Didn't really like this game. If it wasn't for the cool moves and sommons Sora does, I wouldn't like this game at all.THIS IS NOT A GAME TO PLAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN. RENT IT, BEAT IT, THEN BRING IT BACK.

That was one of the best games I have ever played. I am now a major fan. I own the 1st 2 books(still waiting for the 3rd to come out), & I want a crown necklace just like Sora's, & I wish I could get a keyblde off of ebay. I would have so much fun scareing my cat with that...*cough* Anyway, I really wish I had a playstation2 so i could get it. So if you have a Playstation2 take advantage of getting this game!

There are only a couple confusing parts:1. Why do they keep changing from the characters actually talking to speech bubbles? It doesn't make sense!2. The first boss is more like watching a cutscene in someplaces.3. What's with the freaky little thing that you have to battle to win the tournament in the beginning?

Although this is a great game, there are a one thing that makes the original better than the second one, the story. The story was more interesting in the first one because most of the worlds in the first one were connected to each other so good that it seem like a movie. In this one, it seems there were more focused on putting new worlds than the story, since it seem like episodes from a show. Other than that, the graphics, gameplay, and boss battles are better. This game is a must have for any PS2 owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, need final mix.","review":"If you played the original KH then you'll love this game.

For some reason I thought it would be the exact same gameplay with a continuation of the story. Only I soon realized that it was completely different game, and I contemplated putting it away and never playing it again.I gave it another shot and really got into it. All I had to do was separate one from the other, and the last battle with Xemnas was twenty times harder than the Ansem boss battle (which is a good thing). I will always like the first game better, but i'm glad I got past the differences and played Kingdom Hearts II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catch-22","review":"I have bad news and worse news, the bad is that if you played Kingdom Hearts I you will absolutely hate Kingdom Hearts 2. The game play is non-exsistant, the story line is at the 1st grade level, and everything they did right in the first game is now gone. The worse news is that the only way one would enjoy this game is if they had never played KH1. BUT if you never played KH1 you will never understand KH2....even at its 1st grade level. You have to give SquareEnix credit, in order to mess up the Final Fantasy Franchise (they are responsible for the horrible FFX2 as well) this bad they really had to work hard. I am sorry to say that I am afraid that FFX is the last we will ever see of the FF world. But to pull some good news out of all of this, if you like a 50 hour Disney commercial then this is the game for you. In several worlds you play the EXACT story-line of many of the Disney movies. There is no doubt what is coming next in the game.....and for some that might be a good thing????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as the First","review":"My son had played this game before we bought it.

The gameplay is better than the first one.The graphics during gameplay are pretty good, but cutscene graphics are almost real!

The gameplay is excuisite; The \\"button-mashing\\" technique has proved to work. But the most fun part of the game are the different worlds and characters there are to be seen. From Agrabah all the way to the Hundred Acre Wood,and from Halloween Town to the Pride Lands and Port Royal, there are many places to visit. I recommend this game to anyone who is a true gamer.

The music and voice talent is outstanding.But the game mechanics are almost non-existant. The game is quite long, but that is because of the tediously regular cutscenes. The actual player-controlled portions of Kingdom Hearts II are far too short.Seeing the many Disney worlds in Kingdom Hearts II is fun, but the exploration is limited and too linear.Kingdom Hearts II is a fine game for pre-teens that enjoy watching pretty special effects...But anyone older will probably find the gameplay tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but uncompelling...","review":"I'm going to set this into pros and cons...Pros: Good gameplayFunPlays like the originalCons: All of the good voice acting from the original was whored out to talentless hacks.Answers too many questions that \\"weren't asked\\" and took away from the big questions presented at the end of the first game.Has extremely generic philosophical references.Has unexplained changes in characters, as well as inaccurate references to the games they were derived from (especially FF7).Arguably too easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingdom Hearts II review","review":"In all honesty I am writing this review because amazon won't stop sending me messages in my e-mail. What I think of the game overall: It was a decent game, though made by Square Enix, this game had its qualities, though having a walking, talking duck and dog following you around all the time, can get annoying, Anyways, this game offers players with either high or low gaming skill to enjoy this game. Its suitable for all ages and even those people who are not up to par, with gaming can give it a good go. The game did have its flaws, it had a really bad habit of repeating itself, and the absolute worse thing about the game is the gumi-ship battles, the gumi-ship battles are a complete waste of time, and have nothing to do with the game, it servers no purpose what-so-ever to the story, and its not even challenging, its just long! Anyways the score I give this game is 68/100, decent game though it could use a touch-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Game","review":"Well this game is isn't too long or isn't too short and it is a decent Action RPG, which is good for RPG fans, so I recommend this game to someone who has at least some knowledge of the Final Fantasy series and well loves RPGs, so I guess that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindom Hearts II","review":"This is one of my first games on my new ps2.

You travel to memorable worlds of Disney, meet characters of Final Fantasy games, and much more. Rich graphics, sweet gameplay, awesome story, and characters make this a favorite of any gamer out there. I'm a complete KH fan, so I will NEVER say no to this series! This game is better and slightly easier than the original, and may be confusing at first... That's why you get Re: Chain of Mermories, 358/2 Days, Birth by Sleep, and of course, the first game!

The problem is that the examples he gives are overly simplistic and is based on a Judeo-Christian version of the truth. The truth is a moving target and it really depends on who you ask.

I did like, however, many of the techniques they mentioned, especially for vocabulary and writing. The reading roulette and different word puzzles and anticipation guides mentioned are good ideas that are easily incorporated into any lesson in any content area.

The songs are mostly Kimmie Rhodes originals, though Willie contributes two (\\"Valentine\\" and \\"It Will Always Be\\") with the remainder of the set coming from sources as disparate as Tom Waits (the wrote title track), Rodney Crowell and Rhodes' partner, Joe Gracey.

There is an old axiom that romance stories by women end in happily-ever-after and romances by men end in death, and that holds true in this case. I found the romance cloying, flat and one-sided. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but a virtuous 1896 woman sleeping with a man she's known one day is another.

It's just weird and to me it almost seems like he shouldn't be writing a love story. I really don't understand all of the 5 stars.

I am very disappointed. The whole book feels more like the ravings of a man half-mad. The transitions from scene to scene are poorly done. The characters are not well-developed. Although time-travel is supposed to be hard to believe to begin with, this story line is particularly unconvincing. I cannot feel for either of the two main characters. I can see how it can make a good movie without the distraction of the poor writing style. The protagonist's ravings about how much he loves this girl whom he has never met and his constant apologies to her once he meets her are just plain annoying.

My stool changed color, lost weight, and my vision, sense of smell, and hearing became distorted. If you look at the information on the web it says that MSM is completely safe, however most nutritional supplements are not subject to rigorous study to determine their safety. Thus, the paucity of data with respect to the long-term safety of MSM. According to my M.D, MSM acts to suppress amino acid production in one's body, and is extremely unsafe for that reason. As amino acids are essential for nervous system function, etc. I had to withdraw from a semester of college due to taking MSM. I would highly recommend not taking it, and if you do using extremely low dosages and consulting with your M.D first. As taking it is not like taking a multi-vitamin.

On the days I take it I feel I have much more energy (mentally and physically!), my joints and muscles feel more fluid, and any pain I've been having is decreased. Also, when the MSM leaves my body it's effects on my joints and muscles linger, so it really supplements, it doesn't just give a temporary effect.I've done a good bit of research on MSM and DMSO lately: MSM supplements the body with sulfur, which we need to survive. Rainwater has the highest concentration of MSM, and then plants, but it breaks down in sunlight, so a lot of the plants we eat aren't fresh enough to have as much sulfur as we need. Also, because of our water treatment systems, none of the water we drink has any sulfur in it anymore. Because of these factors, a good source of sulfur is needed.I found I don't need 1000 mg each day, so I try to take half a capsule a day (sometimes I forget).

Make sure if you are going to buy MSM make sure you read the whole label. When I typed in 100% pure MSM, this TriMedica MSM came up. I was told pure MSM is what I need, not 99%.

While the ending is rather predictable and the characters of the students are almost trite, with the exception of the rich girl that ends up with the guy called \\"Monster\\", the story is enjoyable. But, if you are a fan of dance, and I am, the tango scene, and the end scene with the various dances are worth the price of the movie. The extras on the disc are pretty standard, but I have to again admit that I watched the tango from all four angles. It is flawless.

He hopes to teach them to trust/respect and depend on each other while doing the Viennese waltz. At first the kids scoff then they get into it.Based on the true story of Pierre Dulaine, \\"Take the Lead\\" is another installment in our growing fascination with Ballroom Dancing. It is neither worse than \\"Dancing With The Stars\\" nor better than the recent \\"Mad Hot Ballroom.\\" What it is, is slightly amusing when it stays in the dance training mode and silly and obvious when it strays into social comment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot dancing!","review":"I can't resist 'hot dancing' and this film has it!

Unfortunately, the glass column has a bend in it between the bulb and the main body of the thermometer. This makes reuniting the liquid impossible as the gap becomes hung up there.The suggested ice water method does not work as it is not cold enough to draw all the liquid dye into the bulb. If you shake the thermometer as advised, the beads in the bulb will break the glass. I have repaired thermometer problems many times when I worked in a laboratory, but this was a lost cause. The thermometer also lacks an expansion bulb at the top, so heating to eliminate the gap will burst the glass.I now suspect the temperature inaccuracies described in the other reviews were due to gaps in the column that were not noticed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to learn","review":"This set is no different than most language courses.

I do pick up phrases and vocabularies here and there through out the chapters, but the layout is so incoherent it's hard to feel confident.

As Latino culture melds into the American mainstream, I felt that part of the American experience was passing me by. OK, once you have made the decision to learn Spanish, where do you begin? I didn't have time for evenings at a Community College. Rosa Martin's book was recommended to me. The lessons quickly focus on the practical (asking directions, going to stores, etc.). Confidence comes quickly with Martin's method. The dialogues are readily applicable to daily life. Importantly, this inspires the student to stay with the program, even when working alone. It's fun. There are no odd Castilian pronunciations or tedious verb-tense arcanery. It is just plain speech for the average Joe (Jose') and quickly assimilated. It reminds me of corporate or armed forces language schools. Martin's book is the best of it's type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Variants must be considered","review":"This is a good course in general, I agree.

It's too small for adults like myself, but for kids 4-12 it really does the trick. It rides a little rough on the street, but it's great on freshly paved surfaces and side walks. Do note that the wheels are on the smaller side, so they feel every single bump and road imperfection. Small loose rocks can stop the scooter if driven over at the wrong angle. Definitely make sure you purchase a helmet and pads along with this scooter if you have inexperienced little ones.One issue I did not like about Amazon is the constant price changing they do. When I first added this scooter to my cart, it was priced at $25, then about a hour later, when I was nearing completion of my shopping, the price went up to $30.

The wheelie bar for one makes no sense, and two: the suspension just makes the scooter travel slower. If you are going to buy your child a scooter for them to merely ride up and down the sidewalk, buy them an a1 scooter.

It's sturdy, easy to fold up and light enough for her to carry. It makes it funner to get to school in the morning and as a parent who is overprotective of her getting hurt, I feel comfortable watching her start to learn all the tricks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price is great value over Pro","review":"We debated between this and the Pro but the Pro's extra money just cou;ldn't be justified by us.

I'm like nuts with this thing!!!!","review":"Get one yours and you'd so enjoy this but remember, you're talking yourself being about less than 15 years old or a tiny adult. I'm like 26 years old and this scooter rocks although the standing area is pretty small and only just enough for one leg and plus. However, if you're an adult and really want a scooter that you could stand with your own two feet front and back such as on a skateboard, consider other scooters fit for adults! Awesome!!!!Best wishes from Joshua in Beverly Hills-Calif-USA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This is a very small, not average sized Razor.

It didn't take long for her to learn how to control steering, braking, etc. And she's on to doing stunts \\"like the big boys do\\". She always wears her helmet. It is easy to store and travel since it folds. It should last as she grows with the easy to adjust handle. Gravel slows her down but doesn't stop her in her tracks so don't worry about having a perfectly smooth surface for good performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best scooter for durability factor","review":"This scooter was a request by my son for his 10th birthday and he loves it. It is easy to spot zipping down the street with the bright shiny red handles and wheels and the sturdy steel frame takes a beating and stands up to multiple drops on the sidewalk. It folds for easy storage and is surprisingly lightweight and the handle is height adjustable. Definitely worth the money for the years of use your kids will get with this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Toy! Well worth the money.","review":"The upgrades on this A2 scooter make it well worth the price over the original Razor A scooter. My kids both love the \\"wheelie bar\\" in the back - which keeps them from getting sandals stuck in the rear tire (yes, that was a bloody accident on a previous scooter). I bought the A2 for my 10-year-old for Christmas. This one is for my 4-year-old. These scooters take hard daily abuse at our house. Going off jumps, curbs, etc. They are ridden DAILY - no kidding. Razor scooters are very durable compared to the others we have owned over the years.

The amount of fun you have overall depends on you though. If you like the skateboard but can't ride one, this is the perfect gift for you.This \\"toy\\" isn't very educational. The only thing I can think is educational about this is that it might teach you proper safety, responsibility, and most of all how to ride a scooter. You really can't expect many life lessons from a scooter. It is something you use to have fun afterall.The toy is very durable. I haven't had any problems at all with any parts breaking or wearing out, and I have used this for atleast 2 years, on a regular basis. From what I have heard, some people have had problems with how durable this scooter is so I cannot assure you that it will not break, but I am pretty confident it won't if you use it properly.So overall this toy will satisfy you in how much fun you will get out of it and it will last you quite awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razor Scooter","review":"The Razor has been the most durable of all scooters we've owned.

Each easily learned to handle and ride with very few mishaps. I think it is pretty safe for a ride-on type toy. (we bought helmets and thankfully have never had any bad landings). Now three years later I am still watching them ride working up a good healthysweat and loving it!! So, I just purchased scooter number 4 forone of the girls who has practically worn the wheels off (I hopeI can talk her into the replacement of her favorite toy).

Ok, I do have one negative to point out. Be careful when you pick the dang thing up to move it when your child leaves it laying in the middle of the garage, as it spins around and will catch your ankle with the heavy metal board.

He didn't know how to ride a bike, but he quickly learned how to balance on the scooter.

He learned how to ride his bike by learning to balance on his scooter!We now have another son who's 3. He's now able to balance on his scooter and we'll be taking off his training wheels soon!All three of my kids love their scooters. It's nice that the scooters come in different colors for them.

I opted to purchase another one through a different company that used UPS instead of USPS (more reliable shipping). Several days later the first scooter arrived, three weeks late. the cost to return it was high enough that it made more sense to just keep it. So, now I have two and only needed one. I realize USPS is at fault for the shipping, but a better action plan from the seller could have resolved this quicker. The scooter was a present for a birthday.

It is light and easy to ride on. If your looking for a scooter that you want to just ride then it's great for you. Although people use scooters to ride around, another popular use for them is to do tricks on. This scooter is good for riding but I would not use it to do tricks on. I have had this scooter since I was a very young age and it has survived around 6 years. Unfortunately after a couple days of pretty simple tricks, the handlebars broke and were constantly folding back. If you want a scooter to do tricks on, try the ultra pro or the ultra pro lo, but if your a young kid between the ages of 5 and 10 and all you wanna use it for is as a transportation method, then this is the scooter for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it!","review":"This was a Christmas present for my 10 year old son that replaced his older Razor (still in good shape but was a hand down from his older brother) and he thinks it's a great scooter.

But, since the campus is not that big, riding a bike is too much of a hassle. With a scooter, you can just fold it up and carry it with you to class, but you can't do that with a bike. I wanted to buy a scooter, but I wanted one that was unique. Once I saw this Hello Kitty scooter, I fell in love!

A quick clean will fix this, but it is something to watch for.A small adult can easily use this with no difficulties.

From day one it would not fold properly and the handle would not lock fully. We sent it back and got a new one thinking we got a defective one. The second one had the same problem. Because my son uses the scooter almost daily to get to school and around the neighborhood, he did not want to send it back and wait for a replacement yet again. So, now we just never fold it up which, is a bit inconvenient living in a New York City apartment. My advice is go to a store with your kid and have them try several models, opening and closing them to see if they can do it consistently before making a purchase.

Then walk down the street to Mr. Yancey's house, go into his basement and check out J Dilla's \\"Donuts.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Alexander Scourby: The Scourge of the Intellect","review":"The mythology of Christianity, which, in short, is a conglomeration of pieces of many ancient Pagan religions, is just that: a MYTHOLOGY.Alexander Scourby treats this material as if it were fact, which would make this rendition laughable, if not so disgusting (perhaps if it were a short story, it would in fact be hilarious...I just don't know)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss you Hazel","review":"The songs here represent and an incredible history, some are bluegrass, some are old time, some are folk, its NICE to see such a variety and collection in one place. Of NOTE: Hazel Dickens makes this work, no Hazel, no magic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Expands Your Creativity","review":"Without a doubt this is the most valuable book on Fireworks I own. It expands your creativity and opens up an entire world of techniques, effects and all-round nifty ideas. I'm so grateful to the authors for writing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Par","review":"This book \\"does not\\" teach you Fireworks 4. I find that this book was an excuse for the author to show off the tricks that she learned along the way. The format is: someone sends in a \\"how do I do this question\\" and she answers the questions. But, it's very specific and advanced questions from the person that sent them in and not stuff that anyone wanting to learn about Fireworks would ask. The type of questions are from someone who's been working on it awhile and can't figure out how to do something tough. A \\"Show and Tell\\" book so-to-speak. Get the Fireworks 4 Bible if you want to learn Fireworks."},{"rating":"2","title":"great insight and information for parents and students","review":"The Gap Year Advantage is the most comprehensive and useful book about the benefits and realities of the Gap Year experience. As the parent of a student who did a gap year, we would have better prepared having read this book. Can't recommend it more highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gap-Year for the affluent","review":"I ordered this hoping to get a broad sampling of gap-year alternatives. While the book provided some lists that included affordable options such as City Year and AmeriCorp, the profiles of students were those who had lots of family money to travel/live internationally. Maybe unintentionally, the book puts the gap-year option in the realm of the affluent, and of the exceptionally bright, independent student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works exactly as advertised","review":"The transfer switch arrived in very good packaging - no damage. The instructions are easy to follow, and I had no trouble installing it. I tested it out and it works great. One great feature is that the wires are all continuously printed with the circuit letter designation on the wire, rather than stick on labels that can come off when you pull the wire into the breaker box or have to shorten the wires. I recommend this to anyone. So, other than looking like 1950's technology, it rates awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"great transfer switch","review":"This was an easy to install switch if you're comfortable working inside your breaker panel. Directions were very easy to follow. You will need to provide the 10/3 wire from the outside box to the switch. The most difficult part was finding the best path and installing the 10/3 wire from the switch to my chosen outside mounting location. Now I'm just waiting for that first ice storm to try it for real!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple to Install","review":"I decided to install it myself and I found the instructions to be simple and very well written and NOT chinese translated into English. It took me three hours taking my time and it works perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great transfer switch.","review":"I can see why this item has so many positive reviews. It does what it is supposed to do. It's easy to install. The wires are both labeled and color coded. Gives you great piece of mind to know that this device is ready to work when called upon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great !","review":"It is exactly what I needed and works great. If anyone is looking to pewee their house with a generator, this will make your life so much easier"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super easy install","review":"Just purchased this in antispation of \\"Sandy\\" watched the DVD instructions and installed in about 2 hours. Super easy, great instructions, and worked great when I tested it. My guess is that the powere will not go out now. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll be glad you bought it","review":"When the power goes out, you'll be glad you bought it. After you have a qualified electrician install it, it's just a flip of a few switches and you have power again. Once the power get's back up, just flip the switches to back to the line power and shut off the grenerator. It powers most everything in my small house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliance controls","review":"Nice unit easy to install no problems. Just as decribed. Hooked right up to my Generators no Problems. Yours generators may not have the standard plug on your unit and may require you to go purchase one, Still no problems. Watch the video on youtube on how to install. . Fast shipping wonderful price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everthing you need to get job done","review":"This product is fantastic and very well thought out! It is one of the best kits available for the intended purpose. Very well made and easy to install. You only need to provide the 10/3 wire if you are installing the outside receptacle. A great product and highly recomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply installation","review":"Instructions were clear and easy to understand. All wires were clearly marked making connection to the main fuse box easy. Everything needed was included in the box except for the wire needed to the remote outlet which can be purchased at your local hardware store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for information","review":"Can someone that has ordered this kit from amazon answer a question for me? I see the connector in the picture for of the \\"Power Cord Inlet Box\\" that mounts on the outside of the house. Is this included in the kit? I can't seem to fing that information anywhere that I have searched."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAPLY BUILT, DO NOT BUY","review":"Those little \\"button breakers\\" are not full size breakers! Yes they may happen to be UL 489 certified, but would you trust your family's safety to button breakers? I wouldn't. You may be led to believe that the full size breakers in your main panel are protecting the wiring in your home at all times, but this is NOT true. When you're running on generator power, the only thing preventing an overload from burning down your home is those little button breakers.Do not install this product in your home. You want FULL SIZE BREAKERS for proper protection. When I pointed this out in a recent video, Reliance Controls threw their LAWYER at me instead of correcting the flaw in their product. They know about the flaw and are suppressing criticism of it.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, nor any product that uses \\"button breakers\\" where there should be FULL SIZE BREAKERS."},{"rating":"1","title":"not in stock after 2 weeks","review":"no update after date promised to be shipped, plus 1 week. not impressed. should at least let me know so i could order elseware. hope the product is better than the service."},{"rating":"1","title":"EMERGENCY POWER ONLY","review":"FOR MOST HOME'S THIS WILL WORK GREAT. (KIND OF PRICEY)IF YOU DON'T PLAN ON RUNNING ANY HEAVY STUFF. I USE IT IN MY HOUSE AND WHEN I USED THE COFFEE MAKER (APPOX 1500 WATTS) YOU COULD HERE THE GENERATOR (7500 WATT) STRUGGLE WHEN THE POT CYCLED ON AND OFF. IT WILL NOT RUN A ELECTRIC HEATING SYSTEM OR HOUSE AIR COND. IT WILL RUN YOUR FURNACE IF YOU ARE ON GAS. AGAIN YOU MUST BE VERY SELECTIVE TURNING ON ELECTRICAL STUFF IN THE HOUSE. IT IS MEANT AS A STOP GAP MEASURE LIGHTS AND BASIC SPACE HEATER FOR 1 ROOM. I WOULD NOT RUN TV'S OR OTHER ELECTRONIC DEVICES DUE TO VARYING POWER LEVELS YOU COULD MESS THEM UP RUNNING A TV OR COMPUTER ON 105 TO 120 VOLTS MAY NOT BE GOOD. ALSO YOU MUST TURN ON HI WATTAGE STUFF FIRST THEN LOW WATTAGE NEXT DU TO INITIAL POWER SURGES.IF THIS POST BOTHERS YOU SORRY BUT DON'T BE A CHEAP SKATE AND FIND OUT THAT YOU NEEDED A BIGGER GENERATOR AND SWITCHING UNIT. PLEASE HAVE AN ELECTRICIAN COME IN AND EVALUATE WHAT YOU NEED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not expandable","review":"It's an OK product. Easy to wire, but it's not expandable. Which means I'm limited to 6 circuits (or really 5 since I hooked it up to my well pump), so if I decide to upgrade my generator some day, I guess I'll have to install a new transfer switch because this one's maxed out. I wish I had seen the GenTran product before I bought this one. I understand theirs expands with regular breakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dropped to my ankle the second time I wore them","review":"I really wanted to like these socks because of the price. It is about 1/3 of the price of a top brand I had for 4 years. Unfortunately, the second time I wore them, after a full day at the office I got home and found out they had dropped to my ankle. This is totally unacceptable if you have serious circulation problem like I do. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"Bought this one in a hurry and was dissapointed when I got home. The author spends too much ink on staff (i.e web standards)she could have covered in one or two paragraphs. As a matter of fact the entire book could have been written in less than half the number of pages the author consumed with this book. After my dissapointment, I went online and in two hours I knew more on CSS that what the book provided. Online tutorials (which are free by the way)are lightyears better than what you will learn from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for those with a decent background in biology","review":"I purchased this book for the purpose of touching up my biology knowledge for a standarized test. I had already taken an AP Biology class in high school and a physiology course in college. This book was very effective in condensing an entire semester long course into a short 200 or so pages. It truly mentions ONLY the very fundamental concepts of biology. I would recommend this book to those who wish to review a biology course that they have already taken. This book is entirely too brief for those with no previous background information in the area. For certain topics that my high school and college courses failed to cover, I needed to rely on more thorough text books for further detailed explanations. Some aspects of biology are just too in-depth for these short cliff notes to cover. In conclusion, this book is a great resource if you are looking for a quick, to-the-point review!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great review!","review":"This is a quick and easy way to help study for finals and for exit exams. It covers biology as a whole. The questions are professional, yet understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Romance","review":"This book kept me not wanting to stop reading the stories are good so anyone that loves romance get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Air cleaner base","review":"This worked Perfect. When you run an HEI distributor there is not enough room to run a large diameter air cleaner unless you have this base with the offset. Fixed the problem.BW"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neuvaderm is AWESOME...!!!","review":"I must say that I was skeptical about this, but for the low price versus department store cosmetics, figured it was worth a try.Amazingly, it really works quite well.After using this product, people were commenting that I looked less tired, asked if I had lost weight or been exercising. Since it works gradually, you notice a bit of difference yourself, but the people who don't see you that often really notice a dramatic change. Smaller wrinkles are smoothed out and disappear completely, while large ones get smaller.It won't make a 69 year old look 20, but it definitely has taken off a decade of wear and tear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seem to be working","review":"I got this product since the other brand I was using, Kumaara, was discontinued. I have been using this for about a month, and it seems to be working fine. However, I cannot really tell how much this product is contributing to the result because I am combining with other products, DHS eye cream in the morning and DHS olive virgin oil at night. With these, I am definetely getting a good result."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bottle was really annoying. It only pumps a tiny bit of cream each time I tried to use it & I didn't notice a difference","review":"I would not recommend this product for the price and the result. I'm actually tempted to return the lotion and get my money back because the pump was so ineffective at actually getting the cream out of the bottle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Face Cream","review":"I am only 40 but I have tried dozens of face care products in the past. This is definitely the best for me. I notice that my skin do not feel dry as it used to. Few days after I started using Neuvaderm I notice a big difference on my skin. This product keeps my skin moisturized for all day long.In addition, I have also been using the Eye cream by this same company. This is really a great total face care system if you ask me. My face, not only under the eye, has also gotten smoother and softer. This is definitely a product I cannot live without. I have recommended these products to all my friends. The cost on them in very low on Amazon too! How can you go wrong? :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste","review":"It didn't do absolutely anything. Don't waste your money.
