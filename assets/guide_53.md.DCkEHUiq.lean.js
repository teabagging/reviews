Complaint #3: the writing is extremely dry. I'm not quite sure where the previous reviewer found humor in this guide.Bottom line - I will HAVE to purchase another guide.

In fact, it quite uncritically accepts a rather steep picture of human nature from social and cognitive psychology and then goes on to pepper them up with a few bible quotes. Even free will is challenged. Now, that would be legitimate, but interestingly enough, even in mainstream psychology many of the findings Myers offers as the last truth are challenged (e.g. compare David Funder's research and Myer's stand on the bias-and-heuristics-programme).

I have three major complaints:1. We have a long distance plan where we have to dial an 800 number then enter in the phone number we want to dial. The easy way we used to do it on our old phones is dial the 800 number then wait for the prompt, then go back on the caller ID list and hit dial, then it would dial the number for us. But nooo... not on these phones, YOU CAN'T review your caller id while the phone is in the Talk mode. The buttons only alter the volume. LAME.2. Both handsets can't be on at the same time.

However, I am deeply troubled by the massive destructive sound that dominates the whole box set. This is no amusement, only crashing and distorted sound. I do regret that I bought this box set. The regular CDs are much better and listenable than this massive moan. In addition, the French behaviour of doubling the text in the booklet is disturbing. A big miss. The star is for the 3rd and 4th CDs which both have a clearer sound and less distorted uptake.

Nora, comes back to live her 9th life and meets up with her soul mate again. This would be great if said soul mate has not been responsible for killing Nora in all of her other lives. This was a lively and entertaining story. I do feel as if the story could have been a bit more romantic. It seemed as if the H/H just fell in love in the dream segments instead of the time that they were presently experiencing. The originality of the story, and Nora's high spirited personality made up for that slight oversight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the passion","review":"I couldn't finish this book. I tried, I kept picking it back up, but to no avail. The heroine is crude and selfish, and the hero?? is too much like Clint Eastwood for my tastes.

However, it does not know how to get to your destination. I used it side by side with a Garmin 660. The Garmin took me to the address while the Invion tried to direct me to a location down the road half a mile. That happened every time at different locations.In addition, the processor seems underpowered and every operation took forever.

I bought it to help me in writing a history book I am having published (The Super Summary of World History), and it was no help at all. I suggest The Elements of Style as a good alternative. This is printed in the workbook style, which requires one to go from lesson to lesson to achieve the goal of learning the subject. I needed something far different.In my opinion this is a brush up kind of \\"course\\" on English, but not a very good one. The authors think that definitions alone will cause one to understand what the parts of English are, and a few examples suffice to show the reader how to incorporate the idea into writing, speaking or whatever. It doesn't work. Once a concept has been covered the next part of the book assumes the student now has that down pat and the authors do not spend enough time explaining how these parts of speech relate to one another or how they might be critical in good writing.Look elsewhere for an English course."},{"rating":"2","title":"So...many...chorales...","review":"This is a nice edition to have. Playing two Bach chorales every morning is kind of like doing some jumping jacks and eating a spoonful of codliver oil...which is to say, good for you. After playing the first 120 you can expect some chorale fatigue to set in, but all the while you'll be absorbing good voice-leading and voice-doubling technique as though by osmosis. What's more, Bach will still surprise you- there are chords so jarring and dissonant that their sudden, logical resolution is like watching a rabbit being pulled out of a hat.On the downside, the notes are small (this edition really packs 'em in) and it can be easy to get lost on the page. No texts are provided, either, aside from the opening words, so you have to accept on faith that some of the more contorted harmonizations are justified by the text. It's still nice to have, though, and looks nice and musicological sitting on the piano."},{"rating":"2","title":"very happy","review":"This book is a school of music its self.Learning to play, sing, transpose and analyse the Bach chorals can become an everyday practice that helps the improoving of musical skills, creativity, musical imagination and even your composing technic."},{"rating":"2","title":"the one and only - for decades!","review":"For a basic course in music theory, this is the compilation which will teach you everything you need to know about tonality, cadences, voice leading, nonharmonic tones, and harmony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This is one of the most incredible cook books I have ever had!The CD adds a whole dimension to the recipes, showing the country, the food and the preparation.

For the fronts it is necessary to loosen up the side view mirror trim. You must pop off the tweeter trim piece from inside and loosen 2 nuts with a metric socket. Same with the rear windows-you need to loosen up the back of the window trim by accessing from an interior trim piece.Even with that the driver's side front fitment was very tight and the first time the window went up it shattered the bottom edge of the Vent Visor at the window rear. The rear Vent Visors also do not push up far enough into the window moulding so the window scrapes the bottom edge each time it goes down past the VVisor and back up.I can't recommend these to a 2005-2011 Equinox owner. We let them sit for almost 2 full days for the tape to stick well up into the window mouldings, the Equinox is just too tight at the tops for these to fit adequately all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Equinox Ventshade","review":"Product was made to go into channel of window, however, this did not work well with the Chevrolet Equinox.

However, the album is enjoyable, it's just that we were expecting more from a LZ double album and what we got was an album with a lot of outtakes included.Four Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Classic","review":"Another classic album from one of hard rocks finest bands, Led Zeppelin. The Album is very diverse n the tracks, but it shows excellance among themsleves. Robert Plant belts out (as usual) on the opener \\"Custard Pie\\". This has their fair share of their styles like acoustic and melodic songs as well as hard and heavy rock songs, but one track shows that they had to be infatuated with Stevie Wonder or someone like him. The Song is Trampled Underfoot, which is like Led Zeppelin trying to be like Stevie Wonder. John Paul Jones has his usual keybord solos and together with Jimmy Page's electric licks give it a little bit of a funk mixed with hard rock. Very tasty indeed. All in all an excellant album, which gets my vote to being one of the best albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Led Zeppelin's Best Album","review":"This is Led Zeppelin at their best!! Zeppelin at their peak! Creativity off the chart. Not one bad song on this album. There is straight up hard rock (Custard Pie, Wanton Song, Sick Again). Blues (In My Time of Dying). Folk and Acoustic (Bron-Yr-Aur and Black Country Woman). Psychedelic (In the Light). Pop (The Rover, Houses of the Holy, Night Flight). Funk (Trampled Under Foot). Just plain old fun (Down By the Seaside, Boogie with Stu). Ballad (Ten Years Gone). And KASHMIR!!!!! The epitome of Led Zeppelin. If I was going to take one album to a desert island it would be Physical Graffiti. Cannot say enough about it!! One of the best albums of all time, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overindulgent dose of Zeppelin","review":"\\"Physical Graffiti,\\" is a two album set that would have benefitted being pared down into one. The best songs on the record, such as \\"Kashmir,\\" \\"Ten Years Gone,\\" \\"In the Light\\" and \\"Sick Again\\" would have combined to make an album worthy of standing next to their best. As it is they are the wheat surrounded by the chaff of the weaker cuts that surround them. In retrospect, \\"Physical Graffiti\\" marks the beginning of the decline of Led Zeppelin as a great band. Still, there are enough great songs to make it worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than five stars!!","review":"Every Led Zeppelin album is amazing, but this is probably the greatest one of them all.

The main frustration is the frankly balmy order of the tracks and the addition of below par material. Bearing in mind that you could only have a max of 25 minutes per side on an LP in those days, here is what i think Physical Graffiti should have looked like (in Order):Side 1: In The Light, Houses Of The Holy, Trampled Underfoot,, Ten Years Gone.Side 2: Custard Pie, Bron-yr-aur, Down By The Seaside, The Wanton Song, Kashmir.That's my opinion of what could of been regarded as the greatest Led Zep albums ever and I would give it 5 stars instead of 4. It still would have been an epic album at 49 minutes but a much more elegent and refined one. I like 'In My Time of Dying' but it really drags; and I generally like long songs! Tea For One and Achilles Last Stand from 'Presence' are awesome. Sick Again is another good song but could have been saved for later. the rest are not that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 = very good","review":"The first disc would be a great 5-star single album. \\"In My Time of Dying\\" is long (11 min), but worth it. \\"Kashmir\\" is not overrated. It's really that good (IMO).Disc#2 contains relative 2nd rate material. My favorites: Boogie With Stu, Black Country Woman, Down By the Seaside. I'd rate disc#2 as 3=good. I am more likely to listen to Presence and In Thru the Out Door than this disc#2."},{"rating":"2","title":"This record ROCKS!!","review":"Hey man, if you ever feel like really chillin' out, put on the headphones, put on Physical Graffiti and sit back and enjoy the ride!Classic rock at it's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy remaster","review":"Along with other Led Zeppelin CD's I've purchased from Amazon this sounds muddy and flat. An absolutely horrible remaster apparently from Argentina. I guess Warner has no interest in investing money in producing a quality sounding product for one of the very best rock/blues bands that ever existed. I've listened to it on my car Bose system and my Onkyo component home stereo. The track previews on the page sounded better than the CD itself. A total waste and a darn shame. At least I've still got my vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"five stars, until you get to know it better","review":"When I first bought this album I loved all 15 songs, but time has tempered that a little.

No, none are nearly as bad as \\"The Crunge\\", but that's not saying much. Not to say this is a _bad_ album at all, just the opposite, but I disagree with the people who say this is their _best_.The first CD is all good stuff, but while the second lags behind, especially in the second half, there are still enough good songs here to make it worth the price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Physical Graffiti' review","review":"Just the songs \\"Trampled under foot\\", \\"Kashmir\\" and \\"Ten years gone\\" alone make this album worth purchasing.The first Zeppelin album to be released under their own Swan Song label is generally a composite album, adding new material to already existing songs. The instrumental \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\" for example was recorded in 1970, but didn't see the light of day until 'Physical Graffiti' in 1975.Other stand outs include \\"Houses of the holy\\", \\"The Wanton song\\", \\"The rover\\" and \\"Boogie with Stu\\".One thing in paticular that I like about this album is, even though it's a double album, it isn't very long, (clocking in just over 80 minutes), and that there isn't any filler material, just more or less good songs that the band wanted to put out at the time.Personally the only songs I don't like are \\"In my time of dying\\" and \\"In the light\\", they arn't really that bad, it's just that they tend to drag on. I find myself skipping over these two songs when I listen to the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best Zeppelin album","review":"Led Zeppelin is the best rock and roll band ever, and this may just be their best album. I own several (but not all) of their CD's and I think this one takes the cake because of the first disc. It includes some of the best Zeppelin songs, and also some that aren't particularly famous but are very good, like \\"The Rover\\" and \\"In My Time of Dying,\\" which features some incredible guitar playing by Jimmy Page.

There's an organ in one song, a hip-hop loop in another (this is from 1975, people!), a western saloon piano in a third ... this album was a revolution.A must for everyone who believes that the blues had a baby and they named it rock n' roll.ps: Now you'll also know where Slash copped that gorgeous intro for his \\"Beggars & Hangers-On\\" song from his first solo album; straight from Zeppelin's \\"In My Time Of Dying\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I selected this album by mistake.

You might be better getting the Howlin' Wolf, Elmore James and Stevie Wonder albums that Zep were obviously listening to at the time they made these albums. But that leaves one of the few Zeppelin originals here, Kashmir, to marvel at. The greatest song, by Page and Plant's always modest admission, by quite possibly the greatest band the world has ever known, or ever will see.

Led was at the top of their form on this one. It was flawless. The drums are awesome, Jimmy Page's guitar combined with Robert Plant's voice really carry it. These songs are moving and they hit hard.

The first album is bluesier, III is more expressive, and ZOSO might win in a decision, but they were never better than they were here. It's not an overstatement to say that the slide guitar on \\"In My Time Of Dying\\" is worth the price of the two-CD set. the experimental \\"In The Light\\" remains a testament to the band's willingness to try almost anything and then doing it better than anyone before or since. \\"The Rover,\\" \\"Sick Again,\\" and \\"Custard Pie\\" prove that they could rock out harder than anyone, while \\"Black Country Woman\\" and \\"Ten Years Gone\\" showed their gentle side as well as anyone else could have.

Desi vibes is a little more stripped down, and a little more raw than export quality. Export quality shows a direct evolution in the production of their music, but desi vibes just has that rhythmic looped grit that Export quality JUST evades.

Well, there was Tolkien of course..., but as I like to say: The Lord of the Rings is the best, but The Winter of the World is my favorite. While it is true that the story starts out in a North American-like continent, it is not obvious until viewing the second and third novel's maps. The Anvil of Ice deals with a man who starts as a cattleherder and develops into a powerful smith. He has to deal with many inner conflicts; these continue on throughout the trilogy. Outer conflict comes from the servants of the evil that is the Ice. Definitely a book that all fantasy lovers should read (too bad it is so difficult to find a copy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The essence of dreams??","review":"I found this book to be disappointing.. hardly any Edgar Cayce's readings in it.In addition, the book doesn't explain how dreams can be analyzed, what kind of dreams exist (1, 2, 3, of 4 dimensional (related to future, present, past?)).Recommendation:Dromen Paragnostisch verklaard (1984)By G. van der ZeeuwISBN 9020205668Publisher: Ankh-Hermes bvLanguage: Dutch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous!!","review":"I gave this a five because it is absolutely beautiful and for me it does double duty as a bracelet!!

I also was replacing my old rusty Foley foodmill that I use for applesauce and tomato sauce. The problem with this product is that the blade does not touch the bottom of the container and so much of the food remains behind.

You see the cooks on the Food Network using food mills all the time making mashed potatoes, milling tomatoes or making soups. We used it yesterday to make mashed potatoes and by the time we finished running 3lbs through the mill (30 minutes) they were stone cold and resembled something closer to pureed potatoes rather than mashed. The issue was not the blade we chose but the distance between the paddle and the blade. There was no room for more than a 1/2 cup of potatoes. Otherwise they sat on the top of the blade and you had to scrap the potatoes down between the paddle and blade. It was a complete mess.

The handles are comfortable to hold, and the body looks great and feels sturdy. I like the interchangeable disks with different hole size and the collapsible legs for storage.

Also, the handle goes crooked with every turn and has to be straightened out (going in reverse a quarter turn works) on every turn. It also does not separate seeds (e.g. watermelon) -- it grinds them up and they pass through the blade. I will never use it again so I should just throw it out, although it is difficult to throw away something brand new. I checked the instructions several times -- they are so simple that I can't see how I am doing anything wrong. I recommend you buy a more standard model. This one is worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic kitchen gadget!","review":"With years of peeling and seeding apples, tomatoes, pears, etc. and being too cheap to by a food mill, I finally broke down this year and bought the OXO.

I don't peel and seed anything any longer (yippee!), & the OXO produces a finished product with very little waste.

Living in the Bible Belt as I currently do, it is amazing to see the closed-mindedness of the local Bible-thumpers. Every other day the letters to the editor have some religious overtones to them. A profile of a prominent local atheist brought the same kind of ignorance and fear that Russell himself was forced to deal with. If anything else in the book doesn't make you question organized religion and its bid for world-dominance, the tragic story of Russell's failed bid to teach at the City College of NY will show you how afraid religion (specifically Christians) do not want anyone bucking the system and thinking for themselves.

I then read Mere Christianity, and after that, re-read \\"Why I am Not a Christian\\". It became clear to me that the things Lewis says emphasizes a much different point than most of Russell's book. Lewis's book delves deeply into why being Christian makes sense; Russell's book is relatively miniscule in discussing truly deep reasons why NOT being a Christian makes sense. My suggestion?

After reading Hotel, Garp, Bears, and Meany; I have noticed they all tread similar ground. There is the mostly ineffectual narrator, there are the characters who thrive because of the quirks & fallacies not in spite of them, there are the same catchphrases repeated over and over, there is the continued fascination and reliance on Vienna as a plot device. Don't get me wrong, Hotel is an OK book. Some good observations are made like \\"we pick up our Chipper Dove's only to put them back down again\\" or Lilly's euphimism for writing. Irving also probably uses foreshadowing better than any other writer. But I felt after Garp & Bears, this is the 3rd time I have basically read the same story.

It chronicles the life of a man, his wife and their subsequent family over the course of approximately 30-years. They opne a hotel in New Hampshire and another in Vienna. The characters are poorly developed and lack substance. The plot is not compelling and lacks any suspense. Irving is normally a master at creating characters, but the individuals that he portrays in the novel are entirely unbelievable. My most damning assessment is that I fell asleep 11-pages from the end, and it took me 2-weeks to be able to complete the final passages of the novel. Avoid this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A rare disappointment","review":"Having read and loved \\"Omen Meany,\\" \\"Garp,\\" \\"Son of the Circus,\\" and \\"Cider House Rules,\\" I was shocked and disappointed by this, John Irnving's most lurid, contrived, and depressing novel. The plots were implausible, the characters thinly realized, the themes repulsive and uncomfortable, and the point of the book entirely elusive.

Granted there is a relationship between the Berry's and their sexual (and incestuous) miscapades. I enjoyed the wonderful manifestations of Sorrow and the ridiculousness of Suzie the Bear.

For anyone who has ever contemplated suicide, the fact that Lilly was somehow destined to die is a disturbing thought. I don't think that people should blame themselves when family members commit suicide, but they don't have to accept it with such equanimity either. Perhaps if Lilly had had counselling (or some other kind of therapy), she could have learned to accept her cirumstances and gone on to lead a fulfilling life, even if that didn't include a successful writing career. I think it's worrisome that none of the other characters even contemplated this. My main gripe about this book is the characters' failure, in general, to appreciate and to truly mourn death; the death of not only Lilly, but also Egg, Mother and Freud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Substandard Irving","review":"I totally agree with Melanie D. about this book, but disagree about OWEN MEANY --- really, really dull.

As they grow, or in one case don't, they run across performing bears, football stars, blind Jewish hoteliers, marxist terrorists, prostitutes galore and enough personal tragedy to last any family a lifetime. Throughout they laugh, they love and they experience profound sorrow. You'll finish this book ready to read it again and again for it is never the same twice. Does Sorrow float?

I mean Mom and Egg die in a plane accident never to be heard from again in life or in the book. I am not suggesting Irving should have plunged into melodrama, there would be nothing worse than that,but the extreme aloofness of these characters made them at first unreal and then finally pathetic.For a more emotional and rewarding but less funny (yes this book is funny at the expense of its characters) read The Cider House Rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotel New Hampshire","review":"I enjoy the way John Irving writes.

Worthless but makes nice beeping sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but be careful","review":"If you are looking for the actual \\"12 mile\\" radius that these radios are advertised as, you will be disappointed. In a large metropolitan, suburban setting, my actual range was about 1 mile.We purchased these thinking if we only got half of the 12-mile range, that would be fine. But a one-mile radius is unacceptable.Having said that, they do work in a range of one mile or less without any problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorola SX700R Talkabout GMRS/FRS 2-Way Radios","review":"I am an Acreage Surveyor and distance between instrument and prism often require the use of radios for communication between engineers.

My work environment is often extremely harsh, woods,mountains,etc. and the durability and dependability of these handhelds is second to none. Excellent product and a very wise purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality, decent range.","review":"These radios sound great. The range is ok. I have another radio that claims to have 14 mile range and these will broadcast farther than the 14 mile radio. However the range is no where near the 12 miles they advertise. They are a little big but I think they might be less likely to be lost because of their size. Belt clip is good. There have plenty of features and options. I kind of wish they had the digital compass though. These are the best 2 way radios I've owner so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go the distance","review":"I bought these for work for comunication between myself and the customer or myself and my apprentice. They seem to work really well. I am a plumber so I would typically be in a crawlspace and the other person would be somewhere else inside or outside of the house or building. They worked great from one end of a three acre factory to the other with all kinds of machinery running, when my nextel couldn't make it outside the building. They really do work 12 miles apart - we tested that, sound still crystal clear. And the batteries last just about forever. The really ingenious part about the batteries is that they come with rechargeable which can be charged on the included base station. But if those were to die and you weren't near a charger, or in five years or so when they just don't last as long, you can simply use AAA standard batteries. A product that is useful for as long as you own it and keep it in good shape! Thanks Motorola."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it","review":"I am a traditional rock climber and a backcountry snowboarder/mountaineer. These radios were a good choice at their $45 price. Between belays, reception is clear enough and ample. Above tree line, communication is expectedly easy, as well. Conversely, in the trees of the backcounty performance is notably lessened, yet still practical.Why Motorola doesn't add a lanyard, or at the very least, an attachment point for a carabiner or cord or whatever, so I can dangle the radio from my harness is waaaay beyond me. It was frustrating to realize the omission as I opened package. I solved this easily enough with (duh!) some duct-tape, but still...how hard could it be? The units are a lil' on the heavy side, but not so much as to warrant the super-cost of a super-light version.Overall, I am satisfied ... for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Useful","review":"These are nice two-ways, they offer ease of use but with lots of advanced features as well. Keep in mind that an FCC permit is required and will cost a one time fee of about $80.00. Clarity and range is good, I have not yet tried the hands free feature so cannot say about that. I would suggest a car charger if you travel with it a lot. The one complaint I have is the belt clip takes two hands to operate."},{"rating":"1","title":".6 not 12","review":"I was quite displeased with these radios. It says that they work up to 12-mile range. I understand that that is in optimal conditions. I bought them hopping that I could use them at school, but on campus they barely reached 400 yards. And while a friend stood on a street corner (off campus) I was on the same street but only .6 miles away when I finally could hear him. I researched 2-way radios for a bit and these got good reviews, but just weren't up to par, I think I'll buy some $20 ones if I want to talk within a building...Motorola Talkabout FV200AA GMRS / FRS Two-way Radio (Pair)I assume I am going to have to go with something a bit heftier...I thought the weather radio was a nice add-on and it seems like there are plenty of combinations to keep out heavy traffic.

No passing? Can't go backward?? What is going on? Yeah, the spirit of the game is there, but it just isn't as good as the original.

If anybody remembers these, they probally remember they weren't the most reliable things. Hopefully, the modern day electronics are better. As a kid it was one of the first (and a best seller) handheld games, but as a toy for the modern age kids, I think they will get bored with it fast. For (the money), I'm thinking of buying one just for the memories. If you have children, it would also be neat to show them \\"In my day, this was THE GameBoy\\".

As a huge fan of Halloween by J Del Pozo I was reading good reviews on In Black and In White. In Black is supposed to be more winter appropriate than In White so I decided to take a risk. I have to be honest, I was a little disappointed by this fragrance. It's probably wonderful for someone else, but I just did not care for the scent. I know the price is on the lower end, but Halloween isn't exactly pricey and it smells amazing, so I figured this wouldn't be a let down. However, the perfume does smell cheap...and maybe a little too musky for me. Also, the nozzle under the cap breaks off easily, but the bottle itself is somewhat attractive. But I guess that's what I get for blind-purchasing a perfume."},{"rating":"1","title":"downgraded for poor longevity/ zero projection","review":"While this scent is fairly nice for the winter, alas 4 sprays are barely discernible some 1 or 2 hours later, thus I am downgrading a fragrance I like but would not purchase again.

Yes. But, also humorous undertones. There are times where you can't help but laugh and then the next page you're sweating from suspense. Koontz mixes in a good amount of humor; however, at the end of the day, it is a standard Dean Koontz horror novel. The characters are people you seem like you know. Not too eccentric or anything, just people that you could live next to. The dog really adds another layer to the experience. All in all, a very good read. At times, it does lack substance. After all, it is relatively short. The pace is pretty quick and before you know it, you'll have knocked out 50 pages on your lunch!

His name is Dean Koontz, and with \\"Ticktock\\", these feelings are quite real. I first read this book when I was about 14. At that age I was obsessed with ordering books from Double Day, and as I penned in the number for Dean Koontz's \\"Ticktock\\", I never knew I would be taken on a ride on a rain-heavy, lightning-sticken night. This is THE best Dean Koontz. If you want to know the two best Dean Koontz books...They are \\"Ticktock\\" and \\"The Door to December\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great audio book","review":"I've never read a Dean Koontz book, so I didn't have any particular expectations for this story. It was a wonderful surprise. B. D. Wong does a terrific job of bringing all the eccentric characters to life. The story reminded me of another favorite book of mine, \\"Cold Dog Soup.\\" I had to keep reminding myself that one person was reading all the dialog, the characterizations were so vivid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dean Koontz...where are you??","review":"After reading Intensity and looking forward to Tick Tock, I don't know what went wrong. This book was not horror it was horrible. I was actually anxious to finish it (actually amazed that I bothered to) to find out what the rating was from Amazon readers. I am astounded that the average review for this awful book was 4 stars. It's nice that one reader allowed her 10 year old to read it, but that is not what adult readers expect from Koontz. The characters in this book - being chased by a cursed doll - wise-cracking and cutting up all the way thru car and boat wrecks and murders. Tommy Phan's mother was the most frightening thing about this book. If this had been the first book I read penned by Mr Koontz, I would not bother reading another by him. It was silly and juvenile and, as if that wasn't enough, had no point, no plot and no purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a Listen? - Nope","review":"Some Koontz novels are entertaining thrill rides but others are no better than lame pitches for silly horror films that should never be produced. Ticktock is one of the later. I listened to the BD Wong audio tape version which creates some interest from vocalizations of the Vietnamese-American characters but his portrayal of the ditzy/deep blond heroine Del Payne was just plain irritating. A skilled actress for that voice might have made this tape (but not the novel) a marginally acceptable diversion. Cannot recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply silly","review":"I have read many by Koontz and I definetely say this is the worst! I really liked Watchers and Twilight Eyes, but there is something about Koontz that disturbes me. He doesn't seem to have any imagination. In three of his books I have read, the mystery of the story was related to some genetic work that has gone out of control, I don't know if there are any others. He tried to plot something different in this one but unfortunately it turns out to be something rather childish, or , to be honest, silly. I say, do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I kept flying over extraneous tangential paragraphs of text to try to follow some semblance of action. It certainly is a comedy - a comedy of errors. Basically a rule book of what not to do - such as don't sit around wasting minutes thinking of the color of the curtains while you're being attacked by some hellish demon."},{"rating":"1","title":"every kind of bad","review":"The characters in this book were just terrible. The protagonist is neurotic, uptight, and way too slow on the uptake. His love interest is a self-satisfied new age hippie chick whom we're supposed to admire but who is just irritating as all get-out. Their dialogue is ineptly smartassed the whole way through.Don't look for the plot to save the day. While it admittedly made me want at times to know what would happen next (which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1), it was very disappointing in its resolution.I listened to the audiobook, so I will give Mr. Koontz the benefit of the doubt that maybe something was lost in the abridgement. But I doubt it, as the pace was fairly slow. This was my first and last Koontz experience.The narrator was good but that's cold comfort all things considered."},{"rating":"1","title":"A most annoying little book","review":"I am a fan of Dean Koontz, and have been forgiving of his work when it didn't live up to Watchers. But in the case of Ticktock, there is just no excuse. Now I should be positive, but what positive things can I say about a book whose only likable character is a dog? Or that the best thing about the ending is that it is finally over? Now that said, Koontz has said this was his first and only attempt at a screwball comedy. Problem 1: it's not funny. Problem 2: it's two serious to not be taken seriously (unless you count the ending, in which credability, sense and style jump in front of a speeding truck in a desperate attempt to outrun the author.) The hero is a idiotic jerk, his love interest is suppose to be kooky, but is just stupid and annoying (not to mention trigger happy,) and the unstoppable monster is pathetic, as is the resolvement of the piece. Koontz should have known better, and should give up any asperations of becoming a comedian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The first book of Koontz' I ever read was Lightning, and I loved it. It is my favourite book, but then I was terribly disappointed when the second book of his I picl up is nothing more than a whimsical fantasy. There were parts where I thought I was going to get scared, but then, nothing. A rag doll that comes to life? Come on, I could have thought of that and been more imaginative with it. At least Lightning had interesting plot turns, and identifiable characters. The woman was the product of alien testing? Ooooh that is just PAINFUL. I would actually have given it 0 stars out of five because I cannot recall one single thing I liked about the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad.","review":"I am a big fan of Dean Koontz, but this one just didn't seem as good as some of his past others.

I bought it because I thought the storyline sounded very interesting. The start of the book was very enjoyable and suspenseful. As the book progressed I was getting tired with the way Koontz portrayed Del's mysteriousness and the way Del talked to Tommy. I found some of that unrealistic. And then at the end of the book I was disappointed. The way Koontz decided to explain the origin of the doll was a pitiful one, simply seeing as there was potential for a much greater ending. And the origin of the doll just wouldn't happen in my mind from a nice person whose intents were innocent. And my final criticism is the origin of Del and her dog. If this was meant to be a horror book, leave it at that. Don't attempt to mash in fantasy and science fiction at the very end to tie off loose ends. But otherwise the book was somewhat fun and some parts were suspenseful--though only two by my count."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and Childish. Should be a Teenager book","review":"Dean R. Koontz likes to mix horror with sitcom style characters. He has written so many books in this category that I think he is running out of ideas. He also has a formula, which although he has been trying to change in the last 6 or 7 years, is still basically the same in each book. For example you know that the main characters will discover each to be the soulmate of the other.In this book his style is wearing thin and reads more like a R. L. Stine book for teenagers. His characters are also to cutesy, their lines are from a 60's sitcom, and I am tired of his using his super smart dog (usually a labrador) character which he feels he needs to put in more and more of his books. I try to keep myself from buying any more of his work yet, because I used to be a big fan, sometimes I am desperate for quick read and he is the only thing I can find at the airport."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just silly","review":"This is not a typical Dean Koontz, as he himself explains at the end of the book. He says he wanted to write a \\"screwball comedy.\\" Well, this ain't Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. I felt cheated. I spent the time reading the book trying to logically figure out the mystery, only to find there was no logic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demon Terror, Koontz Humor, Super Story","review":"Mystery writer Tommy Phan is having a bad night. It's raining, but he can't really enjoy the ride he's having in his new Corvette, even though he did seem to enjoy flirting with a waitress earlier. His mother just seems to have a way of making him feel guilty. How come he hasn't married a nice Vietnamese girl? Can he help it if he prefers blondes? How come he isn't a doctor? Can he help it if he'd rather write?When he gets home he finds a rag doll on his doorstep. He takes it inside, uh oh, bad move, doesn't he know he's in a Dean Koontz novel. There's a demon in the doll that seems to delight in terrorizing Tommy. Not wanting to become demon dinner, he gets on out of there, races through town, wrecks the new \`Vette, but he can't seem to shake the demon and you won't be able to shake this book. Super characters, though unlike other Dean Koontz books, this one almost has a sense of the comical and that just seems to make it all the more delectable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Dean Koontz book ever!","review":"I've tried to read other books like Whispers, but they didn't hold my interest. This book made me a fan of Kooonzt for it was a fast fun read, a real pageturner full of creative writing and it makes you use your imagination, it's got a great and romantic, and funny plot. If it weren't for thsi ver accessible book, I wouldn;t have gone back and read Whispers, and all the other Koonzt books, though none are a sgreat as this, all of Koontz' books are worth a read, this one deserves multiple reading, I'm on my 3rd copy now, I keep waerin' Tick Tock out. a great comprehensive read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Comedic","review":"Being an avid Koontz fan, and one who commutes about one hour each way for work, I found listening to this that I often found myself laughing and the story very predictable.

But in general, I think Koontz succeeded admirably in what he set out to do--writing a novel that's genuinely scary in places while never losing sight of the \\"screwball comedy\\" genre, all at a nice, fast pace. He even was mostly accurate in characterizing the immigrant Asian culture. This shouldn't be your first choice if you like your horror to be unrelentingly terrifying and pessimistic, unleavened by even a dash of humor; I think this novel is more for tried-and-true Koontz fans who, by now, are trusting enough to give a try to whatever new tack he wishes to take. Count me in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror and comedy lite","review":"The more I read this story, the more I realized the author didn't take this very seriously. That's fine as it's supposed to be a light read. Good action scenes early on but the comedy was lame and the characters were one dimensional. Can't this author write about someone beyond wealthy Californians (who never seem to have jobs) and their 100 IQ dogs?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain Koontz's Big Bag 'o Trite 'n Cheese","review":"The characters are one-dimentional and the writing very childish (\\"First he did this.. then the monster chased him.. then he did this.. then the monster chased him..\\" etc.).

Different strokes, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Best Koontz, but not the worst.","review":"This book was a quick read that kept me interested.

In the beginning it seemed as though it had potential. However it kept going no where and the ending was the worst of all. His adding the supernatural and ufo abuctions came out of no where and made absoutely no sense at all. I had just finished reading Intensity which was absoutely great and then I read Tick Tock which was terrible. I really don't know what he was thinking.

Thewriter (which I usually respect and like) is going fora lighter approach which he can't handle. He tries todo comedy bu can't do it because of his own self-centeredperson. The past has made us learn not to mix horrorand comedy in one novel, and this theory has provento be right, again.

This book was absolutely ridiculous, it included everything from (what the book referred to as) a \\"snake rat-quick little monster thing,\\" magic, alien abductions, etc. I finished the book but only in the hopes for better explanations but found myself to be completely disapointed. There's no way to even guess the ending because the introduce a character at the very end. It didn't help that the book was obviously meant for the more testerone-filled gender as the first few pages were dedicated to the specifics of a corvette (head room, leg room, overall length, incorrect horsepower, etc.), then later specifics on guns, mention on war, pirates, and a chuck norris type detective.Overall, this book sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Oh So Boring","review":"Well this is just flat out a boring book.It starts out competently (note: not great but not bad) but quickly turns into a pitch for a rather bad action movie, a boring predictable chase followed by some bad dialogue followed by another boring chase and repeat. Pluck a few of the usual suspects out of the sterotypes bin for characters and you've got yourself an awful literary work.The best bit, and only funny part, is the authors afterword at the end; he claims its a 'screwball comedy' ie its deliberately crappily written. Like Kevin Cosnter telling us Waterworld was supposed to be a horrnedus flop - it was his post-postmodern commendary on the world or some such rubbish.Obviously upon reading the draft he realised how bad it was and tried to passs it off as being deliberately bad cos it a 'comedy'.

From my first read, Darkfall, all the way to a recent read Sole Survivor, I was hooked. Dean Koontz is usually able to keep me captivated from the start. However, Tick Tock was very disappointing. I find it strange that so many other Amazon readers loved it. The story started out frightening, but then became entirely too silly for me. When I sit down to read a Koontz, I want to be so scared I'm afraid to turn out the light. But instead, I almost closed the book for good. I just kept waiting for it to get better; but it didn't. Botttom line: I found the idea of a cursed doll (cursed by a friend of Tommy Phan's mother, no less) had great potential, but the underlying plot elements were too far-fetched and somewhat ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you'd expect","review":"This is the only Koontz book I've found where the baddie is stupid and the goodies are great. When I started reading this book I found it rather boring and tedious, then I met Del Payne.

As always, his writing is great and his characters are a lot of fun. But the story in this was a bit weak to me. It's basically a horror/sci-fi comedy, and Koontz is almost as good at comedy as he is with thrillers, but something about this story fell flat.

With a life ending deadline of dawn, Tommy does everything he can to stay alive.Koontz really delivers with Tick Tock. I enjoyed the pace of the book, something I appreciate very much. Nothing is more boring than a book that drags on with page after page of useless information. Tick Tock does just the opposite. The reader will be sucked into Tommy's plight, though they may not like him very much in the beginning, you will be cheering for him by the end.Good Luck Tommy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This book is totally different from many of his other novels. Quite odd because this was more on the lighter side of reading, yet I was expecting something intense like In the Face of Fear. I gave it a seven mainly becuase of the totally unexpected events told in the story (UFO abductions, a multi-millionare working in a diner as a waitress with a dog who also has psychic powers??!!) But then again, it was better than some of his other books, such as Cold Fire and Demon Seed. He incorporated something not used in many of his earlier novels, lots of witty humor.

Fortunately, the book is a blessedly quick read. The plot was weak, the characters and situations were never believable, and the entire premise of the book was nothing but a rehash of a tired theme (inanimate object becomes imbued with evil spirit).

I have read many other really good, suspensful books (Watchers, The Door to December) that by far surpass this book. I barely even finished it (took me 3 months). I would much rather read a book about some crazed psycopath on the loose (God help me!) than to read about some alien thing hidden inside a doll. I was very disappointed. It just slowly dragged on and on, until I figured I might as well put the book down before I fall asleep with the it in my hands and loose the page I'm on.

Perhaps if I was 13 I would have liked the book, with all it's childishness.So that is why I gave it two stars instead of one - it was amusing in some parts, and the characters were very colorful.

That being said, it's a terrific album and one of my top-five favorites. From the firey, fuzzy cover art to the long-distance reverb guitar, this album really puts me in the mood of days gone by. It has special meaning for me because it was originally given to me by an old girlfriend who snatched it from her brother's record collection back in the seventies because at that time it was out of print!

Otto Skorzeny is practically unknown outside the realm of Military History, and has never really been bought to the public eye. Though this book was written in the 1950's, before some of Skorzeny's prolific post-war activities, Foley manages to conduct one of the most thorough and justified examinations to date of Skorzeny. he gets inside the subject's head, consulting him, his colleagues and his enemies, giving a well researched and detailed account of Skorzeny's early career and famous exploits. A certain degree of bias must be accepted, due to Skorzeny's influence in writing the book, but it is still a classic. A must for anyone interested in the subject of WWII commando operations, and the one which all other authors on Skorzeny quote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...but a little one-sided","review":"This is an excellent read for WWII enthusiasts.

Norton's stupid face receives very little screen time, and he's given even less time to unleash the crude jokes on which he's built a modest career and a rabid following.Putting Norton on the cover is disingenuous at best, since his performance is so understated and far from a comedy routine that includes disturbed quips about Dakota Fanning. Very disappointed. This is obviously low budget and the actors are below average. The reason to watch it is Norton, and he's restrained to the point of boredom.

Yes, it does get the idea of \\"Darsan - seeing the divine\\" down well, and debunks the Western criticisms and shallow reactions to Hinduism. I cannot see, however, how this would be useful to an introductory student of Hinduism, because it is far too brief and the manuscript wanders freely from topic to topic, asking far too many questions, giving too little context and in-depth answers.

Fly-Man, The Comet, The Shield, The Web, and others are written in high, dumbed down, camp. If you thought the 1960's Batman television series was campy, it has nothing on the Red Circle era heroes.

Drinking, smoking, sex, adventure... this is a testosterone flooded over-the-top extravaganza that somewhat to our surprise both my wife and I are really enjoying. For those of us that grew up living & breathing the space race in the '60s, a show that says you can get up there with enough guts and will really warms our hearts.It's X-file conspiracies, Kimball Kinnison space opera, Tom Swift genius engineer... all in one.

It omits \\"Don't Give In To Him\\" but includes \\"Daylight Stranger\\" and \\"Could I\\" -- both co-written by Gary Puckett and the band's longtime mentor, Jerry Fuller, and both released on 45 rpm singles (perhaps flip sides of the same single). \\"Could I,\\" especially, is a fine, fine song that should have been a Top 10 hit.

Then, I started edging and I found that the Ryobi engine was bogged down by the work of the edger. I kept the throttle wide open as I edged but the edger could not cut very well. I actually twisted off the upper shaft in less than 10 minutes of edging. (The edger slowed down the driven rpm's, but the engine speed was up.) So, the Ryobi is great for a string trimmer or a blower, but NOT for use with the edger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Investment","review":"The TrimmerPlus concept has been a tremendous asset for me. I have the trimmer, the blower/vac/mulcher, and the edger. I agree with several of the reviewers that the first usage is a bit awkward, but once you get the hang of the machine, it works very well. I do agree that it tends to work better (edges easier & quicker with deeper cut) walking backwards, but forward works fine. I also have found it to be versatile in that I use it to provide a natural edge around my flower beds in addition to edging around curbs and sidewalks. I know someone with a bigger, single purpose edger, but I feel that this one is just as effective, less expensive, has plenty of power, and is more versatile than the other machine. Plus, I can pop it off, attach my trimmer or blower, and get to the next phase of my yard work in a matter of seconds. Overall, a pretty good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ryobi Lawn Edger TrimmerPlus","review":"I bought a straight shaft Ryobi grass trimmer and wanted to have an Add-On Lawn Edger; however, the shaft on the Edger is NOT straight; it is curved.

And, we need easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Something Else!","review":"I am disappointed in the performance of this edger. It simply is just not very good. Conceptually, it is nice, but in reality it has quite a few problems. For starters, it has what can best be described as a \\"rudder\\" that is supposed to travel between the pavement and the grass. Unfortunately this extends way past the wheel and it just basically digs itself in, unless you set the blade depth as deep as it can go (which is difficult for such a small engine). I removed the original small wheel and installed a larger wheel just to get this \\"rudder\\" thing up a little. The second problem is that it has a \\"fender\\" to prevent stuff from being thrown around. Unfortunately, on thick St. Augustine grass, it hangs up and makes it impossible to advance smoothly and in a straight line.All in all, this was a huge disappointment. I really like the Ryobi string trimmer. I've been very impressed with it and its design, but don't waste your money on this edger attachment. BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to the job","review":"I am on my third Powerhead for this attachment. I just dont think it has enough power for the job.

Edging got easier each time. My only complaints are that the wheel seems a little small and cannot be adjusted enough to allow for shallow trenching. I have gotten past this by installing a larger wheel. The other minor complaint is that mud sometimes gets packed behind the blade, but I overcome this by carrying a screwdriver with me and scraping it from time to time. Still a great product and time (and string) saver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice add-on for 725r","review":"The edger does a nice, easy job except for the first edge of the season, which takes a little extra time.

It makes crisp, clean, deep cuts that are uniform and actually help to prevent the grass re-growth in the areas you use it. Our neighbor owns a lawncare company and has commented on great results we get from using it. My husband has cared for lawns since he was very young, and he knows what works well and what doesn't. Both he and his dad use the edger attachment and love it. The price is just right for what you get in return. The only downfall is that it is very powerful - so if you get careless, it will chip at your driveway because it spins really fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power? Control? This little edger has none","review":"This edger might be useful for a tiny townhouse patio, but if you have more than 10 feet of edging to do, look to a dedicated edging unit and not this substandard add-on. The trimmer itself is a great unit and I have no complaints--but the edger add-on only has one guide wheel which makes it difficult to cut a straight line. The power is also insufficient to chew through grass and dirt if you've waited more than a week from your last edging.

If you have an older model with a solid blade rectangular, go buy a new replacement with the scalloped edges - it spins better and cutters faster! I kept the wheel on, and replaced the plastic head screw that sets the wheel height with something more solid and a better lock washer - the vibrations would loosen the screw often otherwise.I'll try the 'backwards' suggestion from another poster this weekend - there is definately an art to this item, but it works GREAT when you master it.

All numbers are visable when you aren't wearing reading glasses. After nearly a month of trying to figure out how to work with it, I am giving up and returning it. First problem is that you often have to dial the number several times before it makes the call. Worst problem,I could not get the answering machine message to kick in - ever. All calls went to my phone company voice mail which is more inconvenient than just pushing a message button the way I did on my last 3 answering machines.

If the caller is on a headset or cell phone, forget it. Might as well use two tin cans on a string. I had to go back to my good ole corded phone which works just fine except I can't walk around with it unless I drag the 25 ft cord around. The \\"audio boost\\" button only boosts it a tiny bit - not enough, plus the ear piece/speaker is tiny too.

This was our first expandable handset and it will be our last. We don't know if it's our phone that was built with a \\"bug\\" in it but the conversation is always full of static (and we have taken the proper precautions to house them away from other electronic devises). 8 out of 10 times if you pick up the phone to dial out you won't have a dial tone and you will receive a message that says \\"unavailable\\"-you then have to wait 30-60 seconds to try again. This will also happen when you go to answer an incoming call. Since I operate a home-based business this is not an option for me so we are replacing these phones.

Also, a note on switching from speaker to normal... you have to press talk again during the conversation NOT speaker (it automatically hangs up). You can not operate more than one handset at a time, however, i know of many pricey phones that work the same way.

The arthur spoke A LOT about her relationship with him prior to him going to jail and that was boring!!

I was tired of reading what seemed to me to be your average romance novel and just couldn't take anymore so I didn't pick the book back up. I normally keep all my book purchases and rarely lend them out (afraid of not getting them back or the book not coming back in the same condition) but I quickly mailed this out to someone who was interested in reading it and if she doesn't send it back trust me, I won't be upset nor miss the book at all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fairly good book","review":"This is a fairly good book.

This and other books just don't cover.It is overpriced, comparing with other more classic investment books that cost only half.

However, I would not suggest this book for beginners. I loved the history of Forex, and the book was great in terms of advice although she does often use terminology with no explanation of what it is e.g. nonfarm payrolls. If you want a book that moves slowly, this is also not a good choice. Do read this book with a good forex dictionary or access to the internet as you will need to look stuff up. Overall I liked this book alot as it was my first Forex book but I have read tons of books on stock and options trading.

When some people want to get rich on forex others exploit the opportunity by selling books the traders. This is such a book.The book deals with both technical and fundamental analysis. Both parts are covered on a very superficial level. That is what happens if everything is included in one fairly slim book.The book contains some bits of information, because the author seems to be knowledgable.

Its a shame that MTV never aired the concert.All the classics are here ALL I WANNA DO, THESE DREAMS, and a stirring DOG & BUTTERFLY.But for me, my favorite is a cover version they did of Elton John's SEASONS. The song is an ode to the friends we have made and lost on our journey of life.

My daughters love Rat-A-Tat Cat, so when I saw this edition, I bought it. The SuperPeek feature is exclusive to this edition, and while the girls like it, it seems a bit \\"gimmick-y\\" and I don't think it improves the game. On the other hand, that could be because I just got beaten twice in a row by them, and they drew SuperPeek cards and I didn't! All in all, lots of fun in a game that only take about 10-15 minutes to play - good for quick quality time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good fit and comfortable","review":"these boots look great and are very comfortable. only complaint is that after one season the rubber at the toe had to be repaired due to seperation"},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive debut","review":"The Black Sea's debut EP, S/T, is a fantastic sampler of the band. Although the EP is short, only three songs, it speaks volumes for the talent of the band. The EP starts off with Ghost Lanterns, a rollicking rocker with a pounding beat and great bass work. Shelby Cinca's voice is soft, and yet conveys enormous power over the track, as well as the other two songs. Landscapes follows Ghost Lanterns and is more subdued and lyrically focused in nature. Once again, the rhythm section mixes perfectly with the guitar and vocals for an eery, somewhat psychedelic rocker. The final track, Wingless Fire, features fantastic acoustic guitar work and beautiful vocals with a somewhat Indian or Eastern feel to it.All in all, a great EP, although a bit short. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Andrew Stevens","review":"OMgoodness, This was like watching a train go very very slowly down the tracks and plow into a car!~ The only reason you watch is to see if it stops in time.Well, this movie didn't.Acting was very very bad,shot so,,,,,novice,bad,lack of the proper noun to describe.I watched the whole movie, the outtakes are the best part,not worth buying the movie though.My boyfriend begged us never to watch iot again.I liked Andrew Stevens in The Bastard so I thought I'd give it a try,,,DON\\"T..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eells Family History in America 1633 to 1952 is the Essential Guide to Eells Genealogy in America","review":"The Eells Family History in America 1633 to 1952 is the essential guide to Eells Genealogy in America.

Although you get plenty of upper body exercise with various twists, punches & turns, you don't get ANY lower body exercise. A surprise to me since boxers have to be light on their feet. It was a BIG disappointment! Even watching/exercising with it the first time I was bored. Also, those with back problems beware. There is a lot of twisting involved.The sound quality is poor, as if it was recorded in the trainer's basement or garage. I found this to be the case with the Chair Circuit Training DVD as well.In the past I purchased the Chair Aerobics and the Chair Circuit training DVD's made by the same company that produced this DVD. Out of the three the \\"Chair Aerobics\\" is the best.\\"I'm not very impressed with the company that produces this series of exercise DVDs.All in all, I would not recommend this DVD.

What a relief that I found this workout DVD! I did it right in my wheelchair with a full cast on my leg and still lost weight and toned up. The instructor does a great job of moving the viewer through traditional boxing moves at a pace that makes you break a sweat and burn calories--all the while sitting on your duff! The instructor, David Stamps, is very pleasant, enthusiastic, and easy on the eyes as well. There are 2 workouts on the DVD--one is a longer workout designed for maximum muscle toning and calorie burning, the other is a quick workout for when you may not have the time, or want a lighter workout. Both workouts made me break a sweat! I also feel like I could defend myself with the new boxing moves I learned.

It can be hard to find a video that will get my cardio up. This one does it well. I enjoyed the presenter. I do this while seated on a fitball. Bouncing while I do it increases the cardio even more, without hurting my knees. Working with a trainer I have determined that I need a larger fitball than the size usually recommended in the tables. If you have bad knees a key thing is to have your knee angle while seated a little more than 90 degrees.I purchased this as an instant video.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the details are excellent and the book is easy to read. However, I made a mistake: I took the practice tests the day before I took the SAT IIs. I realized that Princeton's focus is on the smaller details, rather than the overall concepts and general information that the practice tests revealed the SATs were concerned with. I did well on the exam, but found myself racking my brain for details from my Biology class. There are a few specific areas, such as hormones, which the book helped with, but overall, I feel that I should have used at least on other prep book.If for nothing else, I recommend the book for its practice tests. I think they're authentic - keeping in mind that the SAT people use some of the same questions from year to year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grrrrrrrrreaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttt","review":"Another princeton success. You may be worried that this book does not have enough information and is missing some things that you learned in class, however, it has everything that you need to know for the exam.

I saw a few things that i did not see in the princeton review book at all, however, even the most descriptive and in depth book did not contain the information. Don't you see all the amazing reviews on this book. Stop wasting your time and just buy this book already, it is great and self explanatory, and interesting as well, unike barrons. This book is maybe 15x better than barrons, and i garauntee that you will get a better grade on the sat II bio if you use this book to study rather than any other book"},{"rating":"1","title":"numbingly familiar","review":"This book is numbing! These self-righteous reviewers ain't getting it - nothing is wrong with the story or Youngblood's supposedly traipsing on new ground (although her whole experience reads to me like the samo, samo, same ol' stroll down a well-beaten path) or not being in a manhunting waiting to exhale mode. It's The Writing, Stupid. Flatfooted and heavyhanded. Not to be mean, but that's the simple truth and the reason so many seem to be turned off by this black girl who maybe should've stayed home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flows like a river...","review":"While reading this book, it almost felt as though I was in a dream! The words and the scenes flow together so beautifully, and the book is difficult to put down. It isn't the suspence (there wasn't any), it was the lovely, dreamlike way that this book was written. The words were poetic! As much as I loved this book, I did find some of the characters (even the main character, Eden) to be a bit unrealistic at times. I am Black, and I'm an amateur writer, but I admit that there were times when I wanted to reach in, shake Eden by her shoulders and say, \\"GET IT TOGETHER, GIRL!!\\" She tries to live a fairy-tale bohemian lifestyle, and it seemed to me that she almost resents the \\"real world\\". All in all, this book is an excellent read; strong, poetic, and beautiful, I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surfacing","review":"I quite enjoyed this novel. The structure of each chapter embodying a different incarnation of Eden's experiences in Paris is quite innovative and enriching. Each step of the way improves her sense of language and self, and Youngblood reflects this in the language of Eden as the narrator. There are several passages where I felt more depth would have helped the reader, but overall I didn't feel the novel lacked. Like Michele Zackheim's \\"Violette's Embrace\\", this is a wonderful novel about walking in an author's shadow and discovering one's own creative self."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dream, or a joke?","review":"I picked up this book to remind me of Paris and have been very disappointed. The descriptions of Paris are completely unconvincing, vague, as if they were learned from guidebooks. The author's observations about life and people are poetic, but unoriginal and shallow. The lead character (and narrator) talks about wanting to go to Paris to find independence and unleash her creativity, but once there, she is so judgmental about the people she meets, I wondered why she kept trying to find new ways to earn enough money to stay. In the end, I couldn't tell if the narrator was dreaming about a visit she couldn't afford, or if the book was a long, elaborate joke about the futility of following in the footsteps of great writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"tres trite","review":"void of plot but crammed with the same old tired, worn out cliches about Paris and black folk in Paris (who are all wise poets, gifted expat writers or cool jazz musicians), all punctuated by embarrassingly bad imagery, annoying \\"how to\\" lists and idiotic recipes. the worse thing is that i haven't been to Paris and really wanted to see what it was like. will someone please write a good book about the black American experience in Paris!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dawning beauty!","review":"i would say it's more like yawning booty. what's up with all the effusive drama about this silly little book? i mean, i'm black, i'm a girl, last year i spent my junior year in Paris, and i can say from personal experience that the way the author describes Paris is like she just looked in a guide book. her portrayal is really superficial and the scenes are really cheesy, like every French person has rotten teeth and every black person is wise and musical. maybe she found herself at the end of this corny book but she sure lost this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"a failed effort","review":"Youngblood should write poetry, a much shorter literary form that would enable her better to control her \\"storytelling\\" which, in this book, fails in a somewhat embarrassing way, weighed down as it is by a predictable plot, clumsy writing and lots of cliches."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely","review":"Very relaxing and uplifting. Its selected kundalini yoga poses we have been doing with Ravi and Ana, put together for beauty's sake. Not tiring at all (if you are not a beginner) it leaves one relaxed and energized. Really resolves stuff such as fatigue, muscle soreness from some other workout, feeling sleep deprived and stuff like that. I've observed kundalini does much to improve skin health, it gives you a special glow. Just be carefull and pacient with camel pose and shoulder stand. Do it in stages, you will get he hang of it eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I can't say enough about this video. I have practiced yoga off and on for a few years, but have never tried Kundalini yoga. After one time using this video, it's the ony kind of yoga I want to do! The video itself is challenging but relaxing, keeps you moving, and best of all, explains the benefits of what you are doing, which encourages you to keep at it if you feel like giving up. I love the format - you just watch a woman moving steadily throughout the movements - not stopping to talk or explain anything - while voices instruct you and explain the movements. I also love the music. After I finished the video, I felt so relaxed but powerful. It left me feeling HAPPY and at peace. This is exercise that I truly look forward to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best dvd ever","review":"I absolutley love this workout, I love all of Ana and Ravi's dvd's but this one is the best.

You will not be dissapointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this video","review":"I have to say that this video was my introduction to Kundalini Yoga and the first time I put it in I was a little uncomfortable with the setting / style of it, as well as the breath of fire. I would have returned it after 5 minutes if I could have, but I tried to have an open mind and give it a chance. I am so glad I did. I love this video. I still look forward to coming home and doing it everyday (for about a month I have been alternating B Body and Fat Free yoga for Weight Loss). I always feel really good afterwards. It relaxes me and lifts my mood. I just ordered 3 other titles from Ravi and Ana. Try it with an open mind and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I have seven of Ana and Ravi's DVDs now, and I love them all. This one is awesome. The workout is very thorough, as all of their workout DVDs are. I never knew I'd love Kundalini yoga this much, but I do! (I've always done Hatha yoga until now.) If I'm unable to do one of my Ana/Ravi DVDs one day, I definitely notice a difference in my overall mood for the day. Once you get into these yoga workouts, you'll be addicted. (I felt funny with the breathing methods at first and doing the mantras/meditations, but now I am totally comfortable with them and look forward to them. The workout doesn't feel complete without them!)Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time flies when you're having fun","review":"I find this video to be fun, moving at a nice pace, and I like that the instructions include ways to focus on my inner qualities as well as outer beauty. I like that the voiceover tells us the benefits of each exercise, it helps motivate me. My personal yoga teacher doesn't recommend Breath of Fire for me, so I don't use that technique, so my experience feels a little incongruent with the tape at times, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty Body","review":"I was skeptical to order this dvd partly because of the title, but I am sure glad I did. It is a quicker fix than some of the other kundalini sets and it is a great way to feel more energetic, radiant, and yes more beautiful in 45 minutes! I do this when I have less time and still must get my practice in. This contains the 7 essesntial kriyas for radiance. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good routine","review":"This DVD contains the Magnificent Seven poses. It is very close to a hatha yoga class, with the kundalini feeling. It moves rather fast and is more for intermediate levels, although modifications are shown for beginners. This workout will develop your flexibility and stamina also. It is both soothing and stretching. I like doing this routine at least once a week, as I feel it is a comprehensive one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Body, Mind, and Soul :)","review":"This is another winner from Ana & Ravi!!!

It makes me feel more complete and radiant!!!!Thanks Ana and Ravi for another wonderful kundalini yoga set!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for daily practice!","review":"I love this DVD. I purchase it after falling in love with Fat Free Yoga by Ravi and Ana. I alternate between many yoga DVD's but this one seems to be in the rotation most often.It is quick and easy to do. It makes me feel energized and strengthened mentally and physically. I highly recommend Yoga Beauty Body."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excellent video, but very into Eastern mysticism...","review":"The production of this DVD is excellent. That said, I feel compelled to warn Christian viewers that it will be offensive to them because of its focus on Eastern mysticism and praying/chanting words to call on \\"your higher self.\\" You practice breathing exercises by chanting certain words (\\"sat\\" and \\"nam\\"). This is Hinduism, pure and simple. Don't go there.I highly recommend you google \\"Christian yoga\\" and choose one of those videos. Read this website for more info about what you might be getting into before you venture into yoga, like I did: http://www.praisemoves.com/ChristianAlternative.htm.By the way, I've never written a commentary on Amazon before.

As a grad student I don't have much time to read, but let me be the first to admit that many a paper was pushed to the last minute because I was reading this every free moment (or not-so-free moment) I had. I really fell in love with the characters. I think that this book would be great for readers who are tired of the same character development, especially in the areas of love and relationships. I was especially pleased to see how well developed the different cultures were in this story... that definitely helped me get sucked in and completely engrossed."},{"rating":"2","title":"it!","review":"Same if not better than the first!Only reason I would say never read this book... it's the last in the series, & u WILL want more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it just doesn't work","review":"Take away Yoko Ono's shaky, but honest singing and you're not left with much.

After just an hour or two, however, it fades significantly, leaving behind a much softer, more powder-like scent. There is a vanilla quality to the fragrance as well as very slight floral notes.

With all the other Curve Crush perfumes that i've purchased from different places the smell lingered well into the evening. I've purchased this product from many different stores before but never at the price of 19.64 so I thought it was a great deal. Next time I will just go ahead and spend the extra money.

He and Rush get into a pretty hair-raising adventure involving Mark's guardian, the nasty Mr. Meeker. (Don't worry -- Mona, Randy, and Oliver have adventures, too.) As a child I didn't pick up on all of the nuances of this book. As an adult, I can. (The scene with the social worker makes me howl with sympathetic laughter.)

His scriptural references seem quite dated. While there are parts to this retreat that can be beautiful and thought-provoking, other parts seem to be so much verbage. For instance, he delves into the Eucharist with great enthusiasm. But too much discourse concerning this mystery can make it seem irrelevant and remote. At the end of the retreat he writes that Christ is available to all, but will give himself to those who make a conscious effort to know him. To this reader, this is the kind of locked in logic of Catholic teaching. A statement is made and then withdrawn almost. What is this conscious effort? What does it require? Maloney says nothing. so in the end all this wonderful stuff, while available, may not be attainable because the reader may not be doing the right things. Apparently, according to Maloney, God has neither the power nor the love to crash through a person's inabilities or blindnesses.

It kept our clothes dry during the trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RECCOMENDED","review":"I gave a star because I had to.The carrier came in, only in tthe seller box, it had very large holes all over.The aluminum frame didn't fit one inside the other, this caused the fabric to rip.It was very diffucult to assembly and then we just couldn't secure it to our SUV, we wasted a lot of time and effort.I had to buy a large box to send it back and return this item.The only good thing: I GOT MY MONEY BACK, not the box money though.NOT RECCOMENDED"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH TOO LITTLE","review":"It is difficult to assemble. The instructions are very bad. It needs to be more rigid on top when in the carry position. Handles and extra buckles need restraints or they whip in the wind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"You pretty much have to pack this thing 100% full in order to avoid the unit flapping wildly from the wind. The plastic batten that is used to arch the rear of the unit ripped completely through the material on its maiden voyage. It also came unzipped by itself, due to the wind tunnel effects; I had to affix a cable tie to the two zipper pulls in order for it to stay shut. In all, this piece of trash is far from trouble-free. I expect to be able to pack my cargo, lock it (locking this unit is not an option), then be on my way and forget about it. Instead, this pile of garbage ripped, came open, allowed the cargo to get wet and to top it off, ruined my fuel mileage much worse than a hard shell unit I had prior to this. What a mistake. Go with a Yakima unit, which is what I should have done. Live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer","review":"This arrived in a box that had been previously opened and re-taped as well as squashed. The product looks to be very stable and well made. It would be nice to see some detailed pictures or a description as to what the various attgachments are for and how to use them.I read the directions and it's hard to figure out what's to be used for what.Frankly I'm a bit dissapointed in Amazon regarding this product.

I was excited to give it a try when it arrived. Putting the unit together was relatively easy. Unfortunately, the holes for the brackets did not line up at all on the crossbars of my roof rack (the cross bars do not adjust).This will NOT work for 2012 Honda Odyssey EXL. Even if it did, after seeing how thin the material is on the inside that rubs against the bottom frame, I would be concerned that it would wear through with just a few uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I used this in my military move from SC to NV, what a lifesaver!

Only two hours into a 12 day trip the drivers side zipper broke. Luckily the kids didn't notice and I was able to spend an entire day trying to re-wrap the gifts that weren't completely ruined by water! We fought the stupid thing every time we had to use it. The straps were too long and even after adjusting them, they rubbed the paint on my new car as we drove. We had to hold our belongings in with Duct Tape and several things got wet again on the ride home. I'm terribly disappointed in this product. I have returned mine asking fora refund. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical with some design/quality issues","review":"I have owned this roof carrier for about 4 years. Difficult to assemble without a lot of strength, but very practical when done. Easy and secure attachment. We use it on a VW Golf and an Audi for longer trips with our dog. Quite amazing how much can be packed in when organized well.The main problem now relates to the removable flexible brace in the top rear of the carrier, designed to keep the folding sides of the carrier upright. This has now pushed through the nylon pocket it slots into and then out through the side of the carrier. Poor quality finishing in areas that are difficult to see. This will be trying to achieve a good repair. It would be too bad to have to throw the carrier in the trash because of this small fault. The carrier is not waterproof. My impression is that rain comes up through the attachment holes in the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I purchased this item for a long road trip across the U.S. and Mexico. On my first trip it started falling apart the stitching is weak and from the metal frame inside it started ripping. I never recommend this item to anyone just spend the extra money and get a hard shell cargo carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good, but made it.","review":"We bought this carrier for a trip from So. Cal to Kansas. It fit great on our Mercury Mariner and the metal frame mounts securely to the roof rack with no tools. The front is streamlined some what. I really didn't notice any gas mileage hit at all. Problem is it broke down along the way. The back has a thin metal bracket that helps expand the top of the carrier. This bracket poked itself through the wall lining causing the bag to collapse in the rear. The top then deteriorated and five rips/tears appeared after about three states. The wind whipped it pretty good causing the rubberized material to flake off like paint chips. We folded it flat like the instructions show and used the supplied cover on the way back. The cover ripped up on the way back so I used tie downs to prevent any more damage. I do think I can use this one more time with tie downs, but of course, the weather proofing is gone. Next time I'll spring for the hard carrier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my money","review":"I purchased this item and had just a little trouble getting it put together due to lack of instructions. Once together I thought it was a great solution to my car's small trunk space. However after using this I realized I was wrong, because it leaked when it rained and now the material is starting to wear away on the top of the carrier. I've had it for only 6 months and used it 5 times. I really wish I would have bought a hard case carrier vs the Rola Folding one. I'm very disappointed that I wasted my money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st trip -great, 2nd trip - it's in a garage sale ...","review":"The first time we used this, it worked great on top of our 2004 Honda Accord. Loved that it folded down while we were at our destination, kept our things dry in rain, and for the price, it worked. On our second trip, with less gear, the front horizontal support bar pushed through the passenger side. I pulled over for gas and had what looked like a 12 inch flag pole sticking out the side. It had pushed through the red \\"reinforced\\" pocket and the material itself. I had some duck tape and fixed it and the next time we pulled over, it had pushed through the duck tape and through the drivers side. We finished our trip with it sticking out both sides. The holes are too wide to cover, and now I am purchasing another one (Thule, NOT Rola) for this years trip. Disappointed with this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first, doesn't last","review":"Initially this product was a great alternative to an expensive hard shell carrier. It was easy to install, the frame is strong, and the access and space is excellent. However, the zippers are extremely poor quality, not suitable for such a large and flexible item. The zippers often split apart and the material holding them has started to tear. When its cold it is very difficult to grip the small zipper pulls. They buckle and are extremely hard to close. With a torn zipper, this product with its other great features, becomes completely useless - unless you don't mind your stuff all over the road behind you."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of both worlds","review":"We got this carrier to use on a road trip from NC up to MA and back. We didn't want a hard shell carrier because we didn't have a place to store it when we were finished using it. And the soft cargo bags didn't look sturdy enough to hold everything in place. So we figured this would be the best of both worlds, and it really was. Also, the price was very good. We had some confusion putting the carrier together (didn't realize there was an underneath pocket to put the frame inside), but when we figured it out, it didn't take long. We packed the carrier to use every possible inch of space, and had no problems on the way there or back. We even ran into a rainstorm and none of our belongings had even a drop of water on them. Once we were done, it was easy to take the carrier down and fold it up. Highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take Home, Home for the Harvest","review":"Truth to tell, I work professionally with Rich Bala, we perform together as The Hudson River Ramblers. This recording, made possible a fun and fruitful partnership.Following a performance by Rich, which I thoroughly enjoyed, I picked up Home for the Harvest. It's unique. Save for a few gems by Pete Seeger and Rick Nestler, there's nothing out there really singing authentic songs of the Hudson River and beyond. I thought this recording would be like a folk collection gathered then sung by a scholar.Granted, these songs will please any historian. The magic and artistry happen when Bala just catches you up in these old chestnuts. He makes 19th century songs compelling, contemporary and lively, all while remaining true to their original form. You'll sing along, learn, and love the Hudson Valley where most of this songs originate."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is a shame!","review":"The CD was payable ,But the case was in horrible condition.It looked like it had been ran over by a car!!!!!!!!!

Then there were all these other wonderfully written pieces by who, I didn't know....Sand, Dostoevsky, Carr, Wordsworth, Sand. I still draw off these women and their love, work, and power as the book is broken into those three parts.

Another nice bonus is the locking mechanism that secures the TV brackets to the wall mount itself. There is no chance of an accident knocking it off the wall. I honestly think it would withstand an earthquake.Now, to the pricing... I paid a hundred. Vendors are asking $250?? This is a great mount, but not at $250. Not to me, anyway.

As a modern publisher, Penguin has put together two nice volumes at a reasonable price.

Independant Worm Saloon would be a safe beginning, but not their best. Go back in time to Hairway to Steven, Rembrant Pussyhorse, Locust Abortion Technician, or Psychic, Powerless, Another Mans Sac, and learn what great music these warped guys from Texas can churn out.

You'll learn a lot of phrases you need to know as a tourist and the book is more thorough than a simple phrasebook. You'll also learn how to put sentences together and by the end of the course you will develop a good feel for the language. Four ninety-minute tapes accompany the cassette version. Though professionally made, too much time is spent by the narrator walking you through the book. The time would have been better spent by supplementing the dialogs. The dialogs themselve are invaluable. The book uses romanized Chinese (pinyin) and therefore you will not learn how to interpret Chinese characters.

It is still the only book teaches you and be sure won't waiste your time. It gives you confidence with UNIX. Another weekness of this book is some wrong commands or exercises that can be fixed in 3rd edition. The nice thing with this book is being a hands on book.

An itimate & candid insight into the mind of a young girl, her experiences at a time when life was so drastically altered for so many people due to the nazi occupation.

I knew little about what it contained and I consequently decided to give it a try. Nothing could prepare me for what this book contained on its pages....this girl was brilliant. I could only hope that I had so much insight now at 22 that she had at 13 or 14. I absolutely commend her father for his decision of publishing her collection of diary entries. It allows the outside world, even over 50 years later, to actually feel what these persecuted jews felt like while they lived in utter seclusion.

I loved this book so much in middle school that I asked for it for Christmas then and got it. Since then I have read it at least 4 times.It's about a young Jewish girl named Anne Frank who is in hiding with her family and a couple of family friends. They are hiding from the Nazi's during WW2. The diary is about what it's like to live in hiding and not being able to go out and do things like normal kids do. She writes about her first love (Peter) and she writes how she doesn't get along with her mom very well. It's sad, hopeful and a real page turner. It will make you grateful for what you have and the freedom you have. No one should have to go through what this young girl and millions of others had to go through. It puts life into perspective and I recommend everyone read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK WAS TRUE AND HONEST","review":"IT WAS ALSO SINCERE AS IT CAME FROM THE VERY DEEPEST TUNNELS OF HER HEART.

I know most everybody has read, or at least heard about Anne Frank's life story, diary, or perhaps just the name. Either way, if you haven't read Frank's Diary, I highly recommend reading it ASAP! If you have, I highly recommend reading it AGAIN as soon as you can! Anne Frank is so strong, brave, and far beyond her years. In the worst of times, she shows the curiousity, and hope of a young child. She remains so positive throughout. There is definitely a reason why her diary is so widely recognized, and taught throughout schools. Everyone can learn a little something, or be more appreciative, thankful, for the life they do have, and freedoms we often take for granted, after reading it. Good for teenages, young adults, and adults of all ages!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasting memory of a young girl","review":"It's about the most detailed book I've ever read.

I have neither found the carm of it or the point of the book. Firstly, this book does not really show or deal with the Holocaust. It is about a girl who is growing up! Being the age of fourteen I have not been able to relate to her in any which way.Secondly, the book is very boring. She goes on endlessly about her bordemn and the fights that happen in the Annex. Lastly, it does not really share anything historical about the Hollocaust except for the idea of hiding. Overall I found this book pointless and very irrelevent. I have read much better books sbout the Holocaust that deal with many historical events. If you really want to learn more about the Holocaust I would recommend For Freedom:The story of a French Spy and Number the Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grotesquely Over-Rated","review":"Although the story of the Holocaust was a very sad ordeal for the entire world, the Anne Frank's diary wasn't good at all. The book's content was boring and anyone could basically skip through the book ten pages at a time and still know what's going on. The book just rambles on and on about what things that Anne is thinking about, and, in actuality, what no one really cares about. Reading the entire book was something that not one reader in my English class could accomplish, mainly because of the lack of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was kind of boaring","review":"Anne Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl, was unlike any other book I have read, it was a mix of everything.

I hope to find a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BOOK!","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read!!! I started it with an interest toward the Holocaust. Anne Frank never talked about anything even relating to this major historical event in her short life. Anne Frank did describe her sexual attraction to females(p.117). She was obviously very flirtatious, which I wouldn't have minded if she had not filled almost half the book with it. Overall, Anne Frank was shockingly perverted, bad-tempered, and not very smart. Many teenagers act this way, but I have never met anyone who went to that extreme, and I have never met anyone who wrote it in a diary so descendents would be forced to read it. Even if that part was not in there, the book would still be horrible. She always writes about the same thigs. It is boring! So if you want to read this book you may, but I would like to warn you about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm alone giving this 1 star- but It's what I think!","review":"I think this is not the diary of hate and the holocost. We learn more about what its like to live with 6 other people instead. It scarcely metions the Holocoust- besides the afterword. And when Anne Frank talks about \\"Blushing\\" as she called it, I assure you that you will be thourolly disgusted. With as little action as possible in a book, I don't think it is worth reading. If you really want to learn something about the Holocoust, just read the afterword! Or, if you love, dull, unexiting books, with very unplesent conversation. Read Anne Frank by none other than Anne Frank!"},{"rating":"1","title":"14 year old speaks out","review":"I speaking as a 14 year old girl hated this book.

What she talked about did not grab my attention. But I can not say she had no talent in wrighting like she said she did beacuse she had no idea that she was going to die in the end and millions of people were going to be reading her book.

The food is little and the schedule is very strict, but they do it so they won't be taken away.I did NOT like this book! 268 pages of the same events happening with an occasional twist got VERY boring. Of course, it was just her diary so it's not like she knew it was going to be published! Some things in the book were interesting and funny but I had a really hard time getting into it.

I had all the historical background in my head, and it was really fun reading Anne's accounts of the events which I was already quite familiar with. I strongly recommend her diary for anyone interested in World War Two or the Holocaust because it is an exceptionally brilliant and moving first-hand, primary source for learning about one of the darkest chapters in world history."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-consuming","review":"With her diary, Anne takes us into her life in hiding, with all the honesty of someone who never really imagines that their private thoughts will ever be read by someone other than herself. I have studied the persecution of the Jews for many years and nothing has brought it more to light for me until this. Anne tells us the raw events of her life - of having to sit and not make any noice for hours on end, and of having to go to the bathroom in a bucket after everyone else has used it, and then have it sit in the room with them. And also she tells us about her first kiss, her dislike of her mother, of that time in everyone's life when we begin to become independent from our family. The amazing thing is that she was able to show us that she was a kid, one that wanted to laugh, to play, to fight, to love, all during the most heart wrenching time in our modern history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Frank- \\"A mind of her own\\"","review":"In this essay I am going to persuade you to read the play \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\". I will give you my opinion on the play. I will also state how the authors could improve the play.I liked the play. It was very interesting. Anne is a very interesting character because she has two personalities in the two acts. I really liked the whole scenario of the play. I really didn't dislike anything but the lack of romance and the argument length. What the authors could've done to make the play better was add more romantic scenes and lengthen the argument scenes. They could've also added an ending to the story telling what happened to the people in the Secret Annex. In conclusion I would like to say that \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" is a play for the whole family.

She writes incredibly well for her young age, and has a very unique handwriting(if you have seen her real handwriting). This book was a interesting and good example as how most girls might have felt during World War II.

Whenever I read the book now, the entire scence comes in front of my eyes. This book prompted me to see the movie on Anne too! This book doesn't necessarily say that Anne was the only girl who suffered oppression under the Nazi rule.

Winona Ryder brings Anne to life in all her bravery and contradictions.

The holocaust was caused by the German people losing Word War I. Hitler(the German leader) used the Jews as a scapegoat for Germanys losses. Hitler built many concentration camps along with extermination camps to rid Germany and surrounding countries of the Jews. Anne Frank was born in Germany in 1929. By the time she was 13 her family was in hiding, hiding as to not get caught by the Nazi police and be transported to a death camp. But one day in Augest of 1944 Anne's family was captured and taken to concentration camps. Every person Peter, Mr. & Mrs. Van Dann, Mr Dussel, Margot, Mrs. Frank, and Anne herself perished in a death camp.

I do not purport to know if it is true or not. It is certainly moving, as is much Holocaust literature, whether authentic or fraudulent. What is far more disturbing is that merely questioning the authorship, or debating the numbers of persons killed in the Holocaust, has become a crime in much of the formerly \\"Free World.\\" Another reviewer notes with evident approval that the French historian Robert Faurisson has been dismissed from his position, convicted, fined, and barred from employment for raising such questions.

The whole point of this diary's publication was to show the world that every person killed by the nazis had a personality, a family, and was just like you. Therefore, this book is about a 13-year-old jewish girl growing up in hiding. It does not concern the holocaust as the hype says. So, unless you want to read about a young girl's day-to-day life, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book!","review":"This was the W-O-R-S-T book I have ever read.

I first thought it would be a very boring book, about a girl who shares her life with her diary. It proved me wrong, it is a very good book! It's about a young girl who has to deal with the Holocaust. Her family, another family, and a dentist have to go into hiding from the Nazis when they took over Holland. It tells about how she felt, what problems she dealt with, and how it was to live in it.

It gets difficult after a while to care much about the smaller problems in Anne's life. I found that Anne was hard to understand because some of the names in the book are still German.

It makes you think about how lucky we are to live in 1999. Anne was a brave girl and very patient while living in the Secret Annexe. I would recommend it to all people, especially teenagers. There are a couple of gross parts, but the good parts out-number the bad.

The only teeny problem is sometimes I can't understand stuff Anne says, like I have to read the lines again to understand. When I first picked up the book, which I borrowed from my best friend, I read for an hour straight. When you start reading this book you can barely stop, so I suggest you get a copy of this book and start reading. I can relate a lot to the way Anne feels---imagine being locked up for two years in a place like the \\"Secret Annexe\\", not being able to go out just because of your religion, and hardly being able to enjoy things you should rightfully be able to. Not too good for young readers, 'cause they might have a hard time understanding stuff about the war, and the book contains some material that's not best for young kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Frank","review":"Accurate and riveting details supplied, together with logistics of the building and some pictures made this book real to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can one say","review":"A classic.

Anne Frank was just a normal kid until her sister, Margot got a labor camp letter. Then, her life changed. The Franks had to go into hiding, inviting 4 other people to live with them. They are getting by, with a few close calls, until August 4, 1944. Nazis came and arrested the 8 people taking them to a labor camp. A few months later, her mom was dead, Margot died, and she didn't know about the men. So, she just gave up. The Holocaust is such a tragedy.

I think this book has been way overrated. Sure it's sad that one had to be stuck under such circumstances at that age, but let's face it, their situation was not the worst: people brought them food, they had a radio, books, pens, magazines and even partial freedom to fall in love. From all the positive criticism given on this book, I was very disappointed. Anne Frank may have become a big writer, but only because she was Jewish and \\"suffered\\" during the Nazi era, not because she was a particularly good writer. So if you're in for feeling sorry once again for the Jews, do read this book, but if you're looking for a literary masterpiece, then don't even bother to pick this book up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother With It","review":"While the Holocaust was a tragic event, and the fate of Anne Frank was too, this book is not the best Holocaust book. I think it is overrated and too ordinary. I understand that living in an attic is quite boring and slow, but much of the book is spent dwelling on mundane things, such as peeling potatoes and her crush. This book rarely appeals to children (they may be grossed out by some parts), and some adults even find it uninteresting. If you're looking for a truly great Holocaust book, try Night by Elie Weisel, a true work of literary genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Maple Press (India) Edition","review":"I purchased the paperback edition of Anne Frank's Diary from Amazon.com and received the Maple Press edition.

I found it very well written, so well infact that I often forgot that it was written by a young girl around my age. In this book ,(or diary)that she named \\"kitty\\",Anne Frank pours out her heart. She tells\\"kitty\\" everything. She writes down her thoughts about the war, about her family and their secret hiding place, and most importantly, her hopes and dreams for after the war.

A recent trip to Amsterdam and a tour of the Secret Annex prompted me to buy the book and read it again. I'm still not finished with the book, but I'm enjoying every page of it. Anne's insights at her young age are amazing. And yes, there are the times the relative immaturity of a teenage girl still shows through, but that's reality. At times, it is just overwhelming to consider what it was like for her, her parents and sister, and the other residents of the Annex, to be couped up inside for around 2 years. Talk about \\"cabin fever\\" and getting on each others' nerves!There is just so much in this book, I can't begin to do it justice in describing. I heartily recommend it to young and old.

It was upsetting to me the first time but it gave me a understanding of how she had to live and how much she wanted to live. It made me realize that something like that could happen to me if war were to break out and my family and I would have to go in hiding and to realize that a person can do things in life that you would never imagine you could do. Anne Frank was for her age a very creative writer. She told about her life and didn't try to hide anything,but she would never imagine that her diary would be found (or did she)and that what she had written in it was just for herself a way she could express the pain and sometimes joy she felt. I recommend everyone to read this book and think about how you would feel if you had been in her shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tribute to Anne Frank","review":"I cried. Words cannot describe how much sorrow and pain this girl must have felt. I myself can\`t even comprehend what that must have been like. Living each day not knowing the fate of you or your own family? If only she knew that she is and always be an inspiring legend. I am 13 and a girl, so I can see some of what she\`s going through. I have a hard enough time with ups and downs not to mention the emotional rollercoaster. Imagine all that plus the constant fear? Anne Frank is an exellent writer and has an unexplainable way with words. Considering all this is from a young girl. Now this review may never be read, but I want everyone to know and understand what I mean. And I won\`t critisize all the people would gave this book a negative vote.

Eight people lived in that cramped little loft barely moving during the day for TWO YEARS!I will admit that not having read the book and only seeing the theater version at my school, I havent had the full experience I have only a partial view, but come on people, if you have the guts to make comments like some of the ones I saw you obviously didn't get it. The book is about their daily realities, not a bunch of ficticious nonsense. The holocost happened, and over 11 million people died.

It is about the Frank family that goes into hiding in World War II. They live with another family, the Van Dann's, and another man. In this book the family's go though many troubles and are always on alert. The lived in the attic for a little over three years and you get to see how Anne matures and becomes a young woman rather than a bothersome child. We get to see how Anne falls in love with the Van Dann son, Peter, and how they live their day to day life in this old attic. In the book, which is Anne's diary there are many close calls where they are almost discovered. I really got a better understanding on how the Jews that went into hiding felt, the constant pressure that is always on them.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn about the second World War.

There were a total of eight people in the \\"Secret Annexe\\". During Anne's time in the \\"Secret Annexe\\", she battled her changing feelings. She could not surmount them and at once fell in love with Peter. This is a tragedy for all Jews. When they were discovered by Gestapos, the unfortunate eight were sent to a concentration.

I reccomned this book, because it tells of how life was during the Holocaust. IT explains the bad and good things that went on.

So, I bought it and it was definetely bigger than I expected it to be. The Heart Rate function works OK, but you have to be standing and wait for a while to come up, so, if you exercise at fast rates (running, biking) this is not a good solution. It works well for those who walk or hike.I ended up giving it to my mom. She walks and does not mind the large size of the watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last long","review":"Set aside the debate of heart rate function, this is not even a good basic watch. In less than 7 months, the caps of the buttons fell off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory.... Useless in practice","review":"I agree with my fellow reviewer that the watch is not worth buying, but my reasons are slightly different. It sort of works when you're resting and stationary, i.e. it gives you a reasonably accurate reading after 5+ seconds of pressing your fingers on to the sensors. When you are running, it doesn't work, i.e. you can follow your heartbeat in the form of a blinking cursor on the screen, but you never obtain a reading - which makes it completely useless for my purposes of monitoring my heartbeat to ensure I am not starting too fast at the beginning of a race."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until they break!","review":"I've had two of them and although I love the concept, both of them broke within months of my getting and using them. Each time they were set to record my heart rate, I put my fingers on the button and they beeped like they always do and then when I took my fingers off the button they kept beeping, refused to cycle through the programs and then I had to put them in a drawer until the beeping stopped when the batteries ran out. Very bad for such a high price. And twice, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Ever the optimist, I thought this would be a good purchase since I was looking for a heart rate monitor that was convenient (ie didn't have a chest strap). The watch seemed to work fine until I used it during a workout on my stationary bike. At one point, it said my heart rate was 212, in which case my chest should have exploded. At other times, I couldn't get a reading at all.Then a few times when I was wearing it sitting at my desk, I'd check my heart rate and find that it was 37. Now I have a low pulse rate and low blood pressure, but that's ridiculous. So I went back to wearing my Ironman watch and put it aside. I took it out this morning and the battery's dead!! It's less than a month old!!(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get a reading - doesn't fit the purpose","review":"I tried the watch on both wrists, on both sides of the wrists, with all sorts of different fingers and positions and pressure and I could not get a reading.

I also love stories where characters fall in love through writing. The letters were a small part of the story but they added a nice amount of depth. At the end there was a little unnecessary conflict, but it was quickly resolved and didn't detract from the overall romance of the novel. One of the best I read in a long time.

The title tracks Honey A & B were mismatch he should've chose either one or the other instead of using both but neither were good. The DEVO cover is OK and \\"Know by now\\" should've been a hit but the more \`metal' tracks \\"Big Trouble\\" and \\"Wham bam boogie\\" left me cold.

Although some have disdained this book because of \\"stereotyping,\\" I think it is important to recognize that the whole concept of the stereotype evolves from the fact that often there really ARE certain national or ethnic characteristics observable in a citizen's actions! As someone who has worked daily (and very happily) with Japanese nationals, I resent stereotyping when it interferes with someone's ability to recognize uniqueness and individuality, but I do recognize, as the author does, that there is a national character involved, too. As the author of this novel lived and worked in Japan for many years, one must conclude that he would not have done so if he had not enjoyed his life there and the friendships he presumably made with many Japanese people.

It seems that Alan Brown had lots of ideas for a book about Japan but as none of them was worthy of a novel, he threw them all in together, with a few observations that he thought rather clever and then made up lots of other things that were too ridiculous even for Japan. \\"Look, I went to Japan and found or imagined these things\\". By using real events such as the death of the Emperor, he implies that other topical events in the book also really occurred- for those of you who weren't in Japan in the late 80's, take this book with a pinch of salt! The mother's story turned out to be the most interesting part of the book, but it was a bit late by then and she had been such a sketchy character that it was hard to get involved at that stage.

Nonetheless, Alan Brown uses humor and beautiful descriptive sentences to make it work. Does he stereotype the Japanese? I think a more important question is: Do we care about Toshi or do we put the book down? I did... and I didn't. Plus, the \\"Epilogue\\" is perfect.

You crossed the line of decency on this project. Six of the 10 tracks are Ham/Evans compositions, 2 are \\"JC Mollard\\" (must be Joey, huh) pieces. Recorded with session musicians, this CD has managed to strip every breath of emotion and depth from these great pieces of rock music. The songs have been sanitized and nuetralized, totally lacking any of the feelings of the original compositions. My strongest reaction was intense yearning to hear the heart and soul that went into the originals, or even the dynamic drive that is in the original groups live takes.

The is the 10 cut album beginning with \\"Come and Get It\\" and ending with \\"Midnight Caller\\". Recorded in 1994, supposedly \\"digitally\\", it is the worst example of engineering I have ever come across. The sound is flat, with no depth or vibrancy at all; it sounds like a hasty mono recording of an old stereo LP (at least the digital technique left it with no hiss, pop, or scratches). In addition, the recorded volume level is terrible; I have to turn my car stereo up to 25 to get the same level I get from most other CDs at 16 or 17.The music and vocals are a cheap imitation of the original; the melody and the words are the same, but that's about it. If you like Badfinger, you won't like this album. Spend your money on one of the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"shame on Joey Molland","review":"a cheap and sad attempt by Joey Molland to wring a few bucks out of his illustrious past.

Each track sounded like a weak cover of Badfinger, performed by my 8th grade garage band. By the 4th track, my head began to pound, due to the tremendously way over-mic'd snare/drum kit that horribly dominates and smears each 'would-be' track. But even if George Martin mixed this CD, the entire effort would still come off as a bad jam session. The mix job and production was pure ameteur hour. How this CD ever saw the light of day is an enigma which will go down in music history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joey lost my respect with this egotistical remake.","review":"Joey Molland has been the caretaker of the Badfinger legacy.

Almost like they never existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad badfinger","review":"I bought this cd at my local record store and paid retail for it! :( My chagrin upon listening to this garage band quality set of covers knows no bounds.

They stuck it out.

I approached it out of duty -- reading it merely because it was a gift, and I knew the inevitable question was not far off (i.e., \\"How did you like it?\\"). So I picked it up and dutifully read it.It was a great surprise -- it was emotionally engaging and very enjoyable throughout! In the end, it turned out to be VERY worth the time it took to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit sad, but absolutely beautiful","review":"Nancy Wilson puts such emotion into this music it's almost as if she's been there, done that. She has other recordings of the title song, \\"Guess Who I Saw Today\\" but this is the one that pulls on your heart and makes you dread hearing the sadness of that last line. Nancy Wilson is a gem and you can feel her brilliance in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS NANCY WILSON!!!","review":"This cd is my definition of Nancy Wilson! Beautiful, sexy, sassy, sophisticated! If you are a Nancy Wilson's fan, this is the cd to buy...believe me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent as always!","review":"Marty is great as usual and this is mostly newer offerings. I was a little confused by the description that this was a complete CD as opposed to just 2-3 songs. It is a full CD. Marty as usual brings his rich piano melodies along with his exquisite voice to these songs.If you enjoy Marty's music you will be very pleased. If you have never heard him before, Marty is one of the premiere Messianic performers in the world. His music will immediately take you into worship."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Blessing!","review":"I have played this CD over multiple times and it has never failed to point my spirit and mind upwards (like all his other CDs, too). I am often reminded of how the evil spirits left Saul when David sang unto the Lord whenever I hear Marty sing. Marty is one of the very few singers out there who truly sings from HIS HEART unto the Lord, and not unto men -- and there truly is a big difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Not what I expected. Very few of the songs demonstrate Marty's rich full tones and range. This album can't begin to be compared with \\"He is My Defense\\" or \\"The Love of God\\" or \\"I Call You Friend\\" albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient Attachment","review":"Does a good job clearing sidewalks and curbs after mowing & trimming. Should work well cleaning gardens since you have variable speeds using your throttle. I wouldn't want to use it for big jobs but, if you have a string trimmer with edger attachment, this is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Good","review":"The product is easy to use and performs very well. There are two different nozzles (a wide and narrow style) supplied. I used the wide nozzle to clear off the patio and sidewalk and it worked fast with good control. A four star rating is given as the unit does produce a loud high pitch sound especially at high RPM. As with many power tools, hearing protection is suggested when using this product. Other than the noise it produces, a five star rating would be in order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for light duty work...","review":"Pros: I use this primarily for blowing grass clippings off my driveway and sidewalk. It is absolutely perfect for jobs like these. It is also much more cost effective than buying a separate machine for these tasks. Fit easily on my Toro weed trimmer.I haven't had to do any heavy work, but I would imagine it lacks a lot of the power necessary to move a large pile of leaves. Just a guess though, since I don't have to! ;)Cons: The plastic attachment on the end doesn't stay on very well. If you hit the side walk enough, it'll pop off. I just have to be careful not to bump it too much. Only slightly annoying. And finally, it has a high pitched whirling sound, which caught me off guard; but once again, only slightly annoying. My neighbors may find it more so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Web designers take note!","review":"This book is an inspiration. Check out his exhibit at the SF Moma if you can, and pick this book up for reference.Here is a designer that realized that everything should not look neat, polished, and bland- reflecting what every corporate machine thinks is \\"tasteful\\". The designer has a responsibility to add flair, artistic integrity and originality into his/her work. That means punch, depth, grit, irony- everything that we used to see in advertising before MTV and online megastores.Today's web designers often copy the latest \\"polished\\" style in an attempt to look professional, and garner more clients. That's why so much of the web looks alike right now. I even admit that I look back on old designs and wonder if I designed something because I liked it- or if I knew that the client would like it.This book helps to shake forth the notion that we can propel design (even on the web) both artistically and commercially, forward with social and political integrity!

This time, I decided to purchase via Amazon.com. The first problem is I received this protein in a bag and not like the container you see in the picture. Secondly, when I mixed this protein with fresh bottled water, it tasted a lot different.I decided to smell the drink and it smelled like spoiled milk so I threw the entire bag away. I did notice how the protein in this bag was different from the way it normally looks. When I have purchased this product in the past, it was sold in the container (like pictured). The protein was also very fine (granulated). When I purchased this protein via Amazon from this vendor, the protein appeared to be caked together and looked like flour.Would NOT recommend purchasing this product from this vendor.

Whether you have previous experience on this type of data or not, one can learn a lot on the subject with this book.It was written in an easily understood way so that one can really follow the examples and have a real go at one's own data while consulting the book.As a former student of Prof. Collett I recall how clear his presentation as well as lecture notes had always been on even the most complicated subject he taught. I treaure this volume very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Binary Modeling Text","review":"This text is perhaps one of the best for what it aims to do. There is so much here for the applied statistician / modeler that you can't help but pick up something new.The treatment on graphical analysis of logistic regression residuals is extremely well done and very well presented. I have yet to find a better treatment that collects the constructed, added variable and partial residual plots (among other techniques) and ties them together in a single chapter.Again, there is a -lot- of information here for practicing modelers to pour through. Definitely give this one a look, read the excerpts and judge for yourself. I have no complaints and love this book. My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"topgear, not much more to say","review":"Season 15 is one of the better seasons of a stellar show.

You'll find yourself watching this complete Series 15 in just a single evening or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the DVD, go for the Blu-Ray","review":"There is one enormous reason NOT to buy the DVD pack of Series 15. Unlike the high definition Blu-Ray release, the DVDs only feature the cut down, broadcast-length versions of this series 6 episodes.There is very little in the way of extra material. A prime example is from Episode 5; Jeremy made an excellent film commemorating Aryton Senna's 50th birthday that originally aired in the extended, 80-minute form for US television. You can't view this scene on the DVD, it's completely removed (instead you get 18 minutes of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz and shameful plugging).Audio and visual quality is up to par for DVD, but it's disappointing that these two versions are not identical. Will definitely order the Blu-Ray to replace this inferior copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"DVD arrived promptly and exactly as ordered.

Probably more amuzing to watch if you are very young, age 6 to 16.For reviewer calling himself \\"Zidane\\" - nor my husband who is French or my mother-in-law who is French too care much for the movie.My personal favorites with Louis de Funès are - La Grande Vadrouille and (I don't know exact english name for it) Restaurant of Mr.Septime.Louis de Funès was absolutely the most brilliant comedian ever, just not in this movie. It's hard to find his other movies in US."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, this is the best-ever from Louis de Funes","review":"More than 30 years later, it is still a great movie to watch again and again. An anti-Semite - Louis de Funes - has to pretend to be a New York rabbi to escape from its by-chance criminal persecutors, he is warmly received by a community in Les Marais waiting for him, there he learns to behave as a rabbi and love Jews, then a happy end where he gets the criminals persecuting him in jail and his daughter falling in love with an new arab president.

This movie displays the genius of Louis de Funes at its height. When I first saw it, my friend laughed so hard she banged her head on the seat in front of her and needed medical help, but she would not leave until the movie was over. Sheer comic genius.

Sumptuous nocturns, and interstitial urban zones for forbidden groping, underage drinking and driving - the alley, the drain, under the freeway - familiar props for Henson's fans. The painterly sfumato, the 'stagelit' trees and grainy, graffitied concrete walls seem impossibly tasteful and in exact measure to the questions we ask ourselves, thumbing the alternative pages of sullen-skinned, sombre adolescents of indeterminate gender.

Logically, their greatest hits compilations should be given 2 discs for starters. But that's not the case.Bob Seger's greatest hits is missing out on so much great stuff, it's almost doing him a disservice. The track sequencing is not in Chronological order, so you get the bizarre effect of bouncing from 1976's \\"Mainstreet\\" to fifteen years later, 1991's \\"The fire inside\\".Lesser numbers like \\"You'll accomp'ny me\\" should have been left off.There's the glaring absence of classic rock staples \\"Beautiful loser\\", \\"Katmandu\\", and \\"Rock and roll never forgets\\", in addition to strong album cuts like \\"Shame on the moon\\", \\"Fire lake\\", and \\"Betty Lou\\". Also missing in action is his BIGGEST, and only number 1 hit \\"Shakedown\\".If you're new to Bob Seger, this isn't the place to start, I'd recommend acquiring Night Moves instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD review","review":"CD \\"sticks\\" at one place so that the listener has to skip the song to continue.

But the best Seger tunes were on his early releases and have never appeared on CD...why? I think a greatest hits package from Seger's first seven albums would be much better than this one. Songs like Ramblin' Gamblin' Man, Tales of Lucy Blue, Lucifer, Mongrel, Heavy Music, Back in '72, Rosalie, Get Out of Denver, and UMC were some of Seger's best work and deserve to be remembered in their original (not Live Bullet) versions.

Sure, \\"Turn the Page\\", \\"You'll Accompn'y Me\\" \\"Like a Rock\\", and \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" are good hits to have on the disc, but what about \\"Nine Tonight\\", \\"Get Out of Denver\\", \\"Katmandu\\", Rock and Roll Never Forgets\\", \\"Shame On The Moon\\", American Storm\\", and even his top ten SMASH, \\"Shakedown\\"? Who picked the material to go on this album? In my opinion, I really believe the artist had little say on the decision.

Every song Bob Seger makes is amazing and they are made just for his amazing voice no one else could pull them off and here is his biggest songs, the ones they missed will be on number to but this is a must have even more then the ones on number 2!

However, the notable missing songs make this a 3 star compilation. Therefore, I have averaged the songs for 4 star overall rating.In the Detroit area, Seger is viewed as something just short of a deity. Therefore, any Detroit review of his work is jaded. I can't get enough of his music. If you want to hear Seger at his finest, get a live CD, \\"Live Bullet\\", or even \\"Nine Tonight\\".Unfortunately, there are many great songs missing from this collection: \\"Rock & Roll Never Forgets\\", \\"Katmandu\\", \\"Travelin' Man\\", \\"Beautiful Loser\\", \\"Nutbush City Limits\\", and \\"Get Out of Denver\\" are just examples. However, as greatest hits collections go, there are perhaps too many Seger hits for one CD.Overall, this CD has great songs, with some omissions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seger's finest hard-driving rock collection ever!","review":"For over 20 years, Bob Seger has been one of the best mainstream rock'n'rollers in America, developing a distinctive body of honest, hard-rocking songs. More songs that can be put on this single-disc set, unfortunately. While many of Seger's trademarks are here like \\"Turn The Page\\", \\"Old Time Rock & Roll\\" and \\"Night Moves\\". There is no \\"Rock & Roll Never Forgets\\", \\"Katmandu\\", \\"Shame On The Moon\\", or any of his pulverizing early records, when he was as tough as fellow Michigan rockers MC5, Grand Funk Railroad and the Stooges. Nevertheless, what is here is fine and contains enough first-rate material to satisfy most music fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will probably buy another Seger albumn","review":"The last Bob Seger albumn that I purchased was an LP record thirty five years ago.

Sure,there are such '70's album rock goods here like \\"Night Moves\\", the much over-played (but worthy)\\"Turn The Page\\", the rocking \\"Hollywood Nights\\", \\"Against The Wind\\", \\"Mainstreet\\" (my second personel Seger favorite)among others. Guess what you really need to do,is also purchase a copy of Seger's 'Greatest Hits, Vol.2' as a companion CD (sort to speak). My sole regret is that Bob Seger was just in my hometown and I didn't catch his concert. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prime Seger!!!","review":"I don't consider myself a big fan of today's Rock & Roll, but I bought this one after watching the movie 'Mask', with Cher, Sam Elliott and Eric Stoltz. It's one of those CD's that you pop in, hit the 'continuous play' option and kick back. 'Roll Me Away' and 'Like A Rock' are my faves on this CD. It's definitely not a 'passer upper'.

This is well and good for instruction, but not for a proper challenge of such philosophies. If one would wish to challenge the philosophy, one would first be requisited to note that with every major philosophical perspective refering to morality a man may find many facets and dimentions. This book seems to take the perspective that everything falls into dualistic definition based on proper negation of the logical converse. This is the poster-book of the fallacious strawman argument."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is probably one of the worst Ralphie May DVDs out. Being an avid fan of Ralphie, this DVD is really a BIG let down. Majority of the jokes are from the Iraq tour video, available at the end of the 'Just Correct' DVD. Perhaps because this was filmed in Tenn, he is really toned down in his language and uses more politically correct terms, which is not the norm for him. But also the fake Nashville accent he tries to push is very bad. IMO, don't waste your money buying this one, spend it on 'Just Correct'."},{"rating":"1","title":"reason","review":"the reason why i gave it a 1 isnt, because the dvd was scratched or missed up.

This was so terrible we turned it off after 15 minutes. If we were five years old we might have thought it was funny. Really just kind of dumb and lowbrow, nothing clever going on here.

All this in a world where religious biker cults roam the Southwest, a group of (Satanic? Worshipers of Cthulhu?) 'Mormons' run Utah (now dubbed 'Deseret') and former president Charlton Heston(!) has reformed the cavalry.It's all silly fun that could easily collapse under its own weight, but after a shaky start the book really lives up to its promise.Yeovil (AKA: Kim Newman) is a pop-culture junkie and it really shows here. His narrative is peppered with off handed references to things like Hanson's third farewell tour. These references are usually worth a chuckle and the volume of them really worked to set the tone for the Dark Future this book takes place in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to see these books again","review":"I loved this series when Games Workshop first published them in the late 80s and I'm very happy to see them updated and back in print.Looking forward to the completion of the Route 666/Demon Download saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"This book served as a wonderful resource.

But I've got the album, so I knew that already.The acoustic rendition of \\"Going Under\\", as well as the acoustic cover of Nirvana's \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" are truly amazing. Amy Lee has a voice to make angels weep. Also, the cd includes a cd-rom portion that contains a high-resolution (vcd quality) mpeg of the \\"Going Under\\" video.

Everything he touches is flaky or vicious/antisocial discussion tactics. I deplore the anti-semetic remark another derogatory reviewer employed, but this author is alienated minority thinking/ethics, sometimes at its worst. Unless you are a pathetic kook like most of The Connection, or a pathetic arrested development case like most hardcore SF fans, ignore this author solely on the basis of his content. Even the former should avoid this one on the basis of his unethical/self-pitying/alienated/vicious discussion tactics as well. The (Libertarian) Connection is finally dying off for lack of interest.

In \\"Holocaust - Dachau and Sachsenhausen\\", the narrator states that Adolf Eichmann was the Commandant at Auschwitz! This is not true - Eichmann was never the Commandant at Auschwitz, he was the architect of the Final Solution, managing the herculean task of facilitating the transportation of millions of Jews to ghettoes and extermination/concentration camps throughout Europe. The most famous commandant of Auschwitz was Rudolf Hoss, who was eventually hanged for his crimes against humanity in 1947.The footage did not reflect anything new, as most of it has already been covered in other documentaries covering the Holocaust. The focus is more on the rise of the Third Reich and not as much on the camps themselves.

Students find the book boring, it is overly superficial and lacks in-depth examples or analysis, and it does not cover many of the issues central to Science and Technology Studies. The book's breezy \\"factoids\\" are maddening, and unless you are willing to build your entire course around explaining and analysing them, the text will confuse students and encourage shallow thinking.The recent text by Bauchspies, Croissant, and Restivo [Science, Technology, and Society (Blackwell, 2006) provides a much better foundation in the key intellectual issues for STS.The Marcus and Segal text [Technology in America (Harcourt Brace Javanovich, 1989) provides an excellent historical overview--including a periodization that helps students grasp the way technology and society interact and shape our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vaporous Boring Spittle","review":"I have had to use this text for a few years now in one version of the Technology & Society classes that I teach. Most of the students I've had who had to read this book hated it. They found it just as boring, if not more so, than I did. I'll say that, although Volti does present bits and pieces that should be covered in an introductory class on STS, overall not only is the book boring and tediously lethargic, Volti makes various presumptuous claims, logical and ethical contradictions, and demonstrates the metaphysics of language and capitalism throughout. Volti might tell you what there is, as he and many perceive it, but the text certainly falls short of any academic work of critical importance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Venetian Palazzi","review":"An excellent volume with color photographs, an engraving, and a brief history and description of each of around a couple dozen palazzi.

No doubt I am being greedy, as such a work covering all the palazzi would require a gargantuan size or many volumes and only large libraries and millionaires could afford it.

If you've gotten this far in the series, you know why you should read this book. The deep and ever maturing characters - the exciting naval battles, shipwrecks, and storms at sea - the dry wit and moments of surprising circumstantial humor - the rich historical details and political intelligence intrigue.

Many Christian homeschool catalogs recommend these books, but I am finding that there seems to be a lot of anti-Christian sentiment in them. It was very pronounced in Around the World in 100 Years.

It was not entertaining at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"well-written, award winning, and honest","review":"I think the author has done an excellent job in describing the character we call Pocahontas, in an honest context. Of course, some might prefer the \\"Disney\\" versions of Pocahontas (or of \\"cowboys and indians\\"). Those are, in my opinion, caricatures that serve to revise what truths we know, yet wish to not dwell on. Awards in themselves don't tell us much, but being an American Library Association Notable Book, as well as a Horn Book Award winner imply that this work is no mindless comic book. In all, speaking as a parent and educator, I am pleased to see the quality--and honesty--of writing that comprises this book. Parents have nothing to fear from truthfulness, especially today when our kids are surrounded with hype and fantasy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real story of Pacahontas","review":"If you like histrical chaacters than you\`ll love this book.If you\`ve seen the Disney movie it was totaly different.She was captured by the english and they converted her into Christianity.She dressed like the english in their hard soled shoes.They changed her name to Rebecca.She even married an englishman,John Rolfe they had one boy Thomas.He was very interested in Tobacco which made him rich.She didn\`t fall in love ith whom you think she may have.i really didn\`t like the book because it\`s set up as a story of events."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN INDIAN WOMAN IN TWO WORLDS","review":"This slim volume can easily be read in one sitting--which should appeal to elementary children. It presents much information about the life of this remarkable Native America woman (beyond Disney). Fritz presents both sides (natives and settlers) with dignity and justice. She uses journals and diaries as sources for historical accuracy--filling in the rest with such statements as, \\"Pocahontas probably would have done this or said that.\\" Her deductions are based strictly on the recorded details of Pocahontas' life.So whom did she really marry and whatever happened to her son? Why did John Smith avoid seeing her in London? How did this modest young woman of quiet dignity and a deep personsl sense of morality conquer London Society? How could she reconcile her tribe's values and appreciation for nature when confronted by the sham, greed and arrogance of White Man's culture? This book is a concise but interesting read about an Ambassadress of Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"The double life of Pocahontas","review":"Pocahontas has to deal with all the new changes in her life. It stated when the English came to America to make a new settlement called Jamestown. The English had came there to find gold, build a colony, change the Indians to christians, and to find the other ocean. They go threw the many hatd times from starving to being attacked be the Indians. The Indians didn't want to take the Christian word. They also didn't believe in the English god either. This was a very good biography. It tells the truth to what realy happened to the Indians. How the English really treated them. That there life wasn't so easy. It isn't like the fairy tail written by Disney. Not all life being perfect and the end isn't like the movies. I recommend this bopok to anyone that wants the truth of Pocahontas's life. Also if you don't like to read biographies you will like to get your hands on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest band ever to come out of Aberystwyth.","review":"Great music, nice bunch of guys too, hope they do well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CDs of the 90s","review":"This is by far Everclear's best CD ever, which is really saying something (see So Much for the Afterglow & World of Noise). It mixes great melody and riffs with intrigueing lyrics. The Twistinside and Santa Monica are phenomonal songs, two of the best and biggest alternative songs of the nineties and are the best on this CD. Strawberry, Heroin Girl and Summerland are great songs too. Actually all the songs on this CD (except maybe Electra Made Me Blind, which is just pretty good) are great songs. After you listen to this CD a few times, it will always be in your CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"piss on emo!","review":"Emo, what a crappy name for a style of music.

That's what it's about!Anyway, this is a great and TRUELY emotional album. This is the best Everclear album.

This CD brings back memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Everclear","review":"Sparkle and Fade is one of the best albums I have ever heard. I've played it over and over again in my car and I am still not sick of it. \\"Pale Green Stars\\" is a masterpiece and \\"The Twistinside\\" seemed like it was speaking directly to me. The song is about leaving the care-free life of childhood and growing up and entering the real world. Since I'm a senior in college I can relate to it because pretty soon I will be leaving the comfort and fun of college and enter a world where I have to earn my own money and pay my own bills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt, intelligent rock straight from the gut","review":"I listen to this album all the time. How many albums--even ones you admire--can you honestly say that about? The songs have a smartness that never gets smug, an edge that never seems preachy, and most importantly, they simply rock. Hard. With a fury and not seen since The Replacements."},{"rating":"2","title":"real people","review":"This album grew on me over a really horrible period in my life. At first I thought it sounded too raw and unpolished, but I came to love that rawness: I felt that Art was speaking from himself, not from a polished, insulated studio and a massage and a cappucino. \\"Pale Green Stars\\" continally makes me cry...all of the songs, if really listened to, get me in some way. It far outstrips \\"So Much for the Afterglow\\" for me.A couple of years ago I drove alone on a soul-searching trip from LA to Monterey through deserted back roads, listening to this album over and over. I don't think any other music could have captured California, my crummy VW, my confusion, or my solitude so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic rock and roll, with a real-life feel","review":"Sparkle and Fade is one of those albums that you can just sit down and listen to all the way through and possibly do it over and over. I have had this album for years and have yet to tire of it. Highly recommended for anyone who likes the newer album. Highly recommended for anyone who likes rock and roll.

I loved it so much I decided to buy their older album Sparkle And Fade. I was certainly not dissapointed. This leaves So Much in the dust, with catchy tunes like Heroin Girl, Santa Monica, and You Make Me Feel Like A Whore. I realized that So Much was pop...and this was alternative with raw emotion. Strawberry made my friend cry. Sorry if Im too talkative for you, but its worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine piece of work...","review":"I bought this album some years ago. Working in a record store meant that I heard many albums before the break-through single was released and they were climbing the charts, so for a summer, this was an undiscovered gem that I played daily. Then, 'Santa Monica' came out, and the rest is history. Though later albums by the band were seemingly crafted to be radio hits, this one was raw, volatile, and unrelenting.With a certain Pacific Northwest chic, Everclear rips through the archetypical rock topics of sex, drugs, and desperation, the band lays down thick grunge riffs without slipping into hardcore mode; as a result the record retains a certain approachability- think of the pop they later embraced minus the sell-out factor.In other words, it's loud enough to make you want to jump in the pit, but catchy enough for people who usually prefer something a little more tame to keep on this list of albums to rock out to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky, really good. . .GROOVY","review":"Really groovy cd. Tons of great lyrics and songs. They really stay with the bands' feel of their lives. They are honest. That's good. . . and it perks you up a bit. It has some of the most rockis as well as loveliest instrumentation I've heard in quite a while, and is just a really good alternative album."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD ROCKS!!!","review":"I OWN BOTH THIS CD AND SMFTA AND I HAVE TO SAY I THINK THIS ONE BEATS SMFTA.

Santa Monica put Everclear on the map! This is one of the few cd's that you can just put in the cd player and hit the repeat all buttton. I've had this cd since '95 an I have yet to tire of it. Art Alexakis is not only gorgeous, but he is also a brilliant songwriter, and guitar player. Craig is an awesome bass guitar player, and Greg is such a great drummer. They have the power to make Everclear sparkle, and not fade!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"Days after you've listened to this album you will still find yourself singing the lyrics.

With songs like \\"Santa Monica\\" \\"Heroin Girl\\" \\"You Make Me Feel Like a Whore\\" and \\"Strawberry,\\" Everclear surely should be ranked one of the top bands in the world. If you don't have any Everclear CD's- you better get one, QUICK!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"phenomenal","review":"This album is the reason that I am such a big Everclear Fan. This shows the band at their high point in their career. The music is full of grungy guitars and great drum beats, but the lyrics are what drives the album for me. Art Alexakis wrote much better lyrics on this album than anything else that this band has ever created. He just knows how to hit people hard and tackles REAL issues unlike so much mainstream music that I hear today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Everclear's best...","review":"I am a bigtime Everclear fan, and I enjoy most of their music, but I fail to see why most of their fans rate \\"Sparkle and Fade\\" as their best album. Sure \\"Santa Monica\\" and \\"Summerland\\" are good, but the other songs are all mediocre at best. I can't quite explain it, but the \\"feel\\" of this album just isn't right.

I highly recommend all their CD's, except this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One catchy song does not a CD make...","review":"A song on this CD, \\"Santa Monica\\" is a catchy tune that got a lot of radio play.

Everything about this coffee grinder is wrong. The one thing a COFFEE GRINDER should do is grind coffee. No matter how long you grind, you always end up with different sized grounds - some fine, some huge bean chunks, none of them adequate to make coffee - it's awful! Also, the design of the product leads to huge messes all over the counter. Little grounds get stuck in the lid, so when you go to put the lid back on to grind again...they all fall out all over your counter. I have to wipe down my counter every time I grind coffee. We'll be returning this product, and buying something better. Save your money, buy a different one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This grinder was just okay while it was fully functioning. I really did not like the size of the grinded beans, it was limited to only drip grind, never was I able to grind the beans to down to an espresso grind.After a months worth of grinding away, the stainless cup decided to stick to the base. I contacted the manufacturer, and at their advice, I filled a small plastic bag with ice, and let it sit for an hour. After a few tries, the cup did come loose, but it was momentarily. It is too late to ship it back to Amazon for a full refund, and the manufacturer will only send me a replacment if I send the grinder to them first. Even for Twenty dollars, this unit is a piece of poo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor grinding experience","review":"This is the worst coffee grinder that I've ever used. I am very dissapointed with Cusinart. The beans do not grind evenly and does not grind fine. This grinder might be OK if you do not like your beans ground fine. If you are used to having your beans ground #5 for automatic cone drip, then this grinder is NOT for you. The only good thing I can say about this grinder is that it has an air tight storage for your ground beans. Pay a little more for the next model up and you will be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one!","review":"With the Cuisinart name, this should be a good thing, right? Wrong! First, it's noisy. Second, it requires constant pressure on the button to grind the beans. Third, in order to get consistency in the grind, the whole machine needs to be shaken two or three times per fill to get all the beans ground. Don't try to fill the cup to the top, either. It is incapable of grinding that many at one time. Fine grind takes forever, too. This gets two stars because it does grind the beans, but after about five years of only once or twice weekly use, it suddenly developed a hot, electrical smell, and it is being replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn!","review":"Quite simply one of the greatest Hip-Hop albums ever released! Lord Finesse proves he is one of the greatest lyricists and this is complimented by an awesome flow. Best tracks on the album are Baby, You Nasty, Strictly for the Ladies and Back to Back Rhyming which has a great verse by A.G. You simply must own this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lesson To Be Taught!","review":"Alright 1st off... DJ Premier, Diamond D, Showbiz, & of course Mike Smooth handle all the beats! If this were only an instrumental record you should've bought this by now. Lord Finesse came correct!!! His punchlines are extremely tight and his perspectives stand-out. Even if you're a hard to please head, I'm confident that you'll find this LP to fit your criteria for classic status. If you don't already have this, by all means get it whenever you come across this. If you do infact own a copy, re-discover its purity as a Hip Hop album for the ages. Peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good video - recommended for those open to Kundalini Yoga","review":"I am relatively new to Kundalini Yoga and have been pleasantly surprised by it. There are few Kundalini classes near me so I've been practicing to this tape. The voice over could be smoother, but other than that I found this to be an easy to follow, relaxing, and at times challenging workout. I'd recommend this to anyone open to trying Kundalini."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly What the Title Says: Bliss!","review":"I took some live Kundalini Yoga classes recently and was amazed at what a difference they made for me. The effects were immediate especially with my moods and general feeling of well being. Then my work schedule shifted and I could no longer attend a live class, so my teacher was nice to recommend Ana Brett & Ravi Singh's tapes to me.I started with Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond, which I was amazed by, and so I am adding to my collection. I just received this last week and love it so much I have done it everyday. It gives me such a delicious loosening of my hips sockets and lower back and it makes me feel happy and relaxed, as if I have laughed for hours. You actually do laugh for a few seconds in the bliss set of the DVD - kind of weird at first, I know, but wow! It makes me glow and the DVD really does what the title says - gives me total bliss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genius Workout","review":"The subtitle for this DVD is Hip Opening & Mood Mastery.I think it's genius that the authors put those two concepts together. It's sort of like the peanut butter and jelly of yoga! This one starts with a good amount of lower body work, but it's not prohibitive at all. I was able to do just about everything and it really opened me up. The second half of this DVD entails abdominal and upper body work. This is a more than skin deep approach which gets into some deep places for active releasing and mental and emotional breakthroughs. The results from this are really worth the investment of time and effort. I can't say enough good things about this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My hips are in heaven!","review":"I am more than pleased with this DVD. It is my third by Ana and Ravi and has become my favorite. I have had years of recurrent piriformis syndrome (acts like sciatica) and the exercises on this DVD are the first that I have found that actually give me relief. Overall my pelvis feels much more open and relaxed. I am also a horseback rider and fully expect the benefits from these exercises will extend to my riding. The matrix menu is an added benefit, as you can create your own routines based on the amount of time you have and what areas you want to work on. There is much more to this DVD than just blissful hips, although just that was well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Hip Opener!","review":"I've had long-term issues with hip flexibility, and this dvd has been instrumental in helping me open up and get moving properly.I like to start with Rodney Yee's \\"Power Yoga for Flexibility\\" (beginner) in order to get the body moving well first. This takes the body to the next step.I definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"Not worth the $1.99 to rent it. 45 minutes into it I got so weirded out that I turned it off. The video is all chopped up with different voices used for voice overs. There is no flow to the routine and the girl acts like she is in a porno rather than a yoga studio. May be for some but not for me as I prefer more traditional yoga routines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual Yoga MUST HAVE","review":"I loved this DVD, it's one of the few where you actually can feel something happening as you do the exercises. They are true Kundalini masters...it took me on a journey. This DVD is for people looking for a deeper connection to themselves and source. You can really feel the energy move!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the favorites with Ana and Ravi","review":"This is my 5th DVD with Ana and Brett. I had time to only do the first 50 minutes of the DVD in one sitting - it was very good. The exercises are not necessarily difficult or challenging; the repetition is what makes kundalini so magical, followed with the quiet meditation in between. The sequences are very different from the other 4 DVDs, save for a few short ones here or there, so I am rating it a 4.5 out of 5 really (not quite a 5 but I do like it a lot) out of all the kundalini DVDs from my favorite 2 people: Ana and Brett."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I have a hip injury and was looking for a video specifically designed to work that area.

A bit strange- don't really know how to describe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weirdest workout ever","review":"I love yoga but this was not at all what I was expecting. I have a hip injury and was excited to try this workout to help me release tight hip flexors and aid in recovery. What I got was the feeling that I'd suddenly walked in on a cult. The breath of fire makes you feel like you're hyperventilating. The quick, jerky movements made me feel like I was flailing around and was likely to injure myself by pulling a muscle or two. There were some movements that I think would benefit my tight hips, but you'll have to wade through a whole lot of craziness to get to them. I would not recommend this DVD if you're looking for a non-religious ordinary workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF $","review":"After reading impressive reviews of this video, I quickly ordered it. However, after attempting to do this strange yoga practice, I immediately threw the DVD in the trash. I practice yoga regularly and am always looking for new workouts. This practice is beyond odd and I wouldn't even consider it a workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Invigorating, Eye Opening","review":"This workout combines a thorough hip opening segment with a heart opening set and an abdominal set. I have four of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's DVDs and this is definitely my favorite.I've heard from yoga teachers that the best way to open the hips is to work the areas surrounding the hips as well as the hip joints themselves as the state of the surrounding areas may contribute to the tightness in the hips. This workout definitely does just that. I always feel invigorated and blissful every time I complete this workout.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Hips :)","review":"This DVD will lift your spirits, as you open up those hips!!! It's a GREAT one to get to infuse your life with energy!!!And open hips create a healthy spine!This DVD not only works on the hips, which is amazing. It also has a set to fight depression and lift the mood, which is great to do in Winter time or when you're PMSing. There are also some thyroid stimulators that are great for balancing metabolism.I LOVE all the Ravi and Ana DVDS, and own them all. You can't go wrong with any of them.

It doesn't even tell you if the reference list belongs on a separate page or what its heading looks like.

Had the authors just dealt with their topic, it would be five stars. Instead,the book suffers from two major problems. First, almost every paragraph is replete with childish \\"inside\\" jokes, sophomoric asides (invariably Lefist where they are politifal), imbecilic puns and similar self-indulgent stupidity, apparently included to show how clever the authors are. Instead, all this junk just distracts from any discussion and generally leaves the reader grinding his teeth in annoyance. Second, there are serious and repeated errors in the descriptions of the movie plots. Did the authors actually watch all the films discussed, or did they rely on others (grad students, perhaps?) for some of the material? My conclusion is that the topic is well worth a book, and its a shame the authors made such a mess of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter book for Excel","review":"I was looking around to find a book that does a good introduction to Excel with screenshots that I wanted to suggest for a friend.

Yes, it connected easily, but any time there is a graphics-heavy job, or even just some text to print that's more than 2 or 3 pages long, the job somehow gets 'stuck' in the cable; it doesn't seem to have enough memory to send the job to the printer. Then it totally jams up the printer and it's impossible to clear the print queue without disconnecting the cable for about 5 minutes and rebooting the printer. It was cheap, but this was a waste of money. You get what you pay for....<Just purchased new iMac - no parallel port for my HP Laserjet 4200, so I thought I'd try this cable, even though some of the reviews were not so favorable. Just plugged it in and it recognized my printer instantly and worked perfectly. Amazing buy for $12!>"},{"rating":"2","title":"USB is the way to be","review":"The Sabrent SBT-UPPC USB Parallel cable was very easy to install. Having a computer with Windows XP, the cable was immediately recognized, as was the HP Laserjet 5 I am using. It has made this printer usable again in a world where parallel is on it's way out. I did however have an issue with the printer. I leave my computer on at night, and at times it Automatically updates and restarts. If it does this (it has a few times now), I can no longer use the printer. What I learned to do was turn off and on the printer, then go to Start Menu\\\\Control Panel\\\\Administrative Tools\\\\Services and restart the Print Spooler service. When I do this, everything works from that point forward. A small price to pay for being able to use the printer. I would score the cable as a 3 star if I knew this issue was completely the cable's fault and not somehow Windows XP's fault.Overall, a very good accessory for legacy printers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked just fine with Vista and Canon BJC1000","review":"It simply worked with a new Dell Vostro (no LPT ports) running Windows Vista and an old Canon BJC-1000 printer.

The setup works fine and the setup was fairly easy. The problem is that I have to delete the old printer setup and create a new printer setup each time I log in to the computer. That gets a bit old.

Strange forced affectation and laughable accents and voices. As far as the book is concerned,I read the book a long time ago and enjoyed it for what it was--a mystery/thriller--not a piece of art. I enjoyed the whole trilogy in fact. This narrator is killing it for me though. I wouldn't be able to stand another Ellroy or any author for that matter, with this guy. He might be good in a different genre but this just sounds forced and odd.I wonder how Ellroy feels about this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I Miss Something?","review":"Hmmm...I think I missed a whole lot of somethings. This is a dreadful novel. I'll admit, I picked it up because the movie is currently in theaters. I should have known better. A review of the movie...\\"...convoluted plot, ambiguous characters, confusing...\\" should have scared me off. Each time I picked it up, I had to re-read a few pages, to figure out who was who and what was or wasn't happening.I tried to finish this book...honest...but, all too soon, it got tossed in the \\"drop off at the club\\" pile. I never even took the time to read the last few chapters to see what happened. Why? Because I had no urge to know.Will I watch the movie? Well, maybe, because I like the actors...but, only once it's offered, free, on \\"On Demand.\\" I've spent enough money on this overly-hyped, drivel of a story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I read this book as a selection for my book club. After all the fan fair, this book was a complete disappointment -- and let me tell you, we've read some bad books in the past. This one takes the cake. I can get past the fictional aspect of the book; however, the supposed \\"great writing\\" is just not there. I found this book to be very superficial, although the story line had great promise. A considerable struggle to get through and little if any flow to the writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scott Turow for the louche set","review":"Ellroy is one of the most overrated authors of recent years.I have no problem with people liking swill, they usually do, but people with otherwise good taste seem to LOVE this pretentious twaddler.Ellroy writes plot-dependant novels, but can't plot to save his damn life. Halfway through every one of his books, the plot breaks down, and, not that I read for plot, there's nothing else left.

Maybe I just don't like the genre, but I found the book to be convoluted and boring. I even tried to watch the movie, thinking that I just needed a boost. WRONG! It was awful too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title Is Confusing","review":"After going about 1/4th of the way through the book, I can't understand why its called The Black Dahlia.

If you like boxing, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Dahlia","review":"Please, don't pay attention to 4 star's customer's review. The book is boring.

The middle part is a little muddled but the ending is great as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellroy is a master","review":"Ellroy takes a small detour from his hard-boiled crime genre to delve into a little historical fiction. I say historical fiction because he take real events from history and intertwines them with his own writing.The Black Dahlia obviously focuses on the murder of Elizabeth Short, one of the most famous unsolved mysteries in the world. It is also something of an obsession for Ellroy.This book is written in typical Ellroy fashion. Tight, hard-boiled prose, along with complex, faulted characters.If you have never read an Ellroy book, this probably will not be your last. If you are a fan of Ellroy, you probably will not even be reading this review, as your time could be better spent reading more Ellroy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough, hard-boiled, noir, ... excellent","review":"Ellroy's noirish story of two cops and their search for the killer of the Black Dahlia is a superb fictionalized account of a real life unsolved mystery. The story has an unsettling documentary feel about it and what emerges is an oftentimes brutal and disturbing portrait of tough, obsessive cops and their no holes barred approach to detective work. Ellroy's debt to Ross MacDonald is very apparent in the plot resolution, although you will not find any characters that approach the nobility of Lew Archer, Philip Marlowe or even Harry Bosch. Ellroy's characters tend to fall prey to their own destructive obsessions. This is a great read, and I encourage fans of Jim Thompson, Chandler, Macdonald & Michael Connelly to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterfully written L.A. noir drama.","review":"If you're like me, and you love American 50's relics, this book is a must read. The first in Ellroy's L.A. Quartet, you'll have no choice but to be sucked into the unbelievable world of the Dalhia. Ellroy's writing style is gritty and sharp. He refuses to bore you. He tapes back your eyelids forcing you to fully take in every word. It's worth the risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting twist on old story","review":"Enjoyed story line, was an interesting twist on and old story/cold case.

He was obviously enamored of words like 'cooze' and other slang of the time. He got too cute with too many plot twists. I really had trouble finishing it and would never recommend it. A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"So grotesque, it's funny","review":"I was darned disappointed by the ending to a pretty great buildup. The Sprague housing corruption angle and the father-(step)daughter tryst was just too derivative of CHINATOWN, while the ending read like dexadrine-fueled Grande-Guignol mashed up with Peter O'Toole's MACBETH. Like the audience in the latter, I actually found myself laughing at the kitchen-sink grotesquery ((...)). And Kay's re-think of her relationship with Bucky...talk about your venus ex machina. Her apology for coming between him and the Dahlia is about as misplaced as Harry Whittington's my-bad to Dick Cheney. A page-turner for 300 pages; a book-tosser for the last 80."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just wanted to finish it to move on to my next book","review":"I received this book as a gift. I read in this genre from time to time and usually the pace of the books is riveting. Here I was very restless and not interested in the characters. So many things happened that seemed far-fetched that I couldn't give the author much confidence. In the end I was happy to finish the book to just be done with it and disappointed at the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"With the hype this book has gotten, I looked forward to a terrific read. Based on a true unsolved crime that has been a fascinating story for decades, I figured I was in for an engrossing read.Unfortunately, the reader has to plow through 177 pages of character \\"background\\" before even getting to the crime. I managed to plow through that but I was so peeved it took that long to get to the real story, I put the book down. I'll pick it up again when I am desperate for something to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal and Believeable","review":"I'll begin this review by saying that I could not put this book down. I'm not even a murder mystery type of person, but something about the Black Dahlia mystery intrigued me. I wasn't very far into it before I began feeling sad that the Dahlia murder would not be--has not been-solved, which makes it obvious that Ellroy causes the reader to care about his characters. My one gripe with this novel was that, as a history major, I wondered at times whether Ellroy had done much, if any, research about life following World War II, namely technologically and culturally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I have ever read without a doubt!!","review":"I bought this book on a whim because I had no idea who James Ellroy was beforehand. Now I am kicking myself for having gone so long without reading one of his books. I have since bought and read five more of his books, but none quite compare to the \\"Black Dahlia\\". Ellroy's method of prose is so tantalizing and intriguing. I found it hard to put down because the depiction of the time and place were so realistic, and the characters were crisp and believable. Just when you think its over (even though there are plenty of pages left) HOLD ON because the ending is as exciting as anything in print. STOP READING THIS AND GO BUY IT NOW!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Black Dahlia","review":"I received great service for this item, but I didn't like the book.

I have owned and read the novel by James Ellroy. This is a make-believe story of the Black Dahlia, with no truth to it at all (I imagine the same as the forthcoming movie made from this novel). I have read the comment by the distinguished Colin Wilson about Severed: \\"The best book on the Black Dahlia--in fact, the only reliable book.\\" If you want a crass, kooky, fantasy tale, read Ellroy. If you want the truth, read Gilmore.

Nothing like taking a famous murder case and writing it into such a made up joke of a story!! Did I mention that it was boring as well? makes you wonder why the author couldn't come up with his own story line, rather than creating a fictional oddity around such a famous murder?

Though absolutely nothing happened in the story by that point I persevered, being curious about this well known case. But damn does the author punish you for wanting to know. Unfathomably cliched, insanely drawn out, filled with cardboard characters spouting cardboard dialogue I finally waved the white flag 3/4 through. Mind-boggling. The author would do well to re-read his Jim Thompson collection to get a clue. A real mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't I just stop reading!?!","review":"One star reviewers, I'm right there with you. The book was dull, the 40's slang was cumbersome. The reviews were fantastic so I kept reading, hoping for some enjoyment. I wish I hadn't bothered. The story was complicated and disturbing and there was no character - not one - with redeeming qualities.Even doing the laundry would have been more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being able to multi-task is great!","review":"This book is really good. I always try to read the book before seeing the movie because the bookks are always better. I purchased the book on CD so that I could multi-task. My life is so busy with work, kids and building a house that I never have the time to sit down and relax with a good book. It's certainly not as enjoyable but now I can listen while driving to work, listen while on break at work, listen while I do dishes or other household chores and when I'm stuffing insulation in my new house as well. The book is graphic and should not be listened to in the presence of young children so use headphones when ever possible. I would recommend this book and any book on CD to all mystery lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One line cannot describe the genius of James Ellroy.","review":"This book will burn holes in your brain it is so intense, so hot, so dangerous. I don't believe I have ever read a piece of literature which literally put me in a state of irrevocable shock at the world, and at humanity and its capability for evil. This is more than fiction. These charactes are caricatures of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I was first impressed by the voice used in this book. The Black Dahlia was written in a very 1940s style. The verbiage seemed authentic to the time period. I found the book to be a strong combination of relationships and mystery, and sometimes disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally like any other","review":"I finally read \\"The Black Dahlia\\" after my husband had been raving about it. I was not disappointed. The story was engaging, and the writing style used an economy of words that I have never seen - straight to the story without wasting time on lenghty descriptions. And yet, you get fantastic description through dialogue. My only complaint is the ending, which I won't give away, but you have fixed in your mind who did it, then it turns and tells you, \\"No, it was THIS person.\\" Just as you've gotten used the that idea, it twists again, and says, \\"No, we tricked you again. It's THIS person.\\" That happens a few too many time. But it's still well-worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE American Novel...","review":"Just like \\"a reader from England\\" below I decided to have a crack at some Ellroy after loving LA Confidential. The worst part about it is that I almost gave up after about 70 pages... After 383 I put down one of the great pieces of modern fiction I've ever read... It's dark, disturbing, unputdownable, filled with the most wonderful, vivid characters in the genre since Raymond Chandler and it's just a question of time before Hollywood makes a terrible movie adaptation... Maybe with that nice young Brad Pitt..."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Intrigue--High Improbability","review":"I can't deny the suspense, and how hard the book was to put down--for the first half because the main character has a likeable intelligence. Not having read any of Ellroy's other books, I was taken by his ability to capture 1940s vernacular and style, in the beginning. The plot becomes so convoluted and drawn out that the reader pulls away from it thinking \\"well, this started out entertaining, but c'mon now.\\" As the plot develops the prose begins to lose its 40s edge and becomes very 90s with tons of phrases and jargon that likely didn't exist in that era. I did enjoy the police sensibility which seemed authentic to the time. The obsessiveness of the main character becomes tedious and as the story rolls along becoming more unbelievable page by page, you are left with gratuitous violence that is more shock value than substance. The book is gruesome and silly at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the investigation for nothing","review":"First of all let me tell you that this book could be written in 250 pages or less, the other 250 or so are things that has nothing to do with the book, for example the fight between Bucky Bleichert and Lee Blanchard and the way they were training for the fight, I can give some more examples.The book has really nothing, no matter if it was real, and at the end the person who did the murder, well nobody does nothing to catch him and they knew who was.And in the other hand, all the investigation was for nothing, at the end of the book you will see that even if there were no investigation at all they will find who was the murderer."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELF-INDULGENT GEEGAW","review":"Sorry, can't join the herd who've swallowed this as good writing. Like AMERICAN PSYCHO, it's got the verbal runs. Good talent at getting words out, no problem there. But what it all means is close to zero. I agree with another reviewer, here is one highly overrated writer. Ellroy has had his two hours of fame. Lets not hog the spotlight, James. Go to sleep, like I do when I try reading your work.

Along with Big Nowhere, this is my favorite crime/mystery book ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetic!","review":"This is the first Ellroy novel I've read but it certainly won't be the last. It is based on the real life 1940's slaughter of the would-be actress Elizabeth Short. Ellroy does a thorough job of introducing the main characters involved and focusing on them terrifically while also making the story unbearably suspenseful. If you're craving twists and turns, unyielding obsession, and an ending that isn't abrupt in the least, you've come to the right place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over my head - and I'm pretty tall!","review":"So there were lots of great parts of this book, and lots of relevant historical information, and, at times, it really shines. How paved streets came about in London, for example, the Macaroni fashions, and other important historical phenomena are covered and are covered pretty well. However, the book does not read well at all. You will find yourself reading and re-reading and re-reading again.

I can imagine popping it into the CD player when I'm driving down a long straight road, and I got nothin' but hours of driving ahead of me. But watch out for the cops, 'cause this one is likely to make you forget about the speed. At some point you'll want to get off the road and have a nice, tall cold one too! An excellent album all the way through... but my favorite lyric by far is \\"like wet toungue suckin' on a peppermint\\" on \\"Where the Water's Deep\\".

When you get it in the mail, it doesn't look like much, but prepare to be surprised. This author is simply a superb researcher and writer. As the cover notes, Baumel is the author of the book \\"Dealing With Depression Naturally\\", which is a stunning compendium. In this short book, Baumel concisely summarizes almost every serotonin-boosting treatment that has been well-researched. He mentions nicotine, alcohol, negative ions--very impressive. I don't know who this guy is, exactly, but he is extremely intelligent and writes with style, in addition to providing a very large amount of information on serotonin in affective disorders, and he does it in a very small amount of space."},{"rating":"2","title":"A forgotten, underground classic (5 Stars)","review":"Very rarely is such amazing hip-hop funk condensed in to the minute tracklisting of 12 songs but on Main Source's Breaking Atoms, it is done with amazing finesse. The only person to condense it even further would be Nas on Illmatic, and coincidentally, he is featured here on his first ever album appearance, \\"Live At The Barbeque.\\" Even without that song, this album stands as one of rap's shining moments with the production team of Sir Scratch and King Kut on the turntables. Their dense sonic collage is something one has to hear to believe. It is, unfortunately, a sound that has never been duplicated on any other record. It is hard to believe that an album such as this could fall into the cracks of music history but it makes the album that much more special. Owning a copy of this album is like holding a piece of rap history and anyone with the great fortune to have this masterpiece should never let go of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We need more Albums like This...","review":"Main Source was always true to hip hop and I wish they would have stayed together.

It was a great chance to learn a little bit more about a character that is close to my heart.During a leave from duty Bosch delves deep into his past to make sense of his mother's murder (and hopefully find the killer).While the action is quick and the writing is strong what really makes this Connelly book stand out is that we really learn what makes Bosch tick. The title is also great - it has a double meaning, it signifies how Harry sees himself as well as the earthquake ravaged LA neighborhood in which Bosch resides - he has a coyote that visits his hillside home from time to time.A very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"MC is BACK!!!","review":"I will keep this simple. Michael Connelly has never written a bad book (at least that I ever read). However in the near recent past he has been a little under the \\"top of his game\\".

The mystery involving the murder of his prostitute mother decades ago is solved by Harry Bosch after he is on an involuntary leave from the police force. The identity of the killer was a complete surprise at the end, and the confrontation between Bosch and his prime suspect was chilling. This is one of my favourite novels and anyone who likes the mystery/crime genre should most definitly read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An edge-of-your-seat psychological and action thriller","review":"Harry Bosch is in his fourties and a temporarily suspended LAPD homicide officer when he decides to take on the most important case of his career: solving the more than 30 years old murder of his mother. Illegally using the name of his direct superior, who was the reason for his suspension in the first place, he takes the old file from the archives and starts his investigation. And apparently he is raking up quite some mud, because before long people start dying. And all the while Harry has to decide whether it is worthwhile what he is doing: will it help him to cope with the past?This book blends the description of a thorough and creative investigation with a lot of action plus an insight into the psychology of a man whose mother was killed when he was a teenager. One of the best of the Harry Bosch series of thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another enjoyable Harry Bosch story!!!","review":"Have just finished this one and it's a great read!!

The premise of this one didn't exactly fill me with enthusiasm, and it did start out a little slow. If you like Connelly/Bosch - get it, stick with it and see it all the way through. So much of Harry's inner being is revealed and you gain an ever greater understanding and rooting interest for him. Characters are rich and deep and one can see how Connelly has gradually honed his craft with each new book in the series. The plot is far better than I imagined and it left me rushing right into #5 in the series - Trunk Music. Loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book - ending a bit weak","review":"Again an absolute must for mystery readers. Bosch is digging in his past, in his roots. What he finds is depressing, but it helps him too. It is a novel full of tension. But the ending is not so good. A man like Harry Bosch should be able to cope with what he found. He is not someone who cracks too easily. Or does Michael Connelly want to forget him?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twists and Turns Around Every Corner!","review":"The Last Coyote was my 7th Michael Connelly. I found The Last Coyote just as good as the rest of them. The only bad thing is that they portray Harry Bosch as a drunk, loser, cigarette-smoking slob in this one, which he isn't.

I really didn't see why the author named this book \\"The Last Coyote,\\" I feel that were better names for the title than that.

Part of the suspension includes seeing a psychologist. Less than thrilled Harry participates reluctantly but begins to understand why he's been so angry lately. He has a job that he's been putting off. He must find out who murdered his mother, a prostitute. This book really gets inside Harry's head like no other. We understand who he is and what makes him tick. He discovers his mother's murder may have been swept under the rug by the politics of the 1950s, involving an aspiring attorney general and his lackeys.

All of the plot twists and Harry's ongoing angst about himself, his life, his view of the world. He trolls through the nasty underside of politics and police work, digging to find the killer of his mother - 30 years ago when he was 12. Best line: he finds the cop who informed him that his mother was dead. The cop thinks that Harry's after him about the loose ends on the incident and has a gun on Harry. Harry tells the cop how he found Harry at a swimming pool to tell him. The cop says \\"you're the kid\\" and Harry answers \\"I'm the kid\\".

Is every word and action exactly as it happened? Likely not...and even if John was alive to provide information for the story...it would likely not all be true.

Yes, it is entertaining and not exactly like it really happened but what film really does, sure a few do but film makers have to keep the audience moving along a story line. I recommend buying this one, it is really good story of a young man who looked at times that he was going nowhere and ended up going somewhere.

By appealing to ALL components of his audience, from James I (via Banquo's royal progeny) to the uneducated and superstitious groundlings (via witches and ghosts), Shakespeare created a timeless classic. Macbeth's tragic flaw, \\"vaulting ambition,\\" ultimately causes his downfall; this downfall serves as an ultimate, meaningful, and universal warning: while ambition may cause a person to rise in status and prestige, too much ambition may cause a person to both lose touch with reality and improve his/her status by any means possible (including murder). Suspense and mystery, combined with mystical superstition, believable characters, eerily vivid descriptions, and universal themes, make Macbeth a wonderful play to read, to interpret, and to analyze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain","review":"There's no footnotes, which make it difficult to use.

They have the footnotes on the facing pages (so they aren't disruptive but are at the same time accessible), illustrative images from Shakespeare's time, and a scholarly essay at the end. They are also very clear (without being pedantic) about the uncertainties in editing the work (between folios and quartos, although no quarto editions of MacBeth were published in his time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Folger Library Shakespeare -- Not Recommended","review":"These editions of Shakespeare by New Folger Library are absolutely awful.

I think that the tree's sound effect should have been a bit louder than ours is...its rather quiet for all of the noise that trains make rattling across the track (and little kid sound effects that go along with it).

Our conscience forgets but our sub-conscious never forgets anything. The author presents her knowledge and experience and understanding in healing ministry that can only help the reader understand themselves better and then invite the healing hand of God into their life. The outcome of positive prayer and self-analysis can bring about at least the start of healing the wounds, but also the desire to forgive or seek forgiveness which is the very core of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves you uncertain what it is you are supposed to heal.","review":"This book confused me.

Strange that \\"Fate Of Nations\\" has five tracks on here, while another album has none, but oh well. The second disc is more for fanatics, but still has alot of good stuff, covers and b-sides. I'm not a huge fan of the cardboard packaging, but it's the music that's important. Overall, it's all the \\"Robert Plant\\" a casual fan should need."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could he have left off \\"In The Mood?\\"","review":"I've been waiting for a collection of Robert Plant's biggest hits for years...and finally it arrives...without one of his biggest and best loved songs, \\"In The Mood.\\" How could he have disrespected his fans so much as to have left that song off? And where are \\"Burning Down One Side,\\" \\"Pledge Pin,\\" and \\"Hurting Kind?\\" Those were all bona-fide hits!!! And, since \\"Sea Of Love\\" was graciously included on here, where is the follow-up, \\"Rockin' At Midnight?\\" There is WAY too much from \\"Fate Of Nations\\" on this album. The exlusion of those other vital tracks is a major, major, major flaw. This is a prime reason why people burn their own CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under-appreciated","review":"66 once again puts on display r plant's amazing talent. It would be difficult to criticize the selections since this is after all Mr. Plant's creation. 'Upside Down', 'Dirt in a Hole', 'Naked', 'Rude World' and 'Life Begin Again' stand out. Although I am very curious as to why 'Oompah (Watery Bint)', the b-side from Hurting Kind did not make it. Bint is an amazing piece that harkins back to the creativity of 'shaken' while pushing forward with a contemporary feel. I would encourage any fan to add it to their collection. Looking forward to the next step for r plant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Archie Day By Day Comic","review":"It's a great comic book, I personally like longer stories, but this, is still an awesome comic book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool for the non-medical professional","review":"This book is written in a form that the non-medical professionals (social work and other ancillary practitioners) can understand.

It gives great insight into the process of theological development from Paul on through the Middle Ages. The chapters are arranged thoughtfully for the scholar and lay person alike, with bite size bits of information and actual exerts from the individual Church Fathers from each era. It has amazed me to see the fragility of doctrine during that period of Church history, being exposed and tainted at times with heresies. It is miraculous that Christian faith has not only been preserved but has flourished. I highly recommend this book to any armchair theologian and lover of Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed\\"","review":"This book is inspirational, telling the story of a French Huguenot village in World War II.

I gave up halfway through."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor look at ethical wealth","review":"I was asked to contrast this book to Christopher Browning's _Ordinary Men_ for a class in Comparative Religious Ethics. While this proved to be an intresting exercise, Philip Hallie's unpolished tale of Le Chambon, a stop on France's \\"Underground Railroad\\" for WWII refugees, suffers in the comparison.Hallie makes tentative steps towards a biography of Andre Trocme (the town's pastor), a specific and narrow history of a French town in WWII, a case study in ethics, and a testimony of praise for people he grew to admire in his research. None of these directions arrive at any satisfying destination, leaving the narrative feeling disorganized and lacking the import the story might have held.In spite of the ways Hallie's approach disappointed me, I would still recommend this book to those people who enjoy reading simple modern morality tales told in terms of \\"good vs. evil\\", or those who want some rather saccharine optimism about human nature in their histories of WWII."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot but make the judicious grieve","review":"When a writer starts a story in the first person, switches to the second person and finally to the third person, I usually get annoyed and stop reading. But when it's on a list of books you have to read and are going to be tested on, you keep going, more and more convinced of the stupidity of those professors in Spanish departments all over the USA who keep it on their reading lists and thus save it from the oblivion it so richly deserves and will soon attain.I give \\"Artemio Cruz\\" two stars only because reading it proved to me that my taste is better than that of my professors.And for those who think that the fault may lie in the translation, I can assure you that the original is just as bad, if not worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flood not spot","review":"These lights die not perform like the manufacturer said.

Her teacher read the book to the class and then they all had the tamales that my daughter and I made. It was a huge hit!! Now that she is in kindergarten, we will do it again (I am buying the book since I have two girls and I think this tradition will go on for a while!).

It just broke and popped out (The ear part) while I was still wearing the headset.The sound quality isn't that bad for the price, but your ears get warm after 30 minutesand the headset is just not comfortable.Buy something else.

I initially had a lot of problem with people hearing me, the sound broke up a lot. Setup was a real difficult struggle. Tweaked settings a lot back and forth, then bent the boom way in almost touching my mouth and it is better.

Weak bass, lack of clarity but it's good enough for chatting. Not so good for music.The headset is rather tight. Not painful but not comfortable for long wearing.The coverings went off quite fast with white peal offs noted after 6 months.Despite the build looks sturdy, it broke after 6 month of use. Be careful of the plastic piece connecting the ear cuff with the body. It can be bent, weakened and break later, that's my case. Repair requires 6USD + the shipping cost to the repair center.The wire protection is a bit thin inside. A few of my previous headsets broke because of that. This one does not seems better or worse.Not recommended for frequent users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stuck with Logitech.","review":"I bought these in October of '09. At first I was very pleased, but after an hour or so of use my ears were practically burning because they hurt so bad. For anyone who spends any time playing a computer game, an hour is not going to cut it. I can't adjust the volume too high without the speakers crackling, which ruins any music for me. Finally, the left speaker is starting to go. I didn't expect them to last too long, but I think three months is a bit ridiculous.

When I first took it I was somewhat disappointed. That was way back then. Lately, I saw the book at a yard sale, reread it, and was amazed at what I ignored in the book when I actually did try LSD; the book is not written from a stoner perspective but is more informational and well researched. It is good reading, funny, and very technical at times.

The other theme noticed about this book was that a large majority of the perceptions made by the authors applied to law enforcement organizations from the East coast and although West Coast organizations were mentioned, many of these points seemed dated (again, referring to the first comment)."},{"rating":"1","title":"proactive police management","review":"This book is hard to read, because it is poorly written. There are too many typos. Too many references to studies done in the 60s and 70s. Book is more of a fantasy than a book about management. If I did not need to read this for a promotional exam, I would have never gotten past the fist chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure as a textbook","review":"As one reviewer noted, this book is comprehensive; it covers a wide breadth of topics. Unfortunately, most of the conclusions are based on studies from the 1960's and 70's. Anything to do with technology is dated; anything remotely technologically modern is treated with a \\"gee whiz\\" attitude. The final chapter on the future of policing is a joke, with the typical dystopian Bladerunner fantasy combined with the authors' personal speculation about world politics (we must create an international police force! etc.). The authors also draw way too heavily on NYPD with only casual mentions of practices in other police departments (earth to authors: no one outside of NYPD has a \\"Rabbi\\" FYI). Not sure why my department picked this book for its promotional test, but they did, so I'm stuck with it. Finally, the typos, mispellings, and instances of outright incorrect information are ghastly. I certainly would not recommend this book for academic use or promotional tests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going back to school","review":"This is a great collection of songs from the seventies and eighties. It consists mainly of full-length LP or 12-inch versions of funk, disco and R&B; tunes. They generally are in the five to seven minute range. It's certainly a welcome alternative to the edited single versions that are recycled on countless compilations time and again. Eventually, some of these tunes would be sampled in later years by other artists. There are three single versions on this album: \\"Think (About It)\\" by Lyn Collins,\\"Pass The Peas\\" by The JB's and \\"September\\" by EWF. This collection is great for parties or get togethers. If you like extended versions then you'll enjoy this album.The first disc runs 78 minutes and the second 72 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get down on it....","review":"Old School Jams Gold is the bomb. Definitely worth getting, but I have one question: Why, on Disc Two, which runs 72:23, do the compilers give a version of Leon Haywood's immortal classic \\"I Want'a Do Something Freaky to You\\" which is EDITED by 54 seconds???I bought this because on the back of the CD case reads the following legend: \\"All tracks full length LP or 12\\" versions (as noted)\\", and I needed this for a lot of 12\\" versions I didn't have. But the legend lies. I'm glad I already have the full-length version (on the old PolyGram Chronicles Funk Essentials release \\"Funky Stuff\\"), but even though I feel this collection is absolutely essential, I still feel frauded for the shortening of this one classic song."},{"rating":"2","title":"NAH!","review":"If you've got most of these, then keep what you've got.

Good enough in color and black and white. Fast enough. The scanner functions as expected, and the copier works well.Now the bad: You will spend a ton of money on ink. Maybe you think any printer you buy will cost a lot of money in ink. No. This one will cost you more. The worst part is that the inks have digitally-encoded expiration dates, and the printer will refuse to function if even one color is expired (or empty). This means that even if you don't print in color often, you will have to keep buying color inks because it WILL NOT PRINT if light magenta is expired.Also, the wireless networking card in my printer quit working after a year.If it weren't for the ink, this printer would be a solid four stars for me. It does everything else just fine, even if it is a little big. But the ink. The ink is such a pain. It makes me angry, and a printer should never make you angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply the worst printer I've ever owned","review":"Does \\"everything\\", but nothing well at all. This printer is buggy, unreliable and goes through (expensive!) ink cartridges even when printing in black only. The printer will usually not restore the wireless network connection upon coming out of sleep, leaving me to fully power cycle the device. Other bugs and crashes seem to appear weekly. Color ink cartridges seem to dissapear in a hurry, even when using black only (greyscale). The printer case itself is flimsy and poorly thought out. The only plus side is that the scanner seems to work fairly well and has a variety of different media support. In short, I will be searching for another brand of printer as this one is nothing short of frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good!","review":"I can not complain.

Other than that, they deny that the scans are poor quality. The scans are not clear. They have very tiny lines running all the through them if you look at a magnified picture. Very abnormal. My first machine had a black line across scans, and the next two (model 6180) have the poor quality scans issue. Upping the DPI and changing programs did not help.

Re-reading the work in its entirety, knowing that Coleman was guilty, is still an eye-opener. . . but this time in Tucker's errors of reasoning. The story is so well-crafted that we didn't notice, or chose to ignore, the signs that we were being led astray. Count me among the suckers, but now one can see Tucker's classic intellectual sins that accompany any time a political agenda clouds one's judgement of facts. First, denigrate or ignore the contrary evidence. Second, obsess on the supportive evidence, even if it's less reliable and relevant than the contrary evidence. Third, editorialize about the motives and competence of prosecutors, investigators, judges, and anyone else who disagrees. And so on reflection, notwithstanding Tucker's flair for storytelling, this is just another bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling mystery","review":"This case may have started deep in the western carner of Virginia, but by the time it ended Roger Coleman's case and name were widely known.

These essays are not for the easily daunted--they aren't the easiest of reads--but even if you don't completely understand everything he says they are still worthwhile for those interested in learning in depth about the depression (and trying to apply its lessons to today's mess).

But if one was to look at the conclusions in these essays one tends to think that the Great Depression could have beed avoided if it had not been for a badly flawed gold standard and sticky-wages. Bernanke illustrates that the countries that left the gold standard the earliest, like Britain, recovered the quicker. A definite read for any serious economist especially one who is trying to see parallels with the Great Depression and the events in the past years of the Great panic of 2007."},{"rating":"2","title":"essay review in two dimensions","review":"The text is an excellent collection of essays presenting Bernanke's views on what caused the Great Depression of 1929 and forward.Each essay makes a case for a particular perceived cause of the depression. The writer presents a perceived cause, eg. the gold standard ,in each essay and then offers reasons why he believes the cause was a real cause or no. The conclusion of each essay then states that the cause truly was a cause or no. The middle of each essay is an accumulation of mathematical and political substantiation to prove or refute the cause. The 'middles' of each essay are not particularly interesting and often are tedious, belonging more in a textbook than in a text for the public. Bernanke's vocabulary is loaded with technical phrases that adds to the tedium.However in summary I enjoyed the work and learned a great deal from it.It is not a text for the reader looking for something to read for fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important background","review":"Bernanke's essays are well known to economists, but difficult for the lay person.

Read Murray Rothbard's America's Great Depression2. Google \\"Benjamin Strong\\", the first Federal Reserve chairman who served until his death in 1928. Bernanke does not mention Strong at all.

What disappoints me is that only so few people on this planet will understand his most logical conclusions due to a lack of education and be able - as Wilson suggests - to come to their own terms with faith, science and nature. I admire his presentation of the scientific facts suggesting a unified natural principle without being righteous or requiring blind faith in anything. He achieves exactly what he wants - he makes you think!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling","review":"I don't understand why many of the reviewers here seem to think this is an \\"important\\" book. What is so important or revolutionary about the notion that science should be done in a multidisciplinary way, incorporating any methods or information that may be useful? Dr. Wilson is obviously a prodigious intellect. His apparent knowledge in so many diverse areas was at times breathtaking. His writing is very elegant. But still, I have to say even though I agree with much of what the author said I found the book to be curiously irritating. At times it felt like the doctor was sort of just showing off. Quite often he just seemed to be rambling on for the sake of impressing us with his knowledge of some obscure topic. Ok, we got it, scientists should think outside the box of their narrow specialty. That point could be made in about 10 pages, without an extended demonstration of the authors own ability to learn something about a lot of other specialties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wilson appears to take a \\"leap of faith\\" in Consilence.","review":"In speaking about the \\"Ionian Enchantment\\" Wilson feels that its central \\"tenet, as Einstein knew is the unification of knowledge. When we have unified enough certain knowledge, we will understand who we are and why we are here.\\" This sounds like consilence to me. Wilson has no scientific proof that this will happen. We have the age old debate I cannot prove scientifically that there is a God (I believe there is) and Wilson cannot prove scientifically that there is not a God. True he is talking about the Ionian enchantment but I think he should make more use of the conditional tense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy of Science or Religion of Science?","review":"I read the book without much grounding in the various branches of science that the author surveys sweepingly. I suspect that I would have enjoyed it less if I did have more grounding, because I might have assumed a more argumentative mind set, quibbling if the specifics are \\"truly\\" as the author asserted, instead of being impressed by the optimistic way that the author put forth his philosophy. The philosophy contained numerous tenets, the most accessable one being the convergence of the banches of science. I was especially uplifted by the hopefulness that this convergence would lead to a clearer view about the meaning of these pursuits. In the end, I thought that my enjoyment was not based on the sense of being persuaded by cogent arguments elegantly posed, but by the identification with an overwhelming optimism that science can shed illumination to the meaning and design of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valid Claim but Vain Attempt","review":"I bought this book unsuspiciously, and read it with the mind of a student who is very attached to this subject -- for I studied philosophy and art together with engineering and science. The style is elegant and might impress the virgin reader. But any person with a minimum level of awareness will read through the flaws and become very annoyed by the numerous inconsistencies. The references, albeit looking diverse and accurate, are also misused in most cases, because they are used as quick justifications. Mr. Wilson is not knowledgeable enough to publish such an ambitious project: 'uniting knowledge'. This book can only be recommended as an introduction to the subject -- it does cover a great deal of topics, and the scientific descriptions are more relevant than the historic and artistic ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I bought this book for a contemporary philosophy course at college, and found it very fascinating. Wilson uses science to explain a wide variety of human phenomenon. I read this book not only for class, but I found it so interesting that I read it for fun!It can be hard to get through if you don't have a strong science background. I study science for fun, so I had no difficulty. However, the less scientifically-inclined in the class had a tough time reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"first time i have seen my ancestral thoughts expressed !","review":"since it can be stipulated, initial conditions preceded the bigbang : subsequently the natural sciences followed first with physics (homogenous quarks, almost), chemical reactions of matter re-assembling quarks then biology duplicating / reproducing - the trinity follows with the solar explosion (hydrogen / helium) then the irridium meteorite accident with mammals evolving (human species) -"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring, breathtaking","review":"What a powerful piece of intellectual work. Wilson courageously unites sociology, biology, and physics under the evolutionary rubric. It's been done poorly in the past, so few intellectuals have dared retread this ground. When it's done this well, there's nothing to fear from seeing Darwin in all things."},{"rating":"1","title":"WILSON'S BOOK IS SILLY. THE SPIRIT OF JAH LIVES!","review":"Wilson is eloquent as ususal spinning out a complex web of thoughts pulled in from a plethora of sources all in support of his 'biology as god' thesis. But, in the final analisis, I find his book to be silly. He is the champion of an outmoded paradigm in its final death throws poviding convincing arguments only for those who find it convenient to believe that material science is the only source of knowledge and wisdom. The turth is humans are like little babys groping in the darkness or out ignorance. Shortly before his final departure from the Earth Buckminster Fuller made the following declaration: \\"We're on the threshold of the Omnichrist.\\" I wish Buky was here today to debate latter day scientific materialists like Wilson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tick-Toc, Tick-Toc, E. O. Wilson's a Crock","review":"Dr. Wilson admires the organization and efficiency of ant colonies. He admires them so much, he seems to think that humans will eventually come to their senses and live like them. This book was tedious reading, and I was bothered by the author's stylistic habit of straddling both sides of arguments without making a convincing case for one or the other.He parrots the popular, gloomy environmental cliches of rain forest destruction, global warming, and tragic extinctions, and to me, loses all credibility as an independent thinker. Perhaps Wilson has already made the transition to ant-logic and ant-thinking <g>."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe","review":"For a man with his obvious knowledge it is hard to believe what you see is what you get with the universe. It is quite obvious there is a Designer, yet wilson believes the designer was blind chance. It is also hard to believe most scientists share his belief and dismiss the notion of Creator. Are we to believe the eagle, Mozart and oak tree all came from the same source? By accident?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"Your reaction to this difficult read will depend on your starting point. If you are reasonably scientifically literate and fairly widely read, the concept of consilience will not be too surprising or novel. Scientists have been talking about unifying theories and basic laws in nature for a very long time. This book will probably add little to the overall understanding of the concept.The case for the argument is made tortuously, with many apparently pointless diversions and too few pointers to the underlying thesis. Basically, I found that the theme got lost in intellectual meandering. If you are not scientifically minded, it is unlikely that this book will bring you closer to the concept. Its language is unnecessarily convoluted and intimidatingly formal. A book written by a scientist for scientists. I look forward to a more succinct focussed publication on this topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the reader below....","review":"Just a note to the reviewer below... LAY OFF THE RHETORICAL QUESTIONS! Talk about muddling the issue...On a lighter note, I must say that I enjoyed the book. The skeptic in me was summoned when the definition of 'meme' was brought on, but one can't deny that Wilson writes science just as poetically as anyone in the field (and without being so poetic as to mislead... Gould anyone?). Readers of this book tend to heartily agree or find themselves strongly opposed - not many stroll along with indifference. Consilience raises some interesting and contorversial issues, many of which (I think) are quite significant. Well worth the read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive unification of knowledge","review":"If I had to recommend a book for someone wanting to be enlightened, I would definitely start with Edward O. Wilson's Consilience. It is a comprehensive collection of knowledge from different disciplines and sources of knowledge. Every adult should read this book every once in a while as a reminder of useful information that we have heard, read and even learned, but that we might have forgotten... I also would use this book as a source for references... It is easy to read, harmonically written to join all its chapters... I think that this book is a must in everyone's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Ed Wilson has written a disappointing book which desperately wants to make a case for science, but unfortunately ends up more an assault on religion and Biblical scholarship, which Wilson would probably consider an oxymoron. Why the assault on religion? Here's a tip for anyone wanting balanced scholarship without pretentions: read physicist Gerald Schroeder's much more plausible book, \\"The Science of God, or biologist Michael Behe's work, \\"Darwin's Black Box.\\" Wilson's point is this: it is by sheer luck that everything came together in the first place. Fine. But why write off, as either mysoginistic or intellectual idiots, those who think otherwise? Isn't concilience supposed to be a coming together? Moreover, Wilson's point is not all that well developed, and wanders here and there. I expected more, and got less, that's why I rate the book so poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfounded diatribe against a nameless enemy.","review":"Wilson is still living in the age of enlightenment, in a vast Euclidian world governed by Newton's dynamics.

Anyway, I did read this again when I was older and still didn't like it, not after later picking up other books along the way like The Flame And The Flower that wasn't even like that book. I have since shunned authors like Jennifer Wilde (actually a male author who since died) and Rosemary Rogers. I don't need that devastatingly demoralizing stuff in escapism.

Reading it in the political correct times of the post-90s, Derek is extremely racist and not a very nice guy. I loved Marietta, but didn't really understand what she saw in Derek. I loved her husband, Rawlins, who in my opinion was the real romantic hero of the story. He had a sense of humor, a dark side and wasn't boring.Jennifer Wilde tends to write about characters who have been around the block a time or two, a refreshing change from the run-of-the-mill recent romances these days with simpering virgins from the ton.

After the first seven minutes of the CD have passed (and I admit to liking those first few minutes), the rest of the CD becomes nothing more to me than a thumping aural assault. Miles has some very interesting ideas musically, but they get lost behind the relentless hammering and it's easy to lose interest after a while. Perhaps if the volume of the beat was toned down just a little, I could give it another star or perhaps two. I can highly recommend it to dance to, but casual listening is apparently not what's intended with this disc. In summary, great musical ideas overwhelmed by the thump."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome experience","review":"I'm usually into metal, rock, ect... but this album is killer.

I have to disagree with everyone, though, on one thing: In my opinion, the songs \\"Children\\" and \\"Fable\\" are the worst songs on this album. Both of them have potential, but \\"Children\\" is too repetitive (I realize trance is repetitive, but this song has very little variation in it at all) and the vocals in \\"Fable\\" make it cheesier than it need be (\\"Tell me a fable.

Of course, listening to the album 13 years later, one immediately feels the bland, aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality, which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in House-centric circles that is. The thudding, ever present, 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper, rendering most of the Yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal. Thankfully once in a while, particularly at the start and finish of the disc, a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions, allowing Dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN EXTREMELY GOOFY CD!!!!!","review":"This album is so wierd!!

But that doesn't mean that you can just throw the two together and make it worth something other than nice aural wallpaper.This EP works so well because there's enough substance behind the dreamy washes of minor key strings to keep you interested without breaking the mood. Repeated listenings (and the music just asks to be re-played) reveal the thought that's gone into the layers here.This is an excellent late night listen. I look forward to an album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep on playing it!","review":"After listening to the free download, I immediately purchased this as the sound is just what I am looking for, rough beats but mellow enough to relax to. This is ideal pre-club, post-club, dinner party, and car driving material. I hate the term chill-out, but this is something you would chill-out to.The sounds are something you would expect on the 'Cafe del Mar' or Hed Kandi 'Served Chilled' compilations, but these tracks don't become bland or uninteresting pieces of 'muzak' on repeated listens, for this very reason I highly recommend this.For something this fresh, it's a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction","review":"A well-written introductory book.

I loved the story of the sisters and will look forward to reading more of Adichie's novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"IMPRESSIVE ACCOUNT","review":"Fantastic book on RELATIONSHIPS during the Nigerian civil war. When we were kids my (Nigerian) father would tell us stories about the 60's in Nigeria as he was also a professor at Ibaden. However, as kids we were never really intrested in the past. When I read this book I WAS BLOWN AWAY at how a stranger (the author) had put into writing everything I had been told over the course of my childhood by my father. I felt like the author had substituted the names of the characters and had stolen my fathers stories. AMAZING.

However, this historical novel will fill you in on many aspects of what this country was about - I say \\"was\\" because Biafra existed for 3 years only, at the end of the 1960's, when the Igbo people attempted formed their own nation by seceeding from Nigeria. The solid story arc is held together by a 13 yr houseboy, who interacts with a cast of well drawn and sympathetic characters, making it a page turner till the very end"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome & Tedious","review":"This book is only nominally ok.

Can't wait to read another by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, Moving and Very Believable","review":"For both my wife and for me we found this a wonderful book. It tells the story of an extended family during the Biafran war. The story is full of life and love, not always easy, and a true portrayal of both life and war. It's the best book I've read over the past year -- since reading \\"Cutting for Stone.\\" I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book!","review":"This book pulls you into the lives of the characters immediately and you never fall away. The writing is gorgeous and tragic, poetic, as the author follows in the footsteps of beautiful, incredible African writers, yet she takes this tragic civil war and makes the story her own. I could not put the book down. After you read this, try 'A Grain of Wheat' by James Ngugi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I appreciate that this book has an afrocentric point of view and we're able to get a glimpse into the life of 1960 era Nigerians. Also, I appreciated some of the conversations that took place in the book. In particular, there was a convo about why Africans like to refer to themselves by Tribe rather than by nation. Chimamanda is also a great writer, I will give that to her. However, that's where my adoration ends.I gave this book 2 stars because it is simply boring. There wasn't much suspense or anxiety that spanned the entire 440 pages I read. Yeah I know its 546 pages. I gave the book ample time to get its s*it together but I just couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambitious novel, lacks focus","review":"I agree with Music Mom. It really drags - so much so, that I didn't notice the time switches as I plodded through it - and became utterly confused about the course of events. The time switches emphasise that the three \\"main\\" characters hardly change throughout the decade. Their circumstances alter but nothing really changes them psychologically. The time switches also emphasise that the novel really doesn't move forward at all. \\"Sweeping\\", \\"all encompassing\\", \\"ambitious\\" are adjectives I see employed to discuss the book. I agree, but add that it lacks a focus and a narrative thread to keep this reader interested. An interesting and worthy topic, but a novel in need of a good editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learning about Biafra","review":"The book is interesting and informative as a docu-fiction about the biafra-Nigerian war, from the Biafran point of view, a view the West knows little about. However the writing style lacks relief as it goes through the various events."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Having been a Peace Corps Vounteer in Nigeria from 1964 to 1966 (just before the Biafran War) and having spent time on the Nsukka campus and had an Igbo houseboy I found this book to be a very memory-stirring read. Written well and captures a lot of aspects of the beleaguered state, conflicts and possibilities of Nigeria in the promising years of African independence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bright Sun","review":"I have just finished reading Half of a Yellow Sun. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters were interesting and the writing was excellent. I became attached to the characters.

I continue to discuss this book and would love to see this story continued."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half of a Yellow Sun","review":"An absolutely amazing book. I never really understood anything about the Biafran war untill I read this book. The charactures were so easy to related to and so easy to love. I never wanted the book to end.

So sad and so brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pace","review":"what i appreciated most of all was the pace of the book. the slow decent into war and the evolution or destruction of the human soul and spirit. it's not a particularly happy book but it's a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared to face the harsh realities of the war in Biafra","review":"I was a college student during this time and had barely heard of Nigeria and knew nothing of Biafra. The pictures of dying children with distended bellies brought many of a dose of reality that came with the daily pictures from Vietnam. How we as a country let this suffering go on still amazes me. This book seemed far more like a first person account of the war than a novel. Read it only if you're prepared to be shocked and educated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcover Enthusiast","review":"It was a real pleasure rereading this book from my youth. I was forced to read it in school and was too young to appreciate its brilliance. The way Jack London tells the story of Call of the Wild from a Dogs perspective is mesmerizing.

So my ears are very picky. BUT THIS THING ROCKS!! for its price range, its unbelievable! It even pink noises itself. a feature only found on really high end models in the five digit price range. It lacks in the midlow to lows, so i wouldnt recomend it as a primary surround sound system to go with your 4 grand plasma. but if your looking for something cheap and simple to go with your xbox.......this is a gift from above. thanks pioneer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Sound System","review":"I purchased this sound system close to a year ago, and I must say the quality of sound is very good for the price.Over time I have noticed no decrease in sound quality. This system is very easy to setup, the wires and notches with the speakers are usually flimsy in home theater systems, with this product I was very pleased with the ease of installation. This is not the highest possible quality of sound, but very close, I personally cannot notice any sort of buzzing or vibrations that can be normally associated with cheap speakers. The subwoofer is rich and sturdy, not to mention easy to move. The speakers, even though small, are very durable and produce rich sound for there size. I use these (in addition to the 360) with my television and a/v equipment. As far as I can tell, it can support up to 4 components. I would reccomend this product to anyone looking for a good sound stystem, especially for there 360 as it comes with a sleek media remote compatibile with the system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 40 bucks I ever spent","review":"This product only cost me 40 bucks. It was a demo unit at the local BJ's and this system is unbelievable. It shakes my 3,000 square foot house and has enough bass to shake my three floor dorm building in college. This system is insane. The bass output is really good and the quality from the speakers is amazing. Purchased the unit almost 6 or 7 years ago and it is still running strong. I really do not have a con other than the fact that NEEDS MOAR BASS but I love the bass from my car. This produces enough to shake my entire house but as with any bass head, you can always use more."},{"rating":"2","title":"System still works wonderfully _ can u believe I got it for $99 bucks?!","review":"Several years ago, I bought this system on sale for $99 plus shipping as a temporary replacement to my dead onkyo receiver sound system. I bought solely on price and features and was not expecting much from it.Boy was I wrong! the sound quality is utterly amazing for the cost. I can't believe how cheap I got it for and i am still using it to this day to drive my entire home entertainment system.I think I got my money's worth and then some. My only complaint is the rather cheap feeling remote, but it is still working %100. the cover falls off now and then but it still snaps in place.features I like is the xbox media center integration and the remote lcd display is actually pretty useful but needed since the amp is intergrated with the sub woofer. The amp actually has a super quiet fan (thought the unit was fanless its so quiet) so be sure do not block vent at the bottom..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent system.","review":"I bought this 4 years ago.

Works just perfect with all my xbox 360 equipment (as you would expect). And I can hook my computer upto the system too and watch downloaded content with great sound. The different sound settings are great, especially the advance movie and music is great for the shape of your room. I have pushed this thing to it's max before and it was great. Better than being in a movie theater! for this price, it really can't be beat. I'm very impressed with it, and can't wait to hook a blu-ray player up to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"every 360 owner should own this product","review":"This system is great, especially for the price. I always wondered why people would invest in an expensive tv and gaming console, then sell themselves short on the audio. Now even budget minded gamers can enjoy rich 5.1 surround sound. The unit is a snap to install, complements the 360 aesthetically, and most importantly, sounds great. The remote is a nice bonus, as it controls the surround sound, 360, and my television.If you're making a dedicated media or gaming room, or setting up a gaming rig for your kids, this product is ideal."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"This products destroyed my boat cover.

Not a Skin Flick........","review":"Don't confuse this movie with the rest of the \\"Emanuelle\\" movies. The character in this movie is actually called \\"Sheena\\". There's a little full frontal nudity during the first 1/4 of the movie. No sexual scenes except for a quick blurp of a woman being raped before she jumps out of a window. If you're looking for an arousing skin flick equal to the other emanuelle movies, stay away from here. If you're looking for a cheeply dubbed foreign movie with a predictable plot... This one's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring waste of a beautiful woman","review":"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This film is acomplete waste. The transfer is bad, the film is all chopped up, thereis not much of a story line and there is very little erotic about thefilm.

My advice isdon't waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish trash","review":"This movie was a complete waste of my time.

So if you already have the entirety of season 1, don't buy this DVD. THe 2 stars are for the lack of labeling on the package. I am sending mine back since I already own all of season 1. I don't own season 2 and am not the type to worry about the whole BCI to Mill Creek thing that has been mentioned in other reviews of He Man and She Ra DVD's.

Duncan has an uncanny ability to immerse the reader in his world, so much so that I wish the characters were real. His characters are well developed, each believable in their struggles and good times. He writes with such compassion and authenticity, it's hard to believe that this is a work of fiction.His novel spans decades, but flows seamlessly. It is written with such feeling and honesty that this book can appeal to anyone. Everyone can find a character that they can connect to. I cannot recommend this book any more....other than to say that every time I read it I find something new that makes me love it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Converted to Baseball","review":"I was never a fan of baseball until I read David James Duncan's The Brothers K. However, this is a story that is not just about a sport, but an extraordinary family of four brothers, twin sisters, a 7th Day Adventist mother, and a father who had to forego his dream of pitching to provide for his family. What sets this novel apart aside from the wonderful characters, is the author's ability to weave a good yarn. Anyone familiar with John Irving's a Widow for One Year or The World According to Garp will adore this book. It charts the course of a family through a lifetime of ups and downs, pain and growth. Read it! It may be long, but every page is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliantly-written, moving account of an amazing family","review":"The Brothers K takes us into the Chance family and allows us to share their joys, their pain, and the uniqueness of each member's fascinating and distinctive personality. Through Kincaid's eyes we are privileged to know each brother, sister and parent, and revel in their astounding perceptions and wit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, complex and well written","review":"The Brothers K was my first Duncan book, and I was very pleasantly surprised. The book was a powerful, complex story of a family whose love wasn't always easy and wasn't without a great deal of complexity.I felt the book dragged a bit towards the middle, but the ending was well worth it, as I was crying my eyes out. An exceptional read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuss Words Abound","review":"My son picked this from a required reading list for his 9th grade English course.We quickly discovered hundreds of instances of all kinds of cuss words.If you want your son/daughter to put these words in his/her thoughts and mind, this is a great book for that. If you don't, buy something else.Book was quickly returned for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal","review":"What originally attracted me to this novel was a former high school classmate of mine stating that it was one of his favorite books. Being the curious individual I was, I went on Amazon and read many of the 5 star review the books receives. I ordered a copy and began to peruse. Unfortunately, the book was not just below my expectations, but I wondered why so many people appreciated a novel that was filled with two dimensional characters and overflowing with cliches that are static in almost every piece of pop culture that is set in 60's-70's nostaglia (family is divided on present political issues, one son becomes a hippy, one becomes a soldier, etc.). Clearly David Duncan had a message, but it is one that has been heard repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells a coming of age story like a boss","review":"I will say this is one of my favorite books I've read, and I didn't even like the ending much. Baseball, brothers, Jesus, war. That scene with his dad in the truck at the mill. I could read that chapter everyday til I die. I laughed and cried several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Modern American Novel","review":"Quite simply, The Brothers K is my favorite all-time read and David James Duncan my favorite all-time author. After devouring Duncan's first novel, The River Why, the story of fishing-obsessed Gus Orviston and his search for peace, I couldn't wait for his next offering. The Brothers K did not disappoint. It is a brilliant novel that intertwines the innate conflict of family with religion, baseball, politics and love. Duncan is a masterful storyteller with an unmatched wit, a steady hand for plot development and an understanding of the human spirit like no other. He has the ability to weave words like Steinbeck. And his characters literally leap off the page, burning their way into your psyche and soul. As an author, myself, I am humbled by his talent. But as a reader, I thirst for more. In fact, in response to the age-old question, 'If you were stranded on a desert island and could have only one book, what would it be?', my answer is simple -- The Brothers K.Salmon Run"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball Meets Theology","review":"What a wonderfully quick and fulfilling read. Enter into the life of the Chance family as they deal with the Vietnam War, used-up baseball player father, East Asian philosphy brother, and a prosletyzing mother.

The whole freakin book is like that. Oh my God... I never, ever returned anything before because it was not worth the hassle. However, this book... I tried and tried to appreciate it over a period of few days, but I just couldn't. It was such a waste of money. I was embarrassed to own it. So, I returned it, despite the hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great details a great guided how to guide","review":"Cycling accross country is something I plan on doing some day.

I heat my house with a wood burning stove, so I need to know about the different types of wood. What I really liked about the book was, it tells you what each tree weighs after it is seasoned. That way you know which trees give you more for your money. For instance, poplar weighs24 pounds per cubic ft. Hickory weighs 63 pounds per cubic ft. It also tells you how to decide which tree is which. The only thing I wish it had, would be a picture of what the heartwood and sapwood look like after being cut. It tells you what it looks like but it would be better to have a picture. It also tells you where each tree is usually found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard shoe","review":"the shoe was really hard and offered no support for arch. Hurt the top and bottom of my foot.

The haunting \\"Out of Mind\\" will someday get the recognition it deserves; inexplicably the song was never released. The entire first half of the album, tracks 1-7, are excellent.

Great poetry, the great vocals, their playing and arrangments... Haunting and desparing...it isn't an onslaught on your ears. Bridge is a great ballad...then Damaged, which is a hard, Queensryche like song...but then Lady Jane doesn't even sound like them at all, nor Disconnected...wow...then after I thought \\"I found the greatest treasue this closet could have,\\" I was assaulted by the low, hard, emotion-evoking title track. It deserves 5 stars all by itself.Queensryche might not be able to manage the commercial success of Empire again, but I also doubt they will match Promised Land's merit as plain good music.If you like hard rock and poetry, this is a masterpiece you simply must own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Big-Time Grower!","review":"This was my first Queensryche album, and I mainly got it for \\"I Am I\\", and \\"Bridge\\". as far as the rest of the album, I wasn't that pleased, but 6 1/2 months later, it grew on me.This is dark, thinking-man's progressive metal and I think these guys are unique. My favorites would be: \\"I Am I\\", with sarcastic lyrics. \\"Damaged\\", very deep lyrically. Great heavy music too. \\"Out Of Mind\\", very thoughtful, deals with the severely mentally ill. \\"Bridge\\", has very deep lyrics dealing with a son abandoned by his father. \\"Lady Jane\\", is very spooky. \\"My Global Mind\\", great tune mostly in Eb and F#. Geoff's vocals shine here with overdubs. \\"One More Time\\", sounds arguably the most Queensrychian on here. A mid tempo, heavy rocker with Geoff's multi-dimensional vocals. \\"Someone Else\\", is just piano and vocals.

They attached pretty easily, and they were comfortable for a little over 20 miles (that's as far as a rode, so they were comfortable the entire time). The bar moved once, which caused a little scare, but I think that was my fault in attaching the bar a little hastily. The foam pads give a little on the edges, so you have to learn to keep your elbows in tight, but other than that I was satisfied. Saved me money, and kept me comfortable on the ride.

Instead of playing with the plane she is running to us ever 30 seconds asking us to fix her plane.We assumed that this would be a high quality toy like Little Tikes normally produces.

It is as relevant today as it was when it was originally published. All the injustice and white liberal \\"benign\\" racism Lester describes has not been changed in the intervening 40 years. If anything, we have lived long enough to see any positive outcomes of the civil rights movement, whether achieved through peaceful or violent means, undone.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Black Nationalist Rantings","review":"I wanted to read this because I thought the title of the book was hilarious and I've always enjoyed reading black nationalist literature. The more radical and extreme the better. So I had high hopes for Look Out Whitey! He writes in a fairly entertaining ranting style, full of parody, satire and sarcasm but this was pretty mediocre as far as stuff like this goes. Overall a disappointment. Its also too dated to be relevant now and judging by a lot of what he wrote and the title he seemed like he wrote this book as a means to thumb his nose at white people more than for any kind of serious black nationalists. Besides who the hell is Julius Lester anyway? I've read my share of stuff by and about black radicals from the 60s and 70s but I have never heard of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"You guys honestly liked this?

Call me an uncultured swine, but I actually prefer my Firm Yoga DVD to this one. The strange snuffling \\"Breath of Fire\\" just doesn't do anything for me.I will admit, this is a very calming session.

Maybe I am still new to all the yoga fitness and will come to love it over time.... But doubtful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty ridiculous.","review":"I really, really do not understand why this video is so popular. The yoga/breathing portion is nice, (I have been doing yoga for six years), but the \\"dancing\\" was really more like flailing your arms around in circles. I enjoy many styles of dancing and just found this to be completely boring and uninspiring. The music was uninteresting and I found the many voice overs distracting, not relaxing. The meditation part reminded me of a sing along children's video.

It could be the greatest dvd in the world, and for many it surely is, but I just don't get the positives.HOWEVER, ana's Kundalini Yoga - A Journey through the Chakras is perfect for creating powerful energy flow. I follow with eyes closed and very much appreciate the experience and after effects. Beautifully chosen elements, simply presented create a very whole and complete class."},{"rating":"1","title":"I viewed, I laughed, I returned","review":"I got this DVD for my wife and myself, based on all the 5-star reviews. We wanted a dance exercise video to complement the others we have.

We couldn't really take it seriously. Obviously, they are very popular, so maybe I'm missing something...Nevertheless, I sent it back today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy","review":"The first half of the workout felt rather choppy and a lot of the exercises felt very uncomfortable to do with cold/stiff muscles.

I would have given it a one star because I doubt that I would ever use it again, but there were some parts that I thought weren't 1 star worthy. The beginning and the dances that she actually leads in this video were actually kind of enjoyable, but half of the video is 'free dancing'. I cant see doing this video everyday because there are so many other dvds out there that will offer a much more beneficial yoga experience. I do own another Ana/Ravi dvd that is okay even though Ana's nipples are clearly visible through the whole thing, but this dvd is more sexual than anything else. I'd do better going to a club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dig it!","review":"I bought this DVD based on other reviews that I had read. I am not a total yoga nut, but am partial to the overall benefits from the practice. I really enjoyed this DVD and look forward to doing it again TOMORROW! Though I am not into commiting the mantras and chants to memory, I did not find them distracting. This DVD is very low impact, however you get a great BURN and your heart rate gets going. It is fun and made me feel very free. I have small children and this was perfect for nap time, no jumping, stomping and the like. I would reccommend it to anyone that likes to look good and feel good, yet does not want to slave at the gym or get bored to death from watching the same home workout DVD for the 50th time. The only thing I did not like was that it seemed at the end to just drag on, but if you are into the mantras and closing prayer, then you may not expecience this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am recommending this to everyone","review":"Having become a big Ana & Ravi fan since I purchased their title: Kundalini Yoga for Beginners Beyond, I was anxious to try this one as well. My expectations were met and exceeded. This one begins with a speedy, efficient, and effective chakra yoga set. The 2nd half hour of this entails dance/movement segments which are both energizing and fun. I was a little self-conscious at first, but once I started the experience drew me in. The \\"buzz\\" I get from this is pretty powerful. I've gotten copies for a couple of women friends and my sister. I've tried other yoga DVD's but they've proven to be not what I was looking for. Lately when I get up I really look forward to doing this one or Beginners & Beyond. I am online now to purchase their Fat Free Yoga. I'm sure I'll wind up getting all of Ana & Ravi's DVD\\"s over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshingly different","review":"Dance the Chakras is one of three of Ravi & Ana's workouts I have purchased during the past month. The yoga workout at the beginning is great. The dance afterwards is like a fun, relaxing reward -- yet you're working at the same time. All of Ravi & Ana's workouts I have bought have been extremely easy to follow, but challenging at the same time. They have really helped me to cultivate a mental strength that I was lacking, which in turn, has helped with physical strength. The others I have are Fat Free Yoga and Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond (5 stars each)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"This is a wonderful DVD to combine mind, body and spirit. I used the begining yoga sequences to get my mind focused on the day at hand, then I danced the chakras and my body did get a workout. I used my heart rate monitor just to see if I was getting an aerobic workout and I did. I enjoyed the relaxation at the end. I would have preferred letting the heart rate calm down just a bit more before laying on the floor, but not worth a star...I just paused my DVD and calmed down a bit more on my own. Wonderful way to start the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll break a sweat!","review":"This was wonderful! I have almost all of their DVDs and this one is my favorite! I sweat more to this one than I do to the Fat Free Yoga DVD, so if you're looking to drop some weight this one works great!There isn't a lot of breaks between dances like there is in the other DVDs, but there is in the warmups.I highly recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Exciting!","review":"If you want something different than the typical yoga dvd, get this one. You don't need to be an experienced yoga practitioner yet, in 25 minutes, you will still get as good a workout as if you were. The dance moves (also about 25 minutes) are low impact, funky, and awesome and feel really great and organic in the body. Ana & Ravi tell you what to do and you can watch Ana who is the coolest thing to watch--the moves are easy to follow. Ravi & Ana give great instruction that can be applied to other workouts as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Workout & appreciate the great music!","review":"This is a great combo of a full 30 minute yoga work out and a low impact dance workout that is a whole lot of FUN! You will feel it in your legs, and arms and stomach and you will also experience a great hip opening and stretch! Ana & Ravi give great instruction for the dance moves and lets you know that learning the exact move is not as iimportant as to keep moving which is the point. You do African style moves for the first center, more sensous movement for the second, martial style kicks and arm thrusts for the 3rd (power Chakra) and then more gentle movements for the heart center. I felt I had never really experienced the joy of dance till I experienced moving with Ana in this program!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yoga video ever!","review":"I have always prefered pilates to yoga, but Dance the Chakras Yoga workout is the best work out video ever, it provides you with relaxation, mediation and a good work out. The best part of this video is that it has preset workouts 45 min, 2 30 min and a 20 min. I have done all of them and love them. I researched many before deciding on this one and I am so happy I did. Buy it you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what my soul needed","review":"I finally got the DVD and did it last night. To be honest, it was just what I needed. The meditation and workout before the Dance of the Chakras melted away all the stress I had been dealing with. It allowed me to focus my mind on myself. The inspirational narration at times is also encouraging. The Dance of the Chakras was amazing..After the video I felt my body and soul saying thank you. I highly recommend it...BY the way, as a beginner, like myself a couple of the poses were challenging, but definately worth working towards anyway.

It certainly seems that way.Can't praise him enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Al Green Compilation!","review":"Al Green is an amazing singer that went through life the hard way. Having his girlfriend brun him and then commit suicide in front of him you would think he couldn't bounce back from that but Belle was the album he made after that incident (or so I heard). Al Green's new cd's don't have the soul he had in his old ones, he doesn't sing like he use to, so if his new cd's soured your experience I suggest you change your mind and get this amazing cd. There is so much soul and emotion put into this album, there isn't a song here I don't like, literally, they all sound good! Many say when he made the album Belle he really lost it but it's not true. Although there was a song that I thought should have been on this cd called Truth and Time, it is a great song too! If you are a begginner get this album to learn what Al Green is all about! Oh and if you didn't know Al Green is a Pastor for a church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Solid","review":"I grew up on this music and it's still great to revisit. Al has a great, smooth voice and his songs are significant to the Memphis/Stax contribution in R&B. Great to listen to as background music or touching love songs. I recommend the Stax Collection as a companion piece of this period of 60/70s R&B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Live With It","review":"This wasn't the album that I ordered. But sending it back wasn't worth the cost. But,it's classic Al Green. If you have a great sound system in your car and or home theater you'd get the most from it. For those of us with factory installed equipment or old cd players at home, we don't get the best from it soundwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a soul fan but love this CD","review":"I'm a fan of rock, progressive rock, and pop-rock--not soul--but throughout my childhood and teen years I heard enough of Al Green's enchanting melodies, soulful vocals, catchy chord changes, and sweet string and horn arrangements that I thought a best-hits CD might be in order for when I'm in a mellow mood (or have a young lady over...). I was pleasantly surprised to find that this CD is not just mood music, but envigorating and entertaining in its own right. It contains a number of great songs that I've heard on the radio many times over the years, but I was most impressed with a song I'd never heard: \\"Let's Get Married,\\" which I've been happily replaying in my head for weeks now and I'm STILL not tired of it. Anyone who's even remotely an Al Green fan will love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE definitive collection.","review":"In my opinion, Al Green is the greatest R&B singer of all time, so I pleased when I heard about this album and went out and bought it. \\"Let's Stay Together\\", \\"Love and Happiness\\", and \\"I'm Still In Love With You\\" are all tracks that will never grow old. If you are tired of the direction R&B has been going of late, you must get this album. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al Green is the ultimatum of love song savvy","review":"The name Al Green didn't mean much to me until about 2 months ago. Let me say, he has the coolest sounding voice and music ever. From \\"Tired of being alone\\" to \\"L-O-V-E\\" Al Green is the perfect love-song artist. He has a unique range in his voice, he can high, but soft when high, and he has a deeper tone when he wants to get jiggy. Love and Happiness is perfect at any time for anyone. Lets stay together is perfect for girl/boyfriend or for the husband or wife. Let's get married is great of course.Marvin Gaye and Al Green would make an amazing duo.

No doubt has all R&B bedroom balladeers of today like Keith Sweat, Joe, and Avant taken a page from his book. Al Green revolutionized soul music with his smokey croon. The 70's was a great period for music, but Al Green was the one singer that is most special to me. I didn't grow up in the 70's but I definately know about it now and I'm so glad I took a look at all the greatness.I got a lot of favorites. The first Al Green song I experieced was \\"Let's Stay Together\\". Big trumpets, big voice, big sound. An absolute classic. The simple yet sophisicated \\"L-O-V-E (Love)\\" is another one of my favorites. I know every word now. And \\"I'm Still In Love With You\\" is gorgeous. I can't say what my favorite track is because I really do love them all.This album is a MUST. HAVE. Without a doubt. I don't care what type of music you are into most, but there is always a special occasion where a little Al Green can go a long way..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Damn!","review":"Old Al is just timeless. Brings back the happy memories of high school when this scared white girl was bused to Northside High. His music helped bridge that gap.

Al Green's vocals are amazing. He can make you high with his barely restrained voice and put you over the top with his incredible visceral screams. His vocal stylings are entirely appropriate for the gospel music he sings now, but we should all be glad that he chose different subject matter to sing about during his 70's peak. All the songs on this compilation are great, obviously, but the standout track in my opinion has got to be \\"I Can't Get Next to You.\\" The beat is slow and hard, and Al is both singing and talking the lyrics. This song never fails to be repeated on my CD player.I like Marvin Gaye, but I go with Al Green if I want to hear something more raw. Don't pass up a chance to hear or get this CD.

The pictures on the cover may look good, but after looking at them for a while you'll realize how unprofessional they look. And did I mention that they're mostly in colored pencil?

She demonstrates how to draw \\"anatomy\\" but fails to implement good Manga-style anatomy into her own demonstration images. While I can understand using the over-simplification of the style for young readers, it would be far better to start out learning the style from someone who offers a more accurate example of the art style.I think this book would be better titled \\"How NOT to draw Manga\\".

I wasn't so much into anime/manga, but I loved how easy the style was to copy. NO. Big mistake. Today at nearly 21 years old, I'm still trying to undo the bad habits this book taught me. Katy Coope's drawing style wasn't a style at all - rather, it was a series of errors caused by not studying the human body. Her more recent work still reflect many of these errors as well. I understand that she was in her mid-teens when she made the book so you can't really blame her, but whoever gave it the OK to be published was being extremely irresponsible.

It really tied together the ideas of art and storytelling for me.Although I have improved much over the years, I still have a certain fondness for this book, and looking over it again I have realized that I can still learn from it--whether it be what to do (or what NOT to do). I still find the line work an example (if maybe not the BEST of examples--still, an example) of where I need to head, and the fact that she wrote it at age sixteen astounds, overwhelms, and confuses me no end.Thank you Katy Coope!

It shows you how to draw over-simplified figures that can hardly be called \\"manga.\\" Well, it doesn't really \\"show you.\\" Coope hardly gives you four steps for drawing a face, and it's difficult to imitate unless you know what you're doing. I guess I can't criticize too much, since this book is obviously aimed towards the younger crowd, like I said in my title.Still, I don't recommend copying her style and attempting to create manga, because it actually doesn't look like the real thing, to be blunt. It's ridiculous. Each character has blush on top of their noses, and now that I brought up noses, the noses she draws are horribly small. Where is the collar bone on the neck? Even if you ignore the deformed facial features, how are you supposed to draw a side view of your manga characters Coope-style if the noses are so small?I could go on and on, but I think you get the point.

The book was overall well written and had a well developed plot. I would recommend this book to people, like myself, of faith. The Robe, being based on and around the time of Jesus' birth, life and death, provided me insight into what might have happened during this time period.

Douglas is a story of adventure and truth. This story follows Marcellus (a Roman tribune) on his quest to find the truth about this robe, these Christians and a man named Jesus. Tracing Jesus footsteps through Galilee and Cana and learning from the Christians in Athens and Rome, Marcellus finds more than he bargains for. He set out to find the truth and found a God he could finally believe in.This is an awesome story of faith and hope! If you like historical fiction, especially that set in Jesus' time, you have got to read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I read this book several years ago and even though I am not a Christian, I simply loved it.

I never really got attached to the characters and had a hard time with the incessant retelling of the stories of Jesus.

Also, there was a rather abrupt ending with many loose ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Intriguing Novel","review":"As soon as I read the description of the book, I knew I had to give this book a chance! From the first chapter, I was completely hooked and could not put the book down! Don't let it's length prevent you from reading it--once you get to the end, you'll be wishing it was longer.Mr. Douglas really did a superb job with this work of art. The characters were extremely well-created, and are just as interesting as the complex and fascinating storyline that they are woven into.I applaud Mr. Douglas for the long time he spent researching for this novel (thirty years). It is both historically and biblically accurate. I recommend this book to both Christians and non-Christians, and to anyone who is enthralled with the era of the Roman Empire.If you like this book and are a history buff, I also recommend PONTIUS PILATE, written by Paul L.

It wasn't that the robe had powers it was that those who held the robe knew that the man who had last owned it was a great and wonderful man, and that's what drove their subconcious to belive that it could heal, while it really was themselves that were healing theirselves because they believed in him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"I LOVED this book!

I feel that this is a good learning and teaching tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beutifully Written Story About Jesus.","review":"This is a fictionalized story, but it still tells a good tale of what might have been when Jesus died. The story is about a Roman soldier who had been one of the soldiers there when Jesus was crucified. He knew the man that they killed that day was innocent, and it haunted him for months. The story is quite historically accurate. Mr. Douglas had put a lot of research into this manuscript. Douglas manages to convey his ideas about Christ and the whole crucifixion and resurrection. It may not be the idea that everyone has, but it is one that he believed in passionately. He knew that the secret of Jesus was a secret of wonder and surprise and passionate mystery that can never be completely explained. I enjoyed the book. It is very well-researched and written, but I did find it hard going at times. I persevered though, and it was well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty history","review":"Douglas has two characters living in Rome in the reign of Tiberius: a \\"Prince Gaius\\" and Caligula, the future emperor. At first I was puzzled as to who this Gaius was, or why Douglas felt the need to introduce such a fictional character - - until I realized that he obviously wasn't aware that they are the same person! Caligula (\\"little boot\\") was Gaius's nickname. My impression is that Douglas read the main ancient sources, Tacitus's \\"Annals\\" and Suetonius's \\"Lives of the Caesars\\". Tacitus refers to Caligula as \\"Gaius\\" throughout, but the the part of his work dealing with his reign is lost. So Douglas apparently did not realize that the \\"Gaius\\" playing a crucial role in the last years of Tiberius's reign was the same person as the later emperor Caligula.Sorry, but if Douglas can't get right something as basic as *that*, then I really can't take seriously any of his claims of having conducted a serious historical research.From this point of view, the movie is actually much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered in March, still waiting for it in May","review":"I have never had a problem with anything before when purchasing a product from Amazon.

I saw \\"Mary Poppins\\" in 1964, and bought its Original Soundtrack Album on Vista Records (a subsidiary of Disney). That album's score was not taken directly from the movie soundtrack (as this \\"restored\\" CD release is). Instead, bits of music and dialogue were included in the LP to make for better segues; the \\"Overture\\" ends in an entirely different fashion; the biggest damage was done to \\"Supercali...\\" where the musical intro has been omitted as well as the comical dialogue in the middle of the song. The sound engineers have stripped out all the charm and warmth of the original Soundtrack version, and yet they call it a \\"Restored\\" or \\"Remastered\\" version. This is why I continue to play the vinyl version (transferred to CD). And frankly, there is no reason to include all 8 minutes of \\"Step In Time.\\" If you want all 8 minutes, just watch the DVD -- like every other song, that's where they lifted the music for this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic disc of lovely music...","review":"An excellent classic to be added to your library - good songs, with the incomparable Julie Andrews to add quality to this recording!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"All the songs on this album are splendid and worth singing over and over again.

It even came sealed and was not damaged in any way.But if you are looking for a CD of the original LP, you will have to look further if this bothers you as much as it bothers me: in the cut \\"Fidelity Fiduciary Bank\\", the two lines starting with \\"While stand the banks of England\\" are missing. Instead, on the CD (not just the MP3 file, but on the CD itself) you get a few moments of silence.Of course, you may not care about this.Another point: the volume of the CD/MP3 files is /much lower/ than usual. This is a \\"digitally remastered\\" recording, which may or may not be related to the low volume level. The low volume level, of course, may or may not matter to you.

I liked it enough to purchase and will remain indefinitely in my growing library collection. The bulky size of this book belies its concise and clear nature, which is a boon for any student attempting to wade through the more dense, wordy literature of some other books on the Philosophy of Art. As the blurb on the rear of the book states, it contains 52 chapters written by leading international scholars which cover pretty much all aspects of aesthetics.Structurally, the book's layout makes it easy to locate pertinent information quickly. The chapters are divided into sections which discuss the history, theory, issues and challenges of aesthetic theory; and then looks at the individual arts such as film, photography, dance, theater and music (to name a few.

However, the Kindle edition of this book ends at chapter 46. Is this because it's only the first edition? Or is it because the Kindled edition simply does not include those chapters?

This book is easily readable by a young adolescent. The tone is direct and upbeat as it deals with a lot of difficult topics like staying safe and gender inequity.I like Dee's approach - she calls things like they are but doesn't leave the reader feeling hopeless. She includes workable strategies and empowers girls to try them or not. She teaches them how to say No! with substance. The book also includes relevant cartoons, writings from girls and from famous women.For any parent who's read Mary Pipher's \\"Reviving Ophelia\\", and become scared, this is the book to hand your daughter now.

It is a great album. Then I got So Much for the Afterglow, which strongly disappointed me. It seems Everclear was loosing their edge. This album is what Everclear should sound like. The bass lines on this album are much better then on it's two later counterparts. The vocals of Scott Cuthburt as opposed to Craig Montoya are more seldom used, but are more convincing. A.P. Alexakis wrote some very different songs, from the quick, hard songs, like Sparkle and Trust Fund, to slower deep songs, like Loser Makes Good. He also hit somewhere between there with the most popular song on this album, Fire Maple Song. The guitars sound overamped and Art's voice is a little muffled, but you have to remember that they produced this album with $400. Everclear overcame this to make their least known or appreciated album, but best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough raw energy, but lacking technical skills...","review":"While possesing the smart lyrics and talented vocals necessary for a good CD, this CD seems to lack the disipline used in their other CD's, Sparkle and Fade and So Much for the Afterglow. In this CD, Everclear proves their talent well. The emotions just burn through your speakers. Although I highly reccomend this CD, I belive you should buy Sparkle and Fade or So Much for the Afterglow to get a true idea of Everclear's obvious talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened?","review":"How did Art Alexakis, frontman of Colorfinger, one of the greatest alternative punk bands in the world, go on to form a band that was even heavier, and then turn them into MTV fodder? This is an album that can stand with Soundgarden's \\"Ultramega OK\\" and Mudhoney's debut. Art's vocals are angry and tourtured by the tribulations that were happening to him at the time, not by the memories of those tribulations like the \\"Learning How to Smile\\" album. If you enjoy \\"Heroin Girl,\\" \\"When It All Goes Wrong Again,\\" \\"Twistinside\\" (a Colorfinger song by the way) or old proto-grunge like Mudhoney or older Nirvana, absolutely check this out.

It is not just a book about an incredible horse, but of his teacher as well as the mindset of our race and the history being made during that time period.

This is a fascinating read. What makes it more than a great animal story is the way it is told within the historical context of the time. There were so many interesting facts and descriptions detailing the period from before, during, and after the Civil War, Reconstruction, and into the early 20th century. The subject matter is extremely fresh, told in an easy manner that makes it fast and easy to read and yet memorable and thought provoking. The subtitle of the soft cover is slightly different from the hard cover -- soft says, the Lost History of the World's Smartest Horse; hard says, the Lost History of a Horse and a Man Who Changed the World.

I had some knowledge of the Reliance, and of Captain Nat, but never really gave the boat much thought other than to wonder at its immense sail plan and dimensions. I bought the book, and have been unable to put it down until it was finished.Christopher Pastore has done a magnificent job of researching this subject, and has woven the historic context and the stories of all of the people involved into a wonderful, entertaining story, full of drama, humour, and spellbinding descriptions of the parallel design and building of the vessels on two different continents, the drama and historical context behind the main players, and the actual races leading up to and including the Cup Defense.Thoroughly entertaining, and factual, Temple to the Wind is a gem, and will definitely not disappoint anyone who reads it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and informative read","review":"Mr. Pastore writes with a style that both informs and draws you in. The race sequences play out with drama and tension.

Although the well-worn premise is general enough that it might've gone in any number of gorehound-satisfying ways (college students prepare an annual charity Halloween spook house in an empty warehouse), all is squandered as the crudely-drawn characters wander here and there, tripping over every cliché they can find while avoiding any sort of satisfying payoff the audience so richly deserves. The pacing seems off, with nothing really horrific happening for eons, and when it does, it's sometimes so poorly-lit and badly-shot, the viewer must rely on character exposition to figure out what happened. HALLOW'S END shows nary a shred of artistry in the writing, directing, or acting; the best thing it has going for it is a cool, marketable title that is utterly wasted on an undeserving disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"this blows","review":"oh my god, does anyone else think that stephen cloud himself wrote all the reviews on this site... i mean did anyone watch the movie..it blewwww! personally, when i watch a movie, even a good one, i dont tell someone about the actors in it, i tell them about the plot. oh but i guess this would be hard to do for this movie because there IS NO PLOT! or if htere was a plot, i dont htink anyone could stand to watch to the movie long enough to find out what it is! once again,it BLOWS! this is by far the most boring movie i have ever watched..sorry to break it to ya if you did wroite those reviews, ahem steven!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just horrible","review":"i've watched low budget movies before but this was just simply terrible. you keep expecting it to get better but before that happens, it ends.

That said, when I chose to watch a new (2003) horror movie, I never expected to see a film that was trying so hard to copy the \\"cheesy 80's horror\\" genre. Some things just cannot be copied and still maintain entertainment value. This film wasn't funny or exciting on any level, at least to me. The actors were dull, and the story was not developed well. The displays of nudity seemed to be placed in hopes of attracting hormonal teens. Oh, and there were no subtitles, which is a 'must' in our household. For people looking for a truely entertaining cheesy horror flick, I suggest \\"Dolls\\" and those looking for a good modern horror should keep looking. Just my opinion, as always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen Cloud is great, the movie is not!","review":"Yes I agree with a lot of you that Stephen Cloud is a great actor. He's obviously trained and tries his best to keep this film together, but the film is awful. There is not one good thing about it besides Cloud. The direction needs directing, the plot needs one, and the film flops.

I especially like the tick sheet at the back of the book, so that you can tick off each jiggy, cheato page or other item that you have got in each of the worlds.

There's lots of silly art doubletalk, some asskicking of foolish people by the skins, and lots of sex. Not erotic or even pulp sex, but rather a parody of pulp sex. Everyone seems to want it--from frustrated social workers, to young schoolgirls, to the fat skinhead--and Home uses the same words to describe each act, sometimes duplicating the entire passage.

Let me first say the caliber of the authors chosen cannot be understated (Kaiser, the Feinbergs, Waltke, Robinson, Chamblin, Saucy etc.), so you can have confidence that you are getting the good stuff from the best people in the field. As someone who was a dispensationalist, I found myself strengthened in my position, but I'll admit some of the Covenantal arguments are very, very good and I have grown to appreciate them more. It is nice to see fellow Christians, able to disagree so amicably.

Never in my life have I ever heard something so terrible. This album is not a tribute or salute. It is an insult to The Beatles and anyone who has ever heard these songs before.

I am truly shocked and amazed that something as aweful as this could exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific album","review":"I am really suprised that no one has reviewed this album before me. It is a wonderful tribute album featuring some of the best loved country artists. Each artist has added their own special touch to their chosen song, sometimes sticking close to the original, and at other times veering off a bit. But however performed each song is performed wonderfully. My favourite has to be \\"Come Together\\" by Delbert McClinton, who turns the song into a rough-and-tumble roadhouse shuffle, with a biting harp solo. Willie Nelson's take on \\"One after 909\\" is also a favourite. Nelson translates it as a moving shuffle, a churning road song. This is an album that any country fan and Beatles fan should own. The 28 page booklet contains photos of each artist, the lyrics and a couple of essays. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"US country covers of Beatles songs that works brilliantly","review":"The concept of different music styles being applied to another e.g. Dylan songs having had both spiritual choirs and reggae tribute CDs, is one of those gambles that when it works can be brilliant. This is one of those succesful cases taking the great Beatles songbook and having a range of different country and western (not all of them well known to me) apply a range of interpretations.The great aspect for me is that the approach in each is so fresh (notably \\"We can work it out\\" with a mock string quartet intro by Phil Keaggy & PFR) or just as enjoyable as the original (\\"I'll follow the sun\\" by David Ball and \\"All my loving\\" by Suzy Bogguss & Chet Atkins especially impressing). Inevitably there are a few bummers - I fear I cannot take Tanya Tucker's \\"gargling with gravel\\" earthy voice very often and certainly not on \\"Something\\" but overall the quality is so good I would put this CD up there as one of the best Beatles tribute I have heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time","review":"I have been waiting a long time for this to come out in DVD!

It also hones negotiating skills. We have not played a Rio Grande game that we don't like. They are very well designed to be different every time you play.

To use the Mac & iTunes one needs to download music in mp3 format (tunes bought from iTunes CANNOT be converted). Then open the hard disk, open iTunes, & find the music library. Plug the phone in using the USB port and then just drag and drop songs or albums into the phone's mp3 file (seen when you open the memory stick for the phone).

It came with everything I needed (Memory card, Memory card adapter, USB cable, and Software). I had a slight problem installing the software, but this was due to my own stupidity. I finally installed the software and it has worked flawlessly since. I know get to listen to great music and I never miss a phone call because the music just stops when a call comes in. Of course, this is for a different review at a later time. I would recommend purchasing the Fun Pack. It's a one stop shop if you are in the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the...?

After the first hundred or so pages and the team is reinserted into the new regiment, the book goes slightly south with random interludes of Gaunt running around being a Commissar/Detective, solving battlefield mysteries. The description of the new characters is also weak, after a while, you basically realize if a semi-major new character isn't described very well he's probably gonna die. The book takes a upward turn when the scout team stumbles upon a warp portal which leads to the final epic battle. It finishes strong with Abnett's solid battlefield depictions.

Using the secret word as a reference is not good as they often repeated the word in different shows. The contestant names is good but who can remember all those names?What is needed is a Grouchophile that can catalog the episodes of YBYL in chronological order and number them. Then collections could use the episode numbers for reference when listing content. Unfortunately this would require access to the Library of Congress and UCLA collections of the films from the show and/or NBC archives.

The boys hit their peak with a wailing \\"If You Need Me\\" and especially with an A+ performance of \\"Under the Boardwalk\\". From one who loves the Drifters, that is the highest praise.

My only criticism of this album is that its sound isn't very polished.

So if Ian Thomas will read this, why not release a live CD of the in Germany broadcasted radio concert \\"SWR lifetime - The Boomers live in Frankfurt- Batschkapp\\" and as bonus for all real fans and collectors of this fantastic Boomers music/songs a release of the one hour TV concert from Germany's \\"SWR 3 - Ohne Filter Extra\\" TV-concert on top ???

The first, purchased about five months ago, lost sound on the right side about two months ago. The second, which was purchased immediately afterwards, lost sound on the left side less than an hour ago.Were it not for the repeated failures, this headset would get four stars from me.UPDATE: It's been about eight months since I wrote this review, and the replacement I received from Amazon for the second dead headset has now lost sound on its right side. Stay away from this headset!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These Stink!!!","review":"I am on my second time around with these headsets.

So far they have \\"just worked\\" with both windows XP/Vista and my Mac OSX machines. The sound quality is decent for games and general voice communication. Sound effects are good and crisp, bass sounds bassy (but not incredibly so) and I've had them on my head for spans as long as four hours and didn't suffer any listening fatigue or discomfort. Light and soft without being flimsy. I even listen to music on occasion, but they aren't exactly a $400 pair of Sennheisers, but they don't claim to be either. The volume control/mute switch on the cable is nice and works well.Everything just works, and is still working. I'd definitely buy another pair if these died at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great...for a year","review":"Well, it was a great buy for the first year. After that it started loosing sound in the right ear. I figured I could live with that. Now it looses sound in both ears on and off. I go from sound to nothing to one ear all the time.

Buy a better headset and don't spend the money twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for World of Warcraft!","review":"I bought two of these headsets, one for myself and one for a friend, after reading some nightmare reviews about comfort and quality in other brands. So far we have used them every night for 2 weeks and they have been perfect. We play World of Warcraft together using the Teamspeak program and they are comfortable and do exactly what I needed them to. The sound quality is fine and the mics are pretty good too not to mention I can wear them for hours on end and not have any problems with my ears getting sore. The mic is adjustable if you are worried about the darth vader effect. Might not be as high quality as some other brands out there but for 20 bucks they definitely get the job done.

Those expecting audiophile recording quality, better take a pass. However, for those of us who like The Butterfield Blues band, this recording contains some great performances. Mike's solo on Born in Chicago is one of his best - thw whole band is really cooking. Paul shines through all the cuts, with some of his best harp and vocals. Both Bishop and Naftalin have some very tasty solos scattered throughout the disk. The fact is that the recording is rough, but it is very listenable for those who are interested (I have heard worse). If this is your introduction to the Butterfield Band, chose another disk!!!!!!!!

That Claudia struggled with her love of being a professional illustrator at a time in history when \\"proper ladies\\" were discouraged from such endeavor, that she struggled with accepting and loving her own chubby body (well-covered with many layers of clothing), that she struggled with seeing--well, perhaps NOT to see?--the reality of the kind of father she had, even as she struggled to realize and accept the real love of a man who wanted her entirely as she is, combine to make a wonderful coming-of-age-in-love story with a plot that kept this reader turning the pages!A lovely debut novel for author Robyn DeHart. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reads!","review":"I enjoyed this story very much. The author did a great job with the content of the story and the characters.

Claudia is so caught up in her own poor body image that it made me want to just stop reading. I found her to be weak and mostly annoying. as bad - but I just couldn't find a reason for him to fall in love with Claudia. The father was just an oddly written character- capable of blackmail, nurder and not caring a fig for his daughter - then all of a sudden depressed and drunk.

If you're looking for the Hugh Jackman character, you may be disappointed, but as himself Wolverine shines in this. Having never read any X-men comics in colour, I can't pass judgement on the difference between this black and white version and the originals. (I think I was three when these came out the first time).A good mix of back-story, short adventures and multiple issue plots, with character development woven throughout.It was a little frustrating when Wolverine was obliged to remain undercover, but made worth it when he outed himself.Definitely going to order the next volume when I get the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Older One better","review":"I got the is for my Mom after she'd had another mug by Enecso Children of the Inner Life.

I loved those tracks so much thatshe got me the CD for her first present. I playbed that do death. Almost all the tracks have a good beat and gets me moving.. It has remamined one my favorite CD's to this day. If you like any of the Smithereens material , you will like this CD. Interestingly the songs that are not theirs are in my opinion the worst of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"very few tricks, great magic","review":"I first got into the Smithereens when \\" A Girl Like You\\" first came out. I have seen them in concert in the early 90's and I really dig the fact that what you hear on CD is what you hear in concert. I feel that one of the traits of a good band is the ability to get your feet moving and the air guitar going as soon as you hear them. Pat Dinizio is definitely an underrated songwriter because he can take an emotion and darken or lighten it as needed to make you feel what he's feeling. This CD is one of the better anthologies out there and it makes you want to check out the rest of their catalog. If you do that, you find that they get better musically and lyrically each time. I highly recommend this one and look forward to more Smithereens in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Pop Rock Platter","review":"The Smithereens had a consistent pattern to their recording career, a few top notch singles on each album that were surrounded with pleasent filler material. The band was a guitar oriented college rock staple during the R.E.M.-dominated late 1980's and could write great pop songs with the best of them. Collecting all those ace singles onto one disc makes for a very strong album. Starting with the title track of their first EP, the album procees chronilogically through each of their studio albums, allotting three or four songs from each. The best are \\"Blood and Roses\\" from their first album, \\"Only a Memory\\" from their second, \\"Yesterday Girl\\" from their third and \\"Too Much Passion\\" from their fourth, but truly there is not a bad song in the mix.Overall, a strong collection from an often overlooked band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Compilation!!!!","review":"As a Smithereens fan I have most of their albums but this one covers all of their outstanding hits. My personal favorites are \\"Behind the Wall of Sleep\\" and \\"Blood and Roses\\" but they all are great.The only thing better than listening to the CD is to see them in concert. If you get the chance see them, the put on a great show. I have been to several of their concerts here in Tampa and the show is non stop energy. I have seen R.E.M., U2 and many others and The Smithereens blow them away! Get the CD, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect replacement for the original MM875 mower blade","review":"This is the exact match for the original blade that comes on the MM875 mower. Although it's hard to tell in the picture, it has the little curved ends just like the original blade. It's easy to install, and even comes with instructions although it's pretty obvious how to change it even without them. I had hit a rock and really messed up my original blade, so changing it out for this replacement blade made the mower cut just like it was new again.Replacement blades for these mowers can be hard to find. The store where I bought the mower didn't have the blade, so I was glad to find it here on Amazon. I later discovered it at one of the big box home improvement stores, but it's just as easy to get it here and have it delivered to your door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT fit all CMM1200 lawn mowers","review":"The description of this blade says that it fits \\"CMM1200\\" lawn mowers.

This blade will ONLY fit types 1 and 2.If you have a \\"Type 3\\" version of the lawn mower, this blade will not fit - the hole is too small to fit over the screw. Instead you need to buy the \\"MB-1200\\" blade, also available on amazon.I'm not sure how you can tell the difference between the types, but you should probably do some research to find out which type you have before ordering the wrong blade.I'm one-starring this based on the misleading description, not the quality of the product itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well finished","review":"As has been stated in an earlier review, this blade, despite the photo, is a mulching blade virtually identical in shape to the original blade on my Black & Decker CMM-1000 mower (with a round, not diamond-shaped shaft hole and blade ends curved below the main shaft). However, the finish is pretty rough - it almost seems as if it was a refurbished blade, though I don't think it is (not completely sure, though!). Most disappointing is the fact that it was unbalanced worse than my original blade (which is why I was trying to find a new one). It had two bright grind marks where it looks as if the attempt was made to balance it, but it wasn't by a long shot. Fortunately I had figured out how to balance the original one (balancing it by laying it across a round screwdriver shaft, instead of putting the screwdriver through the shaft hole), so I'm still using the original, and the replacement is waiting for a balance job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exact Fit","review":"In the land of riding lawnmowers, this was impossible to find locally. I had originally dismissed this for my 19\\" cordless electric mower (CMM1200 - now four years old) hence the vain local search. The actual blade length is closer to 18\\". A true 19\\" blade is too long. The width is 1 3/4\\" with a hole a hair larger than 7/8\\". This is an exact fit. Got it in a timely manner installed in less than 1 minute.

Also, if you don't angle it properly, the balls will not come out.The secondly,this machine is listed to be good for all ages; it's not. When we set up the machine we found that it pitched too low for the average 9 yr old. When we placed it on a table it worked a little better but the overall machine was still very unstable.

My two cents: if poor recording technology interferes with your enjoyment of music, don't bother, but if it doesn't, and you love electric blues jams, E-WL may trigger multiple climaxes in your ears (can I say that?) Too bad nobody made a professional live recording of the PBBB with Bloomfield, but Elektra had problems getting them down right in the studio, so may not have tried.

Sent that one back and the third one didn't catch on fire, but I did detect that unmistakable odor of burning plastic. So finally I sent it back for a full refund. I am currently using a different charger from the same company (the MH C-9000) and it works wonderfully. It simply appears that the MH-C808M charger is not one of Maha's better models.

There's no way I'd leave this thing unattended for the hours that reconditioning cycles require. I just tried a soft reconditioning of some AA batteries, and the unit keeps getting frozen in the discharge phase. I've let it sit overnight with no change. Even when I remove the batteries, the display stays frozen until I unplug the unit.I have always loaded the batteries with the correct polarity, in the correct order (highest capacity > lowest capacity), and always on a hard countertop with plenty of air circulation.I just got a MH-C9000 from the same manufacturer, and so far it's working great.

Nothing to pin point, as the ones that overheat are the same brands and ones that work fine. Not an age issue as it has occurred with newer batteries too.4. Caution, if you do not seat the battery ALL the way. The unit has the potential to overheat as some of the plastic on our unit melted.***All in all, I am left not trusting the device.

Lewis is probably the best flyer-pilot I have read; he avoids the automated style of some military authors, and provides the reader with an easy-to-read, smooth-flowing narrative. Lewis' eloquent narration not only puts one in the cockpit, but also into his heart. And there one finds a young man who discovers his love and wonder for life amidst the clouds. Lewis' detailed accounts of aircraft, tactics and wartime activities are invaluable to the history of military aviation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of Limited General Interest","review":"This memoir of a British WWI pilot is pretty uneven and likely only to be enjoyed by those with a particular interest in military aviation history or WWI. Lewis' narrative is fine when he describes his enlistment, training, and adventures as a pilot both over France and in home defense. Whenever he attempts to describe life outside these areas--his minor romantic entanglements, the big \\"drunks\\" the officers would have, and his views on life and human nature--the writing is very weak and ordinary. This is especially true in the latter portion of the book, which recounts his postwar activities in China. He does a good job, however, of conveying the sketchiness of those early days of flying around in wood and cloth machines with little more than a compass to guide one. A more entertaining WWI flying saga is the fictional The Emperor's Coloured Coat, the second in John Biggins' Otto Prohaska quartet and its followup, The Two-Headed Eagle."},{"rating":"2","title":"an amazing adventure well told","review":"while not exactly great literature, lewis, in a self-effacing, matter-of-fact manner describes his experiences in the great war, and his efforts to teach flying to the chinese. a mixture of philosophy, humor, horror and history, what really comes through is his love of life and flying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always go for the best","review":"The snuggle fleece is very good.

I highly recommend this sweet smelling \\"cotton candy\\" like scent to you and the price point for the product is very reasonable. Only one downside to me. I can't smell it on myself anymore so everyone else gets the benefit and I don't even know that I am still using Pink Sugar."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this product!","review":"I purchased this product two separate times from QVC, but they don't always carry it.

This fragrance is deliciously sweet, very light, and sure to please anyone who smells it on you! Most importantly, my boyfriend loves it too! The scent is a mix of vanilla, cupcakes, cotton candy, hint of citrus...and more! I highly recommend this if you like sweet candy scents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrumptious!","review":"The scent is so wonderful I have received more compliments wearing this scent more than any other.

It arrived quickly, but is a tester. The description did not say it was a tester. I would not have purchased if the description would have mentioned it was a tester.

Was very disappointed I didn't receive the authentic fragrence and have to go through all the trouble to return it then re-order the true product.....hopefully...."},{"rating":"1","title":"parabens!","review":"You should be aware that this product contains five forms of parabens.

I know the difference because I have bought the real perfume before and I was hoping to get a better deal. The packaging looks very much the same but on the bottle it does not say \\"aqualina\\" like the real stuff anf it does not smell nearly as good as the real stuff.

I get a lot of compliments when I wear this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite scent right now","review":"Obviously fragrance is a very personal matter. Because we all have our own personal body chemistry, one fragrance can smell quite different on various people. For that reason, I am not going to urge you to buy Pink Sugar. I can only say that I love this fragrance! I first smelled it at a Sephora store some time ago and I could not get the scent out of my mind. I finally bought some and I love it so much I am now on my second bottle. I pretty much wear it daily. I find it hard to categorize. When you first put it on it does smell like a mix of cotton candy and vanilla, but as the day goes on the smell deepens. It is actually a very complex scent and it is really hard to describe.I absolutely adore this fragrance - but will you? The best thing to do is to go to a Sephora or Ulta store and try it. Obviously lots of people love Pink Sugar and maybe you will as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE!!!","review":"My english is not perfect, but I have the urge to write this small review. When I received the Aquolina, it was very clear that it was no original-the box was similar but without aquolina sign. The smell was also different and it's clearly a fake. I am very dissapointed, because I live in Serbia and it is complicated for me to return it, and also because I completely lost my trust to this way of purchasing things."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovelly flirty scent","review":"I like the fruity flirty scent of Aquolina's Pink Sugar perfume. The hair perfume is a wonderful addition to the collection. People have commented on the scent as I breeze past them and I have noticed the scent lingers on into the next day before I wash it out of my hair. The formula is light weight and not at all greasy or oily. My hair is very fine with loose waves and is susceptible to the weight of most hair products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Sugar EDT Spray","review":"Wonderful scent. Smells different on different people. Reached my house in 10 days. Very affordable compared to other perfumes out there. I love the sugar and candy notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh MY SWEET HAIR I love this!","review":"Pink Sugar is a lovely sweet, cotton Candy, vanilla, soft, fluffy cloud of a scent. The packaging is VERY cute and the product line is so extensive! I especially love the Perfume however the Deodorant is REALLY nice as well. The hair perfume was a MUST try and I was NOT disappointed. This is a wonderful way to wear Pink Sugar! It also has ingredients to help with shine without adding greasiness. I love spraying this in my hair even when I am not wearing my Pink Sugar Perfume. *I also own the body soufflé and the body lotion. Would love to try the body oil! If you love Pink Sugar you NEED this product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this hair parfume and so does everyone i know","review":"this hair perfume leaves your hair smelling fresh and clean. everyone who i hug wants to know what im wearing. me and my sisters love this product. if you dont like sweet vanilla with a hint cotton candy this wont be the scent for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the original \\"Aquolina\\" Pink Sugar!","review":"I ordered this item from Amazon under the impression that I was purchasing \\"Aquolina\\" Pink Sugar and the item that came to me was just \\"Pink Sugar\\". If it was not a week befor Christmas I would have returned it. But being that it is a gift, I have to keep it and hope it is of the same quality. I am quite upset that Amazon would do such a thing and carry a \\"knock off\\" product and advertise it as an original. Their \\"out\\" is that they claim the packaging may be different, but, in actuality, it is not the same product. So disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cotton Candy in a bottle","review":"My daughter loves this stuff. I love the smell too. The bottle is pretty and it lasts a long time. I prefer the smell of CLEAN which is a freshly showered smell more geared toward an adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT A FAKE","review":"I ordered this product from Amazon, and like many others thought it was fake because of the lack of branding on the packaging. I did some research and found out that Aquolina has removed the company name from this product. The bottles are now being branded solely as \\"Pink Sugar\\" and no longer as \\"Aquolina Pink Sugar\\" So if you think you have a fake, you absolutely don't. Amazon is selling a legit product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for sweetening too flowery or musky fragrances..","review":"I layered Pink Sugar and Lush's Karma perfume, which it heavy on bergomot and patchouli, it really brought the sweetness down. Real cotton candy scent on it's own. I love it but it seems nearly embarrassing to wear on its own at my age. I think mixing may be the only way to go with this one but it has a place in my fragrance wardrobe, like a rhinestone clip or bright scarf."},{"rating":"2","title":"SMELLS AMAZING!","review":"This is one of my favorite perfumes and I get sooooo many compliments on it!

This is sweet, but not like the fruity gunk little girls spray on themselves. It is more cookie than candy or bubble gum.If you have owned Pink Sugar before, you will not be disappointed. We got it on amazon from \\"Beauty Storage\\" and I was a little hesitant to order online, as a few of the reviews I read indicated that that this was a fake. The item we received sure seemed correct product and not a knock off.First, it smells the same as the last traces we had in another bottle. The bottle has changed, but is the same as what is shown on the manufacturer's website. It arrived right on schedule, came in the standard packaging, and was in fine condition. That plus it was cheaper than what we'd pay Retail, I could not be happier with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusually Great Deal","review":"Both my wife and my daughter loves the smell of Aquolina Pink Sugar Perfume. During the Xmas season, it was selling for just under a hundred dollars for this size.

They were completely happy with this after Xmas present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Sugar by Aquolina","review":"I really wanted this fragrance for years. I have a big parfume collection so I was always putting my purchase away. But recently I decided to get it for myself for birthday. This perfume smell delicious and fresh at the same time, it is warm and inviting. When I wearing it, it makes me happy. It is a compliment gather. Men love this perfume. Vanilla, musk and bergamot give this perfume a special notes. It has great staying power for EDT. It is special as no other perfumes smell the same. Price is great for the amount and quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best scent ever; but decent enough to still wear.","review":"I purchased this fragrance from Sephora's website because I needed something more playful and youthful than my other scents. When it arrived and I sprayed it, I was a little disappointed that the perfume smells EXACTLY like the Cotton Candy Fantasy spray that one could purchase at Rite Aid for $5. I am aware that this is supposed to smell like the treat; however, I thought that Aquolina would personalize this scent a little more. Perhaps a hint of cotton candy surrounded by notes of vanilla would have done the trick. Nonetheless, I still enjoy wearing this to casual events, as it is appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Powdery","review":"I was expecting sweet and yummy. This is very powdery and overwhelming. I only sprayed it twice and 5 hours later it is still way too strong for me. It could just be my personal taste, but I just don't like it. Lessoned learned, fragrances are too personal to order online for the first time before smelling them. I am returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Bad Product","review":"Do not buy - Smells like cotton candy for 3 seconds and then becomes putrid. You think you are saving money but you are really losing in the long run. Again - do not buy!**UPDATE** Apparently, the company that produces this fragrance has decided to remove their logo from the bottles and the outer case [....] The new bottle I ordered from Sephora's website looked exactly the same as the knock off from Amazon. The real one smells 100X's better. I've learned that somethings are too good to be true. If you're going to pamper yourself - or someone else- do it the right way and splurge by purchasing from a company that sells the real thing. (This same size cost $22 on Sephora's website)"},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE","review":"I think this is fake. There isn't the brand name aquolina anywhere on the package.

I used almost a whole bottle! Then I bought another one and switched up my pefume for a while.

The perfume was shipped very quickly and for only $1. I have long hair, so it took more than just a few sprays, but the scent lasts all day. It wasn't greasy, but I still avoided spraying it near my roots just in case. It left a subtle shine and helped get some tangles out. I will definitely purchase this again when I run out! It's very Cotton Candy, and also reminded me of Jessica Simpson's Desert Treats scent called Candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Satisfied!","review":"Wow the product was exactly what I wanted and it was an excellent price and buy for the other prices I have seen. Thank you so much! God Bless you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"I received a tester. I was giving it as a gift and there was no lid. I would have liked to receive a complete bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are tester bottles","review":"I was unaware that they are selling tester bottles until my order arrived. Nowhere on the product info does it say this. I ordered it as a gift for my sister and now I will feel like a cheap person if I give this to her. With shipping, this price was only a couple dollars cheaper than the other sellers on Amazon who include a cap with their bottles, as well as the cute pink and white striped cylinder it comes in. This product does not include either of those things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Sugar 3.4oz by Aquolina","review":"The exact same thing happen to me its a tester. The color is a bit yellow and it smells different. I am not happy with this at all. =( I sent an email to the company and here is what they wrote me:The ad details under item condition actually does say it is a tester. The photo also shows a tester. No cap, no retail packaging.When I chose to buy from this company I had no idea that showing no cap and no retail packaging meant it was a tester. I have looked enough times since I recevied this email and still can not locate the ad detail that states its a tester. Not to mention the bottle say (Tester Not for Resale!) I will say since I did email the company they said I could send the item back for a full refund and buy the correct item for more money. I think not! But thanks anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the true Aquolina","review":"Same on this product it's not the true Aquolina brand it doesnt have the name on the bottle and it wears off in an hour the real one last all day. Also the bottle leaks from the top it drips all over the place soo much wasted product there is more on my vanity than myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Sugar","review":"I love love love this scent. I first went through a 1 oz bottle, wanted more, then bought the 3.4 oz size. I still really love the fragrance, but it lasts all of 20 seconds. I literally can spray my entire room, all my bedding and pillows, my clothes and head, spray some into my air conditioner, heater, whatever, then walk away, and come back into my room a minute later and not smell it at all. I feel like maybe the smaller size bottle was more potent, but I could just be imagining it. If they could create a longer-lasting perfume version I would be hooked for life. p.s. the bottle is very pretty..the shiny pink swirly is nice and I like that it's a simple shape and isnt covered in big cheesy flowers or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells amazing.","review":"This stuff smells amazing.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome value","review":"This is one of the best fragrances I have ever smelled, buying it for my wife. I usually have an allergic reaction to most perfumes due to the floral scent, however this perfume smells like, well, candy! I love to smell it on her, and the scent generally lasts all day long. It is an awesome size for the price....Great value!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mature fragrance that says fun!","review":"I originally sampled this fragrance in Sephora a few months ago and liked it, yet didn't purchase it. I was surprised to see such a great price on Amazon, so I couldn't resist. I still like it very much, as it's sweet, but not juvenile. It's a great everyday fragrance, light, fun and I think will be particularly nice in the summer (people have asked if it's some sort of a vanilla fragrance). As a rule, I like fragrances that are clean and sophisticated. This is a light, clean fragrance, yet fun rather than sophisticated and a nice change. Thanks for the great offer and an opportunity to try it. I have received numerous compliments and will be back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet girly scent with surprising sophistication","review":"I recently purchased this perfume for a friend. When I sampled it in the store, I thought that Pink Sugar had a sweet, girly scent somewhat reminiscent of cotton candy, and it seemed like a perfect match for my pink-loving friend. Throughout the day, however, I continued to notice the fragrance, which I had sampled on my own wrist. Over time, the sweet component of the scent faded somewhat, leaving behind warmer, fuller notes that had both a vanilla and a musky quality. Although I'm not usually a fan of overly sweet scents, this dry-down was extremely appealing, and in the end, I felt that this was a fragrance I would wear myself.Still, I do think the appeal of this perfume is limited to those who prefer scents that are a bit more on the \\"girly\\" or feminine side. However, if you have dismissed Pink Sugar as being too sweet for you, you might want to give it a try and see if you like the way this fragrance transforms over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a warm, sexy sweet scent.","review":"Rich, sweet scent that smells like caramel and warm vanilla. This is not one of those cheap teen perfumes that fades away quickly. This fragrance lasts and a little goes a long way. I can't wear the strong floral, heavy musky perfumes simply because they give me headaches, so Pink Sugar saved me from that. So glad I've finally found my signature scent. Thank you Aquolina!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes you smell like vanilla sugar.","review":"Which is a very good thing as far as I am concerned.This is one of my favorite perfumes! I ordered it after reading some online reviews, (and this time, I actually put some effort into trying to find it locally.) There was no place in town that carried it, and I was told I'd probably have to drive at least 2 hours to get it... so I ordered in on Amazon. It was a very good price, the shipping was reasonable, and I got it very fast.The packaging is not super extraordinary, but I don't really 'buy the perfume for the bottle'.The scent is amazing, there is really nothing else out there quite like it. It is like pure concentrated SUGAR. It really doesn't get any sweeter than this, and yet, it is not overpowering, and it lasts for hours and hours.My husband does not like many perfumes, but this one he does. He says it makes me smell like cotton candy. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the same packaging","review":"I wanted the package with the pepper on it like shown in the picture.

First off, as I suspected, it is \\"sonic\\" meaning audible- not ultra-sonic meaning super high pitch that only the animals can hear. This was to stop two cats from climbing my Christmas tree btw. It does go off when they climb it- but all it does is bother me with an annoying tone. The cats don't even notice it. One is very skiddish and the ultra-sonic remote trainers make her jump and run, and at least gets the others attention- so they are manageable animals. I also have to shut it off at bedtime, because all it does is wake me up, and not deter the cats. This product is just a complete fail- if they had an ultra-sonic version- it would probably be great- effective on the animal, and not bother me every time it goes off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tattle Tale Alarm","review":"I bought two of them, one for my daughters counter-surfing Great Dane and one for my leg lifters. It worked well to keep the Dane from stealing food because he hits the counter with his front and causes the vibration to set off the alarm.

We have a home built in 2010 and it is has a basement. The home is well built. We've never noticed vibration on the ground floor, but apparently the Tattle Tale definitely notices it.

The noise is fairly loud and managed to scare me a couple of times, but she was less than impressed by it. She would put her paws on the gate and set off the alarm; however, the noise would only make her cock her head in interest (while keeping her paws on the gate). I believe it entirely depends on the personality of the dog. She is not highly strung, so she doesn't scare easily.

I can tell because the next morning I'll find cat hair near the scene of the crime. You'll want to either move or turn off the units when using whatever furniture you've placed them on because otherwise they will just keeping beeping at you everytime you move near them. ;) Just remember to put them back!We're having a new couch delivered this week and hoping to use the tattle tale on there as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"My cats ignored it after the first buzzer","review":"Trying to return this item, waiting for the seller to give me instructions.

But it doesn't work very well - it is TOO sensitive on the ultra-sensitive setting. Couldn't take a step in the house without setting it off. But on the less sensitive setting, it sometimes worked, sometimes didn't. As a result, within a few days, our cats were completely immune to it. Once I heard it go off and looked around, only to find that my cat was actually laying on it! Didn't faze him a bit! So, I cannot recommend.

I had bought this thinking it was the vibrating unit due to the description. I was going to go away for Christmas and wanted something to monitor our cat when he got too close to the Christmas tree. When the unit arrived, I checked the Amazon website again and then noticed there are two different units. I never picked up on it when I ordered. Bottom line, the description for the regular sonic unit is wrong and needs to be corrected. You are not able to adjust the vibration unit and leave it unattended.

It only takes 2 minutes to rewind a spool, so even when I do run out in the middle of a job, I just look at it as a 2-minute break from yard work. Of course, if your one and only concern is convenience, you may be looking at the right product. Be aware, if you've had trouble with rewinding trimmers in the past, it may be because you're using old line, which tends to get brittle over time. Buy some new line and try again. If you buy the three-pack of spools three times, you just paid for your trimmer again.Thanks for reading,Adamps.

Jensen discusses several artists whose careers were shadowed or distorted by husbands, some of whom were themselves artists or collectors. She also treats extensively the history of a Native American basket maker's struggles with market forces, traditional cultural artmaking and art-using practices, discrimination, and family forces. Covering late pioneer days through the rise of Hollywood and spanning painting, photography, literature, dance, and crafts, the book surprised me with its concise and compelling portrayals of many societies and art worlds. Jensen communicates immediate and personal interpretations of the \\"lifeways\\" of silenced and near silenced women artists, as well as some who succeeded--at their great cost--in finding a voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not completely uncensored","review":"Watched this DVD set, and typical VIACOM only the curse words used are uncensored, all other aspects of the show remain censored.

The Medjugorje apparition is not approved by the Church and has been denounced by some of the highest members of the Church, including Father Malachi Martin, Father Fiore, Cardinal Ratzinger, and many others. \\"I don't know what's coming out of Medjugorje, but its definitely NOT Our Lady.\\" -- Father John O'Conner. Medjugorje is deceptively promoting socialism (the dangerous political system of Karl Marx that has killed more people than any other in recorded history, by far.) This book is entirely too flattering to Medjugorje, and it doesn't bother to refute the seemingly endless amount of anti-Catholic \\"messages\\" coming from the apparition. For those who know their Catechism, this book will probably repulse you. For those who are lost, this book will lead you further down the garden path."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"I have never written an on-line review before but I feel compelled to write in regards to this novel of J. G. Hayes. I primarily read gay themed novels and found this to be one of the best written with excellent character development and descriptions of time and place that put you right there in South Boston. Further, I was totally brought into the story. The approach that Hayes used in presenting the main characters was unique in this wonderful tale of love. It was a refreshing and uplifting read and so different from the usual themes of lust that seem to dominate gay novels these days. That's not to say this novel doesn't have passion--it overboils with it. Anyway, I would highly recommend this novel, especially to straight friends and relatives of gay people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful book. I got it when it first came out, waited to read it until I would have time to enjoy fully, loved it, and then passed it on to a friend, who loved it and passed it on to another friend and so on until a few years later I finally have my copy back (well-worn!) and look forward to a chance to reread it myself. Check out J.G. Hayes' other books too... the story \\"Regular Flattop\\" in This Thing Called Courage is one of my absolute favorites. Tender, caring, sad, beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't always believe the high star ratings on a book","review":"I had read the previous reviews believing their praises & thought that this would be a nice book for inspiration for my own art. If I had been able to see more pictures from this books BEFORE I bought it, I don't think that I would have bought it. There are too many blurred and/or DARK images that you can't even tell what they are & what's with the skinned frogs positioned like they are having carnal knowledge?! 2 pages were wasted on the poor frogs! Nude frogs?! Also what's with the 3 nude Barbies? I thought this was supposed to be a book on human nudes. Whatever! There were some nice artsy images but I am put off by the women trying to pull their nipples off (even my husband thought that was weird).

My biggest problem with the book was that the text was VERY hard to read because there was no punctuation! It's amazing what commas can do, and I finally gave up trying to read and reread passages that had no punctuation except a period now and then.

Son gives a strong performance in spite of his age (he toured for just five more years) on songs such as Death Letter, and John The Revelator. Four blues and four spirituals. That tells me that he loved God as much as he loved the blues.And I am still fascinated listening to the spoken parts of this when Son starts to preaching. Revealing as a documentary of what is behind his music - the inner struggle to understand the human heart. Here we catch a glimpse of the conscience of a man who tried to live a life of integrity, and faith. He tells it like it is.There are more complete albums of Son House's material so this is not the one to start with. It is the one to complete your collection. Essential for anyone who wants to understand something of the roots of American music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 28th Ingredient is Missing","review":"I ordered this book before I knew that it was a Eugenia Potter mystery, based on the characters created by Virginia Rich.

If you want to read a nice romance between Eugenia and a former college sweetheart, then this book is for you. If you want a challenging mystery, look somewhere else.

Every time it appeared that the story might begin at last, the author would stop to throw in a meaningless recipe (yawn) or food description. Then I would think, NOW she is going to get on with it, and there would be pages of extraneous background information on characters, geology, or something else that stopped the book cold.

We have a situation that is prevalent in an area of the UK that has produced many artistic prodigies, but none as simple and unassuming as Ms. Dunbar. The differences among the 3 daughters are well defined, and I can't imagine how their bleak existence could be more powerfully displayed.Not pleasant, but definitely worth a look.

Then that same person reads everyones made up answers along with the correct answer and you have to guess which is made up and which is the correct.

Many of the original voices are back; they join together to tell a fun, new story that focuses on what Timon and Pumbaa were doing while the action of the first film was taking place. For those of us who know the first Lion King quite well, this movie is all the more enjoyable, as the pieces fall into place, and we see how the two fit together.

If you are an adult who enjoyed the first Lion King movie, and so want to watch the second, you might be disappointed.

Disney again hits a new low by regurgitaing one of its own \\"classics\\" to boost its DVD sales for the quarter, only this time it hypes a self-parody of \\"The Lion King\\" and diminishes it into a rolling mess of potty humor and weak plotlines. The premise, if there is one, is the retelling of the original story from the viewpoint of Timon and Pumbaa. It fails miserably. The continuity of the \\"story\\" is forceably broken at times by freezing the film and showing the silhouettes of Timon and Pumbaa in a movie theater (ala \\"Mystery Science Theater\\"), fighting over the remote control, picking noses, flipping mucous, and generally whining obnoxiously over who had the best scene. My own five-year-old daughter lost interest twenty minutes into the movie, calling it \\"stupid\\". Don't waste your money on this over-priced mess.

The original Lion King is still the best but this one is very good. Lion King 1 1/2 is a little more upbeat and less violent than the original. It also has some catchy songs, too. Another good thing about the movie is it has almost all of the original voice talent. If you liked the original Lion King and were disapointed with Lion King 2, you should watch Lion King 1 1/2.

You know that awesome moment were Scar reveals his plans to kill his brother and take over the kingdom? Well why not shove Timon and Pumba in the far corner have them do a river dance gag.

Furthermore, the plot is so hot it makes my blood clot into a big knot. So I recommend this to both kids and adults.Cons: I didn't see Steve Buscemi or Nicolas Cage in this movie, so I guess its safe to assume that the cons do not exist. Yes, yes, the rumors are false, Timon & Pumbaa DO NOT get thrown in prison.Once again, I recommend this to both adults and children, but the animal savagery could be a little to hardcore for peeps over 89."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Horrid.","review":"May I add they just should have made a 3rd edition with Kiara and Kovu's cub and not this crap?

What the hell happened? Then they all ran back through the desert to the pridelands. What's going on there? The meerkats were only afraid of Hyena's, but Mufasa made sure that they were never in the Pridelands. Among other things wrong with this movie.Only thing good about the movie was kawaii little Simba.And the more disturbing thing was Timon and Pumbaa kissed.

It's an irreverent romp through the Lion King universe as seen through the eyes of Timon and Pumbaa. I can't tell you how many times I had to pause the DVD so that my son and I could regain our composure after laughing so hard. The new songs are cute and stand up against some of the other songs in the Disney oeuvre.Some critics have lamented at the flatulence jokes when there were none in the original film.

I would have to say probably half the movie was copied from the original, or built around it in a way that is probably reflected well in the title. I give it 2 stars and not one, because in the 50% or so that is original, there are a handful of funny lines by Timba.It's not really a sequel or a prequel, nor does it add too much to the whole story. Bottom line, it goes into why Timon and Pumba were on their own prior to meeting Simba, and then it goes into a little more into their life together as a trio of buddies without any worries in life.

Both his self titled debut and his sophomore effort 'Repeat Offneder' featured mainly guitar/rock oriented songs. He has slowly moved away from those roots and leaned towards a more funky, progressive, and less guitar-ladened sound. This new record epitomizes his evolution (not that this is an entirely good thing). Songs like 'My Confession,' 'You Never Take Me Dancing,' and 'Eternity' most vividly illustrate his new predispositions. These influences are clearly reflected in the real jewels on the record: 'Fools Game,' 'Can't Lie To My Heart,' and especially 'Touch of Heaven.' I recommend this record to enhance a certain mood of the listener; that is, if you are looking to relax, buy the CD. I do, however, yearn for the return of his old-style of music, i.e. 'Nothin You Can Do About It,' 'Should've Known Better,' and even 'One More Try.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Advertising","review":"Do not be fooled by deceptive advertising.

A former Cannon user my interest was in finding more detailed information about Nikon autoexposure modes, metering system(s), lens options, flash's etc. Instead I got a history of Nikon products, starting with the coal burning models, interspersed with the personal opinions of the author. This guy probably sleeps with his F-5. The book is for Nikon geeks, or people who frequently buy and sell Nikon equipment, or people who have the Nikon version of Trivial Pursuit, not for people who want to know how to use their Nikon equipment. Inspite of the reviews I also ordered the Magic Lantern Guide for the F-100. This book was panned in most reviews, but I found it to be much more on the mark for my purposes.

As bad as the old one had gotten, it was far better than the new one.

The flex tube is prone to fouling as debris gets caught in kinks as you move about. Also the bag-end of the tube tends to clog up quickly as soon as your garbage can fills, so you have to keep a constant eye on that end of the tube. Once the tube gets clogged on the bag end, debris fills the tube and it becomes seriously impacted. At this point you have to stop operations and unclog the tube. If you've been at this for a while you start to wonder why the vacuum doesn't work as effectively as it should. I wound up unclogging the tube around 5 or 6 times before I gave up on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use, particularly in cold weather","review":"The B&D; vacuum extension is not very effective. The primary issues are:1. The hose is too short to allow the flexibility of moving around without constantly moving the leaf collection container.2. The hose needs some sort of clamp to hold it in place on top of the flexible container cover. It tends to pull out of the cover and blow leaves in unintended paces.3. The hose is fairly stiff in cold weather (32 degrees). This aggravates the problems listed in 1 and 2 above.

They changed the tube construction completely using a rubbery/plastic instead of the tough oil cloth used in my original system. During it's first use I had to wrap duct tape around four separate locations where the rubbery/plastic tube ripped open holes.

Not only does he show how madness, being an everyday thing in Renaissance times, becomes a serious problem to society, but also shows the birth of psychology and the asylum. Where the asylum originates (Foucault traces it back to the many texts endorsing confinement, rehabilitation, treatment) to the point of its emergence. His historical traces also serve a purpose of exposing psychology and psychiatry, their origins and moments of emergence. Foucault also introduces the idea of \`discourse' in this text, which later forms a major part in his thought. He ends with his thoughts on madness..a mediator between art and civilization.\\"..[B]y madness which interrupts it, a work of art opens a void, a moment of silence, a question without answer, provokes a breach without reconciliation..\\"An excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defining madness is a subjective thing...","review":"When I first saw the book's title, I imagined it would be a book about psychiatric hospitals and many psychopaths' stories.I was wrong.It is much more than just that.Madness and civilization, is a book that explores the history of mental illness and how it was defined since the 16th century.The book takes to through history and reveals a story not known to most.How the first considered crazy people were thieves and homeless people, then leapers, and slowly it became what it is today.Though very interesting, the book is also a bit hard too read. it is a book that gives a lot of knowledge, but not a lot of plot.

Threads on the inside began unraveling on the first use. The zipper is low quality. The major defect was that the bag ripped open around one of the reinforced areas where the bag handle is sewn to the bag. The bag was then useless - and made a heck of a mess, blowing debris on me when it blew. I had only filled the bag a few times when it blew, and it was kept relatively clean, so air could pass through the bag reasonably well. There should be a recall on these bags because not having a good quality bag makes the vacuum feature worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problems as others and more...","review":"Luckily the zipper on the bag is intact, but the plastic attachment is worthless. I have ducttaped it for the time being, but the \\"pins\\" inside the attachment will soon break. For the number of times you remove the bag, this should be the sturdiest part. The machine is a decent blower, but the screw holding the blower sections together vibrates loose and gets lost.My B&D; rechargeable trimmer now hums but the blades don't move.

Fottrell's writing sucks you in and propells you along--into the bright lights, and sometimes seediness, of showbusiness. This is a story where Hollywood's biggest star Miranda Lane gets involved in a scandal that might ruin her career. The writing keeps you reading, and, unawares, you are suddenly someplace completely different--inside a story of social significance--reading stuff that shouldn't be forgotten. It's a wonderful read. One that is tough to put down. It's a story that taught me a few things, about life, and about myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Designed Product!","review":"While the shape and size of this product is nice, the on-off knob and battery conduit is very poorly designed.

The diameter is good and if you experience pain with larger sizes, this one is for you. It has strong vibration. The problem is that the end to turn it on is also the end where the batteries go.

I needed something to help my son keep his room neat and tidy and I thought that this would help. It helped for about a minute. The concept of this unit is grand; however, it is not holding up to the demands of what it claims it can hold. I have a 19 inch TV, a VCR, GameCube, Nintendo 64, 10 VHS tapes and a few gamecube games and the unit is leaning to the side. The drawers are not closing like they should. I don't like the idea of having to drill nails straight through the plastic shelves in order to connect them to the sides of the unit. The plastic is the only thing that is sturdy, but, what good does that do you when the assembled unit is weak when it is holding the very things it was meant to hold. I have to return this to the store. It is just not worth the money I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"bad product","review":"This item is not worth the money.

Everything was so dirty from the box I had to wash everything before putting it together. Second, it isn't that sturdy. The sides wobble a whole lot and the shelfs also wobble and I followed the directions exaclty. I even used extra screws I had to try to make it more sturdy. Third it doesn't hold nearly all the tapes it says it will. If my son didn't like it so much and the company I purchased it from wouldn't charge a restocking fee I would send it back. The video center is a great idea and looks great in photos but after getting it, it still needs alot of work. I wouldn't waiste my money on this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"I was very dissatisfied with this item. First, the plastic parts are very bulky and gaudy.

The best part of it is that my grandson loves it! It has taken him away for his video games for a while. The makers of these puppets have done a great job.

I also bought the firefighter one, since those are the two jobs my boyfriend does. Well, Lamar immediately told us that the construction worker was \\"Bob the Builder\\". He made every grownup that came over play with his puppets. They look exactly like the Muppets. The stick is held on by velcro and can be used in the puppets right or left hand. The body of the puppet goes all the way up to an adult's elbow, and the mouth is easy for small hands to work. He absolutely LOVED them. I am thinking about getting the basketball player also. I also enjoyed playing with them with him. The quality is very good, no small pieces. The clothes can be removed, but the hats stay on. I got two puppets for only twenty dollars. They are more than worth the money. Just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granddaughter loves it.","review":"My 2.4 yr old granddaughter loves it.

In one, the protagonist spends a sweltering day in a stifling waiting room, hoping to get a job. What ensues is unforgettable. Later, in a second scene, the protagonist meets a young woman and talks with her about their future prospects while strolling atop a high-rise building in downtown Calcutta. In a vivid display of calculated mise en scene technique, Ray blocks his two subjects against a backdrop of thousands of Calcuttans, swarming in a park a dozen stories beneath them. With this empathetic visual metaphor, Ray captures the dilemma of India in the 1960s -- a country of great human assets but overwhelmed resources and infrastructure. This film provides great insight into the fascination and frustration of life in India during this era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not Play on Some Standard DVD Players","review":"BE WARNED: This DVD will not play on my standard Sony DVD player even though Amazon describes it as \\"Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only.)\\" The reason is that it is in PAL format.

The author conveys his points in a logical, easy to understand fashion. I've read many books on the subject, only to be discouraged by the use of fancy buzz words, techniques and personal agendas. This book omits such frivolous silliness, and only gives the reader what is needed to understand the subject matter. The section on situational awareness is particularly compelling.

I was totally wrong.When you hear his best songs in a \\"greatest hits\\" compilation, it is obvious that Squire is a great songwriter and capable of writing very catchy pop songs (with a faux edgy sheen placed onto them). He's a singles artist that, when you hear all the singles put together, you notice that the guy's got alot of great hit songs. His music is similar to Def Leppard's where he takes ultra catchy, syrupy harmonies, and then \\"rocks\\" them outSometimes a greatest hits compilation places an artist in a proper context where, when all the good songs are lined up, you just gotta respect the material (like with \\"Eddie Money\\")Although it took some work, Billy, you have converted me and I like your hits...even \\"the stroke\\".

But it's been crafted in a bubble of cluelessness, an unapologetic time capsule that might be forgivable if it were actually of the era or showed the slightest awareness that it borders on parody.

Rudolf Nureyev and Ghislaine Thesmar are excellent - their dancing is superb. Rudi obviously had a great time dancing this role, and there is a lot of difficult dancing - a lot of very different steps and combinations. He was nearly 44 years old, yet danced as if he were 10 years younger. His acting, artistry, and musicality are fantastic. Great music; great costumes. There are a lot of far-away camera shots; I assume because so many dancers are usually on stage. The choreographer, Pierre Lacotte, shares special, warm memories of creating this ballet with Rudolf.

That's not to say they hit a bulls-eye,though. Their ambitions are higher than their success rate. They attempt to skewer the artistic mindset and the psychiatric profession but the humor in part is too manic to truly succeed. That said there are enough laughs here to give the film a qualified recommendation. Sean Connery is inspired as the poet disguised as a brawling, boozing, womanizing, blue-collar guy. Or is it vice versa? Joanne Woodward is Connery's match as his supportive long-suffering wife. There are any number of amusing setpieces here: Connery dressing down the ladies' auxiliary, Connery's confrontation's with the process server(John Fiedler, \\"Mr. Peterson\\" from the old \\"Bob Newhart\\" show), Connery playing the psychiatrist recordings of an unfaithful wife to her unsuspecting husband.

These other films have a balance that allows more adults to enjoy them as well as the intended target of younger teenagers. \\"JTMD\\" appeals more to that teen crowd and has older viewers wondering if this has anything new to offer.. and wonder is all I did. This film tries taking a lot of plot lines and ideas from other teen films and brings them all together.. the results are one BIG mess. 2.5 stars is all I can give.. the other films mentioned above are the ticket. \\"Heathers\\" = 5 stars. \\"Mean Girls\\" = 4 stars. \\"Bring it on\\" = 4 stars. \\"Clueless\\" 4.5 stars.

The only thing diffent was the reason for the revenge.There was more to high school than the cheerleaders, the ball players and all their drama. I don't want the cheerleaders and ball players to be offended because I had some great friends that either was a cheerleader or a ball player. (LOL Ok maybe just the ball players).

This blade does NOT edge straight. It CHOPS and MUTILATES the grass instead of leaving a smooth straight line. Having gone from a straight edge blade to this blade was a HUGE downgrade as far as the quality of the cut goes. Also, the blade is short, and I have to put the edger on the lowest setting in order to get into the dirt where some grass is below the surface. Granted maybe this works best for digging or trenching but the blade is horrible, IMO, for straight edges.I since bought another straight (8\\" Rectangle) blade and even though its not made for the machine, it fits, and works 10X better. I went back and re cut the edges straight so now the lawn doesnt look like chopped salad along the edges. Do yourself a favor and get the straight blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right blades","review":"Couldn't find replacement edger blades for my Edgehog locally so I'm glad Amazon had them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong picture","review":"The hole pattern on the picture that is shown does not match the pattern on the item that was shipped.

All of the graphics and supplemental information provided throughout the chapters are beneficial and the summaries at the end of each chapter actually do a good job of reviewing and testing your knowledge.

We followed the directions exactly. A few strands of cotton candy started to come out and then it clogged, turned liquidy and started to burn. Because of the safety features, it is very difficult to unclog. We were very frustrated.

Put your money toward something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not that good","review":"Yep, Read the reviews and was did what I should. Mine did not put much out at all. It Was very loud. I did it four times. Mine put some stings out at first but just on one side of the inside. So really not a good item. The box it was gets me... It shows a nice full batch on the front of the box and I am not really sure anyone could get that like that. This was a gift but I think it should go back and get something else.

How easy to just make it at home!!The instructions are not very clear and you have to let it heat up for 10 minutes before you can begin to use it. ( Tell that to 2 kids DYING for Cotton Candy.) Then we put in the sugar, only 1 teaspoon, and PRESTO it made Cotton Candy....But only about a large cotton ball size. I kept waiting for more, but that was it. Now just imagine splitting that between the kids!!!! It was fun and tasted great (the one whole bite) but is not worth it for children. In order to get even a small portion, it took forever and the kids were frustrated. I would not purchase again. But would maybe buy a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love This Toy!","review":"We really love the cotton candy maker...my daughters aged 7 and 4 think it's the greatest. It does have to heat up as mentioned in another review, but this was like the first thing in the instructions - it was very clear. After it heats up, you can keep making cotton candy without having to reheat everytime (as long as you don't unplug it)...each batch makes 1-1.5 cups of cotton candy. My only complaint is that I haven't been able to find replacements for the paper cones in stores (although they are available through mailorder) -- so we use a mixing spoon to scoop the candy out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get it to work either","review":"Well, I wish I would have reviewed the rating on this one. I bought it on sale for my son's 12th Birthday. The first day we tried it, there really wasn't much cotton candy coming out; enough for one bitful. Each time we added another teaspoon of sugar, less cotton candy came out. So I decided to take it apart and clean it. The second time we tried it, i guess the parts weren't dry enough, so melted sugar started coming out. So I took it apart and cleaned it again. This time I allowed the parts to dry for two days. Then we tried it again for the 3rd time. Cotton candy started coming out great, but it was only enough for one bitful, then melted sugar started coming out again. Then it started smoking. So I turned it off, and let it cool down. This thing is going back to the store. I really was determined to make it work, but I just couldn't. I wouldn't recommend this product at all. Also, the directions need to be made a bit clearer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat gluttons~Not!","review":"This is terrible, after only putting in 4 teaspoons of sugar spaced over a long period of time it started making a weird noise~Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Trouble","review":"I thought my daughter would love this toy. She loves Cotton Candy and loves to cook. However, waiting for 10 minutes with a small child to get it put together and heat up is a lifetime. Then, after all that, we got almost NO cotton candy.

The biggest thing to remember when buying this is this is a TOY. No, it's not going to produce the best quality cotton candy but for my my kids, just watching the sugar spin into candy was delightful. Sure, it does take 10 minutes to warm up and it only makes a little candy per spoon of sugar but for the $13.00 we spent on it it's a great little machine. The candy is a bit grainy but I suspect that is from using regular sugar. If we were using super fine, I bet the results would be better. This is an Adult supervised activity as the machine heats up quite a bit.I would definately recommend this product for a nice change of pace for a family evening at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"why?","review":"Why are companies aloud to sell this junk? We tried this out a few moons ago, it was loud, ugly and gave you a tiny little sticky, stringy, gritty, burnt up, chewy thumb sized nasty tasting tuft of sugar product after 30minutes of use, it also smelled like burning plastic, it went back after that. give the nostalgia electric machine a try, unlike this one, it makes great tasting cotton candy, a proper cone within 3 minutes after the initial 5minute warm up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand new, did not work","review":"Bought the machine brand new, like everyone else, followed the instructions to the letter, ten min warm up, actually bought and used professional sugar, the machine spits out a tiny bit of cotton candy, all mashed together maybe a base ball after 30 min.

For amateur musicians they are pretty decent, and if I was attending a local small town concert I would have rated it as a nice performance. However, A high quality recording of an impressive instrumental performance this is definately NOT. By my humble ear, I heard off-tempo and off-key notes throughout the various numbers. The recording itself was of modest quality as well. No offense to the artists, they perform much better than I could ever come close to, but I was mislead into thinking this would be a much higher quality musical CD by the other reviews.

It has three parts: The Inferno, The Purgartory, and The Paradise. The Inferno is Hell where sinners are punished in various ways according to the degree of their sins. The Purgartory is a waiting place in which sinners must endure certain hardships in order to inherit the Paradise. The Paradise is Heaven, where a select few live in a perfect society. The Divine Comedy follows Dante in his journey to perfection, however, it has many politicial ideals inbedded. This particular translation is excellent.

Reading this translation gives me a sense of not only what the content of the book is like, but also how it would have artistically sounded and felt. It's so well done that sometimes it's hard to believe that this is only a translation of the masterpiece. Ciardi also provides a summary page before each cantos, and very extensive and helpful notes. I wholeheartedly recommend this translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Divine Comedy (Great Classic Series) [Paperback]","review":"When I ordered this I understood, as the title indicates, that it was Dante's The Divine Comedy.

But it's not really that. It's more of a lyrics-free version of the same album. You still have the Spectorish ethereal chorus in the background, and guitars, ukeleles, and other instruments that you'd not ordinarily find in either an orchestra or a big band. I think I'd have enjoyed this CD all the more if it had really been an orchestral or band transcription, instead of a neither-fish-nor-fowl as this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilled","review":"This is a strange instrumental reworking of the songs from Ram.

I've been searching for this rare item for years, and when I got hold of it, I was flat out disappointed. This is not even Paul himself. He had no part in this, except providing the songs and producing this load of instrumentals. As the CD jacket does not reveal any musician credits, I assume he did not play any instrument nor sing in this album.

While I am a big Beatles fan, this one slipped by me.I love Ram, happen to think it is Paul's best solo album. So I like this instrumental version, done in large part by the guy who did arrangements for Those Were the Days by Mary Hopkin, and Let It Be. Paul asked him to do a big band version of Ram in 1971 when Ram came out, but it wasn't released until 1977.This big band version is kind of shmaltzy, kind of jazzy, kind of old-time jazzy.If you like this kind of music and if you like Ram, you will probably like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Demented Lounge Party!!!","review":"I truly didn't know what to expect when I bought \\"Thrillington\\" but when I played it for the first time I was amazed!!

And I just took it apart and really looked at it and was totally grossed out. I knew that my tea was starting to taste a little strange. The amount of gunk inside the lid was intense. Not easy to clean...had to use a small toothbrush and qtips and still not totally satisfied...lots of little jagged areas inside where gunk hardens. Trying to research another solution...maybe bleach or vinegar soak would do it. Lid does come apart but not completely. I would still give this product 5 stars because it keeps the drink warm and is just so virtually indestructible...I have to believe that there is an easier way to clean this.

It barely holds 10 oz. I don't need to keep 10 oz. of anything hot for ten hours when I would drink it in one minute! I wanted a good cup to take to a coffee shop to reduce waste. This one doesn't even hold the smallest amount of coffee they offer as well the design is such that if you fill the cup past this ridge, when you put the lid on it over flows the sides of the container all over the place. The design is pretty good. I like the idea of being able to drink from all sides of the cup when in use and then to have a lid that makes it totatly tip proof for a bag. I wish it came in a bigger size and I wish the description was accurate and said it only holds 10 oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more work","review":"The shock part of this is fine, but the mount part needs a lot of work.Problem 1) Once locked in, the mount part of it wobbles back and forth. It's loose and no amount of tightening will fix it, looks like they tried already and stripped out the screws at the plant. Now Blue was very accommodating and sent me a new one which is better but it still will wobbles about a 1cm back and forth at the top. I ended up using some super glue to stop this. At home this is ok, but in a studio or regular recording use it probably won't stand up for long.Problem 2) The swivel arm, you just cant get it tight enough. The screw is made of very soft metal and the swivel is flat metal on flat metal so it never really gets right enough and a good push will knock it over. Once it's on a mic swivel arm I don't think it will last long. It might but I'm not sure.Pro * It does the isolation part well and if I can keep it immobile it will do a fine job, just needs an update (version #2 ? )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't handle the weight of the Blue Snowball microphone","review":"I picked this up along with the Blue Snowball microphone and I'm quite disappointed. It's made of solid construction, but the locking mechanism is terrible. It won't hold the weight of the Blue Snowball microphone and after twice watching my mic smack the table due to the lock mechanism slipping, I refuse to use it anymore.Also, when I was taking the Snowball out, it was a little hard to unthread it due to how the thread mechanism works. If you try it, DO NOT tighten the Snowball down very much or you'll have an awful time trying to get it back out.Overall I can't recommend the product, at least for the Snowball. It looks great, feels great, but it can't handle the weight of the Snowball reliably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable","review":"The outer ring is very loose and unstable where it joins the stand mounting bracket.

He smelled something wrong, studied the reports and was quite clear on the essentials that would be be touched on by the Garrison investigation, expanded by the 1978 House Hearings and virtually confirmed by the release of ARRB papers in the early 90's. Oswald was a government agent and there were things done in Dallas that assisted the killing. Things that Lane and Meagher and Weisberg would write about a few years later.

The problem is, not only has the Wiccan movement moved well beyond this sort of material, it was never interested in the lies and false representation presented here. The author is yet another poser who makes the rediculous claim that Wicca is an ancient religion passed down for hundreds of years. A prime example is the inclusion of the Charge of the Goddess. Although Doreen Valiente clearly says she rewrote it into the form that is presented in this book, the author seems to think that the charge was written hundreds of years earlier. Avoid this book as it has nothing to do with either modern Witchcraft or even the movement when it was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless, possibly harmful.","review":"This book is a collection of junk, with a few parts that could do actual harm to the user. The recipie section should be taken with a grain of salt. Do your research before you run off and start making tea out of stuff in your backyard. Also, i am glad the author at least includes a warning about the \\"flying ointment\\" which could easily kill you. On the magical side I object to the inclusion of several manipulative love spells, which are highly unethical (not to mention childish). If you are a bored teenager that needs to feel dark and powerful, or an insecure new ager looking to validate yourself by buying into a fake \\"tradition\\" of witchcraft, by all means pick up this book. If you are an adult looking to forge a closer connection with the spirituality in nature, this would be a waste of time and money better spent on a Cunningham or (no one can possibly call her fluffy) a Starhawk book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Beginners","review":"\\"The Grimoire of Lady Sheba\\" wasn't the first book I've read about Wicca, and I'm very happy that it wasn't.The book doesn't really explain about the Craft and it's holidays etc. but just gives rituals and spells.There are a lot of print errors in it.The first thing I've noticed when I just went over the book briefly was that the dates of the Sabbats were incorrect, when I read the book thoroughly I so that many of Lady Sheba's spells were spells to control and manipulate people, which is wrong according to Wicca.I think that people who are completely new to Wicca shouldn't read this book first, if they want to they should read it after reading some good books so they'll see the difference and know the true meaning...Also there are a few nice ideas in the book that can be \\"borrowed\\" to rituals and spells in the correct manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little thing called common sense","review":"I appreciated many of the ideas.

Lemme tell you all about it. Every day of it.\\" And so on. The plot is alright, but there needed to be more added to it to keep things interesting. It tells you of his slow struggle with death by nearly each excruciating day. Most of the time, it's nothing interesting at all! It's like: Johnny went in for testing. Now I'm going to tell you all about his cancer, all over again. And the testing that happened, and what witty things he said to the nurse, and so on. It's awful.

Unfortunately those that are not familiar with his music might think the \\"Coalition\\" is really cutting edge stuff, \\"strikingly original\\", or whatever your favorite jazz adjective might be. But it's not. Listen closely. Does track 1 (\\"The Ministry of Truth\\") sound familiar? That's because it's a rehash of one of Previte's old tunes from one of the Latin for Travelers records. A few tracks later on \\"Coalition\\" we get a rehash of the first tune off Previte's Empty Suits record, and not a very good one at that. Both tunes are conveniently renamed of course, to deceive the listener that they're getting something new. This technique of \\"self rip-off\\" is nothing new to Previte as he's done it many times in the past, with the album \\"Corporate Art\\" being a prime example.\\"Ministry of Truth\\" is an apt title.

Having seen the italian original, it is remarkable how the same characters are cloned to modern-day cleveland. For example, the uptight and old-fashioned Michele from Sicily is now a stylish afro-american that could be a pimp. But while the original had a beat to it that engaged the story to evolve from one scene to the next, as a good page-turner book would do, this remake languished. The original had a really good musical beat that acted as a \\"page turner\\". This one does not.

Unfortunately, the features that made the original sparkle (great characters depicted with love and care), are not present in 'Welcome to Collinwood'. What's left is an uninspired mess. The characters that were supposed to represent the Italian soul were not successfully transformed to American soil. Instead, they were shamelessly copied from the original.

It's good for small, debris free yards. I use it for quick touchups to keep the grass short but once a while I'd plugin the electric mower to produce a clean, professional cut.

Even my dad who used the old time reel mowers was so impressed with it! You can visit with neighbors and hear the birds singing while you mow!

I know what a joy it can be to mow your lawn with a push reel mower. This, however has been nothing but a frustration to me. I complained to the company, and the answer was effectively \\"sorry 'bout that.\\" First, it wouldn't cut high grass. I can live with that. It won't cut flower stems from weeds in the lawn. Didn't like that. So I pulled up the lawn and put in a brand new sod lawn. It cuts pretty well, if you don't mind cutting several ways, and on consecutive days during the fast growing season in Spring. The major complaint I have is that now that I have a new, soft lawn, the mower won't stay in adjustment, so it soon looks like I tore the lawn instead of mowing it, and the anvil and blades don't meet at all spots on the anvil or blades. Other mowers I've had cut like a pair of scissors all along the anvil. This one won't and it is way too expensive to get it repaired.

I so looked forward to using my new American reel mower.What a disappointment. What a waste of money. From day one it has not performed well. It flattens more lawn than it cuts, and when it does cut it is so patchy, it looks like a bunch of little mohawk haircuts on the lawn. Completely unacceptable and a waste of my time, as I have to go over several times, and it still looks like a mess.In addition, the handle flexes too much, even when all the nuts are tightened down. Which, by the way, I would advise you to do every time you use the mower, if you buy one.

The mower cuts well. I do have to occasionally go over an area twice, but I guess you do with a gas mower also.

Because it comes as two pieces and must be put together it feels like it bends a little too much at times. 2) The mower is made in China.

As others have said, it will get stuck with the smallest of sticks, but that's just the way the design works. Not hard to get out, but best to just make sure there are no debris before you start. Pushing it is really easy, though we have a flat lawn. I can finish my yard quickly then just hang it in the corner of the garage. No gas, takes up little space, loving it so far.

I was unable to fish a new cable using the old one so I need a new antenna. I read the reviews and this seemed to be good for my application. It does not work as good as the factory antenna. I live about 50 miles west of NYC and 60 miles north of Philadelphia and I would be able to pick up stations from either city depending on what side of the mountain I was on. Now neither come in and my local stations come in with static. Once I am within 20 miles of NYC it works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Got off to a bad start with this transaction - the seller didn't put enough postage on the package, so I had to waste over an hour and $1.79 to collect it from the local post office.

It is not necessarily bad, but it is definitely not demi. This product is beef base with many thickening agents. It doesn't taste like demi, it doesn't look like demi, it doesn't feel like demi. The result is much like a hard, gritty paste form of the Knorr dry mix, if you've ever used that. And if you have used that, you know (hopefully) that it is not really demi-glace either.If you aren't really looking for demi, just salty, beefy flavor and a mild thickener, just stick with beef base and wondra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Demi Glace...its a base","review":"To call this a Demi Glace is all wrong.

She tells the reader that studying in medical school is a whole different world than the studying done in undergrad.

The bell is really loud actually, and great for alerting pedestrians and sometimes cars. I was really bummed out, though, when my horsey sticker fell off. Now it's just a plain old bell and I'm thinking of buying something else. Anyway, that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Other than that, it is a super nice bell. Just make sure you secure your sticker with some extra glue or something or you will look upon your bell with sorrow for the rest of your days ;_;"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and honest","review":"I just finished Yoo's \\"Girls for Breakfast\\". I really don't like spoilers, so I won't include any here. The narrator of the novel,Nick, is soooo funny, that I couldn't put it down and finished it in a couple of sittings. Nick wants it all with typical teen bravado, but is also incredibly insecure. I read a fair bit of YA lit. (I'm a teacher), and I was really grateful that Yoo doesn't have some big moment of clarity where the character figures out all his problems and does the right thing at just the right time(this ruins many similar books). Instead, his narrator is just a big ball of raging hormones and confusion and contradictions. I'd say the only downside of this novel is all the pop culture allusions. They had me dying from laughter from the first couple of pages (\\"Kodiak Long Cut bear\\"), but they might be confusing to a 16 year old who didn't grow up in the 80's. Overall, hilarious and painfully honest. I would definitely recommend this to smart teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"El Gran Detective","review":"Acabo de terminar esta gran obra y aun quiero seguir leyendo acerca del gran Archimboldi, la baronesa, los criticos, los detectives, y el resto de personajes que hacen este mastodonte parecer un cuento corto.

I have seen these boys a few times in concert and own a few of their CDs and they are TRULY the BEST at what they do.If there is anyone wondering about if they should buy this CD, I will say this one thing: I can't pick out any one thing about this CD that really stands out from any of their others, but they stick to what they do best, and it works!

The target audience of this book is surely 12 year olds. Anyone over that age, or who has read any decent suspense literature (King, Barker, Koontz -- if you don't know who they are, you'll probably like this book.), is going to be bored out of their minds.

Of course.","review":"I finished \\"Cry for Strangers\\" and felt the story silly. Now I am half way into \\"Comes the Blind Furry\\" and decided that this is going to be the last John Saul book I will ever read.The main problem with John Saul is that there is no strength in his stories. The main characters are either too stupid to fugure out things or too weak to act on things. The supporting characters shair the same problem with added indeference.Stories don't have to have happy endings. Main characters don't have to be perfect. But they have to have something different about them to attaract the readers. John Saul's characters are too bland, too mediocre to carry a story. And it is just painful to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and somewhat boring!","review":"I found this book to be extremely predictable from start to finish. The plot was well used, and proved tedious to force myself to read at times. The main charictor in the story, the girl's father, just does not seem real to me.

I felt so bad for Michelle and angry towards her father who practically dis-owned her because of what had happened in the past. her new sister didn't help Michelle feel anymore important either.It was so sad that it actually made me cry.I was really disappointed with the ending but the whole book in general was fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of John Saul's best!","review":"I read this book in Middle School and thought it was creepy back then. Its still holds up today as one spooky read. I also really enjoyed Suffer the Children and Punish the sinners.Ghost kids are just creepy \\"if you ask me\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the mark","review":"This book has lots of spooky elements - a ghost, an indestructible doll, an old man with family secrets, automatic drawing, a mysterious stain that won't go away. Any of these ingredients might be a good core for a thriller, but they don't come together in any meaningful way. Throw in a well-adjusted child turned instantly neurotic, a maladjusted dad, whose fragile psyche could never have survived medical school, and an ineffectual mother and you've got motives as murky as the fog that heralds the ghost's arrival. The plot revolves around \\"little children\\" who - at 12 - inexplicably speak and act like eight-year-olds. There isn't enough reality here to make the supernatural aspects effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-o-r-i-n-g","review":"I have not read a Saul book in years and I really don't know why I downloaded this, but I remember enjoying them when I was younger. I guess I would classify this as young adult fiction because I can't imagine many adults being sold on this very shallow boring ghost story. Nothing happens for so long that I almost gave up then there is a section where all h-e-double toothpicks breaks lose and it become a bloodless bloodbath as it were. I read this while commuting to and from work and had about five pages left after I made it home; I was still not sufficiently entertained to read those last few pages until my next commute. I think the title cracked me up so much that I chose it for that. It is what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and unconvincing","review":"This is my third Saul book and may be the last. I found this book annoying and frustrating. There were too many unnecessary characters who were too weak to do anything. I found June the most frustrating. How could she NOT stand up to her husband? Was he seriously affected that bad by his daughter's accident or was something supernatural at work? And Michelle's \\"friends\\" were so bowled over by the mean-spirited twit Susan that they physically could NOT stand up to her when she was being mean to Michelle? Not to mention, I wanted to know more about the little blind girl and her back story. Why did she pick those particular kids to harm? This book had an amazing concept that someone like Stephen King could have worked wonders with. Saul just seemed to flail around and not know what to do with it. The ending was somewhat satisfying which is the only reason I gave this two stars. Such a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspenseful, Creepy Ghost Story","review":"This book captivated my attention even though it was very creepy and spooky. It's the only ghost story I ever read so don't really have anything to compare it to. I can't really say I liked it, because I don't like being creeped out and scared, but if you do, then this books for you. It's about a girl, Amanda, who was blind and was forced off a cliff, died and now haunts other 12-yr. old girls. Michelle, an adopted girl, moved from Boston to Paradise Point and found an old doll in her house the she named \\"Amanda.\\" The ghost girl came to visit her and they became friends. When someone teased Michelle, the ghost would come and arrange some sort of \\"accident\\" so they would die. This happens over and over to build up the suspense and excitement. I'm not going to tell the ending though, because I don't want to spoil it for you.--Karen Arlettaz Zemek, Author of \\"My Funny Dad, Harry\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Saul's Best","review":"This is by far one of Saul's best books.

The book started out with a good story line but in the middle and end it just left me irritated and disapointed. DID Cal ever figure out how much he had hurt Michelle with his behavior? Did he ever fugure out that she died thinking he did not love her? Cal was very unlikeable to me and seems to have gotten off too easy. If he was so afraid of kids then why was he not afraid of his newborn daughter? Did Jeffs mother ever blame the family for her sons death? Perhaps I am putting more into the book than it deserves but I do not like to be left with unanswered questions and I would have preffered to hear more about the blind girls life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an idiot -- harassment by Potent C text messages","review":"Over the past three weeks I have received more than 1,000 spam text messages on my Blackberry from the same person, many of them pushing this music.

But when I got these I was so disappointed.They don't really go with the castle because the feet are to small and can't work the platforms.The figures are made out of a cheaper plastic and the swords are easily bend, the helmets don't fit right at all, and the detailes on the figures are a very poor paint job.Not at all like the figures that came with the castle or the other additional packages we bought.Of cause my boys still play with them, but I can tell they sure prefer the original figures. The difference sure surprised me since all of them are imaginext and fisher price, but I didn't get a chance to call about it yet.

The first 5 songs in particular are amazing. I have to say it took me about 100 billion years befour i got hold of this album but it was well worth the wait. The Album starts off with the epic 'Excution day'. The song contains some of the greatest guitar rifts I've ever heard and Meatloaf's voice has vastly improved from the underatted 'Bad Attitude'.Other fantastic songs include 'Rock and roll mercenaries', 'Blind before i stop' and 'One more kiss'. This album was unfortunately very unsuccessful worldwide and only reached number #28 in the UK charts due to distribution problems. Even after concidering this fact the album is still considerably better than 50% of the other albums on the market and, is well worth 12.99 of anybodies money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Title - Lousy Album","review":"The wonderful ode to what we shall euphemistically call 'self abuse' of the title notwithstanding, this album reeks.

I can honestly say that I have never been this disappointed with a cd purchase in years. The best song would have to be \\"Dryad of the Woods\\" and that would be because it's an instrumental. Daniel's voice is good but he does these stupid \\"hacha-ump-a-ump-dup\\" sounds in the middle of songs which takes so much away from the tracks. I wouldn't recommend this album to many people. I know there are tons of people out there that like it and like this type of music but I think a better purchase would have to be O.S.I. if you like this type of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the same band that did \\"Entropia\\"???","review":"First, let me say that I am a big fan of Pain of Salvation's older material. \\"Entropia\\" and \\"One Hour by the Concrete Lake\\" are both excellent albums, and showed a talented band with tremendous potential. \\"The Perfect Element\\" was decent, but was well below those albums in songwriting quality. But this? Well, this is just abhorrent. I really can't even believe it's the same band. A band that once did such ambitious, original, interesting music has dumbed down to boring pop trash. I can't even stand to listen to this thing, and I've had it since the day it came out. The amount of fans that consider this their greatest work is just bewildering. I suspect that most of them are just fairweather fans, who had never even heard of them until \\"The Perfect Element\\" came out. I've been listening to them since \\"One Hour...\\", and I consider this to be well below their standards. I really hope the next album is better, because this is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain of Salvation neeeds to take a walk down remedy lane","review":"I'll be brief since every one else seems to think they need to write a novel. I thought this album was a major disappointment, I have only listened to it all the way through once and that was hard to do. I feel that it could have been very good, the music is alright and the album idea is kind of cool, but the vocals are way over done. The guy has a cool voice but he throws all this weird [stuff] in their with his singing and it wasn't \\"emotive\\" like other reviewers said, it was lame and made the album hard to listen to. There are only two songs that he doesn't screw up and one of them is an instrumental piece that is actually really good.

These songs will move you to the point of tears, and sometimes that's exactly what you want in an album. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Atkins","review":"These have a great crisp taste and nice flavor. They are not overly sweet and do not taste fake. The taste is of crispy rice, litly creamy and a bit sweet with chocolate glaze. One of the best I could find and the price is right.

The remastering job is a joke. I'm always amazed how record companies try to get you to buy the same album over and over again and in this case the CD. They use big words that sound good like \\"Digitally remastered\\"+\\"24 bit mixing\\" etc. The first cut of this horrible sounding rerelease had an usually amount of background hiss. Same was true of the second song. Hiss has never bothered me historically but in this case it did. What tapes were they using I wonder? The guitar sounds brittle and overall it was hard for me to judge the music since this CD sounded so awful. However, the bonus live tracks sound great and are packed full of dynamite. I have heard tracks from this album on vinyl and they sounded much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"More noise from the Noise Machine from Flint, Michigan","review":"I really thought, when I bought this LP, that this would be an improvement. There is a keyboard mix on the first cut, but then Farner recycles one of his boring, repetitive guitar breaks and the record takes an artistic skid from there.I notice the CD has a live version of \\"I'm Your Captain.\\" This is one of the band's better tunes, having been played ad nauseum on your favorite album rock station. But the instrumentation is stretched out sans improvisation and it all gets tired.That a new generation even thinks this band is worth anything must be a sad commentary on the state of modern rock and pop music.Footnote: The LP jacket was ROUND and shaped like a huge coin.

We all knew Mark Farner was a genius at writting and guitar playing. Recently I've been burning old albums on cd's and downloading to iTunes. I pulled E. Pluribus Funk and burned the CD. After listening close, the pops and scatches were to much for the beginning of most the songs but mostly Loneliness. I made the decision to download a new copy from the MP3 store. What a great decision that was, not only are the songs pop and scatch free the sound quality is amazing. I noticed a few studio fix's at the beginning and end of some songs, very cool.

This session is from August 1959 and features Jackie McLean on alto sax, Donald Byrd on trumpet, Sam Jones on bass, Art Taylor on drums, and Davis on piano. This same rhythm trio cut Donald Byrd'sByrd in Hand(see my review) three months earlier, but they are definitely more inspired on this date. The standout tracks are the soulful \\"'Snake It,\\" \\"Loodle-Lot,\\" and the rhythmic \\"Rhumba Nhumba,\\" but unfortunately what stands out the most is the poor sound quality. There was a lot of distortion on the previous incarnation of this recording, seemingly emanating from the drum mics, and it has been cleared up dramatically, but is still distracting. It is my main reason for awarding only four stars.

Along the way you will encounter some interesting people and characters who helped form Zane Grey's version of the West--from traders, hunters, and just plain old folks whose influence helped make Zane Grey the writer he was. You'll thrill again the remembrance of his novels as each page unfolds in some location he has described in one of his books.

I would recommend this cd to any Star Trek fan who enjoys watching the episodes and hearing the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting oddities make this a good purchase...","review":"It is sometimes annoying how Paramount manage to repackage Star Trek themes in endless combinations, but it is a testament to the consistency and quality of the composers who have worked on Trek's various TV incarnations that these discs seldom disappoint.This particular disc stands out mainly for the interesting departures from the 'standard' Star Trek themes, namely Nana Visitor's rendition of 'Fever', the B-movie style theme for 'Bride of Chaotica' and the (not very good) lounge version of the original Star Trek theme.At the more conventional end of the spectrum, the excerpts from 'All Good Things' and 'Balance Of Terror' bring back memories of two excellent episodes that most fans will remember fondly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Trek Fans Rejoice","review":"At last, some of the most familiar classic Trek music cues are available on cd. My long-sought personal favorite is Big Ruk, the timpani-heavy action cue so wonderfully utilized throughout the series, but especially memorable for its association with the Gorn in Arena. The DSN, VOY and TNG selections are also stand-outs, quite enjoyable even by someone like me who generally finds the newer Trek music a tad bit bland compared to the signature cues of Fred Steiner, Gerald Fried & co. Also appreciated is (finally) an appearance of Goldsmith's Voyager theme as it appears on the show, and not in the strangely edited long version that showed up on the 30th anniversary disc. All in all, a terrific collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Weaker Second Album But Still Good","review":"I was a little disappointed in the selection from the original series, I think the songs from Amok Time are better than the original series songs on this album. The album, however, does not disappoint once it gets to the DS9, VOY, and TNG tracks. They are either pulse pounding, retro during the Captain Proton songs and even beautiful when it is neither of the previous two. I also didn't care for the lounge mix version of the original series theme, it just didn't sound that good, but, you have to take that with a pinch of salt. If you like lounge music, you may enjoy it more than I did. However, I really loved that Visitor's version of the song \\"Fever\\" was thrown in as a \\"bonus track\\" according to the CD slipcase. She really shows her pipes and can really sing. I couldn't help but smile just thinking about the DS9 episode \\"His Way\\" while I was listening.

The book does have its serious moments but it's mostly a very funny and candid look at the gay porn industry and all the certain directors, stars and such that perform in them. I hated the book at first. All the characters and situations were yawningly predictable...but it started to pick up and I was hooked before I was halfway through. It moves quickly, has some very explicit and hot gay sex scenes and (thankfully) doesn't go TOO over the top.

Don't be fooled by the labeling or its popularity. It's just junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells cheap!","review":"This product is cheap and it has too much fragrance. The smell is so overwhelming you can even taste it. it doesn't hold the twist very well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and tight","review":"Great little set of extensions. I bought these to change the spark plugs on a Navigator. If you drop a socket on top of a 5.4L Ford, you are probably going to shed tears getting it back.These extensions allowed me to reach all those pesky coil-over bolts with no problem, and never dropped a socket."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a lesson plan","review":"This book is ok but not great. It's more of an idea starter, 'get you thinking', type of book. I agree with the other reviewers that, as a teacher, you can read a poem or two in class to get kids started on their own two voice math poems but don't rely on it for correct math or to be a resource for class. There is not enough varied content for that. It's more like a lesson plan that the author has expanded into a short book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry for Math","review":"The poems here are for two voices. They celebrate many aspects of mathematics and I use them for a jumping off point for having children write poems in two voices for science, social studies, or just for fun. I even use this book at Back-To-School Night."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product!","review":"if u have oily skin...it controls ur oil....it takes care of inflamation because of the tea tree oil it has....but it does make the skin a little red...and as soon as u put it it burns like hell.....im serious its very painful....i have to put it little by little or else my eyes will start to tear....really hot burning sensation not good.....ill stop using it as soon as my acne starts to fade....i recommend using 100% pure tea tree oil from the same brand, desert essence, because it works as an antiseptic...drys out skin a little but doesn't burn...takes redness away and inflamation and good for sensitive skin!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well","review":"This stick really gets rid of pimples fast. It penetrates deep into the skin and doesn't feel greasy - just absorbs right in. Works a lot better than Burt's Bee Blemish stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST remedy for occasional blemishes","review":"Since stumbling across this product in my local health food store I've become completely addicted to it. My skin has never been so clear! I used to use rubbing alcohol to dry out small blemishes or bug bites, with the accompanying sting and the return of the itch soon after. An application of Desert Essence Blemish Touch Stick actually makes the itch --and the blemish-- go away! Generally, you will have to apply this more frequently than some other treatments, but with its small, portable size and pleasant-but-quickly-dissipating scent, that shouldn't be a problem. I love that this product is all-natural; it won't damage or dry out your skin and it's good for the earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Quality Control is TERRIBLE","review":"I have used Desert Essence for years and find that they are not consistent in their formulas, but even worse one batch of their lip rescue made my lips burn and peel for days. I woke up with them crusted over, and never received a response from the company. Do not use this product on your face in case it does to you what it did to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIT IS PERFECT","review":"THIS GOES ALONG GREAT WITH THE JUNGLE/SAFARI THEME IN NURSERY.

I was disappointed minutes after I turned the first page. Oh sure it has nice glossy print and pretty pictures but content? You won't find it here. You will find all the info in this book and much MORE at recreation.gov. Won't cost you a dime either. My copy gets sold at my next garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating reading experience....","review":"While I enjoyed the plot -- I did not care for Faye Kellerman's delivery. Now don't get me wrong - I love a good mystery, good historical fiction, and a good romance, but this book just didn't deliver. Ms. Kellerman's dialogue between our lovers was often overkill and would go on for pages and seemed rather unrealistic. There was no warmth between the characters. I was intrigued enough to get to the end of the story - but the who-done-it answer made me feel like I had wasted a lot of energy looking for the killer in the book. Just a frustrating experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic yet compelling","review":"I was so engrossed in this book, I couldn't put it down. I found Rebecca's storyline particularly interesting, Shaespeare's, not so much. It is not for the faint of heart - there are graphic descriptions of torture that may be fiction but are based on actual historical events and are very disturbing. But if you can handle it, it's a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is nothing more than a \\"bodice ripper\\".","review":"This book was a great disappointment to me. I really like her contemporary mysteries. The speech of the characters was a mixture of fake 16th century and anachronistic 20th century language, i.e. \\"attention span\\". The events that befell them were totally unrealistic and were rather like the \\"Perils of Pauline\\". Lots or gratuitous sex and violence. It was a total strain on my credibility. Don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"fiction can be misleading","review":"Although Literature is fiction, and bearing that fact in mind, I would like to say that Roderigo Lopez (1525-1594) existed (in flesh and bone) and was a physician to Queen Elizabeth I. He was killed under dubious circumstances, after being charged of trying to poison the Queen. NEVERTHELESS, the Doctor was a PORTUGUESE Jew and not Spanish as the novel (eventhough fiction) says or imagines he was. I think History students and readers in general should bear that in mind. Enjoy your reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't read it.","review":"I have just found this author and was enjoying her books, when this one appeared and surely sounded different, I started to read it and couldn't get passed page three. I can not stomach torture, violence etc. Not for me. Had to give it a star, as I couldn't write my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise but...","review":"There is nothing I enjoy more than a good historical mystery novel. Unfortunately this novel is not it. It strained credulity on a number of levels even interspersed with historical personages. Did Elizabeth Tudor really have a lesbian encounter with one of her ladies in waiting? Did Will Shakespeare take time off from his play writing to investigate the murder of a friend or engage in an amorous affair with the same lady in waiting?I agree with the reviewer who stated this novel is nothing more than an Elizabethan bodice ripper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is the most irritating, annoying character imaginable. Every time she has an encounter with her father and manages to get her own way, I cringe. If only Kellerman were true to the actual conditions governing the conduct of women at the time. Then, we might have been spared this whiny, ridiculous character."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sorry I bought and read this book","review":"I usually love historical novels of this time period and have read many, but this is one I wish I had not read. I should have stopped reading when the author turned Queen Elizabeth I into a nasty old child molester. The characters were not believable and nor were the situations they found themselves in. If you want to read really good mysteries/novels from this time period I highly recommend anything written by Karen Harper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up half way through.","review":"I thoroughly enjoy Shakespeare. This book sounded like it might be an interesting little mystery that involved him.Every once in a while I would get a little thrill of Hamlet, MacBeth, the Merchant of Venice. Was the author going to tie Will's experiences to the writing of these plays? Sadly not.The mysterious death of Will's friend continued to be mysterious with very little plot movement.I found the portrayal of Queen Elizabeth to be deplorable and the author's attempts at Elizabethan bawdiness to be a complete failure. One must leave something to the imagination unless one just wants to write trashy novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the job great so far","review":"After trying a black sprinkler hose that performed more like a soaker, we purchased this based on the good reviews and weren't disappointed. It set up easy enough and is easy enough to couple and de-couple. It works as promised with one small caveat - we have a small slope and the height of the lower stream is 5 feet and the higher ones are only 2-3 feet so we have inconsistent flow (but I don't know how you would correct that...). I also appreciate the length and the ability to adjust the length. Only one other thing that I noticed recently as when I hooked it up, there was a small trickle of water from the coupling running between the tubes - like a leak. It didn't seem to be much but if it becomes an actual leak then I would downgrade it as we've only had it a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrews sprinkler/soaker hose","review":"I had purchesed an Andrews twin tube sprinkler hose from stiens lawn and garden, for a strip of lawn I had seeded.It had alot of holes and the best spray pattern of any hose I have used.I planted strip gardens of tomatos,berries and watermelon.I purchased two more hoses and raised them above the plants to spray downwards.These hoses make the best watering system. Low flow and great pattern. And with the supplied clip you can make it water any length.Only negative I have with Andrews hose is they are not double ended,and you can not connect two togeather for longer areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad politics bad policies","review":"This type of thinking degenerates on close analysis.

I ordered a large accordingly, and on washing the item (I haven't even worn it yet!) it shrunk to the point where my midsection was showing (Washed the item in a cold water setting and line dried it). Unfortunately, my polos need to be tucked in for work (which is why I purchaised this product) and these will not suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizes are GROSSLY misrepresented.","review":"I ordered this shirt in spite of the reviews which mostly stated that the shirts were far too small. All those reviews were RIGHT. I ordered what is supposedly an adult 3x. I ordered a size larger than usual (I can normally wear a 2x VERY comfortably) to account for the size issues stated by other reviewers. When I received the shirt and tried it on, the fit is more like an adult LARGE. The fabric stretched enough that I COULD wear it, if I chose, but the fit was tight enough I would not choose to EVER wear it in public.I'm not sure where these 'adult' sizes were determined, but no 3x adult I have ever seen would be able to wear a shirt of this size. If you choose to buy this shirt, make sure to order AT LEAST two sizes up. Or, more preferably, look for another shirt to purchase.
