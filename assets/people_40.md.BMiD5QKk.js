Even though the book focuses on specific attractions with no pretention of tying them all into a coherent story, it effectively gives you a sampling of the history of Kyoto, its industries, and their sensibilities.At the very end of the book the author dedicates a couple of paragraphs to actually planning your trip to Kyoto - wish there was more information there.

If you get just a bit squeamish about explicit descriptions of gay sex, you'll still love this book.

This isn't a complete memoir like \\"Running with Scissors\\" and \\"Dry.\\" Instead, it's a collection of short stories about the author's life. All of these stories are incredibly honest, and also quite hysterical. My favorite chapters include a description of young Augusten's experience working on a television commercial for Tang; his stint as a student at the Barbizon School of Modeling; the twisted relationship he has with his corrupt housekeeper, Debby; his various sexual encounters with Catholic priests; and his relationship with his boyfriend Dennis, a.k.a. \\"The Schnauzer.\\" I read this book very quickly and enjoyed every page.

He says the things I am thinking and have thought about in the past. His pop culture references are dead-on. I would recommend this book to most 30-somethings and up who will really relate to his comments about Donny and Marie, Tony Olando, and Flair pens. His writing is not for the faint of heart, however, and I wouldn't suggest this book to my parents, or any of their friends for that matter. But for open-minded, not easily offended adults there is no one today who can beat Burroughs at his genre.

I read and very much enjoyed Burroughs' two memoirs, Running With Scissors and Dry. Magical Thinking is a collection of stories which has the definite feel of cashing in on the success of those two.Burroughs has freely admitted to being a compulsive diarist. These stories have the feel of being plucked from his diary and perhaps dressed up a little. The most enjoyable are the story of his escalating battle with a cleaning lady and a sketch of his altogether different brother. The rest - well, I don't remember much.Jaklak sez check it out if you're into gay dating.

I read his first two (Dry was definitely my favorite), and ran out to get this as soon as it came out. Boy, was I disappointed.

Wow, that's gotta make you feel good! There were so many put-downs of other people throughout the book that the major feeling I had after reading it was that Burroughs is mean spirited and rather full of himself.

He is in a league all his own. If you have a dry, sarcastic, skewed sense of humor, and don't shock easily, I highly recommend this collection of short stories, along with \\"Dry\\" Augusten Burrough's previous novel. Be forewarned: Mr. Burroughs does border at times on being perversely descriptive -- which can be disturbing, hilarious, or both. His previous work, \\"Running With Scissors\\", was not a personal favorite, due to much of the depressing content, however, I believe that with each successive published work, Mr. Burroughs only gets better and funnier. I cherish his work, and am eager for more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ARE YOU PEOPLE CRAZY?","review":"This is, quite possibly, the worst book I've ever read. I don't understand how the previous reviewers could find any redemption in Burrough's new book---there's nothing magical about it. These stories are pointless, bitter, uneven, and offer nothing even insightful about the human condition---more importantly, of Burroughs condition. He continually states how screwed up he is, I guess expecting us to know this from his previous books, but never actually gives us much that is tangible to back it up which just makes it self-deprecating, and not even in a funny/ironic sort of way. Burroughs comes off as a bitter, snobby, aging queen, who is way too full of himself. If this becomes a bestseller then it only proves one thing: Burroughs is definitely a better marketer than writer and should go back to advertising. Insulting.(P.S. I only gave this a star because I was required to.

There's nothing exceptional about how he delivers a story, how he turns a phrase or creatively depicts situations and inner psychologies or character development. He doesn't make language his own.

It is the most blatant and yet ineffective imitation of David Sedaris, right down to the common themes (life as a homosexual) and settings (coping with domestic help, having to kill a rodent). The callowness of the author can take your breath away, such as, for example, when he analogizes his baldness to breast cancer, saying (to paraphrase): \\"Baldness is to men what breast cancer is to women.

He's funny and there's something endearing about the way he writes -- yes he's gay, and yes that necessarily \\"colors\\" his worldview -- but talking about a job you hate, a family you loathe, and a partner who amazingly tolerates you are necessarily universal.That said, he lapses here.

Magical Thinking, ok I guess it will be funny little novel thing....wow.... wrong!The first one, about him as a kid (ok, fine but there was no cool point or twist)then in most of the other stories, there's always something about his sexuality, sex this and sex that I didn't expect it... but went for it anyway...still tho, no real twist (except the cab priest).The white mouse one is pure animal cruelty, kinda freaky.So, well, it's not the worst book ever but it's definitely not what the backcover is presenting or the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Though I read this book a few years ago for the first time, I decided to pick it up again - desperate for a funny read to erase the depressing taste the last book I finished (Timoleon Vieta Come Home) left in its wake. Luckily, I hadn't remembered very much about it at all, so it really felt like reading a brand new book! Unfortunately, I did recall laughing more than I did this time around. But the few funny parts were really very hilarious - namely the cleaning lady and the shrimp and the killing of the rat/thing. But, overall, it seemed... more arrogantly amusing than truly funny. I don't know - I just really prefer David Sedaris' writing. This book just seems like a more self-involved, graphic version of the same basic idea of essays. Not that it was bad, at all, I did enjoy it, I just wouldn't recommend it with the same fervor that I would David Sedaris' books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not fun","review":"I loved \\"Running with Scissors\\" and \\"Dry\\", so I expected good things from this book. I was very disappointed.I don't even like Augusten Burroughs as a person anymore. He appears to be a narcissistic, mean spirited, shallow piece of crap. This book wasn't funny like his others. It was disturbing to read about someone Augusten's age acting like a spoiled 3 yr old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumbled","review":"Building on \\"Running with Scissors\\" or \\"Dry,\\" you could easily feel that this book might have even more to offer about this author's life. However, while I felt the stories were mildly amusing and Burrough's has a talent for sarcastic writing (like Bill Bryson or Mary Roach), this book I found overall chaotic and without merit. Why aren't the stories in chronological order at the very least? What is the point of this book? It seems almost as if you're listening to a friend talk endlessly about himself with no regard for what you might like to hear (or pay for). There's no cohesive bond to hold the stories together other than they are about the author. Perhaps it's time for time for Burrough's to show a little versatility and less self-indulgence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruelty is not funny","review":"I have to say it: I was actually enjoying this book until the rat/thing chapter. But reading the descriptive way Burroughs tortures, blinds, and drowns another living creature made me actually sick. I know not everyone has empathy for animals, but even the most seasoned hunter can still recognize the need for humane killing of unwanted pests. Burroughs makes a joke comparing himself to a serial killer. And honestly, he may be one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is my first Augusten book. And I have to admit I really liked the first chapter or two. It reminded me of the very talented David Sedaris. However, Burroughs lacks something Sedaris has - - and that is decency. There's a line you cross to become humorous, and Burroughs has leaped way beyond it, in fact rented a Hummer and completely run over and demolished it. I'm not a \\"prude\\", I mean I actually was able to enjoy the twisted nature of \\"The Tetherballs of Bougainville\\" but this came at a cheap trashy expense - which turned out not quite funnny at all. Sadly I gave up on the book early on when he mentioned the encounter with the undertaker and ... well I wont go any further. I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely acceptable; nothing like the entertaing, captivating \\"Dry\\" or \\"Running with Scissors\\"","review":"\\"Dry\\" and \\"Running with Scissors\\" were fascinating, moving, and frightening memoirs by Augusten Burroughs. Both were worth every minute spent reading them. But \\"Magical Thinking\\" is just a random collection of experiences that make Augusten Burroughs seem insensitive and cold. Perhaps that was his goal. Few stories in \\"Magical Thinking\\" are fundamentally entertaining. The ones that are, however, almost (but not quite) make it worth reading. I'd take a pass and read something else if I had my time back."},{"rating":"1","title":"No magic or thinking","review":"Before reading this book, it is important to remember that Burroughs is not Sedaris. While Sedaris' stories are sweet and life-affirming, Burroughs shows just how ugly and cruel the human animal can be. There is nothing \\"magical\\" about these stories. These stories are the most banal of life's events put under the microscope of a neurotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!!!","review":"Now that we know J.T. Leroy was probably a housewife making up stories about a life which wasn't true, it's sooooooooo refreshing to read Augusten Burroughs's highly personal, often funny, and riveting explorations of, well, himself.

So adios, Leroy, don't let the door hit you on the..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical indeed","review":"Having read RUNNING WITH SCISSORS, I was eager to embrace the author's other attempts at writing. DRY was next, and then I found this book-------MAGICAL THINKING. It's truly amazing that Augusten Burroughs could keep up this pace, mining more and more elements from his childhood and adult life; molding them into hilarious and dark tales that keep the reader captivated for hours. Some of it is edgy, some raw. And some is brilliant! I must also recommend another great Amazon pick that I recently came across titled BARK OF THE DOGWOOD which is somewhat of a combination of Sedaris and some of the more gothic Southern writers. VERY funny and dark also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Thinking","review":"It was an ok book. I have read all of his books and this one didn't impress me that much.

I thought most of it was hilarious and truly enjoyed it. I kept thinking about what the 80 year olds in the center must have thought, but there it was, right on the shelf of their library. I guess Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn hadn't noticed it yet. As far as the animal cruelty aspect of it goes, I think people react to the way the narrative is expressed rather than the act itself. There are far more gruesome things reported daily in American newspapers that I think more worthy to advise friends not to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"this one hit the spot.","review":"This is Augusten Burroughs we're talking about, he's always going to be amazing. I like this Augusten a little more. Less dark, and more of in a balanced place in his life. Stories range from his childhood and being in a Tang commercial, to hiring a money-grubbing house cleaner when he lives in New York. He speaks from his gut, and from his heart. It's honesty and it's exactly what I'm thinking. His sense of humor and wit never fail me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick funny...","review":"If you like Sedaris, you'll really enjoy this Burroughs book much more than his previous writings. He's admirable for surviving such a weird and tragic childhood but in this book I see a talented adult/writer that gives the past the finger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burroughs--one of the greastest 'tragic humorists' ....","review":"...of our day. The Great Mark Twain had underlying humor woven into his writings, Burroughs has obvious humor written so subjectively that you forget yourself. It takes great skill to write any powerful feeling subjectively (I should know), and that is a trademark of not a good author, but a great author. I loved running with scissors, well, this is another great book of tragic humor. It is such a healing to laugh about pain, while feeling for the person simultaneously---Burrroughs elicits that response, continually. He has the gift of 'healing' via his writing. I strongly suggest that this book (or Running With Scissors) be given as gifts this Chrismas, especially to people going through crisis."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the one","review":"This is a mandatory product for the wife - she swears by it.. buy it through Amazon to get a much better price than through your local beauty retailer which seem to have HUGE markups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static City!","review":"I do not like this product for my hair type.

But the sequel is still very entertaining with plenty of excellent fight scenes.The setting is British-occupied Hong Kong where we find Ip Man trying to open a martial arts school. He must prove himself as a capable master before the corrupt, locally established Masters will permit him to become an instructor.

Instead of saying biceps, it says 'ribcage' which was disappointing when I had my friends over to watch it and they never seen it before. I had to stop the movie and tell them about the mistake, then continue watching. Other than that - the movie is fantastic - flows really nicely (it has the same run-time as Ip Man 1 but feels shorter when you watch them back-to-back). It's funny, enjoyable and has a lot of whoop-ass from our very much loved Donnie Yen - definitely one to add to the collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Sequel!","review":"There used to be one top MA movie for me and that was Enter The Dragon. Sadly, that is now number three in my favorites, Ip Man and Ip Man 2 taking the top spots.

Then they can reach in, hanging upside down, and get all the seed they want, never putting a foot on the hinged perch. I suppose a smaller squirrel might not be able to reach the seeds with their back feet grabbing the wire, but I'm not sure.This feeder may work if you put it on a post rather than hanging it, and it does come with an additional bit that you can screw on to make it sit on top of a 4\\"x4\\" post.

These stories were sensitive and age-appropriate tales of a toddler learning proper behavior.This collection (unabridged) included these stories in addition to some new stories we had never seen. These turned out to include ample examples of bad behavior. For instance, in the \\"Eat Your Dinner\\" story Bartholomew only eats dinner when he knows he will get dessert. In the \\"Go To Bed\\" story, Bartholomew fights with George every step of the way. Our kids may do this on their own, but I don't know what we gain by demonstrating bad behavior in books. If you want to buy \\"Ba and George\\" books, try to buy them individually so that you can be selective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book?","review":"I see the positive reviews of this book, but I don't understand why. Although I know Bartholomew bear obeys in the end, the way he fights what he is told and says no I do not believe is a good example to our children. They need to learn to obey right away. It is not cute or funny that he says no to his parents when told to do something. And reading it to our kids will make them think it's okay to say no as long as they obey in the end. We all know that things we read to them and let them watch contribute to their thinking. I think it's so much better to teach them to say okay right away. It teaches them to challenge authority, and in a society where the young people have so little respect for authority, this is the last thing they need. I don't mean to read too much into the book, but it seems but the \\"nah\\" seems to be the recurring theme in the books, and neither I nor my husband liked this book. I seem to be a minority here as far as my opinion, but I am really that far off base?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Redux '92: Live in Japan - Utopia","review":"OK hands down this album is a must for any Todd Rundgren fan. Todd and his band Utopia started in the early 70's and for the most part have played through out the years or worked with Todd on verious projects. Redux '92; - Live in Japan is one very good live album from start to finsh. It seems that musician's who choose to record live in Japan get a more involved audeance. Deep Purple, Cheap Trick & Santana have all had great albums that were record in Japan.

Even some of the stuff I couldnt stand was given a rather nicew 'treatmnet.' 'The Ikon' and 'Hiroshima' alone are worth the price of the cd...but then there are some other gems on here inc. 'Trapped' 'Back On The Streets' and 'Fix Your Gauze' In the works and is finalized, is the Utopia II reunion W/ TR Moogy Klingman John Siegler Ralph Shuckett and Kevin Ellman.

The Cateye TL-LD500-R was advertised as being carrier ready. It was not. The screw to mount it to the carrier was at least 1/4 inch too long and the mounting materials did not come with washers or some other way to fill the gap. I ended up putting the light on my saddle post; however, if I wear a long coat or put my briefcase on the carrier, the light will be hidden. Furthermore, if I had intended to mount it on the saddle post, I would have bought the much brighter Planet Bike taillight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid switch","review":"Firstly, the light is bright and uses the easier-to-find-and-replace AAA batteries. But 'replace' is the operative word here. The very exposed and touchy power button was an awful idea. I can't tell you how many times I've opened my backpack or duffel bag to find my gear illuminated with a creepy red glow. A slider or switch would have been much simpler. Other than that it's a really good light, but the backpack-bump-parity-counting feature is unnecessary and frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light","review":"Bought this light to help me on early morning rides to work.It mounts to my Topeak rack perfectly so that I can use my bag.Has blink feature wich I like.Only problem I had was accessing the light button once it was mounted to my bike rack.

He was definitely right. Not only are were-ravens extremely interesting, and the book it's self amusing. It's a wonderful change of style from the typical werewolf characters. Were-ravens aren't slash and kill characters, but they have other interesting skills that lend depth to any game I've seen them in.

The fabric patterns are bold and colorful and seem easy to clean as well, which is good. I also like that it has 2 pieces; the mirror detaches from the plush triangular base to allow you to strap it to your crib or elsewhere, which is also handy. Though the item description does say \\"colors may vary,\\" (and I was hoping they would) I did get the colors shown in the picture--mostly purple, which is fine I guess. Also, this is by far the best price I have found. The image may be slightly distorted at times (depending on how close/far away you are to it or if it gets bent) but I feel like that's typical for \\"child safe,\\" thin, plastic mirrors, so for the safety of my child I am willing to see passed that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this mirror...","review":"I wanted to like this mirror, but the fact that it came to me looking like some other baby already had played with it for 6 months makes me a little upset!

Instead of just being the aimless brute he has sometimes portrayed, Moment of Romance really gives him an excellent chance to shine. The plot follows Wah Dee as he is persuaded to be a getaway driver for the dangerous Trumpet (Tommy Wong). After the police stumble upon the robbery, Wah Dee uses an innocent girl as a hostage to ensure the safe escape of himself and his contemparies. Trumpet insists that she could identify them and should be killed. Dee, however, preserves her and a bond develops between them. However, with Trumpet seeking to take over the gang, Wah Dee is soon in danger alongside his new-found love. This film really touches the heart with its skillful development of the characters and the gradual love between the doomed lovers. Wu Chien Lien is innocence personified and her performance really lingers in the memory.

Only 3 songs (his 3 biggest hits: \\"Me and You And A Dog Named Boo\\", \\"I'd Love You to Want Me\\" & \\"Don't Expect Me To Be Your Friend\\") are duplicated on both albums.What makes this one so great is that it contains my 2 all-time favorite albums cuts of his: \\"Rock And Roll Days\\" & \\"Goodbye Is Just Another Word\\" from his \\"Calumet\\" album. I wish all of his original albums were made into CD's. He really put out some great work on them back then, and the public is being robbed by not being able to enjoy them today."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I like this singer and he sounds so good on CD.

My kids and I enjoy playing tinkertoys together and I feel like they are really learning something. I do recommend that you buy a larger set.

After all, you can never have too many Tinkertoys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspires creativity- a lost art these days","review":"I'm surprised by some of the poor reviews. We've had this set of Tinker Toys for 2 years now and it's always something my kids go back to. No issues with broken pieces and I can tell you my children are rough!The thing I, as a parent, like best about this toy is that it allows the children to use their own minds to make whatever they want. My kids have made everything from \\"dog bones\\" to \\"microphones\\" to \\"eyeglasses\\", even the occasional \\"plate of food\\" and more. No instructions needed! If you are concerned that you cannot make the patterns on the box then you are micro-managing your children's play time and stifling their creativity.\\"Classic\\" toys without batteries and noise are a rarity today but I seek them out.

That set also had 66 pieces, and they were mainly wood with only 4 plastic pieces (the green windmill fans). The current set is NOT THE SAME as the one I bought 5 or 10 years ago; the current set has 66 pieces, but 24 of them are plastic pieces!!! In other words, six times as much plastic! They should label it \\"SOME REAL WOOD PIECES.\\" Disappointing, and much less \\"the classic\\" than it used to be. The plastic Tinker Toys break much easier; some new sets are ALL plastic, and I avoid them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"My kids get super frustrated because the pegs fall out of the holes.

I bought it for my 3 year old (a very large boy & normal strength) He is unable to fit the pieces together. I have trouble with many. They fit VERY tight. He has broken several pieces by trying to shove them in or pull them apart. Other pieces fit much too loose.What it has come down to is this....\\"mom can you please build me something with the Tinkertoys?\\"Um....I have a better idea son, let's go buy a toy you can actually play with yourself.

Unfortunately, since there are no detailed, step by step isntructions, we found it too frustrating to reproduce some of the elaborate creations pictured on the container. We also broke several pieces in the first few hours. Maybe I'm just spoiled with K'Nex, and the very detailed instructions they come with. Maybe for some kids who just want to use their imagination to build their own creations, this would be a good toy. My son really wanted to build the creations pictured on the container, so this toy did not work for us, so we returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"better choices out there . . .","review":"Feeling nostalgic and romanticizing the educational value of *classic* toys, I decided to buy this one for my 4 yr old son for Christmas. At the same time, my SIL bought him a \\"Kid K'Nex Roll and Go Pal.\\" I was dissapointed that she purchased a competing toy so I defiantly broke out the Tinker Toy first. Both of my children were quickly bored. The wood pieces were very stiff and hard to fit together and, well . . . I'm not sure how to describe this but, the various pieces don't make any sense. It's as if someone took a bunch of different shaped objects and threw them into a can. They don't relate together in any meaningful way. I couldn't think of ANYTHING interesting to build and neither could my kids So, we moved onto the K'Nex and the kids have been playing with it ever since.

It is poorly made with the wooden dowels not fitting in many of the round wooden connectors. Some holes are drilled too large and others too small. One of the wooden connectors cracked the first time we put a dowel in. Lots of plastic tubing parts that take up space in the packaging tube but aren't either easy or fun to use. The enclosed instruction book has sample diagrams that are not possible to make with the pieces enclosed in my set.

I cannot speak for the plastic set, but the wooden set is certainly not made the way it was when I was a child.I bought this for a Christmas present, and a month later many of the parts are damaged.Many of the ends of the rods have cracked off. A few rods broke when I was playing with my two daughters, so I know the breakage occured during average and gentle play.I was very disapointed in the overall quality.

I divided up all of the pieces 4 ways. each child having the same type and amount of each piece. then i pair up 2 students . one child makes an object(real or imagined) the other student does not see the object (use a folder to screen) then the student must explain to the other student how to make the object using prepositions, adjectives, and appropriate verbs and sequencing words (first, then, next, finally, etc). success is measured at how closely the object resembles the original.the kids will want to do this over and over again and gain experience explaining a process to others.have fun"},{"rating":"1","title":"broken pieces","review":"I purchased a tinkertoy set for my grandaughter for Christmas.

Tozer, a man who served as a pastor for 44 years without benefit of any college or seminary training. Tozer discusses 10 of God's attributes, from his mercy and grace to his immensity and holiness. In the back of the book, David Fessenden adds a study guide which can be used by an individual or by a group. Tozer contends that our faith can only be as big as our God and he feels that we have \\"watered down\\" our Lord and as a result, we have also reduced out faith. In each chapter Tozer tells the reader about one of God's characteristics, then defines it and discusses how this attribute effects the life of the believer. In the process he answers questions such as \\"Why Are We Not Happy?\\" and shows us that God is perfect and infinite in every way. God's Lordship derives not from what He does but in who He is, and Tozer does a good job of helping us understand that better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I have order many items from amazon.com, but this calculator I received is going to be my last order from this website."},{"rating":"2","title":"a brilliant and incisive study","review":"Kimmerling has produced a brilliant account of the waning of Israel's hegemonic secular Zionist meta-culture and his meticulous analysis of the emergence of Israel's vibrant subcultures and countercultures is not to be missed.

In this work he ignores those researches which point to the fact that the overwhelming majority of Israel's citizens share basic values, as to the Jewish and democratic character of the state and tries to argue that Israel is falling apart into seven different socio- ethnic tribal groups.The real point is that Kimmerling aims at helping produce the disintegration he is claiming exists.My suspicion however is that the state of Israel will be thriving long after Mr.Kimmerling is no longer available to deliver us his awkwardly written distortions."},{"rating":"1","title":"locks didn't work","review":"So-So packaging - arrived with slight damage.

I found the characters indistinguishable from each other. In fact, I kept having to flip back to the beginning of the book to remember the differences between Nat and Fletcher, Tom and Jimmy.Actually, the characters are so uniformly flat, it seems even the author himself couldn't keep them separated. On page 70 of the soft-cover version, Archer has Jimmy replying to Nat (he meant to write \\"Tom\\" but obviously the editor of this book had fallen asleep by this point too). Archer goes back to using Tom after the first error -- but it just compounded my frustration with the boring, similar characters.Enough said.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find the coin toss","review":"I agree with the disappointment of the factual errors in the book. However, for those that skimmed pages you missed the clue to the winner of the coin toss at the end.

There were several shock sections and a lot of jumping from one main character to the other. I find this difficult when using my Kindle as I can't flick back in the book to check on some detail I hadn't absorbed. This is one of the disadvantages with E-Readers. I was disgusted with the print production.

Boy, was I wrong! This novel reads like Danielle Steel wrote it- full of trite phrases and hokey dialogue that only shows that Mr. Archer must not be conversing a great deal lately. Also, the time frames do not match up with the characters: if they are twins, Nat goes to Vietnam when he is in his first year of college, (18) stays 2 years and comes back when he is 19? Simultaneously, his \\"twin\\" is now at Yale Law? Huh?The worst part of the book is the ending- (stop here if you don't want to know...)a rival reveals secrets that lead Nat's talented and sensitive son to suicide (even though it had NOTHING to do with him..) and the two brothers find themselves at last- only to agree never to acknowledge each other. Neither of these incidents stop them from campaigning for governor..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microwaved Jeffrey Archer","review":"Archer is one of my favorite authors, but Sons of Fortune is nothing more than Kane and Abel nuked in a microwave. It has none of the emotion or well-drawn out characters that make Archer such an enjoyable author. It has all of the hallmarks of Archer books (two protagonists, a antoganist that stretches back to childhood, lots of women, business takeovers, etc.) with none of the juicy storytelling that allows Archer to rise above being a supermarket-rack novelist. The ending (last few chapters) is entirely implausible, as Archer allows the story to careen out of control. The end of the book turns into a Perry Mason movie. Archer needs to get off the two warring protagonists kick and get back to writing other storylines. A promising start turns into a disappointing finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far fetched idea, but still a good story","review":"It's interesting reading the other reviews of this book. For most of Archer's books, readers are in general agreement in their reviews. Not this one! I for one, liked it very much. I agree that the whole premise that the story is based on, the way the twins are separated at birth, is a little far-fetched, but Archer built a great story on that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What century is this? What country is this?","review":"There are lots of other reviews that summarize the plot. I just want to record my reaction to the book. IT'S TERRIBLE! The text sounds like it was written by a Martian who read some bad early 20th century American literature. Maybe Brits should't try to fake American. The plot is ludicrous. The handling of small matters is very sloppy. I wasted my time on 189 (of 503) pages and came away with nothing other than the desire to warn others to keep away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as always","review":"I have read some who simply hate this book by Archer. I must say while it could be a little better in terms of layout, structure and proofreading, the story itself is interesting enough.Let's not forget this is merely a work of fiction and it thus should be considered just that.

I can ignore the anachronisms (Yale coed in the 1960s). I can even overlook minor errors (Officer Cadet School, instead of Officer Candidate School).This monstrous political novel bizarrely distorts American politics. There apparently was no fact-checking done regarding American politics in this novel of American politics written by an English lord. The competing candidates for the Republican nomination for Connecticut governor endure separate primaries or caucuses in every town in the state, on different dates? Their chances of winning the Republican nomination depend on the Electoral College? Beyond bizarre.

This one didn't compare. It started out pretty well, but my attention lagged at parts, and the ending was disappointing. I found the suicide of Nat's son pointless. Lucy's relationship with George could have been interesting, but she ends up just saying he's only a friend and gets an abortion. The scene big revelation at the end was a letdown. Many reviewers have pointed out inaccuracies, and I'll mention one no one else has: Archer makes the character of Su Ling half Korean. He correctly points out that Koreans are different than Chinese and Japanese, but obviously did not research authentic Korean names. The names he gives to Korean characters sound more like Chinese. It would have been very simple to look up a few real Korean names. This is just something that annoyed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What craft? (Reference reviewer Peter Senese.)","review":"I read only 54 pages of this book. The really irritating number of typographical and grammatical errors, along with the anachronistic behavior of the initial few characters and a numbingly obvious plot, made it too painful to continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Archer at the top of his craft . . .","review":"As a fellow scribe, I have learned to appreciate the storytellers who have the ability of fully consumming a reader into their story. In Jeffrey Archer's 'Sons of Fortune', Archer, surely one of the most prolific writers of our time, has crafted a compelling, thoughtful, and complex story filled with fascinating tid-bits that keep the reader grounded, but somehow racing for more.As a big fan of Mr. Archer's written work, I think 'Sons of Fortune' is his greatest work as of yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst","review":"This improbable (more like impossible) story is so filled with gaps and poor research it would be laughable even from a first time author. Mr. Archer seems to have no knowledge of how the draft lottery worked (selected by birthdate) as one twin recieves a notice yet the other doesn't, nor how deferements worked. He never bothered to find out the difference between a Warrant Officer and a Commissioned Officer in the US military. He mish mash of time has a college junior starting law school. Then, of course, is his complete ignorance of how either primary elections or a general elaction for Governor works. Perhaps Mr. Archer should invest some of his royalties in a researcher to get at least some of the details right. Other then that the charaters are cardboard and the dialogue mostly childish. This book is a severe disappointment even by Mr. Archer's standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Vietnam Research","review":"His total lack of knowledge regarding Vietnam military operations, equipment, and terminology show that Archer didn't bother with basic research.

Kane and Abel, another one with an Australian media moghul and this one. Two lives growing up apart and then coming together. Kane and Abel brought tears to eyes while reading description of Abel in Europe. This novel brought yawns.To be fair, I like his style, so kept reading. But overall everything was predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - but great reading for transatlantic flight!","review":"Intriguing idea, but Archer disappoints. Elliot is a great villain, but there's no revelation on his motivations. Improbably, Nat and Fletcher do not even react when they are told the BIG NEWS. Archer fails to explain the thrust behind Nat's and Fletcher's political leanings, in spite of introducing ambiguities surrounding both of their politics during their high school/college years. Get this book if you need something to distract you during a flight... otherwise, I would give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fairy Tale for Prep-School New Englanders","review":"I was interested by the blurb on this audio CD and so rented it for a long drive. It started off fairly interesting as the initial set of circumstances and setting is well described. After that, it plays like a fairy-tale. The characters are totally one-dimensional and the plot is very contrived. There is one plot turn that is totally preposterous; the author must be out of touch with today's youth or must have been completely out of ideas to advance the plot. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard characters","review":"I've always been a fan of Jeffrey Archer, but I must admit that I'm a bit disappointed with this offering. The characters are cardboard cutouts. Both Fletcher & Nat are tall, good looking, extremely bright, witty, ambitious & with nerves of steel... there is not a single flaw in them! Ralph Ellison is the bad guy - slimy, evil... not a single virtue! And this separated at birth bit... come on, Lord Archer, you could've been a bit more original than that. . 'Kane & Abel', though similar (parallel lives etc.)was a far better book. My favourite remains ,Honour Among Thieves' apart from his early works."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"As a true Archer fan, I couldn't wait for this book to come out. I had to have it the first day and what a waste. I was so disappointed with this book. It was so predictable that it is not worth the paper it is written on.

What a disappointment! I was confused and could not keep track of which twin was the Taft or Hotchkiss, Harvard or Yale, etc. Thought I must be losing it until the author showed he was in a fog as well, attributing a deed to one twin which belonged to the other. Mercy! I know the author is currently incarcerated but surely there are fewer distractions there and he could do better. Skip this one, Archer fans or have fun looking for errors. Where was his editor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute waste of time","review":"I can sum this entire book up as follows: absurd contrivance after absurd contrivance.

Highly Recommend this seller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Version of Mutiny on the Bounty, period.","review":"Despite the negative reception this film received during its initial release (much related to Brando's infamous behavior on the set) this version of the historic mutiny is beautifully shot, intelligently scripted, and moves along at a good pace. Trevor Howard plays Captain Bligh as a truly misguided tyrant and commands attention whenever he is on screen. Marlon Brando plays Fletcher Christian as a gentrified dandy, that adds a very interesting dimension to the dynamics between the two leads, lending considerable weight to Christian's reluctant decision to mutiny. Lots of crackling dialog, much sweeping action. Bligh's dance at the behest of Hiti-Hiti is worth the purchase price. A great tale, very well told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate to history, long, very slow","review":"This is easily the worst of the three versions. Its historical accuracy is terrible and for some unknown reason the writers simply made up details that just never happened in any account. The ending is not even close. I didn't think Bligh seemed as cruel as his actions indicated. Christian was interestingly interpreted but did not seem authentic. As a huge Mutiny on the Bounty fan, having read multiple versions of the books and seen all the movies, I would not recommend this to anyone. Rent the 1st or 3rd version if you are only going to see one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutiny on the Bounty","review":"This earlier version of the epic tale of the sea is not as well done as the later version with Mel Gibson. Mr. Brando in my humble opinion did not play Fletcher Christian very convincing for a mutineer. The jacket states he is a 'dandy' transformed into a man of action--I am not convinced. He looked too much a dandy through the whole thing.Trevor Howard as William Bligh was not played affectivly as I think the book relates, but it did receive high praises from the Academy Awards nominating process, but like giving the Nobel Peace Prize to peace impersonators and politicans without credentials, the awards are somewhat suspicious whether they actually mean anything.Great work on the sailing of the ship though for when it was produced. Not comparible to 'Master and Commander' and the genius of Mel Gibson or Russell Crowe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bounty","review":"We enjoyed seeing this movie, and it prompted us to watch the Anthony Hopkins/Mel Gibson version also. The characters of Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian were very much different in the two films, and the historical summary at the end of the Gibson movie evidently indicates that it was the correct interpretation. On its own, the movie has great acting, and is enjoyable watching, though it appears to have taken literary liberties. Knowing this now, I find the ending a little weak.All things considered, we will continue to call bossy, inflexible people \\"Captain Bligh\\" as both characterizations showed that, just to differing degrees. This version would be the classic definition, and the one we would have in mind. We may look for the Clark Gable version to round out the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"MUTINY\\" OF 1962 WITH BRANDO IS UNDERRATED","review":"The 1962 film based on the Nordoff/Hall book about the \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" is an under-appreciated work of cinema. Aside from the beautiful settings the characters do the story well. Trevor Howard'sBligh is a cruel, inhuman taskmaster (even though the real Bligh wasn'tthat bad). The Tahitians who were tricked into serving aboard the Bountywasn't brought out, but that is another story, outside the book. The crewof the Bounty couldn't have been a better group of actors. Then there'sBrando's Fletcher Christian. Okay, maybe he was a little over the topin some respects, but more appealing than Clark Gable or Mel Gibson'sChristian. Don't agree? Take a longboat on a long voyage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even watch!","review":"When I received the product the DVD case had a gash in the top right hand corner!

He simply isn't credible as a naval officer or a leader.Though Brando's bizarre performance is the big problem, the movie has some other problems too. For some reason, the story is not clearly focused on the conflict between Captain Bligh (Trever Howard in an adequate if not great performance) and Mr. Christian. All the distractions drain energy from the action. Some good supporting players like Richard Harris and the great African-American actor Frank Silvera are completely wasted in their roles.Do yourself a favor and watch the 1935 Charles Laughton/Clark Gable version instead. It may not be as pretty as this overblown white elephant, but it's a rip-roaring good time at the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) HD DVD","review":"As I was viewing this movie (on my HD DVD player) it became obvious that video and audio were out of sync. I checked on other (HD)DVD's and everything was perfect, wich made me to believe that the problem was related to this particular DVD. I brought this to the attention of Amazon and they immediately corrected the situation by sending me another DVD. However, this one also exhibited the same lack of synchronisation between video and audio. What a shame, cause this movie belongs to my alltime favorites. So, two stars for the video part, wich was excellent, but minus three for the audio that was not able to keep up with the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good remake!","review":"This new version showed Brando in a very demanding role who deserved him a nomination as Best Actor facing the merciless authority of a serious superior officer, the capatain Bligh (Trevor Howard)The confrontation between him and his superior lost a good part of its dramatic punch due the excessively long sequence when the men arrive to the Island.Respect the first version in 1935, the film captures just a part of its sparkling success. The excessive details and its overlong timing weakened the expected punch. Brando exceeds to Bogart but nobody could blurry the superb acting of Charles Laughton in the original version of 1935.Nevertheless this is a recommendable film for Brando's fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fateful three hour trip","review":"When Marlon Brando made up his mind to turn in a great performance, there was almost nobody else on the screen.

The main argument of the book is that cultural frontiers in early North america were \\"two-way\\"- interactive and dynamic. Thus, both sides influenced each other. The author attempted also to \\"write history from the other side of the frontier.\\" (p.10) He is sympathetic to the Indian's point of view and tries to shed some light and understanding upon it.He rejects the perception about the European moral superiority over the Indians and argues that the French and the English governments periodically fostered scalping of European and Indian enemies by offering bounties or other economic incentives. (p.269)The only drawback of the book is the Axtell is repating himself, because this book is a compilation of papers and chapters from previous books, so he doesn't have a lot of new information in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"balance","review":"I often buy this book as a gift for friends who are interested in international criminal law.

There are three separate subplots with three separate main characters. This causes the story line to be somewhat convoluted. It would have been better to tell the story in first person from the POV of each character. It would have made it easier to read.The writing is literate. The setting is in the 1970's. Vietnam is winding down. There are good location descriptions, although too many locale changes do not leave the intended impression of fast moving events. However the character sketches are good.The many plot shifts and somewhat stilted dialogue make it difficult reading but the author overcomes the difficulties and the reader is carried through to an enjoyable ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to make policy...","review":"I'm the director of the Masters in Advocacy and Political Leadership (MAPL) Program at University of Minnesota Duluth.

The sounds created by this Scottish duo are pure beauty & are as addictive (& effective) as any mind-expanding narcotic. Buy this album & listen to it everywhere... it creates the perfect mood for any environment & its atmospheric quality is equalled by no other cd i've heard yet (except for maybe Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient works, volume II).

Inspired by documentaries and the voices of children at play, BOC create hypnotic soundscapes that often have your synapses playing catchup to their sonic wizardry. \\"Telephasic Workshop\\" is not only funky, it's transcendent. \\"Roygbiv\\" and \\"Olson\\" both clock in at less than 3 minutes, yet they are two of this album's most exquisite gems. Chopped up vocals and pulsating bass propel \\"Sixtyten\\" into some very weird territory. Anyone who spent time reciting times tables in front of a classroom will appreciate \\"Aquarius\\".At 18 songs and 70 minutes, Music Has The Right To Children never overstays its welcome because, in creating such a unique sound, BOC simultaneously create the perfect haven in which to dwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"new age electronic lounge music","review":"hmmm. i must admit i'm confused by all the effusive praise heaped on this album by the legions of rabid Boards of Canada supporters out there. maybe I'm missing something. this entire album sounds like background music for a stark, highly stylized and designed lounge in New York or Stockholm where turtlenecked hipsters sit on uncomfortable chairs and talk quietly with expensive cocktails. Or maybe tunes for a Diesel store? It is indeed mellow in a repetitive, \\"what will they do with their Moog synthesizer and drum machine next?\\" kind of way. It's just not all that challenging or interesting to listen to, in my opinion. I guess I'd just suggest that anyone ready to hit \\"Add to cart\\" first give the linked track snippets a listen first to make sure they know what they're getting into here....

While most techno is derived from variations on a standard theme (Trance, Dance, House, what have you), the Boards break all the molds here. Listening to it brings back feelings that some of the most revolutionary recordings in techno (Black Dog's \\"Bytes\\", Aphex Twin's \\"Selected Ambient Works...\\") gave me.

There is no excuse not to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Board-er line brilliance","review":"Disconcerting, disturbing and curious are not words that lend themselves to great music readily. In the case of Boards of Canada, however, there are few more suitable - the whole album has an otherworldly feel to it, with hazy beats underpinning snatches of sampled speech, children's voices and keyboards. The creators live up to the mysticism that the music evokes too - members of the cult of The Purple Octagon Sun (whatever that might be), they are extremely elusive and media-shy. The album has no obvious beginning or end, with tracks that blend into one another leaving no obvious boundaries. Mysterious and enchanting, this is music everybody's children have the right to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, fuzzy, trippin', laying, sitting, moving, being ...","review":"Own this! Like MBV's \\"Loveless\\" and very few others, this album is seemless in all respects. It evokes a consistently shifting, floating feel that adds eternal depth to the tunes. Indeed it evokes the feel of soundtracks to scenes never seen and only (and ever) felt. Comparisons to other bands can be left to others.

I sat down and listened to the CD, devoting all my attention to it - and I didn't hear anything! Not literally, of course; the music just seemed empty.

While a track like Rue the Whirl harkens sadness and alienation, Aquarius (my high point on the cd) is expansive and awe-inspiring (what a track!). Then there are warm, dreamy passages as well, such as The Color of Fire. A sense of the seventies is recalled but not without a firm nineties edge. There is a prevailing mood or reverence for the mystery in all things. Very creative. Very trippy and cosmic, and at the end, a civic word of wisdom. Well not quite the end - Happy Cycling really leaves me wanting more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like trance buy this...","review":"... Because if you do you'll soon realise how vacuous and emotionless it is, and how, when done properly (as it is here) Electronic music can transcend the build-ups, break-downs and same old arpeggiated cod-eastern tuneage that trance has given us, and become something truly amazing. An astonishing record.Believe the hype, this is one of the greatest albums of the last millenium."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"This is good stuff through a pair of headphones.

The impression I got was that this would be the kind of stuff you would hear played in the background of some venue that attracted very pretentious people. The kind that continuously shift their opinions in accordance with what got thumbs up from the latest edition of an entertainment magazine. I guess if that is what this kind of music is aimed at then yeah, it does a good job, but life changing it most certainly aint. Interesting, it is not. Nostalgic, no. Uneventful....?

Extremely interesting music. I liked most of the songs on there. But the legal note in the song \\"One very important thought\\" talks about censorship and protecting our constitutional rights. It got me curious why someone would censor music like this. I searched on the internet and didn't find much except somebody saying something about their involvement with porn (Maybe on the CD cover ???). But What I Did Find was that almost all of their CD's are riddled with references to the birth of the satanic church, hypnotism, brainwashing, and the cult movements.

His effort to stick to the KJV text at all cost is very laudable per se but negates the advantages of more modern translation techniques.

It wasn't even operated in a closed area like in a house or a building. I used it in an open area, with the 2 radios seperated by couple of blocks. As a matter of fact, it didn't even reach 1/2 mile when transmission starts breaking up and gets noisy. If gone further than that, it's a total transmission lost. Moreover, the battery drains pretty fast also. Gotta say that it's really dissapointing having to spend 50 over dollar for below 1/2 miles of talking range."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointment","review":"I bought a pair of these Motorola radios and they worked when I checked them out. When I got them into the mountains of British Columbia they had a range of less than 50 feet. I talked to the paid apologists at Motorola's 800 line. They said if I sent them in maybe I would get a replacement set in 4 to 6 weeks. They also hinted that I was too dumb to use the radios. Take my advice: go another direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I had no luck with this item.

Then I ordered them, tried them for an hour and ended up hating them. The funtionality and ergonomics are great. They feel fine in your hand and the quality of the buttons, screen and range are fine -- BUT! I couldn't understand a word a person was saying into the other radio. At any volume level it was fuzzy, muddy and completely distorted. This was equally irritating on either radio. There was no interference, no static, just inconceivable communication. I also tried other GMRS radios from other manufacturers and found some to be identical, and one to be perfect. Among the others was another Motorola brand that was much higher in price and featured higher quality, but sounded exactly the same. So I think it's a design flaw in thier speakers. Fix that, and future models might turn out fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't they be honest?","review":"10 miles? I bought the 6510 at Costco. I had my doubts but I figured if they advertised 10 miles surely it would do at least a couple. But only if you are on the water or other flat plain. Why do you need one of these if you can see the person? They only work if you have a direct line of sight and that was only a mile or two at most. But get over a hill or within trees or houses and absolutely nothing! I lost my party!Pros - I liked the design and it was easy to use. The NOAA weather did work - if that's all you need. Fits in a pocket.Cons - DOES NOT WORK to keep track of your party. It takes 14 hours to recharge.The good reviews in here must work for Motorola. Mine are going back to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorola Radios Great for Conference Setting","review":"At a age where cell phones abound, we found ourselves staging a conference where there is no cell service and the conference center is sprawling (two square miles). These radios were the answer to communucation problems that the staff encountered. We used thirty radios to keep connected in two teams and even found it easy to communicate with the other team easily when needed. The only disadvantage is that they recharge in pairs. We solved this by recharging all of them in two central locations, and the team members picked them up each morning. They provided great clear transmission and communication between staff was a breeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exchanged them for Motorola SX700","review":"I don't know if I just got a bad pair of radios, but they didn't work at all.

But I did do a lot of research. Unfortunately most of the negative reviews I read about them were true for me. The 1 watt of power only got me about .5 mile of reception at best. The people who only need two-way radios for usage ranges of less than this may love this radio. If this does not describe you, then I strongly recommend going for a higher wattage model (for example I now know that Midland makes some excellent 4 and 5 watt models). Power = range. The advertised max ranges of all radios can likely only ever be reached under extremely ideal conditions. That's marketing for you.

Since the other Motorola one works, I'm guessing (hoping) this is not a design flaw, but a QC problem.Overall, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headtrip!!","review":"I found this book to be a nauseating headtrip.

It is completely outdated, in contrast to modern medicine, and otherwise fluff with a bit of commons sense thrown in. Imagine sitting through the worst class in school you've ever had and that is what reading this book is like. He admits right at the start that he threw this book together in a very short amount of time due to publishing deadlines and it shows in the content. Some of his \\"new science\\" is downright ridiculous to the point of being funny. It appears he wrote this book because someone offered him a book deal based on his reputation and his work is lazy and misleading. If I could rate this book a \\"no stars\\" I would. Save your money.

You are better off searching for books by these guys. For even better stuff, search for book under Milton Erickson, the father of hypnosis whom Bandler and Grinder studied under. Why am I telling you all this? Well, this book is basically on human psychology. To understand yourself and others, this is the topic to study and what this book preaches, but very vaguely.

I now enjoy every aspect of life like I never have before. This man is a god!!!!!! All of those negative people out there who can even say Tony is a crook should have never purcahsed the book in the first place because they must have been reading with a closed mind. How can he be a bad guy when I am living proof that he is a life saver.

It shows the formula that can be implemented into all areas of life and that's what I love about this book. He is not just some guru who teaches people in a boring sophisticated way. He teaches with so much vibrant energy that through his words, I can totally feel his confident and exciting energy through me. He talks about the importance of modeling the people you want to be and when I think about models, the one person who I always think of is Anthony Robbins himself.This is one powerful book.

The only thing I didn't like about this book is that it wasn't fun to read. There were many detail stuff which I didn't really need to do or follow. So I had to skip paragraph here and paragraph there. I had the opportunity to listen to his entire 30-day tape set. And let me tell you! It is entirely different than reading his book as far as acquiring information is concerned. I was so motivated from his tapes because he has such strong presence and energetic voice. He speaks to you as if he is really there with you. He conveys his energy and message very effectively. There were many instances I truly felt he is sincere and want you to succeed unlike some others who are just out to make quick bucks from consumers. Overall I do recommend his book but if you are truly into motivating yourself and don't mind paying extra then get the tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to NLP...","review":"I originally started out studying the field of psychology but then I became disillusioned by how it seems as if they implied that people were broken and that change had to take a long time and be painful. This book taught me that change could be quick and painless. The things that Tony talked about seemed magical and in some ways they are. I learned from this book that there was another way. I didn't learn how to create change from it. For that I had to seek out competent practitioners. But I will credit Tony and this book for opening my eyes to the possibility.Tony Robbins is the Bruce Lee of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP). If it weren't for Bruce Lee making all the movies he did then there are many people that wouldn't have joined the martial arts as their currently are.

Robbins touches on every element necessary for success, no matter how you as an individual define success. Unlike the Robert Greene books (don't get me wrong, I love those, too!), Robbins actually delves into morals and ethics rather than trying to remove them from the equation. This was key for me, as I don't think I could stomach some of the tactics advised by Greene. Knowing how far you're willing to go (and the price you're willing to pay to get there) is paramount, and Robbins examines this in great detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlimited Power : The New Science Of Personal Achievement","review":"An older book but still very good.

He hastens to add that in the re-centered SAT, his scores would be 100 points higher. The basic argument of his book is that recruited athletes are less academically capable than other Ivy League and NESCAC students even though all available statistics suggest that they are. The book is a response to William Bowen's excellent work on athletic recruiting in the Ivies and other elite schools, 'The Game of Life: College Sports and Educational Values'. Lincoln meets Bowen's sophisticated statistical and social analysis with anecdotes and quotes. Bowen says that athletes underperform in these colleges; Lincoln find one guy who did not. Bowen's book is widely acclaimed; Lincoln finds one guy who does not like it. Worse Bowen either does not understand many of Bowen's arguments or has willfully chosen to ignore them.

However, its told in teen and modern fashion. I as a Senior AP English teacher in High School, do not think this movie is truly a allegory of Othello. I always tell my students not to too much rely on this movie. I also recommend that to read the play first, then watch this movie for further understanding. I think it's great movie for teens. The ending was abrupt, however. However, I do not think this is appeasing for old people like me. READ THE PLAY FIRST. Then you get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad It's Laughable","review":"The movie is so shallow and absurd. Josh Hartnett for some reason is able to control the other characters in the play so well they will do whatever he wants them to, even commit murder. It's absolutely awful. There isn't a good thing about the movie. I suppose that you're supposed to feel sorry for the people's lives Josh ruins and hate him for it, but in reality he was my favorite character and I thought all the drama he created was mainly their own fault for being so dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Fan of Josh Hartnett","review":"Okay Im not going to take the time to write a summary of the movie since the people before me already did. This is a great movie. Its definatley worth watching. This movie was suppose to be out in theatres in 1998 but because this movie had school shootings and the Columbine shooting happened recently the movie was postponed 2 years. Its a modern-day version of Shakespheare's \\"Othello\\". Some of the things the characters say during the movie really keep you thinking about it. Listen closely to what the characters say. Josh Hartnett plays his role as Hugo Goulding very very well. This is definatley a great movie that people should watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watered down but remains true to the original","review":"It's sad that today's youth (and myself included at that age) are really ill-equipped to handle Shakespeare. That being said, however, O with it's tragic ending seems just a little bit unrealiistic in a modern setting. But it certainly is imaginative to have it set in a modern day prep school with the title role transformed into a black basketball star in an all-white privileged environment. Unfortunately something is lost in the translation. Yet the jealousy and deception remain.And I just have to comment that athleticism is something that just can't be faked on film. And as much as I admire Mekhi Phifer as an actor his basketball talents leave much to be desired. Plus the 8 foot rims were a little ridiculous. Mekhi 'O' gives a credible performance (as he always does) just not over the top.A good introduction to the Bard for our younger viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential...","review":"Great play, great concept, LOUSY execution! I agree with another reviewer who commented on the bad sound editing. I could barely understand what was being said at times, even when I replayed the scene.The script is badly written with a very slow beginning and an unrealistic building of the plot. Odin goes berserk with little prompting and Desi does virtually nothing to persuade him otherwise. Some of the more dramatic scenes are played out chillingly, but the build up is lacking and an increasingly inappropriate soundtrack plagues the viewer throughout the movie. Apparently the director felt that a movie with an African-American main character can't possibly have good music.Some of the acting is very well done, but overall I expected much more. They took a great concept and made a film of mediocre quality at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEE IT FOR SUPERIOR SILENT GERMAN \\"OTHELLO\\" ON DISC","review":"Shakespeare's tragedy \\"Othello\\" set in the world of highschool basketball? That's \\"O\\" (Lion's Gate), an interesting experiment that somehow does not quite jell.Mekhi Phifer plays the titular basketball hero, Odin \\"O\\" James, Julia Stiles is his steady Desi and Josh Hartnett is the double-dealing Hugo. This two disc set features a modest commentary by director Tim Blake Nelson (the half-wit convict in \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\") and cinematographer Russell Lee Fine, a look at the elements in setting up the basketball scenes and interviews with the stars.But what makes this DVD worth considering is an incredible bonus feature, the extraordinary silent German version of \\"Othello\\" starring the electrifying Emil Jannings.

It was originally going to be released 2(?) years ago, but with the school shooting in Littleton CO, they decided to put it on hold.The movie is slow going but with a message. I'm not certain though, that the message made it through the movie because at the end of the movie, the kid still wanted to and was looking to fly as high and with the other students. Does that mean that doing and planning what he did, he succeeded or he plans to achieve it because of it? I'm not sure or clear on that.Hopefully people will get the message that by doing something like this...it doesn't solve anything. And I'm hoping that with the start of school and if kids choose to see this movie that they would get the positive \\"let's not resort to that\\" manner than the \\"that gives me ideals\\".The young actors and actresses in the film did a fine job.

I knew, it being the 21st century and all, that I shouldn't expect a total repeat of the play. What I got was far worse. The acting and plot was good, but the details left so much more to be desired. The sex scenes were not needed, and I'm certainly no prude. They added nothing to the story, nor did the steroid scene.

Or they could have hired younger actors to credibly play teenagers.

Just as with the Bard himself, Tim Nelson allows the characters and the decisions they make unfold and together create the inevitable tragic conclusion.

Disc 2 contains the original \\"Othello\\" as well as commentary and interviews that invite the viewer to watch \\"O\\" another time. Each person took their part well ~ Mekhi Phifer was excellent despite seeming a bit mature for the character's age.

That movie was deep, dark, and disturbing. We were both shaking on the ride home.Besides the fact that it scared the hell out of me, I really liked the movie. Josh Hartnett's acting was wonderful as he played evil Hugo Goulding. Mekhi Phifer's acting was pretty good especially near the end. Julia Stiles was a big disappointment. In many of her other movies, she was a girl with an attitude. In 'O', she sat their like a bug, as if she was just watching everything around her.I would go see this movie again and I'm glad I saw it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film!","review":"I saw this movie about week ago and it was great. Everyone was perfect for their roles and the acting was very dramatic. Mehki Pheifer did an excellent job as Oden (Othello with a different name) and Josh Hartnett was the perfect jealous person. The plot and screenplay were great and had a lot of good twists. This was a great adaption of Othello, and the director did a good job of making the movie seem modern but yet still Shakesperian.

I have never been much for drama but I descided to see it anyway. Josh hartnett's ( Black hawk down, 40 days and 40 nights) performance was breakthough. It really showed how talented he is. Mekhi Phifer (Honey, 8 mile) and Julia Stiles { Save the last dance, 10 things I hate about you) shared alot of depth and chemistry in this film. Tim Nelson did a great job foccusing on Josh Hartnett and Mekhi Phifer's strange relationship together. This move was very intense and full of twists and turns. The cast was nearly perfect.

It was obviously early in the careers of some of the actors (this is Julia Stiles at her worst) so I can let a little bit slide.The story itself is a novel twist on Othello taking place at a private school in the South. Class lines, racial themes, etc. are all addressed and neatly packaged in this teen flick. However, the story itself just drags on forever until you want them all to be killed!

In addition, you must have a high tolerance for cussing in order to watch it. The movie was over for me after Julia Stiles made her first appearance, cussing up a storm with all the men in the room. Everyone had been cussing non-stop, and I finally had enough--it seemed to be done just for the sake of using bad language, not for any larger aesthetic purpose.I let a colleague have my DVD, and she watched it herself, thinking she would try to show it to her students. She made it through half the movie before deciding it absolutely could not be used as a teaching resource.

Sometimes when I would look at my collection of DVDs for a movie to watch that night, I would think so-so about this movie -- until I started watching it again. It is no wonder that one of the top movie reviewers said that this may be the best action movie ever. It keeps you on your toes and doesn't have to resort to a sex or foul language to keep you glued to the screen. This was the kickoff for Sandra Bullock and she does very well.

She definitte did some great movies after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never has riding a bus been so exciting!!!!","review":"The first time I saw this film, I felt like I had been on a fun and breath-taking thrill ride. From beginning to end, this great action film moves so quickly and so interestingly that you feel like YOU are on that bus. Keanu Reeves is good as a cop, named Jack Traven, trying to stop a disaster that will kill an unsuspecting busload of people. Throw in Dennis Hopper as a really good psycho villian and Sandra Bullock as Annie, a young woman who becomes a reluctant hero, and you have the making of the best action film of the 90s. When I watch this now, I still enjoy the fast pace of Jan DeBont's direction and the chemistry between Keanu and Sandra is charming and real. This film spawned a sequel---don't bother, it was bad!---stick to the original. You can't improve on a film like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever! (In the history of movies)","review":"Overall, speed was an excellent film with a wonderful movie plot and magnificent characters but what really made this movie 5 stars was the lead actor Keanu Reeves. He so gorgeous, unbelievably hot that after you watch this movie, you WILL fall in love with him instantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCEEDING THE SPEED LIMIT","review":"Yes, SPEED Is one heck of a ride, from its tense elevator opening to the sheer agony of riding on a bus that could explode at any minute. Yes, Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper and Sandra Bullock are great in their roles, and the movie moves along at warp speed, a rare exercise in adrenaline-inspired action. My problem with the movie ultimately is SPEED should have ended after the bus exploded. The writers could have come up with a more interesting and definite ending for Hopper's character. The addition of the speeding train only proved an excess to what had been a crisp, fluent movie. By going this far over the limit of audience tolerance, DeBont and crew sabotaged what should have been a five star movie. But up until the poorly conceived ending, SPEED is one fun ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"This movie was good but the storyline was so dumb. I mean their couldn't have been one guy doing multiple acts on people without someone else helping him. This movie was also the start of the no story to special effects movies leading into such movies as Independence Day and Twister. Released in 1994 this movie made much money at the box office and unfortuantley started a trend that we still are in movies with no plots or anything to them, that is why there is an independent movies surge. If you like action this is the movie for you but the story is unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie owns you","review":"This movie is a classic and everybody should see it. Sandra's part in the movie is very stupid. But alot of stuff blows up. So that makes it a good movie. I think keanu could do better than sandra. They should of had trinity from \\"the matrix\\" instead of sandra. But thats ok the movie still rocked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintentionally hilarious","review":"This movie is excellent - if you don't realise that it is supposed to be serious. If you think that it is a parody of action movies then it is great. Reeves' over the top deep macho voice is hilarious, and the women all cry and panic whilst the men all say \\"grrr\\" and make smart-alec quips - think Brad and Janet in \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\". The characters are extremely shallow and unbelievable - one minute Bullock is freaking out, and the next she is coyly flirting with Reeves. If you want intentional hilarious parody then I'd recommend \\"Rocky Horror\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speed ...!","review":"This movie is filled with action but is totally unrealistic! The movie should actually be considered a comedy because of the stuff that goes on. I wouldn't reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe what I'm reading","review":"Speed? C'mon people, this movie stunk to high heaven. Good story, admitted, but the final product left me shaking my head. Keanu Reeve's acting was so bad, I wanted to stick my hand inside the screen and slap the little SOB. If there was an Academy Award for 'Ham', then I'd understand, but I don't think there is. Little boy trying to play a grown-up role is what it boils down to. Maybe he should have goton a few more chest hairs before he decided to do this.Next, there are 'serious' action movies and then there are the campy. Both are enjoyable, but they should never cross the lines with each other. Speed came off as trying to be serious, but fell flat a number of times. I would eat my own boogers on national TV for two hours if ANYONE could get a bus to make that jump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keanu is #1","review":"A mildly entertaining action thriller. The acting and directing are rather poor, but the action sequences make up for it. The worst thing about the movie is Keanu Reeves, who is probably the worst actor in Hollywood with George Clooney a close second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I absolutly dispise this movie! I saw it when I was like 9 years old. I remember the whole time sitting there goin \\"GOD, this movie ...\\" The action was very poor I thought. I hated all the characters & there was no plot. The plot was a guy was blowing things up! Thats a stupid plot. The only good performance was Jeff Daniels & Dennis Hopper i Think. But there were no good relationships between the charachers. I know a lota people really liked this movie, but trust me, there are action movies 20 times better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overrated movie of all time...","review":"This thing was terrible and I thought it couldn't get any worse until I was forced by my wife to watch Speed 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Acting, Stereotypical, unrealistic diaster-movie stunts","review":"I just finished watching this movie on VHS 15 minutes ago. It was very difficult to sit through the whole thing. The acting was bad, the characters were 2D; it was like a bad made-for-TV diaster movie. I think Keanu Reeves was fantastic IN THE MATRIX. But I am suprised he was given a lead again with this movie in his portfolio. I should add that the camera work was good. But the music was awful (like Casio keyboard sequences). And the dialog was just cheesy. I am honestly shocked that this movie did so well at the box office, even among respected critics, and still gets good reviews here. I think 10 or so years from now, people will look back and wonder what in the world they were thinking when they praised this movie. Awful, shallow, canned, trite, forced, devoid of even the pretense of reality. It reminded me of Con-Air. Same kind of hoakiness, but at least Con-Air had a protagonist with some depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie EVER","review":"Did you ever actually sit down and watch this movie, it's ridiculous. It's not believeable at all, a large city bus could not jump a gap in a 50 foot gap in a bridge at 70 miles per hour. That may be cynical but it's the truth. Anything to get attention to the films poor acting and horrible plot line. The only thing that saved it (and not by much) was Dennis Hopper, but I don't understand what he was thinking by being in such a terrible movie. I find it sad that this movie actually became a blockbuster hit, and so much so that they decided that there must be a sequal to it. I don't know who made that decision but there should never have even been a first one. If I'm wrong and you like this movie more power to ya, but if you have never seen this movie...go get something better, anything better please...don't waste your time...I know this movie isn't suppose to be a work of art...so you be the judge...but I'm sure I'm wrong"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant get enough!","review":"Like my other reviews, i found this classic bond. i like them because they are closer to the novels than the movies. dont get me wrong, i love the moives too, but this gives you a picture of what Fleming was thinking.I am almost finished the official stories and hope the other, non Fleming stories are just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Century Child","review":"Centruy Child being Nightwish's 4th studio album and 2002 release and is symphonic power metal album.

This CD is an instant classic. First, the good parts: \\"Dead To The World\\" is darn catchy. \\"Slaying The Dreamer\\" is heavy and Marco sounds awesome on this song. My favorite song however, is Nightwish's version of \\"The Phantom Of The Opera\\". It may even be better than the original.The bad: \\"Forever Yours\\" is far too slow and weak. \\"Feel For You\\" isn't actually bad, but it's not as breathtaking as I know Nightwish can be.All in all, I'd recommend this album to any fan or persons curious about all the fuss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"I first came across this music from trying to download it.After I actually listened to the music, I realized that this band was to come one of my favorite and most recommended cd's that I told my friends about it.

Dream Theatre and Symphony X spring to the forefront. In my mind the metal makeover medleys of these opera based compositions just don't work. The singing is aggravating to listen to and makes you want to cringe and it's obvious to any ardent guitar listener that this has all been done before. Okay, steal a little and make a song out of it if you can, but some of this is total rip off and there is a hell of lot better out there and I am going back ten years. Overall a load of crap really, unless of course you are so young, or nave that you just haven't heard very much music in your time to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Let me start by saying that I am not your typical GOTH fan. I am a 49 year old male, not the typical 17 year old female. Having said that, if you know who Queensryche and Charlotte Church are, this CD might just be for you. This CD is intricately arranged and very well done. The songs go from Heavy Metal to Opera while mixing in some songs that any pop diva would be happy to call her own. That is what makes this CD so facinating. The fact that the band is talented enough to pull this all off is what makes this CD a remarkable achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"Very powerful CD, Tarja's wonderful, opera-styled voice carries you along.

Alas... the previous 2 releases were so majestic and original. This is trying to be the same but as many have mentioned already, Tarja's soraing vocals have been toned down quite a bit and the new bassist, Marco (ex Sinergy-- he should've stayed put!) tries to sing as well and it's absolutely horrible! To me there's a few gems on the album, \\"End of All Hope\\" a classic more in the \\"Wishmaster\\" vein, \\"Slaying the Dreamer\\" quite good until the final few minutes when Marco ruins it and the epic \\"Beauty of the Beast\\" is actually quite cool and probably the only thing that will stop me from selling this slab of plastic to a pawn shop.

I hope they release it in the U.S."},{"rating":"2","title":"the continuing awesomeness of nightwish","review":"The Century Child debuts bassist Marco Hietla which takes nightwish onto another path of musical influences. This is one of the first albums to have a permanent male vocalist within the band. This album features the darkest lyrics to that date which blends with mystically-bonding music suggests a dark period of paranormal manifestation in the band. The overall quality of the album is fairly entertaining. The maturing sound with the incorporation of orchestra adds to the heavier symphonic texture of the band's sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music, Yet hard to call \\"metal/rock\\"","review":"A friend got me hooked on Nightwish with the CD \\"Once\\" (which is a bit heavier then this cd). When i found Century Child i loved every song, yet was puzzled by the different style Nightwish did. Tarja still had her opera style voice, yet in this cd it didn't stand out as much. This cd also has more clean male vocals, \\"slaving the dreamer\\" is the only song on this cd that is heavy with the male grunts (if you wanna call them that). As always there is a lot of keyboards in this cd with is just breath taking.I guess to truly help you i can say: This cd is more \\"pop-ish\\" then the other nightwish cd's. or at least thats how i would describe it. But all in all it's still a great cd.My personal favs are \\"Dead to the world\\" which has a catchy tune and is a duet with Tarja and Marco, my top fav. \\"Ever Dream\\" \\"Ocean soul\\" are both slower but still pretty & \\"The Phantom Of The Opera\\" is just as good as the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"For The Love of Tarja","review":"After reading a review in a Metal Magazine I decided to give NightWish a try and I am glad that I did.

Nothing exceptional goes on here and you know how great the vocals are by now. The standout song is 'Everdream' and some other songs are better than others. The introduction of some male singer only shows how not to sing as he wrecks all the songs he appears on.

We Went From Amazing to Mediocre!","review":"Skip this album if you are looking for an introduction to Nightwish. Oceanborn & Wishmaster are each so much better than this. Tarja isn't really given a chance to shine, and that is a waste of talent. Also, & more importantly, the new male vocalist they have is awful. Just awful. I mean truly, disgustingly, annoyingly & painfully awful. There are THOUSANDS of singers that they could have gotten to add counterpoint to Tarja's amazing operatic style. What they got was a sound like a strange constipated sneer. I hate his voice and cannot listen to any tracks he's on. Also, the music seems sub-par. I can't put my finger on it, but it just doesn't move me. Oceanborn & Wishmaster are permanently in my car & I listen to them constantly. This is going back in the CD case for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good album, comparatively not good.","review":"If i had never heard a nightwish song before then i would consider this album excellent. Sadly, i have heard many of their songs and therore can tell that this album is lacking in many areas. Tarja, the lead singer, normally sings with immense power and projection giving the music an opera-esque feel. I felt that this was largely missing in this album and Tarja sings moreso with the attitude of a little girl. If you are a hardcore nightwish fan then i would reccomend purchasing it for the couple of very good songs. If you are not a hardcore fan i would reccomend Oceanborn or Wishmaster.

However, this is a daringly fast-paced performance with a refreshing and controversial approach to the ensemble (one voice per choral part).

For once I was kept on the edge of my seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"St Matthew Passion - A fresh Interpretation","review":"I heard of this new development in the performance St Matthew Passion on CD Review on Radio 3 about a year ago. Apparently Andrew Parrott had the idea after considerable research, that a performance of this oratorio using very small vocal forces was not only feasible but desirable. A considerable body of evidence from Bach's own time seems to point to the greater authenticity of these limited numbers.The main advantages are clarity of texture in the vocal ensembles and an immediacy and intimacy that can not be achieved with the usual large scale choirs.I would thoroughly recommend McCreesh's version and I found it powerful and compelling as well as superbly recorded.I have an early 60's Klemperer recording which is epic in scale and power but this new performance demonstrates that Bach's masterpiece can be interpreted in a variety of ways and still be totally convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic piece of vanity publishing","review":"Books published at the author's own expense really should contain a warning on the seller's site.

Although I enjoyed his \\"Dress to Kill\\" stand-up to \\"Circle\\" I assure you that \\"Circle\\" is full of laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpolished material not DVD-worthy","review":"I am a huge fan of all of the other EI DVDs and have seen him in concert. For that reason, I have to say that this material doesn't warrant release on DVD. It's really slapdash, and seems like an unfortunate attempt to get another DVD out to fans prematurely. Wish I'd rented it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not His Best, But Still Better than Most","review":"Let us cut to the point here, Eddie Izzard is a comic genious! If you like his other DVDs then you will find this one to be a worthy and most amusing companion to them. On the downside, it is shorter than others and while worthy of your hard earned cash it isn't up to the lofty standard of D2K.If you are new to Eddie Izzard, I would first reccommend taking a look at \\"Glorious\\" on CD (the video isn't as good) or the Dress To Kill DVD before adding this to your collection. If you aren't new to Izzard, WHAT are you doing reading reviews - just buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not D2K, But Still Pretty Darn Good...","review":"I had to give Circle a total of four stars out of five simply because the behind-the-scenes footage was so great. Seeing Eddie drunk and breaking down into a fit of giggles was truly priceless.The Circle performance itself was nowhere near the outrageous lunacy of D2K, but it still had glorious shining moments. As mentioned in previous reviews, The Deathstar Cantina and the monkey bits were some of the best.If you are a hardcore Eddie fan, then you must own this DVD. If you are a beginner, start with Dress to Kill or Glorious, then watch Circle. Definite Article and Unrepeatable are also fabulous. As you can see, I am an Izzardite, so I know what I am talking about. Really, I do. Now shut up and go watch a video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.","review":"I don't understand why other reviewers say it's not as good as \\"Dress to Kill.\\" For my money, \\"Circle\\" IS better than \\"Dress to Kill\\". Funny, intelligent, well measured, perfect comic timing. Eddie Izzard rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Wonderful! Superb! Simply a piece of genuis. I being an huge Eddie Izzard fan have to place this one right under Dress to Kill. He goes back to Glorious with his poking fun of religon, but makes some good points about Christianity and Paganism. Ahh those transvestites...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Eddie at his best","review":"I have been an Eddie fan for about 4 years now and have seen all the videos he has out (Unrepeatable (good but hard to hear), Definite Article (my favorite, over and above D2K), Glorious (quite good) and D2K which, really, is a masterpiece. I saw Eddie in Philly for the Circle show and he was much funnier the night we saw him than he is in this show.I felt let down after I saw this DVD - it's definitely not Eddie at his best. Of course, it's been said that Eddie sucking is probably better than most of what else is out there. Some of the bits were good, but most were kind of EH.Were I to recommend stuff to a new Eddie fan it would be in this order:DK2Definite Article (seriously, this one is frigging awesome!)GloriousCircleUnrepeatable (really, just for sound quality)For lots of good Eddie stuff *AND* transcripts of all his shows, take a visit to www.auntiemomo.com/cakeordeath.

I happen to find his humor irresistible, but my wife hates it. So give him a try, and you might like. I particularly like his approach - he's a story teller as opposed to terse punchy jokes. For example, he'll talk about what if the pope is an action hero and he has \\"altar boy\\" (pronounced as if he's saying \\"batman and robin\\"). He goes on about how that would work and the strange things they'd do. So obviously if you have any sensitivities, he's not for you. But the stories evolve magically; he tends to take very familiar situations and make them immensely comical. For example - at the end of Circle, he does the Death Star Canteen bit. So what if the Death Star had a cafeteria and Darth Vader were to go for chow? Must be seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, but not quite up to the standards he set for himself...","review":"Eddie Izzard is my favorite comedian by far and just about everything out of the mans mouth gets at least a chuckle from me. Though if you are new to Izzard I reccomend buying any of his other DvD's first, as this dosn't quite live up to his other preformances (Though I have not seen Unrepetable or Sexie yet so I can't say anything about them). That said, if you own all the other Eddie DvD's or simply must hear the Star Wars bit this is still a very fine performance that got quite a few laughs out of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"reloj pierre cardin","review":"compre uno de estos relojes y no funciona adecuadamente, la perilla de ajustar la hora no funciona, hubo que llevar el reloj a reparar. no lo devolvi porque sale muy costoso desde mi pais. la caja tambien estaba rota."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book but could have gone a little more in depth","review":"Not a bad book at all, but they don't go into the power user functions.

He conclusively argues for the abolution of taxes on capital and why unprincipled politicians will fight to keep them. He demonstrates with examples how some countries have prospered by keeping or eliminating taxes on capital while those who didn't have fallen behind. He is most persuasive on the issue of financial privacy as a human right and without it we are at the mercy of a totalitarian government. Very easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"philosophically correct","review":"Since I am not an economist, I must leave some of the technical details of the book for assessment by others.

The material is a bit dated, but still relevant for learning how to speak.

I unplugged it, took out the control from the frypan, and observed that the end of the probe had started to melt.If you have one of these, check the probe.

It has been wonderful. It is very wide, but not tall. It is perfect for paella. The skillet controls the temperature perfectly, and looks great on a buffet table or on the dinner table. It has a stainless steel finish and looks like a nice chafing dish.It is easy to clean. I am glad the skillet does not have a non-stick coating, since that finish seems to eventually come off of every pan I have owned. I season the pan as described in the brochure, and things never stick to it.I am very happy with this skillet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-cook design","review":"A beautiful product to look at, but not at all practical. The lip around the top where the lid sits, bubbles the condensed moisture to the outside of the skillet. The several times I've used it, have made a huge mess to clean up!

Not happy about this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rival Skillet - Purchased as new item","review":"Yesterday, I received the 16\\" Rival Stainless Steel electric skillet that I ordered earlier this month. I was really looking forward to using it. Unfortunately,when I removed the item from the box, the first thing I noticed was that there wasn't a handle on the cover (ouch!!)...(my husband later found the broken off ring-type handle in the bottom of the box). The next thing that caught my eye was the 3\\" diameter stain on the bottom of the skillet. Upon closer inspection, there I noted multiple scratches on the dulled finish. The exterior of the skillet was also slightly stained. It was obvious that I had received a used/recycled/whatever skillet instead of a the NEW one I had ordered. Hence, this is not really a comment on the product, but on the quality of service received from this site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"We've been using it for over a year and been very satisfied. It's just like new even after weekly use. We'd highly recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of how large it really is","review":"First off, let me just start by saying that my one-star rating is not because of the product, nor Amazon.com. In fact, I never even used the product before I returned it. The 'problem' with this electric skillet is its size -- it's enormous. I ordered it because we're cooking for six (or more, at times), and I thought a 16\\" skillet would be great. However, I failed to take into account the size of our dishwasher. The electric skillet doesn't fit into our dishwasher, and won't fit into most standard dishwashers, at least none that I've seen. That the skillet is fully submersible and dishwasher safe is one of its strong points. Not being able to stick it in the dishwasher was enough of a downside for me to return it. I'll be purchasing its 12\\" cousin as soon as I'm credited for my 16\\" skillet's return."},{"rating":"1","title":"ELECTRIC CORD NOT INCLUDED IN TWO SKILLETS","review":"We ordered two Rival SS166 Stainless Steel Electric Skillets from Amazon.com. They are just what I have been wanting for many years, however, both of them arrived without the electric cord/temperature probe/controller. Hence, we were not able to use them. This entire episode has been utterly frustrating. A Rival customer representative told us they had a shortage of temperature probes/electrical controllers. Apparently they continue shipping the skillets even though they cannot be used. Although we were forced to rate this on a 1 to 5 scale, we would actually rate this much lower than 1!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best thing that ever happened to my cooking life","review":"Honestly, I bought this item because it looks good! But now, I am cooking more than ever. The surface is so large I can cook four big pancakes at a time. I can double my Chili recipe (with room to spare)...and watch it cook through the glass cover. I highly recommend this large electric skillet to anyone who cooks for a crowd, and likes to have some leftovers. (\\"Bar Keepers Friend\\" is a great powder for clean-ups on the stainless steel.)FIVE STARS!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Okie event","review":"I would have rated it 5 stars, but it moved a little slow at times. A good friend of ours was the \\"losing\\" coach in this movie and we had the chance to see some of the filming. It was heart-warming to see how the town of Nowata rallied around the movie-makers. Many of the actors were Oklahomans and the extras were Nowata citizens. It was indeed an exciting event. I was very pleased with the finished product. It trully reflected the small town life in Oklahoma and lifted the spirits. No cussing, no sex, just pure down home fun. Even our 14 year old son liked it, although he probably wouldn't admit it now. I plan to buy it as soon as the price drops."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to give it a half star.","review":"If you are an Okie (my husband is) the movie will have it's charm. If you are truly (not truLLy, Thelma)a football fan you will rally around the spirit of the movie, but for those not familiar with the twang and sloooooow pace of the central states think again before buying this one.

I am 22 years old and I played college football at a division one level. I appreciate great football movies and I also appreciate movies that make you feel good. If you have family in town, or you have kids in the house and you want to have something that is great for people of all ages you need to buy Possums. I own a copy and I bought a copy for my parents. This is a movie that has comedy, romance, high school high jinks, and heart. I gave Possums 5 stars because it is truly a refreshing movie! I would recomend it to anyone who is looking for a great movie to add to their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect mix between trash/death and melodic rock","review":"I found this cd is the perfect mix between trash or even death-metal and classic melodic rock.

TEN stars.","review":"It should be noted that folks have been posting effusive praise for this movie here for 14 years. That should tell you something, dear reader.Let me first say that if you're avoiding this film because you think it's sleazy or you're uncomfortable with the idea of a relationship between an older man and a 14 year old girl (played by an 11 year old,) trust me... you're denying yourself a supremely well crafted, brilliantly acted and deeply moving film.Natalie Portman's appearance (her first film job) is, and I know this sounds crazy... is one of the single most remarkable female film performances I've ever seen. And I've been watching films for over fifty years.I'm going to leave it at that, except to say that this is one of the most riveting and moving love stories I've ever been fortunate enough to find. One of my ten favorite films of all time. And a great introduction to a great director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good story on many levels","review":"I strongly recommend this book to anyone. The story starts out a little slow in terms of protagonists and plot, but pretty quickly starts to make sense and become very interesting.And how can one not love a story about black holes, Russian Oligarchs, historical events and culture, corporate overreach, US politics, and a very sexy woman. The character development is excellent, and the tension building hard to resist. I quickly became interested in many of the characters and cared about what happens to them.At least try a sample--you will get hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well thought out and plotted first novel","review":"Highly entertaining novel with several franchiable characters.I won't bother you with a story description, you have already seen those in other reviews.I will say that I enjoyed this story and found it quite compelling. I will be keeping an eye out for follow-up titles from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laboured junk.","review":"I am afraid that will this novel, the author has mistaken a second-rate science essay as the plot for a novel. Sadly for us, he has inflicted 'Singularity' upon the readership of Amazon whereas it would have been better kept to himself. Only read if you like to read about characters directly mined from the worse clich��, a plot that drags, and writing that it is about as amateur as you can get. Avoid at all costs and lets hope the Archon Sequence ends here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Read","review":"This techno-thriller is the sort of book that I can't get enough of - and I wish there were more of them to read. If you love Crichton, Rollins, Brown, and Clancy this book is for you. It is written very well, and it is very believable. Many of these books frustrate me because they don't show an adequate understanding of the US government and its inner workings. This book does a great job in staying in the realm of possible while pushing as far as possible to the edge of belief.I found myself purposely slowing down reading the book, because I didn't want to be done with it. I hope that his next book is just as good - and I hope it comes out soon.... I'm ready."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Bill DeSmedt does an excellent job writing a book that is at the same time fun to read, and intellectually stimulating.

While many novels have multiple plot lines that intertwine usually some are weak and as a result your read through a chaoter just to get to another charcters POV, here every chapter change i felt pissed that i'd have to wait for a continual of this line while i felt the glee of another plotline's return, can't wait to read his next novel Dualism.Thanks for restoring my faith in current day sci fi !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill DeSmedt, hot new writer","review":"Bill DeSemdt is an \\"Information Engineer,\\" an amateur physicist, a student of Sovietology, and now a first-time novelist who reads like he's been doing this for decades.

I workout about 5 days a week doing various exercises and fell into a rut. I really wanted something new and to feel a different kind of work out. This video is not a workout. My mother (50 yrs old, does not work out ever) did it with me and neither of us broke a sweat. We had FUN dancing and laughing at eachother but that was all.--It's hard to do. She doesn't explain the moves at all and even with my dance experience I struggled to figure out what she was doing or how the moves fit together in each sequence.--It's short. Each \\"Dance\\" is about the length of a verse in one of their songs so 35 seconds (about). So even once you learn it you'd have to do it over and over for at least an hour (boring!!) to get any kind of cardio workout.--It's fun. If your bored or your kids are having a sleep over buy this and have them do it!I really don't recommend buying it for fitness purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"This is definately not a dance workout. they only show you 1 dance move that is about 30 seconds long."},{"rating":"1","title":"pcd workout","review":"dont get this dvd it is horrible the dancing is horrible nothing in it was worth doing you will feel silly watching this dvd and even sillier doing the movies"},{"rating":"1","title":"LAAAME!!!","review":"This is not a workout.

Some people are bagging on the soundtrack for not having \\"fast paced music\\" or even a song by \\"Rancid\\" but this soundtrack does well enough by itself. I highly recommend it for people who tastes go beyond power chords (though those are my favorites to play) and banal orchestra sets. The only reason I gave it 4 star rather than 5 star is because in the trailers they play a cool world music type song at the end, and I can't find it!!

Instead we have a composer who has slapped together some music that lacks focus and emotion. This soundtrack is especially upsetting because war movies typically create great soundtracks. Who can forget Patton's theme, or Maximus's theme in the opening of Gladiator, or the Dune's war theme. What could have been a great soundtrack to a great movie, has become a great movie with a lot of music for noise. It seems that after the screw up with Pearl Harbor, Hans has just become lazy with his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still love Mr. Zimmer's music, but just not this one.","review":"This CD was not what I expected at all. What I expected was an enegetic, high volumn, fast pace, heroic theme soundtrack. I shouldn't blame anyone for this, since I haven't seen the movie.

I got a copy of him and as soon as I heard the whole cd I bought one of my own.

Thank you Hans Zimmer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The last musical score that impressed me was Dr. Zhivago.

I listened to it and all I can say is the music is a haunting middle eastern/arabic mixed with modern/techno accents. It is not a lyrical CD (i.e. no Moby) -- it is for the most part instrumental. This is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes","review":"My first impression was not forgiving. But after listening to the middle eastern themes and electric guitars, it flowed nicely. The solo and tribal chanting tracks from this score led up to the successful melody of the music from Tears of the Sun 9 with a slight jungle beat to it). I believe the PC game, Command & Conquer: Generels, may have taken some influence from Black Hawk Down's theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great from Hans Zimmer","review":"This sound track provides excellent instrumental pieces full of suspense and emotion.

The only drawback was the tiny sized print."},{"rating":"2","title":"made me feel sympathy for Kevin Mitnick","review":"This book did what I thought no book could do - it made me feel sympathy for Kevin Mitnick. It's also a page-turner. There is actual drama in this book, which is remarkable, since most books about hackers are bogged down in details about code and hacker tricks that are completely lost on the average reader. This book strikes a fine balance, it seems to me. I learned a lot, but I also had fun. Goodell seems to understand that there is a lot of grey area in hacking, that it is not all good and evil. This dramatically told tale reflects that understanding. I'd recommend it highly to anyone with even a passing interest in cyber culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on the topic","review":"I have read all 3 books on the Mitnick manhunt: Takedown, The fugitive Game, and The Cyberthief and the Samurai.The Goodel book, the cyberthief and the samurai, was the first book I read on the subject. I read it shortly after it was published and thought it was very well balanced between the two parts of the story. After reading the other two books i realized that this book is the best becasue it doesn't pick sides, its just an accurate retelling of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read to peak your interest","review":"I read this book years ago and really enjoyed it.

I don't think I have ever heard worse. Another issue that disturbs me is that the song titles and credits are not listed. This is not a purely improvised work - somebody (probably Byrd) did the compositions and arrangements and should have been given credit.This would be another top knotch Charlie Byrd CD if the publisher cared enough to remix it and rework the liner notes.Steer clear of this one, but don't hesitate to buy the many other avaliable Byrd CDs that were published by someone who actually cared about the music.

I can deffinately say that bikes in this price range do not typically pack in as much value as the makers of this bike(Kent). I agree with one other reviewer that mentioned the necessary proper care and adjustment of this bike, but that is true to a degree for all bikes. This bike is best for those who will ride occassionally to semi-frequently with a moderate degree of rigor. I used it for my first triathlon and it suited me well. I dont suggest this bike with the intent of upgrading it later. Just sell it and move on when the time comes (likely a year or so of satisfactory use).

Then I noticed my camera wasn't staying upright. It was falling slowly in a clockwise movement. I went to tighten the screw that keeps that part in place and there is no screw there to tighten. You can see where one should be, but that part was missing. Now I have a broken leg and a box of tooth picks keeping my camera in an upright position. Nice.I am calling Calmulet after New Years Day and asking what they can do for me. $179.98 and $15 to ship is a lot to pay for broken parts and missing parts. I will keep you updated.

The book is formula based... right down to the generic dog care chapters. If you want to be an informed dog buyer, this book doesn't cut it. I feel that the average buyer needs to also be informed about more complex issues such as responsible breeders and genetic diseases (more than a small paragraph). It is important to know what a Beagle ought to look like, some background (this is a hunting/pack animal!), and how genetics actually works. I recommend the New Beagle if you want to know more about your dog than what you could easily find out by reading the encyclopedia. The New Beagle not only spouts off the standard but helps illustrate it. I feel the average reader is more intelligent than formula books give them credit for and the The Beagle : An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Hanukah Music","review":"I had just watched a Hanukah special on Public Television when they advertised a Hanukah CD by Craig Taubman. While browsing here on Amazon, I saw another CD by Mr. Taubman. Hanukah songs done in a more modern way. While my Mother, the traditionalist did not care for it, myself and some of my non-jewish friends who had no idea what they were listening to liked it. I find that the music on the CD can also be used for mood music. Going to try it on my next party. If you are looking for the traditional Hanukah music, this is not the CD. But if you want a different spin on the Hanukah songs you learned and sang, then this is the CD to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"I am so pleased to be able to say that I loved this album! I must admit, I was a little skeptical of an all-instrumental trance-chillout remix of Hanukkah classics. This could easily have been a disaster. Instead, it's the first entirely successful mainstream Hanukkah album geared toward 18-40 year-olds that I've ever heard. This is the kind of music that I'd be proud to play at a holiday party, the kind of party where martinis outnumber hot chocolates. Just as Craig Taubman and the Celebrate Series did with their album, Celebrate Hip Hop, this one goes where you didn't think Jewish music could go. And I can only hope that they choose to go back again very soon. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silver Dragonshields","review":"I've owned a number of Dragonshields for a while now, over a year. I can't remember any splitting or breaking.

They're fine value and everyone I know that runs these will tell you the same. If you play MTG and you use anything other than Dragonshields, I would suggest trying them out and I'm pretty sure you'll never go back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Overall, these card protectors were just not worth it.

The black filter shown in the photograph is not what is often sold this year. They are selling a yellow painted filter using a Champion Laboratories \\"Eco\\" design with this part number. A quality oil filter has a metal interior with holes to allow the oil to flow through it. This metal cyclinder supports the paper filter element. The \\"eco\\" design uses a plastic grid with large openings. This does not fully support the filter and allows pieces of the filer element to pass into the engine. This naturally causes blockages which leads to engine failure. If you want a quality oil filter for your Kohler engine, use a Purolator L10241 (or PL10241) or the Wix 51348 as substitutes for this filter. The Champion Laboratores \\"Eco\\" design is probably worse than a Fram oil filter.

This entire album falls into the latter category. This is one of the few albums I own that I listen to in its entirety without skipping tracks. Every song is a standout.I read an interview where Hahn said that the punk kids don't like J Church because their music is too indie and the indie kids don't like their music because it is too punk.

The limitation of this movie is, that it's a true story. The sureal lives of the characters are well portrayed, but the conclusion is abrupt and, while not graphic, is still sickening, especially when you know that people can behave like that and be out of prison within five years!

This role was Kate Winslet's debut at age 17. She immediately went from this role to receive an Oscar nomination for Sense and Sensibility in 1995, followed by starring roles in Jude and Hamlet in 1996. Then came the bombshell that was Titanic in 1997.Shortly thereafter, Peter Jackson directed three hugely successful Lord of the Rings movies in 2001-03. This is where it all began for two cinema legends. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark all-consuming true story","review":"To even fathom such scenarios are incredible, but to think it all actually happened, its just mind blowing. Especially after watching Peter Jackson's early masterpiece. Kate Winslet should forever be in Jackson's debt, for he practically discovered her. And I'm so glad he did. She was brilliant in this. Melanie Lynskey is the real star though. She creeped me out every time she turned to the camera or gave her mother an evil glare. Their combined performance was what kept this film interesting. It's almost fantastical in nature. Jackson does a great job with all the different elements, combining the real with illusion and it flows perfectly. Its really dramatic and twisty, you almost want the girls to succeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Look at a Gruesome Tragedy","review":"this film was very well done by director peter jackson of the well known lord of the rings series. this was kate winslet's first role and i would say that it is one of her best. this is an uncommonly heard of film that is well worth watching and will stay with you long after it is over. the film is haunting, mysterious, and memorable. i would recommend this film to anyone looking for something different but something great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, horrible DVD!","review":"Please, save yourself some aggravation and wait for Miramax to release an official Region One DVD!

Turing their time together they write a novel, work with clay, and discover sex for the first time. Juliet's parents are getting a divorce and she must leave the country and live in South Africa for a while. Pauline pleads to her mother for her permission to go to Africa with Juliet but she says no.

This is a film where her actual talent shows, not her cleavage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"Somebody once said, that the novel Lolita was the only convincing love story of the century. Well, Heavenly Creatures is the only convincing cinematic love story I've seen yet. The fact this is a true story only underscores that. It's a very twisted love story, but one none the less.This film will make you feel a lot of different emotions when watching it. Both love and hate for the two main characters, a constant feel of uneasiness, especially when they go into their fantasy world, among others.The ending of this film gets me like no other film I've yet seen. You despise the girls for what they do. It's amazing how one evil act transforms your feeling for the girls.Most disgusting to me, is how real life Juliet Hulme, has gone on to make millions of dollars a myster writer.

It means the AI breaks away any sieges on whenver you hit end turn after laoding a game. That's right. It lifts ALL of its seiges, meaning if you play one turn every session, none of the AI factions will ever take a province. Period. CA has simply denied the bug, claiming it a \\"reassesment feature.\\" This \\"reassesment feature\\" makes all the AI factions even easier to steamroll than they already were, even on Very hard difficulty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strategic AI again","review":"Let me start by saying that this is a good game. Why the 1 star then?As you may have seen from some of the recent reviews here, the AI does not retain its long term plans when you load a game. It's difficult to be precise because, although anyone with the game can show that something wierd is happening, Creative Assembly refuse to acknowledge it. Suffice to say that the strategic AI is weaker than it should be because of this.As far as I know at this time, CA do not intend to fix this for the add-on.So, how does this affect you? If you can only afford to play a couple of turns at a time (and the turns get pretty lengthy later on), then this will be of concern to you. Even if you can play long sessions, it's possible that it will affect you.So, there you have it. Frankly, if you were interested in RTW already and can play more than a couple of turns a session, then this bug is not hugely important to you. It is to some though, as is the way that CA have handled it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have a Good Divorce Lawyer Lined Up Before Buying This Game!","review":"A middle age professionals' opinion - simply the best darn strategy game EVER!

While there are a few AI glitches I don't go looking for them and if I stumble across one I avoid taking advantage of it. So the gaming experience is outstanding!I have no idea how somebody could rate this game as 1 star. They are obviously must be some kind of PC gaming \\"high-brow\\".Just one word of caution if you're married - you may want to have a good divorce lawyer lined up before you buy this thing because I warn you - you will be spending a rediculous amount of time playing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rome: Total Bore","review":"After reading the first 10 or 15 reviews on this site I'd thought I'd give this game a go. I really enjoy strategy games, and I thought this one might have quite a bit of depth, and would have a good longevity. The dull gameplay does not do the graphics justice, I expect to be able to switch on a game and enjoy playing it agian and again - this is not one of those games.

I'd highly recommend STW or MTW to anyone who's interested. RTW shows great potential but the game isnt ready for sale.

In fact unless you are willing to play the game in 12 hour stints without loading your game, the AI factions will NEVER take territories. Enough said. There are many more bugs but that alone is worth ignoring this game for the time being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great","review":"This game had the potential to be one of the best strategy games of all time.

Believe me, my PC is NOT loaded with all kinds of space wasting junk. There's no other game on my PC. I uninstalled and re-installed it yet it STILL won't go past the tutorial before crashing to desktop. I will NEVER buy another game by this company again. PERIOD. If there was an \\"I want my money back\\" star system, I'd give it 5.

With much regret, I had to put this game aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential crippled for slow player","review":"If you are the kind of player who can't play more than a few turns at a time (due to RL constraints), you will be very disappointed by this game. Due to an annoying bug when you reload a save game, the strategic AI is completely checked in his development (few countries will be able to expand beyind their intial borders).Which means no challenge at all on the strategic level and quite a boring game.PYJ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost there","review":"RTW is ALMOST a wonderful game. It's full of great ideas but it's seems finish in a rush, and it's shipped incomplete. It seems that 80/85% of the things in the game are complete, and in the others are plenty of bugs. The worst it's the load game bug (well, 'feature' in the Creative Asambly termonology). The AI lost of this long-term plans after a reload and play dumb for one or two turns. Of course, CA denied this and have no support/no acknowleged about this bug.So, it was a pity. RTW is almost there, in the edge of be a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, flawed implementation","review":"I'm giving this a 1-star, because it's got a major game breaking bug in it. The AI is flawed. Everytime you load a game, it manages to forget what it is doing. If it's sieging a city, the army will stop sieging and wander off to do whatever armies do.The consequences of this are huge. If like me you only play 4-5 turns at a time (and given a turn can take 10+ minutes that's not unrealistic), then every five turns the AI will stop. Consequently it doesn't expand, and there is no challenge.To add to the frustration, the developer, CA has stated that this is not a bug (despite evidence to the contrary), and that nothing will be done about it.Highly disappointing, and I can't honestly recommend it. The way I have been treated is awful, and I won't be buying another product by CA for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be good BUT","review":"This game is great if you can play multiple turns in one sitting. However there is an issue with the save game feature where the AI basically resets every time you have to load your game.

The ability to place yourself as a general commanding realistically rendered units as you look out over the battlefield. Its the \\"almost being there\\" quality that gives this game the \\"Wow!\\" factor. On top of which you get a strategic campaign mode game to link your battles together.The animations are highly detailed and can be pushed for detail as far as your video card can handle them. The controls and views are all intuitive or easily learnt and there are fun elements like your General giving a speech to his men before the battle or units cheering as they defeat another enemy. A recent patch has ironed out virtually all the irritating bugs and while there are still a few quirks none spoil the gameplay.Definitely one of my best buys"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Game","review":"I'm a fan of both the Civilization Series and Warcraft and very much enjoy this game.

[...][...]It is a shame because I loved Shogun:Total War, and I really had faith in the developers. No longer. If they cannot even admit that the save/load function is severely flawed, let alone dedicate the resources to fix it, what response do you think they should expect from their end-users?

In addition to the raised screen I find it very handy having an integrated full size keyboard, numerical keypad, and USB hub all in one. It should be noted that this is not as good as a proper external monitor, keyboard, and dock setup. However it does come in a close second if you do not have space for those items (although the footprint for the Alto is also quite large). For whatever reason some of the function keys don't work for me (such as the volume keys), which may be irritating if you want to use them a lot.

The photographs are old and grainy, the paper is cheap and the print is a bit fuzzy. I was surprised the book was published in 1991, it had the feel of a 1950's publication. The contents also seem to be out-of-date. Much of the text reflected the authors conjectures, beliefs and favorite idioms. There was no significant research of the subjects.

With the extreme heat over the weekend I finally got to see this and I can't believe it's taken me so long. What a splendid version of the novel, so smartly adapted and well acted by Samantha Morton, Max Beesley, Benjamin Whitlow, Ron Cook, Lindsay Duncan, Frances de la Tour, Peter Capaldi, John Sessions and others. This version captures the humor and the pathos of the novel and is much more satisfying than the film version with Albert Finney. I would have reigned in Brian Blessed's performance as the Western father character. Otherwise, I can recommend this wholeheartedly. I can't believe it's not more well known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!!!!!!!!!","review":"A&E is excellent when it comes to making mini-series, and Tom Jones is a prime example. The characters were very well cast and the screenplay was very well written. It was a joy to watch. I enjoyed every minute.

The Albert Finney version is so far superior to this trash that I hardly know where to begin the comparisons, but I'll try. Max Beesley is not remotely believable as a seducer of sophisticated women, Samantha Morton's Sophie is too silly for words and nowhere near attractive enough to drive a man to distraction. Brian Blessed was scarily manic rather than funny as Squire Western. All in all, this production was an incoherent mess.I don't always go along with professional reviewers, but I have to in this case (they hated it too!). Rent the Albert Finney version and enjoy (especially the scene at the inn with Mrs. Waters!). There is a reason why A&E never showed this again; it is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Jones","review":"I was more than incredibly disappointed with this film. Disgusted is a better word for to describe my feelings. While illegitimate children, love affairs and intimacy can be shown and talked of in a tasteful manner - this film did it most untastefully. It was full of explicit language and sexual content not to mention nudity and baseness. If it were given a formal rating according to the current ratings, it would definately be 'R'. It is a far cry from, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Wives and Daughters\\" and \\"North and South\\".

The characters were likeable enough, but two-dimensional and under-developed at best. Julian is described as a \\"scoundrel\\" on nearly every page, but is never really characterized as such. Chloe's character is half relatively-intelligent-but-naive-maiden and half silly widgeon. The mystery they're \\"solving\\" together is sketched out in the broadest lines possible, and is only used as a backdrop to their inter-personal tension, which is eventually resolved, but only after pages and pages of trite and unnecessary angst.

Back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban Legend","review":"This movie is a great source of camp, and one of the only movies out there that unintentionally serves as its own satire.I heard an urban legend that perhaps someone more knowledgeable could clarify for me. It goes something like this: Prior to this film, marijuana was legal (or, at least, not illegal). A chemical company (that still exists today, so I will refrain from using its name) made a chemical used in the process of making paper from wood pulp. Paper made from hemp (marijuana), however, did not need this chemical and was thus cheaper to produce. The chemical company, therefore had a great financial stake in demonizing (and eventually outlawing) the marijuana plant so that it could sell its chemical to paper manufacturers. It was this company that financed and distributed Reefer Madness, which was part of a propaganda campaign to make marijuana (and thus hemp) illegal.Does anyone out there know if this is even partially true?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Restored edition, fantastic!!!!!!","review":"The movie Reefer Madness seen by itself is really nothing to brag about, but this special addition for this best-selling cult classic is fantastic. It's a must buy, because for how cheap it is, you really get your money's worth. For the first time ever, I can say that the colorized version (complete with multicolor smoke and over saturated psychedelic color schemes) is better and looks better than the original black and white, and both versions are available to watch which is considerate of the DVD producers to give us both, and it looks as good as we can ever expect. Extra features are fantastic highlighted by a hysterical commentary by Mike Nelson, formerly of Mystery Science Theater 3000, which is the sole reason why I bought this edition. The commentary by the people who colorized the film is also worth a look. I highly recommend this new edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie we all laugh at now","review":"This movie was made to scare its generation away from marijuana. Now, its extreme exagerations and ludicrousy make it cult classic. From saying that the new \\"drug menace, marijuana\\" is far worse than cocaine or heroin to an introduction that states the film will only be a success if you are too scared to ever think marijuana has any good intent, the film goes too far to ever be considered serious. The film fails at its mission of scaring the public away from marijuana, but allows us to laugh at just how far the US Government went to continue the prohibition.

The author has effectively turned me off from a study of the Septuagint, not increased my interest in it. I was originally very interested in learning about the Septuagint and its place in the overall scheme of God's Word.

I was disappointed to find that it tuned out to be a collection of \\"Big Picture\\" propaganda films of the 50's era, and sadly lacking in history of the \\"conflict\\" outside of sketchy descriptions of the progress of the war. It might better serve as a study of propaganda as it existed during that period, but its usefulness ends there.This should not be confused with another CD collection with a virtually identical title: \\"Korea: The Forgotten War 1950 - 1953\\", and subtitled \\"The true story of a brutal and bloody war.\\" This I found to be a factual presentation of events, well organized and tastefully done - if war can be described in those terms.

For the high cost, I expect something that works at least the first time! What is with all the tiny accessories - must be part of the marketing strategy since they know little kids will easily lose them.

It took me about 30 minutes to just be able to untie and untangle Barbie & Krissy to get them out of the box. There is absolutely no reason for them to package so severly.

The story worked on a basic level and the scientific details very informative, but the author went overboard in his vividly gruesome descriptions of death and dismemberment. I quickly grew tired of the macarble detail and found I could skip paragraphs at at time and stil keep track of the plotline. However, my real problem with this book were the one dimensional characters and the unrealistic interactions b/t the Marine characters. I really hate when authors write about the military withoutconsulting someone who served. The interactions b/t the Gunnery Sgt and his subordinates did not realistically reflect the Corps, and the Captain calling the Gunny, \\"sergeant\\", would not happen in the Marine Corps. To make matter worse, the author seems to confuse Marines w/ (Army) Soldiers, which is tantamount to heresy.

Aside from a couple funny moments inserted to break up the drudgery, this movie is not worth watching. Unless of course, you feel as though you need a lesson in Gay rights, which is all this movie is about. Essentially it's a public service announcement for liberal gay tolerance, which I have absolutely no problem with. Where I do have a problem is when it's billed as a comedy, and I paid to buy the movie thinking it was something it is not. The plot has so much potential, but instead of going the typical Adam Sandler route of crude adolescent humor, it takes a turn in a completely different direction.

You can't give benefits to a dead person. Other than that, the film has it moments and it's general message about tolerance is a good one.

And I was so pleasantly suprised to be laughing out loud over and over again. I absolutely loved the light-in-the-loafers son. Especially when he beat up the bully at school. I about peed my pants. THAT was one of the best fight scenes in film history! Someone needs to clip that and turn it viral! If you're homophobic, you are going to be uncomfortable a lot in this movie.

This particular film is seriously missing something...I think overall it's just the chemistry of James and Sandler. They don't work well together; they're better off never working together again.I rented this out for the plot did sound funny enough, and the trailer for the movie sure made it look entertaining. But trailers can really fool you sometimes that's all. I hardly laughed throughout the entire movie, and most of the time I was looking at the clock, eager for the film to finally wrap itself up. It does grow boring and the jokes are not close to being memorable or side- splitting.Not to mention Sandler's character is just annoying from beginning to end. All this together makes this a rather lousy movie. Another Sandler miss to add to the list.2/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Adam Sandler","review":"Adam Sandler has a reputation among the Hollywood types as the nicest guy in Hollywood.

It had some new elements of vampire mythology. I wish we had some fang action compared to the necklace weapon.It was a bit dated...very 1980's like themes and visuals. The acting was good. Catherine Deneuve was perfect for the role. Icy, beautiful, and a tragic character. Bowie was not bad for the role. A young vampire worried about retaining his youth.Seeing a young, very attractive Susan Sarandon was a kick. Some of the love scenes were nice and appropriate for a vampire movie. Vampires, blood, and sex. What more could you want?Not five stars due to some slow pacing that just dragged at times throughout the movie. Like a previous critic noted...I was just waiting for Bonnie Tyler to come out singing \\"A Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" in the MTV music sets.A good solid movie for an evening view. Tight 91 minutes run time too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beautiful Vampires","review":"I suppose this movie was loosely about vampires, but it also seemed it was about beautiful people. You even had to be beautiful to be chosen by the stunning Catherine Deneuve and the eccentric/striking David Bowie. This movie is definitely a cult classic.Although since the mid eighties vampire movies have evolved into stories that have more of a plot, I still like this one even though it was all about \\"posing\\", and the plot what somewhat vague. The colors were beautiful, the music, the dialog was minimal which gave it a strong sense of obscurity and importance. The opening is just great with Bauhaus playing the tune Bela Lugosi is dead (that's actually Pete Murphy you see).This flick is one of the first that I have seen in which the vampires are just too \\"cool\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cult classic vampire flick","review":"Sink your teeth into this cult classic that should have made it to DVD a long time ago....still stylish 20 years after its release. May seem dated today, especially after films such as the adaptations of Anne Rice's classics, but the vampiric lovemaking and lesbian/vampire relationships were shocking at the time of its release. An attractive cast, especially the timelessly beautiful Catherine Deneuve, make this a must-have for fang fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film!","review":"This movie is excellent! Some people say that is a slow movie or it has nothing to do with the book. First of all,of course it is going to be slow if you are a Twilight Fan (I can imagine your faces if one day you decide to watch Murnau's Nosferatu). Second, I recommend you \\"Story and Discourse\\" by Seymour Chatman. Read it, then you will see that comparing literary texts and films as you do is a waste of time; they are different discourses. This film is great, great actors, great music, great gothic elements. If you want to see a very good vampire film, this is it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You call THIS a horror film? No way!!!","review":"Silly, overdrawn plot about vampires who just didn't come prepared. David Bowie was OK, I guess, but this movie just wasn't scary! Period! On the positive side, when Catherine Deneuve puts the moves on Susan Sarandon, I suddenly found myself paying attention! That was sexy! But why the hot girl-girl seduction scene in what's supposed to be a scary movie? It just doesn't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below par special effects + No suspense + Choppy flow + Wooden Acting = A huge waste of money and time","review":"This movie was released almost 30 years ago and it shows its age. The special effects look like those of today TV shows. I mean they look obviously fake. There\`s no suspense. The flow is choppy. The acting is wooden. Some scenes look more like a musical show than a movie. I mean they look beautiful but they had no substance. In short, this is a huge waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of David Bowies best movies to date","review":"I'm a huge Bowie fan, but I have to say that this movie did not feature his best performace. The only good part of The Hunger was the first ten minutes or so, after the shower scene with Denuve. Then the movie gets pretty boring, and Bowie ages rapidly and dies. so unless you want to think of Bowie as a dead Bowie, I suggest you save your money and not buy this movie.

So glad we have come so far in movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunger for More","review":"This film started off very well then just dropped off and went staight down. I guess I'm just not sure what Tony Scott(top Gun, True Romance) was trying to convey here. I did not fell simpathetic towards Catherine Deneuve at all. David Bowie was very good while he was in the film, but I wanted to see more of him. Far and away the best part of this film were the love sequences with Susan Sarandon and Deneuve. That being said, if the best part of the movie is the sex scenes then it is usually bad. I really don't think this was a bad movie, I enjoyed the idea behind it but not the delivery of the material. I guess with the cast and director I just expected more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best seducion scene ever!","review":"The scene where Miriam seduces Sarah while playing Lakme on the piano is delightfully erotic. Catherine Deneuve is mesmerizing in this scene and Sarandon played her part perfectly as well, innocent and awkward yet willing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stylish 80s Classic","review":"This 1983 film holds up incredibly well and has actually improved with time. Although the word \\"vampire\\" is never uttered, this is one of the best vampire films around. Tony's Scott's direction, coupled with the inspired casting of Denueve, Bowie and Saradon, makes it such a stylish trip that it's one of those rare films that's difficult to look away from.The DVD makes a very welcome and overdue debut as this film must be viewed in widescreen to truly appeciate the visuals. The quailty is excellent. The extras include a low-key but fascinating audio commentary by the director and Susan Sarandon, a still gallery and a trailer. Very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing, to say the least.","review":"I heard a lot about this movie. David Bowie! Vampires! Bauhaus!Well, I thought, I like Anne Rice. I like vampires. I like \\"gothy\\" movies. Why not see The Hunger?I was dissapointed. Sure, the movie was pretty, but plotless and extremely boring. The only good parts were the beginning (mainly because of \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\"), and the parts that had a young David Bowie in them. The rest of it was a typical 80's B movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money on this","review":"It's funny that today's reviews are positive and all the rest I saw are very negative. Don't get me wrong, I love David Bowie. He's a great actor. But this movie is not only slow-moving, it's boring, tacky, and crying for plot. It's also suffering from a serious lack of Bowie in the second half of the film at which point i'd happily smash my copy of the movie just so I would never have to watch it again. If a story were to be written out explaining this film, it would be no longer than one paragraph and it makes me wonder how they managed to fill the time when the amount of plot barely would have done well for a half-hour show. If you want to see David Bowie in something good, buy The Man Who Fell To Earth. It's a particularly interesting movie and shots from the movie can be seen on such album covers as Low and Ziggy2. So, in closing, don't buy or even rent The Hunger. It's a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MOVIE OF THE 80'S","review":"The Hunger will be available in the USA on DVD soon. No exact release date is confirmed yet but preliminary information gives October 5th 2004. .The DVD picture has been mastered in 16:9 Widescreen (Anamorphically Enhanced for widescreen TV's) that provides the very best picture quality and can also be viewed on a normal TV.The sound is mastered in Dolby Digital 2.0 (Stereo).

Catherine Deneuve is... well, she's Catherine Deneuve: elegant, beautiful, with a timeless/ageless quality this movie makes the most of. David Bowie co-stars in one of his best film performances. Wonderful photography and sound track lend to the atmosphere. A must-see for anyone captivated by the vampire mythos."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hunger.... a modern classic","review":"While this movie may not be for everyone -- it is certainly on a must-see list for anyone who likes Bowie (amazing performer), Sarandon (I love her!), or Deneuve (she absolutely gorgeous). Or, if you just love anything vampyrical, add this to your collection.The fashion, sexuality, and music make this a trip through time back to the 80's for me everytime I watch it. It might seem dated for some people - it's not a typical Hollywood Vampire flick. (Which is, of course, why so many people love this film). Buy the dvd, dim the lights, and curl up on the couch with someone you like."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ultra-Stylish, Ultra-Sexy Vampire Film.","review":"Never before have vampires been so seductive. \\"The Hunger\\" is the \\"Interview with the vampire\\" of the 80's. Tony Scott's Directorial Debut has style to burn and He proves himself to be an excellant story-teller. Much like his Brother Ridley, he has a brilliant visual sence and can make the most plain scene enthralling. He has Tremendous help from an Impecable cast. David Bowie fits his role like a glove while Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon use both Beauty and Brains to create the Sexiest Vampires on film. The film is really One memorable scene after another resulting in a near-perfect film. (More of Bowie would have resulted in perfection)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not about \\"vampires\\" - but Immortals","review":"Cool film - first saw it years ago. Deneuve is amazing.

I saw the movie without having first read the book and still found the plot engaging. The cinematography here is some of the most beautiful I've ever seen. Almost every frame is stunning. Worth seeing just for the scenes of the young man roller skating in a covered area - wet floor, fluttering birds, and Bowie hiding in a dark niche, like a spider waiting on him to pass close enough. Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hungry for the Hunger","review":"The best 80's vampire movie ever! All star cast and excellent cinematography.

Yet, he has F/A 18s firing these to destroy ground targets, and he refers to B2 bombers carrying AMRAAMs as cruise missiles.

It's just Jeanette and Hubert Cooke and their two guitars, but an entire band couldn't produce a bigger sound. The Cookes don't sing songs--they belt them, but the sound is engaging nonetheless. If you perform country gospel music for yourself, at open mics, or even professionally, you'll be adding to your repertoire from this CD.It's therefore especially unfortunate that the CD sounds as though every track was recorded with maximum gain so that the meters were pinned throughout the entire session.

The book is fantastic! I would love to see this book as reading material in high school classrooms. I would have loved to have it as a reading assignment when I was in high school. It teaches that we are all capable of being compassionate towards others and capable of building a greater world for all of to live in. I think it goes beyond the religion. To me, this book is right there on the list next to Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. Both are must reads for all. If only the American media actually reported news, we would all know of all the things that happen in the world, instead of just hearing a bias viewpoint.\\"All countries keep their citizens oppressed to one degree or another.

He becomes a drunkard but it is later revealed his 'retirement' was only cover to become a double agent for the East Germans. He then falsely defects to East Germany so he can do one last mission.I liked the film a lot and enjoyed the dialogue too. The Criterion edition is a two disc set with great bonus material.Disc one contains the film with the theatrical trailer, Disc two contains audio commentary by Oswald Morris of selected scenes, a 2000 BBC special about le Carr��, a gallery of set designs, and a 1985 conversation between between director Martin Ritt and film historian Patrick McGilligan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark , brooding and ironic ,","review":"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is a dark brooding spy saga about Alec Leamas (Richard Burton), a burned out, cynical, alcoholic and rather depressed former MI 5 agent, who has been \`discharged' from the service.Working in a library, he forms a romance with Nan Perry (Claire Bloom), a young English librarian, who finds meaning in her life, with doctrinaire Communist views, and her activities in the British Communist Party.Leamas is later asked by the service to help cover for a East German spy, secretly working for the British, and is asked to make contact with East German agents in Holland, before being taken back to Berlin.A rather ironic and slow moving film, with some brilliant dialogue and little action.The end gives some more ironic evidence of how the Communists devour their own , how those who devote their lives to \`The Party' often end up as it's victims."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to real intelligence organizations","review":"real life spying is made up of nondescript little grey men, not James Bond. best seen before watching Alec Guinness' tinker tailor and smiley's people, or the more recent tinker tailor remake"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"Couldn't understand the dialogue due to the British accents.Very difficult to follow.

The interpretation and the recording is first rate. I'd have to say it's as grand a recording as anything I've heard from Klemperer, Reiner, Von K, Haitink, etc. Just a luscious 3rd, in other words. The rest of the recording is highly charged, pounding, Beethovinian excitement at it's highest. Wow! Love the merge of thought and pure adrenalin! This guy knew what tempo was about! The 8th is to die for. I don't know the history, but I'd have to say that this conductor had a marked influence on most 20th C Beethoven interpreters that came after him. The tempo changes in the 8th are unlike anything I've ever heard, for instance. I'm sure some purists will object, but for a crafty, idiosyncratic take on the most often recorded composer in classical music (OK, maybe Bach and Mozart are in the lead there), I highly recommend this CD. It's in mono, sure, but the orchestra sounds splendid.BEK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite the errors...worth the inverstment.","review":"This is a great teaching(learning) book. Very few books get the point across as well as this one does. Aside from keeping your interest, as the book progressed from fundamentals to the later advanced chapters, I felt I was learning throughout the entire book. One of the best attributes of this book are the case studies. Each one builds upon the last until you have built and programmed a complex campus network. I was delighted as the lights went on with each progressive insight. I was less than happy with the CD and the answers to the study questions, and feel sorry for the authors as the editing staff did a poor job of catching mistakes. There is an errata sheet on the publisher's website, and it did address the errors. I am told a second edition will address these issues. By the way, I passed the exam first try with a 792. Not my greatest score, but also not squeaking by either. I recommend this book despite the errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good overview but lacking in depth","review":"I'll give this book credit for the fact it is easy to read but that's about it. I had thought the Cisco Press book was lacking until I read this one. It's a decent book on switching but I didn't find it very useful for passing the CCNP switching exam. I would recommend the Cisco Press and the Todd Lammle books. Reading the two of them will surely prepare anybody for the exam. The McGraw Hill book just doesn't have the depth and isn't very accurate. I also noted that the technical editor is a CCNA/DA. I find it hard to believe that a technical editor can provide much insite on a study guide for a certification that is beyond what he has.

I stopped reading it after the first two chapters. The title of the book is incorrect to start with. It should read \\"Building Cisco Multilayer Switched Networks\\" not \\"Building Cisco Multilayer Switching Networks\\" ! Some/all of the writers (and reviewers) just missed too many important concepts; and the figures are not illustrative of the concepts being discussed at all !

If you go by ACTUAL album sales Madonna is 1 and Celine is 2. Madonnas new album is looking to outsell Mimis in a few more weeks world wide! And who cares if Mariah is getting her 17th number one. That chart is no longer based on sales but spins at radio. Not hard for her to get a number 1now when stations are only playing Hip Hop and R&B!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did you see that, the greedy cow!?","review":"Jeeeeeeeesus Christ.

Mariah is certainly cementing her own demise with these trashy, cheap and mis-calculated releases.

Mariah has lost a fan due to her greediness and don't even get me started on those diehard lambs who worship the ground mariah walks on, they've made me hate mariah for good and trust me I've been a fan for 10 years"},{"rating":"1","title":"She reminds me of a stuffed sausage","review":"How many times has this album been \\"released\\" in order to garner sales? I realized that this album flopped internationally, so she has to make a buck somehow. The only good song on this album is \\"It's Like That,\\" only because the beat is addicting.

I DID!!!!!!!!!!!Now that you've got that into your head, let me just say, people should not buy this edition, nor should they buy the edition coming out near Christmas. Come to think of it, Mariah doesn't deserve anymore success or to sell records anymore because of her stupid cash-ins.Also, how cocky is the new title? The DIAMOND edition (released near to Christmas). Hint, hint, she wants her fans to get her a third diamond certification (Daydream and Music Box also gained this achievement). Well...this cash-in (or should I say, THESE cash-ins) are working, she's already half way there (this album is already certified 5x Platinum as of 8th December 2005). It's just a shame and such a pity she has to cheat to get there..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you doing Mariah!?","review":"A 5th release of the same album on the way! Is this the only way she can sell this album by having the same people buy it over and over!? No wonder this woman never goes on Stadium tours, cause she could never sell one out!

Mariah is over if she needs to do this to sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible CD","review":"I love mariah carey and her latest offering, but I have to give this one star because I will not support an album that I already own just for extra tracks.

The 4 new tracks \\"Don't Forget About Us,\\" \\"Makin' It Last All Night,\\" \\"So Lonely\\", and \\"We Belong Together (Remix),\\" are all excellent. They sound great on the CD. And the DVD is awesome. No cheap presentation, only the best for Mariah. The videos look terrific. You can either view them continuously or individually. The DVD menus look really nice also. This is a superb package all around.This CD plays like a greatest hits album. Amazing!!! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Mariah, you're trying it for a fifth time now, eh?","review":"I understand this is a fourth version of the album, but the fifth one is coming in late December - start saving your hard-earned money to dig out something else you already bought in the first place!!!

Now she is too breathy, and her voice isnt as clear and powerful as before. Now it sounds raspy and abit like michelle williams voice. I dont like the new sound of her music either.

I want to her some more songs like forever, and vision of love, and not only rnb just because its going to pay her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted with Mariah","review":"This album is okay, but I am disgusted with the idea that Mariah expects me to buy this album five times over with 5 versions of it in 9 months!

I agree with many of the reviews regarding this UltraPlatinum Edition. Why didn't Mariah put these items on the first disc??? Greedy, Greedy, Greedy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah, what have you done?","review":"Mariah's career has been a freefall since day one. This album is nothing as good as earlier MC's hits. The first albums (particullary Musicbox) are what Mimi should have done always. It seems like she will never produce quality hits such as \\"Hero\\" anymore. But oh well, those where the good times...Also, the CD quality is very lood, the production falls short."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lambs Have Been Slaughtered","review":"While Mimi has been emancipated, all of her lambs have been placed into bondage to keep buying any lame CD she puts out. Mariah Carey went downhill back in 1997 and I haven't supported anything she has done since then. She doesn't appeal to me anymore with her whispy vocals, implants, and attempt to be down with the hip-hop thang. So now in the \\"music\\" world you have this new thing where you re-release the same lackluster album, each time adding a little something on that doesn't contribute anything worthwhile. Simply because it's Mariah Carey that's reason enough to get this so-called \\"Ultra Platinum\\" CD/DVD edition. What's the next re-release going to be called? Emancipation of Mimi Super Duper Maxi Ultra Platinum Plus? Anyway, this re-relase sucks just as much as the original, probably much more since it's a greedy attempt to rip off folks. But hey, you suckers get what you pay for: nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time goes by so slowly when listening to mariah","review":"Mariah's music is full of contrived cliche lyrics, sung over tried and tired beats, immaculately polished to fit the radio airwaves. Forget substance, edge or any sense of diversity, Mariah is in it for the hits, and if it means selling her soul, then so be it.You see, the difference between Madonna and Mariah is quite simple:Madonna is a pioneer of our times, an artist who goes against the grain, and challenges social norms. Her power and passion far transcends only her music, as she is a cultural icon. her music may not always sell in the tens of millions, but it makes a statement, and with time, it is appreciated for the risks it took.mariah is a pioneer(purchaser) of hit songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the looney bin with you woman!","review":"Only a mad woman would release the same record 86 times just to cheaply garner as many sales as possible. Look out for January when she releases The Super Topaz Diamond Encrusted Platinum Titanium Steel 24 Carrot Gold Super Bling Bling Edition with a bonus track of Mariah singing about tulips, rainbows, butterflies, lucky charms, and lollipops! Do not miss out on this lambs or Mariah might have to join her sister out on the street corners."},{"rating":"1","title":"How greedy and desperate can a record label be?","review":"I know Mariah needs to make her money so she can buy her Luis Vuitton and Cristal, but this re-re-re-release of this album is shameful. If you have to release the same album multiple times, it's because the label is desperate for sales, and it's hard to respect ANY corporation that's desperate. Mariah, I love you, but I don't need to buy 60 copies of the same album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Why are people saying there are four remixes on the CD? Have you even listened to the re-released? It has the original 14 tracks, plus ONE remix- \\"We Belong Together\\"! The others are \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", \\"So Lonely\\" and \\"Makin It Last All Night.\\"I loved this CD the first time it came out, and I love this version even more because of the DVD. The interview is HILARIOUS and we get to see a side of Mariah we never did before. I stood in a line for a total of 16 hours in the past two days to meet her, and it was absolutely worth it. She was amazing, as is the re-release! Madonna fans, don't clutter the reviews up with your inaccurate rantings. If you have something to say about the music, then say it. Don't come in here to promote Madonna- do it on her own CD's review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Official: Emancipation of Mimi [Diamond Deluxe Edition]","review":"You heard it folks, it's coming your way. if you think a cheap poster, an extra video and six remixes of the same song are worth $27.99, then go ahead and place your pre-order.let's hear the Lambs defend mariah's motives now!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A fifth version of this album to be released!!!!","review":"December 27th will see a Diamond Edition of this album released, which will encompass an updated bonus DVD, and an extra third disc which will feature an array of remixes. What's more, is that it will come in a collector's box, and will include a full lengh poster of the album cover.Now don't get me wrong, this sounds like a good version to grab, had it been relesed 2 weeks ago!!!!! However, since I have already parted with my cash for 2 versions of this album, I am absolutely mad that mariah would authorise such a blatent attempt to cash in on her success.Please mariah, stop forcing your fans to cough up their money everytime your label decides to add a video or remix to an already stale release. Stop the madness!!!What's worse, it will be selling at 24.99 (approximately, though not certain). This is an extremely high price, and for that, I will be passing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously another artist who doesn't care about the fans.","review":"Ok, it's official. Because of this, I no longer like Mariah. Why should us non-TeamLamb used-to-be fans respect her if she has none for us? No wonder she calls you her lambs. You ain't helping either. You are trashing Madonna and Mariah is getting low ratings for this. While I hate the members of TeamLamb with more passion than I hate Mariah, Mariah took a wrong step. Very wrong...bad idea! The original album is good, but this is just a waste of money, plus you'll be falling into Mariah's trap of trying to gain a diamond certification."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Re-Issue of a fantastic C.d","review":"The new song Dont Forget about Us is Great..Mariah is really on a Hot-Streak this Year. I see some Grammies coming her way"},{"rating":"1","title":"Album Of The Year? Hah!","review":"The original version of The Emancipation Of Mimi was mediocre at best (I did listen to it and did buy the album. Listen. I DID!!), but the re-releases are just too much and Mariah is going too far. Maybe if she released this as a first re-issue of the album, I would give it maybe 3 or 4 stars. But no, instead, she released the Limited Edition, followed by the Platinum Edition, then the Platinum Edition with the DVD, which makes her a total utter cash cow and means this is the THIRD re-issue of an old album. As the following item is a first re-release of an original album, buy the new version of Madonna's Confessions on a dance floor instead, which is really how you should package a special edition!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emancipation(s) of Mimi","review":"1.

Now we will be getting yet another re-release of this album at the end of December. And this is all so Mariah can suck more money out of the pockets of her fans so she can buy more donuts and get even fatter. For only $27.99 you get a fifth re-release featuring We Belong Together Part 2 (So So Def Fat Cow Remix: featuring Twista, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliot, Da Brat, Ludacris, Nelly, Busta Rhymes, Jay Z, Puff Daddy and Jadakiss). So everyone run out and buy it right away, after all you will have to wait another two months before she re-releases it yet again for $49.99 with another bonus cd of her farting the tracks into the microphone. There are actually some musicians who don't need to re-release an album five times in order for it to go platinum."},{"rating":"1","title":"mariah is a greedy pig!","review":"releasing this album 5 times? okay now THAT IS SO PATHETIC. I like this album but all the additional stuff is garbage and not worth another 20 bucks. She's cheating her fans and they're too immature and fanatical to realize or admit that mariah obviously loves her fan for financial gain and obviously is not confident enough to release beautiful ballads which easily could have been done from the original mimi. Mine Again got a grammy nomination, why not just release that song instead as a single? Kanye West is a great producer, Stay the Night could have been released, but she had to release the cliche r&b don't forget about us with it's weak vocals and attempt at being like we belong together. I'll have to think twice before buying a new mariah carey record since the new tracks sucked, it really worries me. And the fact she's proven she's in the music business just for the money is giving me second thoughts about where my money is really going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-release? Don't you mean re-re-re-release?","review":"Look. To get my point straight, this is what I'm trying to say. These are the four versions of this album available so far:1---THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI - Mariah's successful comeback, went on to sell 4 million in the U.S alone.2---THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI (LIMITED EDITION) - Mariah's successful comeback gets another money-grabbing boost with a poster and a special packaging, therefore this is the RE-RELEASE.3---THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI (PLATINUM EDITION) - Mariah releases the same old album with 4 bonus tracks, making this the RE-RE-RELEASE.4---THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI (PLATINUM EDITION DELUXE) - Mariah releases the \\"PLATINUM EDITION\\", but with a bonus DVD this time. Therefore, this makes this the RE-RE-RE-RELEASE, like I said in my title.Mariah, this is a cash-in.

Are some consumers being punished for running out and getting this cd when it was first released? Here we are, two singles later, with an 'expanded' version of this project.

I can't speak for everyone, but I'm sick of this 'double-dipping' that's become so common in the industry. I and won't be suckered into it...I'll just get a copy - yes, a COPY, from a friend. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this heiffer thinking?","review":"Lord knows, this owman is so tired and played out it is not funny. The only times she has been an interesting artist was when she went looney tunes and tried to kill herself and when that sick girl wrote her a letter and she responded with: \\"Excuse me Miss, but I have problems of my own.\\" Now that was a laugh riot!Here is just a few remixes added to an already craptacular CD. Yes she has a voice, but she only sings unremarkable songs.

Even if she was it would only be because she plays it safe and never has an opinion. Madonna has taken on abortion(Papa Dont Preach). She took on the Catholic church(Like a Prayer). She proved that women could own their sexuality and not be victims of it, and spoke out for gay rights(Erotica Era). She stood up against war and took on Bush(American Life). What has Mariah stood up for? Butterflys? Gli tter? Charmbracelets?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think that","review":"This album is abit overhyped. I dont hate mariah, but i dont like the kind of music that is on this cd. They are merely repetitive rnb songs. I would rather have seen songs like open arms, and forever on this cd. I also think that there are too many featured artists on the cd. Only about five of the songs are just mariah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly.","review":"I'm sure people like Madonna and Janet have released special editions before in their music careers, yeah, but that's not what I'm getting at Mariah for. I used to like her.The fact that she's released this album four times over (as many other reviewers have already stumbled up on), and also released her Merry Christmas album recently for a second time on dual disc, shows she's just too desperate for money.

Mariah is as manufactured as they get, and is constantly looking for street cred, which she simply doesn't have. She has only slightly changed her style once, in her entire career, and likes to stick to the formula. Where's the creativity in that.Further more, she is ripping oiff her fans with this 'deluxe edition'. I mean, is she had all these extra 'good' songs from the beginning, why not place them on the album initially. Why wait and make fans dip into their wallets twice. That is greed, and it shouldn't be tolerated. BOYCOTT THIS RELEASE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-releasing The Emancipation Of Mimi: bad idea!","review":"I did like Mariah. Furthermore, I thought this album would go on to be a Mariah classic in ten years time. It will, that's the honest truth. However, I don't think it will be remembered for its great original tracks.

I won't buy another CD from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get The Ultra Platinum Edition!!!","review":"Mariah fans, get the Ultra Platinum Edition and you won't be disappointed. THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI is one of the best albums of 2005. If you're a fan of her earlier work and you've hesitated buying this, now is the time to take a chance.

It's about why Mariah is such a cash-in cow and why she is such a greedy so and so. So. Here we go.First Mariah releases her comeback, which goes onto sell well, standing currently at 4x Platinum in the U.S. Then, she releases a limited edition with a bonus poster and special packaging.

Def Jam just are desperate cuz they havent got any success from any of their artists lately. Ashanti flops, Ll Cool J flops, etc.Mariah i'm a diehard fan. Stop doing this to your career.

Her record company is actually quoted as saying this in the article: 'We can't reveal any details yet, but what we can say is that Mariah is excited about giving her fans this special release for christmas, and that she is working hard on making it extra special for them'.Let's hope that mariah realises that over-flooding a market with your cheap releases may actually have adverse affects on sales, and pulls the plug on this joke of a release.Article quoted from the canadian Music Buzz magazine, November issue, under the headline 'Mimi plans diamond box for fans'"},{"rating":"1","title":"We'er so glad U2 upset this skank","review":"Blue Racer: Mariah Carey is one ugly tramp and only came back as her label people paid radio to play her but the great U2 upstaged her.

In 2001 Mariah not only battled a bitter ex hubby out to sabatage her career, but she was also dropped by her label because of it. No one in the history of music could fall so gracefully and most critics actually thought her career was over. Mariah received over $50 million from Virgin Records for one album Glitter and anyone that business saavy is meant to be here..Mariah's voice on the Emancipation is truly captivating and the lyrics and beats are her best yet..The Emancipation of Mimi is about to cross 10 million sold worldwide and has already been named the biggest selling album on 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this one!","review":"It's great to see that in this edition you will own a few more songs and video as well but I hope that Mariah also can do the same thing to her Charmbracelet album.

If she can do to the Emancipation of Mimi, why not Charmbracelet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One limited edition is fine, FOUR is toooooo many!","review":"I say four because she's released three limited editions of The Emancipation Of Mimi (the original version is obviously NOT a limited edition), and she's releasing a fourth limited edition soon, and a fifth version of the same album.1- The Emancipation Of Mimi2- The Emancipation Of Mimi Limited Edition3- The Emancipation Of Mimi Ultra Platinum Edition4- The Emancipation Of Mimi Ultra Platinum Edition w/DVD5- *COMING SOON!* The Emancipation Of Mimi Diamond Dulexe EditionPoint proved on why this is 1-star and why it deserves no credit. Sorry Mariah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels cheap.","review":"It's not artist-like to re-release an album and even less when EVERY SINGLE SONG depends on backing vocals from featured artists, this woman is only behind Ciara in the \\"feature another artist cheap thingy\\".Definitely C H E A P, bad quality production, it sounds like it has been recorded under the sea.Unlike Jennifer Lopez's VERY good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gisela Uberia","review":"Bad already released Music, people, this is not RnB, MC is the sweet girl next door who now pretends to have street cred and makes cheap songs by featuring like 200 different artists and never standing by herself, it must be that after her mental breakdown she simply lost her voice and now resorts to lypsynching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible re release","review":"I can't believe I actually wasted my money on this, the 4 new tracks are horrible, you get a recycled remix of We Belong Together, 2 BAD new tracks and the newest single Don't Forget About Us which sounds like We Belong Together part 2, the song is tanking BIG TIME because of that fact. Mariah is really trying to milk everything she can out of this album, I do love the orginal release and would give that release 4 stars but there is no reason to buy this version if you have the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why re-release the same garbage from only a few months ago?","review":"Mariah, in her never-ending attempt to stay relevant, has re-released her insipid EMANCIPATION CD. Why? Don't ask me....I'm just as confused about it as most people. It was trite to begin with, and re-releasing it only shows her chronic desperation to sell more records to be deemd worthy of \\"pop star status\\". Word to Mariah - get over it. Your work will speak for itself, and given that most of your older work is forgotten, you don't have much to say.Save your money and buy MADONNA's CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR - it is a far better CD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Dull, Repetitive, all in one giant worthless pack.","review":"The production is bad, the sound quality is VERY-cheap, sometimes you can't hear what MC is pronouncing because of it.Also, it's one giant ball of the same old song from 15 years ago, creativity isn't inside the minde on Boriah Scarey.Buy J'Lo instead.

What a ploy to raise her sales and earn more money. The original was bad enough, but honestly, the new songs on this album are even worse. When you hear them you will understand why they didn't make the album originally. Now they decide to put them together and try to scrape up more sales... like always.Save your money because chances are she is going to be releasing the Super-D-Duper Ultimate Titanium x 10 version of the album in a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for the Diamond Edition coming late December","review":"The Emancipation of Mimi (Limited Diamond Edition) rrp 27.99That's right lambs, don't purchase this ediiton cause there is a spectacular editon being planned, and slated for release on the 27th of December!!

It is rumoured to feature 3 discs, and comes in a box packaging, with a bonus poster and christmas clippings.This is pure heaven for us Mariah fans, and means that this will be a 'diamond' christmas. Yipeeee!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mimi has gone overboard with this trash!!!","review":"She was lucky to sell so much of this trashy album originally, but now she is just pushing it. She is milking the cow with this release, and us fans should not put up with it. Slap Mimi up, and throw her with yesterdays trash i say!!! She is a vile, fat and over-grown monster who needs to be stopped. All her albums are contrived crap, and they all sound like they are created by some computer.MAriah, please lose some weight before you decide to wear a skimpy dress again, and save us all the agony of having to look at your vile body!!! Lay of the krispy kremes mimi!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No voice, No talent, just a big behind!!!","review":"Mariah is nothing but a fat low life money scavenger, who hates her fans and loves to rip them off. She has no talent, and needs to lose some of that fat on her body before she releses anything else. Seriously, she is just milking the cow with this trashy mediocre album,Madonna is beautiful, and is a living legend. Mariah is just an old, worn out, fat wannabe!!Note to mariah: Can't you afford jenny craig??"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Emancipation of Mimi is a beautiful album!","review":"You have to give props for Mariah Carey to this great cd and she sings so beautiful and great that the same time. I think Mariah Carey and Mary J.Blige are the best singers of all times. My favorite songs is It's Like That,We Belong Together,Shake It Off,Say Somethin' Featuring Snoop Dogg,Stay The Night,Get Your Number Featuring Jermaine Dupri,To The Floor Featuring Nelly,Fly Like A Bird, We Belong Together remix Featuring Jadakiss,and Styles P and the new single Don't Forget About Us. If you don't have this re-release cd of The Emancipation of Mimi and go get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"my honest opinion","review":"I don't like the fact biased madonna fans are pulling a teamlamb tactic and giving this album 1 star reviews when I doubt they've even heard the album though madonna is a legend and all. I have this album and I really think it's one of mariah's best, so why am I giving it one star? Because the new songs are crap and the original ones are fine the way they are, there is nothing wrong with the original version of this CD. This album was just an attempt for her label or even possibly her to make more money and gain more popularity when she's been blessed with enough of it this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS","review":"I will definately buy this.. i love this album so much!!!!!! Its so good to see Mariah back on top of the charts.. its where she belongs!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great albumn would buy another","review":"Quit hattin' I beleive that Mimi is back and better than ever I bought both albums and would buy another just because she is all that and more. And all you anorexic hoes out there get over the fact that curvse are here to stay and she looks hot! And I am a gay man I would consider Hittin' that sexy woman! Great praise to Mimi! You go girl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point?","review":"Yeah, the album is very nice (I rated it 4 stars), and the bonus tracks and the videos are great, but this is such a cash-in, it doesn't deserve atleast 4.5 stars like the actual special edition/songs do. Mariah is just attempting to make more money - FOUR TIMES!? I don't think so. She should be banned from re-releasing her albums more than once, coz I hear she's releasing the album again for a fifth time soon..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah is a cash cow. GET OVER THAT.","review":"Mariah has an amazing voice, I'll give you that. The original version of The Emancipation Of Mimi (that's four versions back), deserves atleast 4/5 stars, but this deserves just 1, or even nothing! She's CHEATING to get her diamond certifications! And she's going to release a fifth version of the album in December!?Me? I prefer both Madonna and Jennifer to Mariah. Oh, and please stop calling her J.Lo, people. Do you know she ditched that name a few years ago? Well you know now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra Platinum Edition my arse, woman.","review":"Mariah is such a cash-in. First she releases the original comeback, followed by the Limited Edition, followed by two Platinum Editions!--One with a DVD, one without. How sad does the bloody tart want to get!?But wait. I wouldn't even think about buying this! In atleast four months she'll be releasing, like, the Super Duper 10 Times Million Ultra Ultra Ultra edition of the album. As always, it will include the same old 14 songs available on the Original album. What's the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad...","review":"I can't believe the music industries is complaining about decline in sales and then pull a stunt like this. What's the purpose of this? To make the listener angry. I do believe that The Emancipation of Mimi - original version is one of Mariah's better album in recent years and I bought that album. However, with this new release it seems like a slap in the face for people who start to believe that she is going in the right direction. The Emancipation of Mimi will be my last album I ever bought from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emancipation of Whoriah Scarey","review":"Mariah really needs to stop using words becasue they sound intelligent, cause nothing on this album resembles anything near an emancipation. It is a cheap beat-driven 'album', which can't even be classified as music.Get Emancipated, or Die Tryin'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Speachless.........","review":"There is really only one terrific song on this album and that is We Belong Together. I was soooo happy when I first heard this because I thought Mariah had returned to her roots. Boy was I let down when all I got was a record filled with rappers on many of the tracks! Stop with the Hip Hop Mariah! It stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shes bigger then ever!","review":"and I dont mean her career dude! She has gotten thick! Her face is so huge! Either she stuffs it with food or she be taking meds for her sanity and its a side effect. Her music is bad to man. And I agree, Madonna is looking HOT again! Can we say MILF!? peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to cheat your fans Mariah!","review":"She is REALLY coming across as desperate with trying to sell as many albums as she can by releasing the SAME album a billion times over. I really think this is going to backfire right in her fat face. Put a fork in her cause Mariah is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss Piggy..","review":"I used to be a Mariah Carey fan. Back in the 90's when she had talent and actually wrote good songs and could still sing. Now she is a fat cow who is as greedy as they come. The idea of releasing an album 4 times and now re-releasing yet again with a third disk of remixes a month after the last re-release?? I remember a time when her remixes were made available on singles for fans to purchase when they were on the radio. Of course that was back in the day when she wasn't a self centered pig who was more interested in sales than in making quality music. She is a fat pig who belongs on the Muppet Show with Kermit the Frog and Gonzo. Mariah, do yourself a favor and go to Jennie Craig with all the extra money you will be sucking out of her stupid Lambs who apparently want to buy any repackaged crap you throw at them. This is pathetic and calculated greed. You have just lost another fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star does not equal to hating or jealousy","review":"I am a mariah fan I have all her albums but I'm not interested in this one because I already have the original, and someone should have told mariah if it aint broke don't fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"please make it stop...","review":"Mariah Carey is already a millionare... why does she have to release this album again? With very few new material...She could have simply released a CD Single for \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", and it would be better if named \\"we belong together - part 2\\" or maybe be a little more original and go with \\"we still belong together\\"! Plus having a song only on a CD single, people would buy it a lot! and it would reach #1 on the HOT 100, just like we belong together did...now releasing another version of this album just because of a few more tracks is just low... a cheap attempt to make it bounce back to top 10, so that the new TV ads can say \\"after all this time she's still top 10!\\" that's CHEAP... LOW...I just wish that she goes back to the days when nobody cared about her and she was a wacko... I actually enjoy her music, we belong together is funky, it's like that is GREAT! but I just don't like her..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shut up!","review":"Please! Mariah is so much better than that washed-up, good-for-nothing, has-been J.Lo! If J.Lo is so good then why did Rebirth flop while The Emancipation of Mimi has been certified 4x Platinum? These J.Lo-fans need to go hide in a corner and die along with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fat in Mimi's Trunk!!!!","review":"Mimi has obviously lost the plot, as her record label has just released the following statement regarding the Diamond deluxe edition of this album: 'Whilst we cannot reveal exact details regarding the new edition of Mimi, what we can reveal is that Mariah is working hard on making this release extra special for her fans, as a sort of thank-you for their loyalty and support to her'.If Mimi thinks she is thanking her fans by making them cough up for another edition of this trashy album, then she needs to be locked up in some cave somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greedy Ass B*tch","review":"Get the **** outta here. Mariah is the best selling female artist of all time but she's re-releasing an album that is like 5 million platium, are you serious?

She gets a little success and she goes overboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah's best album, and best re-release","review":"This re-release is the best!!!!!The CD includes 3 all-new songs and 1 remix of the hit \\"We Belong Together\\" (with new vocals!)The all-new songs are fabulous:1. \\"Don't Forget About Us\\"it's a great song. 10/102. \\"Makin' It Last All Night (What I Do)\\"9/103. \\"So Lonely (One & Only pt II)\\"This is not a remix of \\"One & Only\\", it's even better than this one. 10/10The DVD is incredible, because the clips of \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" are the best videos i've ever seen.

Mariah, please come to your senses!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please tell me i'm dreaming!!!!!","review":"The nerve on this woman. I can't believe that she is seriously going to release a diamond edition of this album in late december, considering she only re-released it 2 weeks ago!!!!! This must set some sought of record, if only one for the most greedy artist in the history of music. Please boycott this release at all costs!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ultra-Platinum waste of money","review":"After purchasing this release, and listening to it, i could not believe I had fallen for the same old industry trap, the 'let's re-release this mediocre album in increase sales' trick. Never has a release been so mechanical and obvious in it's attempt to increase sales for an artist. Mariah is more sickening than usher, in that she tries to pull it off whilst pretending to be genuine. The new single 'Don't forget about us' is as contrived as a song can be, and is a calculated radio hit, with no substance or emotion apparent.Stay right away from this release!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated theories make me question this book","review":"This book is a good read and the author offers up many suggestions for dealing with different types of employees that way well work. However, it was something I read in the opening chapters that concerned me. The author mentions motivation theories, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and the Two Factor Theory (Motivation/Hygiene). Though these factors have been used by practicing managers for a long time (and are quite intuitive), empirical research has found that they are not valid. Though the author never explicitly says that she uses these theories in her recommendations, it casts doubts on her advice. Your mileage may vary on how useful her suggestions are, but I have a hard time trusting the advice of someone who is presenting outdated theories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone ever hear of digital?","review":"I HATE to give this recording a bad review.

The introductory legend serves it's purpose in setting up the story, but the film seems to falter afterwards. The film becomes sluggish and the story grows very thin and drawn out in the middle. Eventually, the action picks up for the conclusion, but by this time my interest has faded. The film does have the Hammer trademark colorful costumes and good sets, as well as some very good make-up, but not enough to help a film that looks more like a missed opportunity than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL!","review":"The debut album by this band was alright, but after a few years of touring their schtick has been worn as thin as tracing paper. Put a fork in this band because they are definitely DONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"It appears to me that the reviews below are not representative of all who have read this fine work. While this is not Cobb's best book by any stretch, he does a fine job showing how his process hermeneutic applies to Wesleyan theology. Ask any ten Methodists what it means to be Wesleyan, and you'll likely get several different answers. Cobb finds a way to discern a unifying strand in the possible answers and points it toward mission and practice.With Cobb, what you see is what you get. When his theology has weak spots, he is the first to admit it. What I find in this book is an intellectually honest, faithful, and meaningful approach to what Wesleyanism and how it can be lived out in our current cultural context. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses on 'for Today'","review":"Cobb is a process theologian trying to communicate to the reader how Wesley's theology can be relevent today. He's not in his area of specialization in this book and doesn't seem to really want to carry on. I expect that Cobb knows of what he speaks, but the book is burdened with academic language and, in my opinion, missed opportunities at connecting Wesleyen tradition to today. As a well-educated reader with a keen interest in Christianity's search for relevence in today's world, even I had trouble slogging through this one. Your experience may be better than mine, but I would recommend this one only reluctantly. Not an old book, but seems dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Problems still unsolved","review":"From 1982, we have this collection of papers by Israeli scholars studying the West Bank and Gaza. It is a detailed discussion of many aspects of the regions. Most important is the analysis of the Israeli and Arab settlements and the validity of establishing new Israeli settlements, under international law.But perhaps just as important is another chapter on the water resources of the regions, which are semi-arid. The effect of continuing current usage on the future water table is investigated, and does not yield optimistic projections.Overall, now in 2004, looking back, we see that the book's issues are as relevant and difficult to resolve nowadays. Population densities have increased and several intifadas have heavily damaged the economy and led to high poverty rates."},{"rating":"1","title":"an anecdotal collection, no \\"true scientific research\\" here","review":"One of the first clarions of the so-called computer \\"Productivity Paradox\\", this report is often cited by other unsubstantiated, anecdotal \\"studies\\". But there is no \\"true scientific research\\" here. Written in 1994 (or '93), published in 1995 (with the fourth printing in \\"97), it must necessarily ignore the enormous impact of the Web. And like similar tales of \\"Productivity Paradox\\" it fundamentally ignores that their incorrect conclusions are based on more than twenty five years of data \\"category error\\" (insufficient definitions). Hence the recent NAICS data corrections reflect the enormous economic impact that previously was denied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thesis about computers and productivity quickly became false","review":"This book makes good points about how computer usability problems impact productivity. The author argues that computers had a negative impact on productivity in the years 1973-1993, but misses the idea that these were years of learning to incorporate computer technology deeply into business processes.

It is well-illustrated, both in color and black-and-white. However, the index is not accurate. It's as if the publisher failed to revise the index prior to publication. For example, the index says that the designer \\"Tortolani\\" is mentioned on pages 206 and 219. In actuality, this designer is listed on pages 190 and 203. It's the same problem no matter what one looks up. This problem makes the book essentially useless for research.

With this CD, Naxos completes its series of Delius works recorded in the 1920 and 1930s by Sir Thomas Beecham. Transfers from 78s have been judiciously managed by Devid Lennick, who supplies informative notes, as does Lyndon Jenkins, Chairman of the Delius Society. Production values in this 2000 issue are all that could be wished for, as are the affectionate and dedicated performances under Beecham's direction. \\"Appalacia\\" is the principal work here, recorded in 1938. The sound is marginally better than can be heard on the fist two CDs in this series. The original 78s apparently pleased the ever-fastidious Sir Thomas and his producer Walter Legge.

However, I was dissappointed by the impracticality of some of the advise, e.g. St. Joan's wort. To have this oil, you are supposed to pick the flowers in June, store them for months, prepare them and then you have the oil to use! Also it advises stretching, exercising etc. that is all very well if you have a \\"normal\\" pregnancy. I enjoy living a healthy organic lifestyle, however, this book is too \\"mother-earth\\" for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the cuff health advice is dangerous","review":"While Susan Weed covers a great many topics and remedies in this book, she doesn't cover any of them with enough detail. She leaves out warnings, indications and rational for many of her reprinted remedies. This book is only150 pages, but should be 3 times that considering the number of topics that she covers. For example she says that \\"excess vitamin C\\" is a Teratogen. Well, how much vitamin C, when and why? Things listed as teratogens are listed as cures later in the book (ex. caster oil). Overall, this book left me confused and frustrated with more questions than answers. This is the kind of book that gives herbal self-medicating a bad name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty thorough.","review":"Great to have on hand during pregnancy and the first year of breastfeeding.

It is unlikely for \\"Eyewitness Travel Guides.\\" I usually believe maps will be greatly appreciated especially for small towns which don't have the tourist information center. However, I appreciate the concept that this publisher makes this regional guidebook, so I give one start for it.

Dropping a slab of brillant sonic sludge. \\"Walking Stick Man\\" is reminicent of there early bluesy stuff. Isobel plays violine instead of the flute. They have also added another drummer and a harmonica to the mix. Joe Culver is still in the band and his drumming is as brilliant as allways. There is also Ed Farnsworth on drums his style is a little more straight forward but still great. Brothers Mike and Jon's guitar work is more spacy and dense. The violine is a great new sound for the band. I do wish there was still a flute. \\"AGain\\" is a real rocker in a Dead C kinda way. Isoble's vocals is as incomprahensibal as ever and thats why we all love her. Clint and joe still provide the structure for the waves of noise to live in.

The author seems to justify his sexual cravings for teenage girls with his \\"charitable\\" ways of offering food and housing to them. It is a very depressing book of old American men preying on young, poor, uneducated girls up to 1/4 their age and then complaining of the lack of love they receive in return. The book goes to great lengths to mock the Costa Rican Ticos for their laziness and dishonesty while bragging about the American's whore mongering of poverty stricken teenage girls. A more valuable insight would have been of relationships between American men with Costa Rican women no more than 20 years their junior. There was nothing remotely Happy about the aging of American men in this book.

I had 3 different hydrometers, all 3 showed different readings. With this, you can calibrate it yourself with just pure distilled water. Once you calibrate it to that (which should have a Sg of 0) you know everything else will be accurate. Additionally the reading gives you a perfectly straight line across the meter, so it's much easier to read. Only need a few drops of water; no more sticking half your arm in the water to fill up the hydrometer. Quicker clean up as well. The only downside is that you need a fairly bright source of light to be able to read the result; normal ambient light isn't enough. Sticking it up to a lamp normally is though, so not too big of a deal. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of the best albums of 1999","review":"Xtra Acme USA is far better than Acme itself; it's the Xplosion at it's most inventive, funky and brilliant.

Moving them to my ipod for current review (Acme, Experimental Remixes, and Orange) made me realize I have been missing something in my life. I mean these albums were classics for Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. Looking around to increase the depth of this current playlist, I found Xtra-Acme. A follow-up to Acme, definitely providing more depth.... funky, rocking, soulful, punk-ish, noisy, chaotic, bluesy.... just like Acme and classic JSBE.Xtra is getting lots of air time in my music listening, and it is absolutely worth the purchase.It is obvious that Beck (as in RIYL) found much influence in the style of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion--both in vocals and rhythms.

Fripp's snakelike guitar lines loop through Eno's ambient landscapes with aimless grandeur, beautifully limning the constellations considered by title: \\"Tarazed\\", \\"Ankaa\\", etc. All seven tracks are of equal sonic value. The most propulsive, though, is \\"Altair\\", where Fripp's guitar meets the drummers from Hassell/Eno's Fourth World, Vol. 1, for a scenic glide through the night sky."},{"rating":"1","title":"a let down","review":"doesn't even come close to the heights set by no pussyfooting and evening star. at best, wispy ambient music for video games or sci-fi tv shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Ambient","review":"What do you do when Ambient Music seems too loud?

This movie is a one, giant, very biased opinion and so few people seem to notice that. any nutritional scientist would laugh. The arguments presented in this movie are almost never supported with any research. These are just idea that in some cases are plainly dangerous.It is scary that so many people believe in this, without trying to be rational and without any sign of critical thinking. Dark Ages. People believe in what they want to believe.People need to be educated about food and life style. However, this video does little to educate but does a lot to spread some unsupported claims about the power of vitamins. Dangerous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Stuff - Nothing New","review":"This DVD contains basic info that anyone who is interested in nutrition already knows. Pretty boring in it's presentation. We all know about the corruption in the food and drug industry and most people know that eating processed food is bad for them but continue to eat what they want until they reach a health crisis. This DVD did not inspire me in any way. Maybe it was because I already knew everything they talked about. This information is available for free on many websites so save your money and do a little research yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unethical","review":"Foodmatters is so irresponsible, I would consider this documentary unethical. This documentary is more about alternative medicine than food. It purports the efficacy of numerous alternative medicine methods without supporting material and does so with dark, conspiracy theory overtones. Foodmatters makes the claim that there are simple cures to serious illnesses like cancer and depression but the medical and drug community has been keeping these cures suppressed from the public so they can make more money. Avoid this documentary; especially if you have an illness and are vulnerable to any kind of false hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring","review":"I couldn't even finish this movie it was so boring. Also alot of the guys in it sound like they are full of bunk. One person in the doc said his cousin lost 100 lbs by taking 12 dumps a day and in one day lost 15 lbs.

It goes well with The Beautiful Truth, another great documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rhetoric","review":"This movie is a piece of rhetoric on behalf of vitamin therapy. It proceeds to straw man what it depicts as a failed health and food system while offering a poorly substantiated alternative as a panacea.This is not to say that actual vitamin deficiencies don't exist or that there are not any problems with the current food and medical system: this movie simply exacerbates and completely misconstrues the nature of the problem so that you will be susceptible to naturopathic quackery. Don't fall for it. The film also fails to back up its claims for vegetarianism. Most importantly, the film does not provide any scientific evidence for pervasive vitamin deficiencies in the general population. If that were the case, it should be measurable."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD did not work","review":"Could not get the DVD to work. Will have to send back and get a replacement.

Rather, it turns me off.The purpose must be to preach to the choir. Really, it is so pushy that it is not persuasive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooked Food Bad For You?","review":"This doc. was so biased I could hardly stand to watch it.

Our stomachs are in on the conspiracy!Yes, roasting our produce with chemicals is bad. After that point, it was a lot of highly emotional talk with little to no evidence supporting it. Seriously, \\"reactive leukocytosis\\" due to eating PRECISELY more than 51% cooked foods, are you joking! Sounds like something a tattered old man holding up a \\"the end is near\\" sign would be muttering to himself as he is looking for a park bench to sleep on.

I have a history in research and the research in this film was subpar. I was on their side and they turned me off with their pseudo-experts and their over-the-top opinions. \\"Forks over Knives\\" is a much better resource on this matter.

Also, the presentation is just plain dull -- a lot of talking heads. The people who are interviewed are for the most part self-appointed experts without credentials, and the claims they are making are either vastly oversimplified, stuff that everybody knows, or in the worst cases, very misleading. Do yourself a favor and get some credible nutrition information.

Just take vitamins,\\" and they don't give any proof that vitamins even work... Just some anecdotal evidence here and there instead of any real studies or statistics. They just tell us how few people die from vitamins per year... They also use scare tactics and paint an inaccurate picture of doctors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Food, Inc. instead.","review":"FoodMatters is deficient of science. The interviewees in this film all make broad claims about the superior abilities of high doses of vitamins, raw foods, and vegetarianism, however, the film does not present the hard science behind these claims. If the film had perhaps shown me HOW high doses of vitamin C improve cancer, I might not have given the film 2 stars. I agreed with the basic message of the film -- that we are too reliant upon pills and that nutrition should be the solution rather than an afterthought. Yet the film focuses far more attention on vitamins that real, whole foods.This film feels like poorly directed propaganda rather than a true documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Food Matters should be titled Vitamins Matter","review":"I was very disappointed in this video, in fact I returned it. It is not what it says it is; only about 10% to 20% of the content is about food. This is a pro-vitamin video! Although it features David Wolf and Gerson's daughter, their part is extremely short. At least 80% of Food Matters is about vitamins. There is alot of controversy these days about vitamins; not everyone believes that they help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information!","review":"This type of information is much needed in the US today, most diets are filled with instant/boxed food.

This book doesn't really give you enough spells to actually be a spellbook. The spells are very complicated and need herbs and items that are hard to get your hands on.[...]The art on the other hand is very beautiful and colorful.

I took two a day for a month, and this morning I jumped back on the CT scanner. The stone is still there, completely unchanged. Is it possible that someone with different body chemistry might benefit from this preparation? Yes, it's possible, but for most of you I seriously doubt it.

You could have put 6 episodes on a disc and I would have been willing to pay more. So much for efficiency in Technology. Star Trek is a part of me--I grew up on it and would have loved to get the whole collection. But now I will pick only my very favorites and go see the rest in syndication.

But the action is hotter off the court when Nancy gets tangled in a bizarre case of mistaken identity.Nancy bears a striking resemblance to Teresa Montenegro, the rising young star from San Carlos. Then Teresa's boyfriend is kidnapped, and Teresa may be next! In a last, desperate move to outwit the hired guns, Nancy and Teresa trade places. Nancy strides onto center court to play a deadly game of doubles-while a ruthless killer stalks her from the stands. I gave this book 2 stars because this book is entertaining, but gets you hopelessly confused without a solid plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor: This Album is NOT as Advertised","review":"Please beware: although the Amazon site lists 20 songs on this album, in fact it only contains songs 13-20. I discovered this when I received the album and opened it. I immediately noticed the disk itself said Vol. II. So I started looking for Vol. I, which was nowhere to be found. Finally, I discovered some tiny, tiny print on the back on the album that said something to the effect that, due to \\"time limitations\\" only Vol. II could be included on this CD. Wow! I am sure Amazon did not intentionally mislead its customers, but you will be sorely disappointed if you are expecting to receive an album with 20 songs on it. If this had been Vol. I, I would have kept it; but the songs I really wanted were the first 12, so I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Listening","review":"I had this album years ago on tape and somehow I lost it (or loaned it).

It was a wonderful treat for me and further increased my appreciation for her beautiful voice. The selections have a Country & Western flavor, with light accompanyment that allows her voice to remain the focal point. I was especially touched by 35 More Miles and They Didn't Listen. However, my favorite selection is Someone Who, which captured me the first time around and continues to do so. Repeated listening does not diminish my attraction to these selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was country music","review":"I love her Oneida songs but not a fan of country music.

Everyone should read this book, even if you never plan to adopt children. As a matter of fact, I highly suggest that anyone that has children, works with them, and or is around them read this book, including Parents, Teachers, Doctors, Psychologist, Sociologist, Police Officers, Adoption Agencies, and Government officials. It will really open your eyes. While reading \\"More Than Love...\\", I was filled with every emotion possible, sadness, anger, and yes even happiness. I could not help crying, laughing, smiling, and empathizing with Dr. and Mr. Stone. I take my hat off to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a great book","review":"I am buying this book after lending out my original copy to new dog owners so many times that I finally lost it. This is a very clear, concise dog training book. It's one of the best you can get, especially if you don't have the patience to read an entire long book. I love Carol Lea Benjamin's other training books also (How to Survive Your Dog's Adolescence is amazing), but this one is great, too, and a little more of a quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution! Some dangerous advice.","review":"This book contains some good basic information for the person who is completely clueless about dogs. It is also cheap, which is nice. However, Benjamin gives some advice that can be downright dangerous, particularly with adopted dogs whose degree of socialization one is not yet sure of when she declares that a hug is a great reward for good behavior. This may be true for humans, but for in the dog world, it is an agressive move and can be misinterpreted with disasterous consequences. There are some generalizations about dogs that can be enlightening, but if you're looking for specific information about how to train your shelter dog, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Book","review":"This book is dangerous and filled very bad, dangerous advice. It was written in 1998, so giving the benefit of the doubt, perhaps our thinking about homing a rescue dog has evolved, but this book is extremely outdated. It recommends using the dog's crate as a place for punishment -which we all know is wrong. It further recommends \\"pops\\" with the leash to jerk your dog into obedience and \\"staring down\\" a dog into submission -again, outdated, inappropriate concepts. It is a very high level, superficial, quick read riddled with inappropriate advice that certainly does not speak to how one goes about brining a new, most likely scared, rescue dog into your home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"I'm sorry, I was really disappointed with this book, disappointed enough to write my first amazon.com review. The intention is great and as an owner of 3 rescue dogs I support the movement entirely. However, I felt the book was a fast overview of dog ownership, touching on training, care and personal stories, but none of those areas were handled in enough detail. I think this is particularly dangerous with the training section, which seems out-dated and emphasized correcting the dog more so than creating a scenario where the dog will succeed.This is a great topic and an easy read, but I personally wish that the author would have done a detailed compilation of rescue stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Hand Dog","review":"I read this book before adopting my first Weimaraner; 4 years later I volunteer as a foster for Weimaraner Rescue and I've re-read it several times. After reading many other training books over the years, I've found Carol Lea Benjamin's dog-training books to be the best in their class.Our rescue gives Second Hand Dog to each new adopter. I also highly recommend Dog Training in 10 Minutes. Both books provide invaluable information--in an entertaining and informative format--as an easy to read, easy to implement way to acclimate & train a new dog in the household.All of Ms. Benjamin's books give newbie & experienced dog owners insight to canine behavior as well as provide the vehicle to make your dog \\"the dog you've always wanted.\\" She emphasizes consistency and humane training that's enjoyable to both owner & dog.Carol Lea Benjamin's dog-training books should be a must-read for every new dog owner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money","review":"I was recommended this book as I adopted a dog. I've had dogs, but never an adult rescue dog. I thought it would give me advice on dealing with issues specific to an adult rescue dog, solutions to problems I may encounter, what to expect, etc. What I got was a sappy \\"be patient and love your dog\\" summary. Any advice in the book was extremely basic and common sense, especially if you've owned any dog before. Yes, we need to understand and train our second hand dog, but this book provides NONE of the \\"how\\". I thought it was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Hand Dog - Too Little for Too Much","review":"I read \\"Dogs For Dummies\\" and they recommended this book but after reading it I found it to be lacking in much useful information.

Thankfully though, Amazon at least came through & refunded my money on this bag.

Though sometimes uneven, I gave the album 5 stars because there are some truly sweet cuts on here, and because it is such a classic compilation. Not only do you get great songs by great bands like Diggin' a Hole by Bim Skala Bim, and the Skatalites' Phoenix city by Les Miserables, but you get some special treats as well. Good early versions of some of the old Bosstones' tunes and a cool song by the Toasters under their earlier name (Not Bob Marley). Other cool groups on here include Let's Go Bowling, Gangster Fun, and the more obscure Bop (Harvey) with Bread and Circuses. Sure, some of the songs are a bit cheesy, but the energy and excitement of these young bands on the verge of a new scene is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"What New York Looked Like in the Eighties","review":"The \\"Inside-Outside Book of New York City\\" features interior and exterior views of some of New York's famous landmarks.

I was a roadie for five years and I saw some of the same things like they're described in this book. The sex and drugs are rampant. The strange people are always there, crowding around the players, wanting attention, wanting to be a part of the scene. E.Layne Kelly caught that atmosphere. She nailed it. If you're into music, you'll dig this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Rockers","review":"Rolling Stone magazine has tried to warn us for years that people like this really exist, but maybe I didn't believe them. This book delivers a jolt of reality that is stunning. My friends and I listen to rock music every day and often hear about the outrageous behavior of rockers, but reading about Peter Woody's life is an experience all its own. The plot is like a psychedelic trip filled with self-inflicted pain, but also suffused with glimpses of love and in the end, self-redemption. The rawness of the language backed by the quirky, brash, unapologetic writing style is reflective of the subject matter--power rockers unbalanced on the edge of total craziness. This totally rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"In less that one year, we get a second amazing book by Hatsumi Sensei.

It does exactly what it's supposed to, which is keep perfectly accurate time via radio sync with atomic clocks near Denver, Colorado. Keep in mind that the further you are from Denver the harder it is to get good radio reception. My watch syncs fine in Kansas City, MO. It was able to sync about once a week when I lived in Washington, DC. It's very cheap looking and basic. It has no backlight, stopwatch, or alarm. The watch casing is plastic and the band in steel painted black. After a while the paint on my band came off in few areas, which doesn't look nice. It is also relatively power hungry for a watch. You will have to replace the batter about every two years."},{"rating":"2","title":"for those who loved the Sox of '77","review":"Even without making the play-offs the 1977 White Sox will always hold a special place in my heart. If you feel the same way, or are just interested in baseball history - you will appreciate this book. Richie Zisk, Oscar Gamble, Wilbur Wood, etc...and those crazy-awful uniforms - a fun season to be sure. This book brings back many memories and any baseball fan has to appreciate that someone (Dan Helpingstine) would see how special it was. Great photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Photos - Shame About The Writing","review":"As a photo-filled scrapbook of an unexpectedly magical season, SOUTH SIDE HITMEN will definitely jog some happy memories for Sox fans who were there in '77. Unfortunately, Helpingstine's writing is clumsy, repetitive and not particularly insightful, and his interviews with former players Steve Stone, Oscar Gamble and Goose Gossage seem to have produced little of value -- which is odd, since those guys were some of the most interesting and opinionated players from that era. Also, this book really needed an editor; not only is the same picture of Bill Veeck and Bob Lemon run twice, but misspellings abound. Was Reggie Jackson really a \\"Marquis player\\"? Was Jim Essian really traded to the A's for Pablo \\"Rorrealba\\"? Also, that \\"Red Sox player\\" posing with Reggie Jackson and Richie Zisk at the '77 All Star game is quite obviously Carl Yastrzemski..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Worse","review":"If I had realized this was published by the creationist Discovery Institute, I would have saved my money. Not as bad as I feared when I noticed that. Most of the arguments and claims on both sides are repetitive. Except for a few mistakes, Kurzweil's arguments much better than the \\"Critics\\" arguments. The most glaring mistake, pointed out by Searle, was his mistating/misunderstanding of the Church-Turing Thesis; it took me two minutes with my encyclopedia of mathematics to check out, but Kurzweil just repeated his mistaken claim in his rebuttal. Most of Searle's argument was pretty silly, so maybe Kurzweil never considered part of it might be right.If you have read Age of Spiritual Machines, this is a waste of time.If you haven't read it, it is a better source than this book. The better arguments of the critics were mostly already covered in that book.

It spoils the original feel of the series. If this is the same for the other OST DVDs then I will not be buying any more of them.The picture quality is generally excellent, the only noticeable problems being the age of the original prints. Nevertheless the transfer is excellent and the sound is excellent.What can I say about the episodes on the DVD? \\"Mudd's Women\\" is a very light, simplistic story which does little for the series. Its watchable but is not particularly good.\\"The Enemy Within\\", on the other hand, is an excellent variation on the Jekyll and Hyde story as a transporter problem splits Kirk in two, unleashing a savage double on the ship. Until the problem of re-combining Kirk is solved a landing party is stranded on a planet as its extremely cold night closes in. A very good episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy purchase","review":"Both are very much entertaining but you must stretch some credibility for one of these stories.If you can discount certain omissions and science screw-ups, then \\"Enemy Within\\" becomes a classic. Sorry, shuttlecrafts existed in season 1 so lack of any reference here is suspicious. And at that extrme temperature, no phaser is going to work let alone a human live.\\"Mudd's Women\\" is the better of the two in terms of plot and concepts since it's possible that a temporarily age-reducing drug could be made whereas you can't circumvent physics and shuttles. Mudd is a wonderful character, devious to the extreme. This alone makes it worthwhile but there are plenty of good elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"review based on content, NOT FORMAT","review":"Mudd's women is probably one of the best episodes from the original series. Harry Mudd is the typical slimy salesman we all expected in that era.Enemy Within is a little more hokey than most Episodes, and it is boring (to me) to watch it more than once a year, but it is a good plot (with now expected poor acting). The dog is cool though, as is the very frozen Sulu *one of the best one-liners in the series, \\"I don't suppose you could lower a line with a pot of coffee\\"*.

The songwriting is superb, the musicians seem very in to what they are playing. Definitely has a polished sound to it, unlike many other indie groups.

The sushi@home maki roller cost any where from $49.99 up to $90 but it should cost no more than $30. Since the sushi fab, you can't hardly find them at stores but give it a year or 2 and most people will be getting rid them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Charms","review":"I was exploring Amazon for Disney charms with my daughter and she loved how these looked.I almost didn't buy them because I saw a negative review about smell.I was intrigued by that bad review so as soon as they arrived I sniffed them and they smelled fine to me. My wife who's 3 months pregnant couldn't find anything out of the ordinary either. Believe me she is sensitive to smells.My only problem is that I bought just one set and my 9 year old and 6 year are fighting over the charms.They have a cord on the end and my Daughters have hung them on there zippers, lunch pail. Zippers and Backpacks.So they aren't just for cellphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney Fairies Tinker Bell and Friends","review":"The charms are very cute, but smell like skunk.

So if you want very cute charms, and can get passed the smell, order these.....if you have a good nose, stay clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected pleasure","review":"I got this cd a few months ago as an impulse buy. I'm very pleased with it. My favorite tracks are Break the Silence, Mindgame Masquerade, The Sacrafice, and Forever Endeavour. I like most of the tracks though. The vocals are good. If you like no frills, non-fluffy power metal this is a good buy. I give it a four stars because 5 stars is reserved for perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries not replaceable","review":"I have a WS 2010 weather station that the coin batteries in the instruments have died after three years service. The same thing was reported by Gary Woltkamp. When purchising a weather station you want to make sure the batteries are a replaceable item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Twice Before You Order","review":"I ordered this unit 2 years ago. Now the wind speed unit no longer works because the battery is bad. Called the service unit at La Crosse about getting a new battery, they said to order a new wind speed indicator at $100, as no replacement battery was available. If you have a bad battery in your 2 year old Lexus would you junk it and get a new car! Of course not, you would replace the bad battery and drive it for another 10 years. Order from La Crosse only if you expect the unit to last 2 years and no help from their service dept. Typical of items made in China, no service aviable, if it goes bad buy a new one and help the Chinese economy and to hell with the U.S.A. and their people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Nature Book","review":"This book was unfortunately listed under Nature Literature.

If you believe in living in nature with respect for and knowledge of all the living things, then this book will make you sick. I live in a forest and if anyone let their dogs out like she does to harass and kill the native animals, they would be arrested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"Not for everyone, but those that understand will want to say to Ms. Blackmarr, \\"Thank you and good job.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Poirot","review":"Discovering an Agatha Christie mystery you've never read is like discovering gold. And Dead Man's Folly is Hercule Poirot at his best. Even near the end of the book, you wonder if he is actually going to be able to solve this one.Good friend and mystery writer, Ariadne Oliver, unexpectedly calls Poirot and imperiously demands the little detectives' presence at a village fete in Devon, where a Mystery Hunt is about to take place. She worries that it won't just be a fake murder. Intrigued, our hero immediately takes the train to the village of Nassecombe to try to put a stop to whatever is afoot. Mrs. Oliver turns out to be correct in her assumptions and Hercule is terribly perturbed that he wasn't able to prevent it. As usual there are lots of red herrings and a totally convoluted solution. An excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"great plot","review":"Although I wouldn't recommend this for an introduction to Agatha Christie (try Ten Little Indians, Murder in Mesopotamia, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd) I think that the twist at the end is one of her most believable. As Poirot says, everything clicks into place. I agree with another reviewer that the beginning isn't that great, Mrs. Oliver saying she suspects something, but I think it DOES work for the book's atmosphere of something faintly wrong about Nasse House. I love the ending. It's so much more centered around the characters and the character of Mrs. Folliat is very touching. The comic relief also works: Mrs. Oliver, the \\"bloodhound-like\\" Mrs. Masterton and her husbands' horsy agent Captain Warbuton are nice touches, as are the hapless girls from the hostel and the foreigner-hating Constable Hoskins."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst one from Christie's I've read.","review":"This is easily the worst mystery I've read from Dame Agatha. It's drab in comparison to her other works, and the big set-up ends in a big let-down. It's simply forgettable and pedestrian.If you skip it, you won't miss anything.Suggestions: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Death On the Nile, Murder On the Orient Express, Peril At End House, and the non-Poirot one, And Then There Were None."},{"rating":"2","title":"A playful and well-done mystery","review":"I found this to be an enjoyable and playful mystery. Agatha introduces an old woman who is a mystery novelist, who is somewhat like herself. Face-to-face with Poirot, they get enmeshed in a sinister plot. The story was well-done and Agatha's writing style is immaculate. There is as much literature in here as there is mystery. A good development of characters, a study of the society around, and a description of the setting that makes me feel I live there. As for who did it? I remained perplexed until the very last chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home Where I Belong","review":"\\"Home Where I Belong\\" I think this was the first Christian albumn by B J Thomas I ever bought. I played it so much I wore out the copy, so after years of listining scratches on the record, I ordered a used copy and recored the songs on a cassette.I would recommend it to fans of B J Thomas christian music. His country junk just sounds like all country does to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but...","review":"I've bought this product at Marshall's for $30.00 (!!!!). The idea is nice: it uses GPS system to record distance, pace, altitude and calories burned. The instruction states it may take up to 90 seconds to get GPS signal outdoors; while it worked nicely around my rural Pennsylvania house, it flatly refused to register anything for about 3-5 minutes in Brooklyn, NY. Unfortunately it doesn't allow you to do automatic 1-mile split time. It is difficult to put on the arm. The real problem is: after I changed the battery it stopped working properly and I can no longer use it! I guess I got $30.00 worth of use, but paying over $100... I don't think so! I was also not able to register the product for warranty over the internet, because it asks for Registration Number that doesn't exist; to register it by mail you have to send a card to United Kingdom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"Cleaning it every time after #2 is just getting old.

It's beautiful and it's a TOTO so I thought it would be great, but I have to clean it with a toilet brush after every solid waste. It has a teeny-tiny water spot and most of the waste doesn't make it into the water, so it leaves behind major streaking that must be cleaned off each and every time.

There is a difference in toilets and Toto Aquia III is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me do things","review":"Somehow, the accoustic side of Robyn always inspires me to do chores. Not just simple chores, mind you, but BIG household chores. And not my house, but a friend's house. As a matter of fact, the first time I listened to this album, I was at the home of my future wife, sanding down the walls to be painted. The music inspired a sort of zen-like motivation to do things in a slightly different way. It sealed my fate, as I ended up marrying the girl. It'll seal yours as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Songs from a great Singer Song writer","review":"Just re listened to this album, and I still love most of the songs on it.The sound is bare acoustic and piano and voice and it suits Robyn's talents well. I saw him play this album live at Einstein's in Jax Beach, FL when it came out in 1990, and he was amazing. There are stand out moments on every song, with my favorites being, Satelite, Cynthia Mask, Beutiful Girl, Lincus House. Very Syd Barrett."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw but polished","review":"This is THE Hitchcock/Softboys CD for fans of Nick Drake &/or Syd Barrett. Accoustic, intimate and direct. My other favorites include Invisible Hits (soft boys) and Fegmania (Hitchcock & the Egyptians). Dark, brooding and invigorating."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favouite Hitchcock CD","review":"As with the other reviewer I would recommend some of Robyn's other albums for those not familiar with his work. However, this is a very good album. There are some extremely beautiful melodies ( Glass Hotel, Linctus House) and some wonderfully dark, yet humourous lyrics. For those who are familliar with Hitchcock's music and are wondering whether to buy this CD. I fully recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention Parents and Teachers","review":"I was so captivated by just the title.

We all learn differently, and whose place is it to judge others ? Bottom line is I have seen too many times, students who will not seek help, due to stigma placed on them by peers, teachers, and family. Maybe we have lost sight of education and its purpose ... isn't getting an education the goal ? Great program for classes who cannot understand we are all not the same, we are individuals, learn differently, etc. The goal I had when purchasing was to show students who are rude and or cruel to other students in hope they will will have no misunderstandings why we all need help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misunderstood Minds","review":"The information about the student's issues was very meaningful, but the video was dry and became boring.

This is, hands down, the worst album Aerosmith has ever made. It has way too many syrupy ballads that this band has been making since 1989 and all the rockers on this album sound recycled and tired.

They also once churned out rock classics like Walk This Way, Living On the Edge, and Dude Looks Like a Lady. Just Push Play, however, makes me want to just press stop.It was obvious after their performance at the Super Bowl that their tale of not being a \\"bubble gum rock band\\" was a theory that they let go by the waste side. After hearing this album, I must question my ever really liking the band. It honestly is not that good and is what I'd expect from a modern day pop band, not Aerosmith!I guess the theme from Armageddon was just a sign of things to come as a once great band turned bad. It's just awful pop music. Makes me wonder who is in charge, Steven Tyler, or Steven Tyler's wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"Awesome, great CD!!!

It's a very rich album, with influences of rap, hip-hop, country and pop mainstream, all with that kind of rock n'roll sound that indentifies Aerosmith. Very good production on the instrumental work... Good guitar solos, great vocals and background vocals-GREAT 2001 ROCK. \\"Beyond Beautiful\\", \\"Sunshine\\", the title track and \\"Fly Away from here\\" are the best tracks on \\"Just Push Play\\".

I love all of the albums, from all of the periods, but when I put this on, my heart sank. Where has the fire gone? Nine Lives was uneven, but at least half of the tracks were superb. This album, however, is unfortunate. The band needs to spend more time playing together, as well as having some more input on songwriting from the other band members. Remember songs like 'Sweet Emotion'? Yeah, Tom Hamilton came up with that. How about 'Voo Doo Medicine Man'? Brad Whitford all the way. Hey, Steven and Joe: leave those new guys at home and look at the resources you have right in front of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"please press stop","review":"If I wasn't sure untill now if it was time for the old rockers to bow down and let the younger generation face the crowds I do now, thanks to \\"Just Push Play\\".After listening to sticky sweet pop melodies such as \\"avant garden\\" or \\"sunshine\\" I feel that Aerosmith have forgotten what music, espacialy rock music is all about.It sounds as if the guys just made the c.d to sell- it's a well edited replica of the recent pop trash that has been comming out lately.

From this one!","review":"Aerosmith has proven they have lost their edge. Everyone saw it coming when they sold out to play the Superbowl with N'Sync and Britney Spears. And just like that Aerosmith sold out. In all honesty, theit last good album was Pump. There are about two decent tracks on Just Push PLay but the overall sound is very hollow. There is just something missing. It could be that musical integrity thing. But there is something missing on this album. Their last few albums have been going south but this one hits rock bottom. Most of the songs all blend in together and you can't tell song from song. Lyrically it's bland as well. With such songs from albums like Toys In The Attic, Pump, and Permanant Vacation, The Album Just Push Play doesn't have one song good enough for a classis Aerosmith album."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIME TO RETIRE....","review":"this is REALLY the album that turns me off from AEROSMITH!!!! as many said, their 70[s stuff is AMAZING, and i like PERMANENT VACATION, PUMP, GET A GRIP and NINE LIVES.....than comes the sappy horrible ballad from the armageddon movie, and i think AEROSMITH TOTALLY SELL THEIR SOUND!!!!! and WHERE IS JOE PERRY?

I borrowed Nine Lives of my friend about a month ago and i liked it but i didnt buy it. Aerosmith have now released Jaded which i think is excellent and i decided to buy the album. The album contains excellent tracks like Jaded, Trip Hoppin, Sunshine and Luv Lies. Im not too sure whether or not to look up their back catalogue, but i know that i like this album and its worth the money that i spent on it.

Don't agree with me? Listen to Boys Of Summer from their latest greatest hits for cryin out loud!I feel sorry for their hardcore fans or for the people that bought this album before even listening atleast the samples that you can find at the music stores.

Again & Again","review":"After coming the underated Nine Lives album (not that it was a great album, but you know who you are), the boys from Boston have returned with probably their best since Pump.

And Joe's words tell you pretty much anything you need to know about this album. If Aerosmith could step into a time machine and go back to the time immediately preceding their recording of this turkey and cancel the sessions, they'd be a better band and the world of music would be better for it.Good luck with the new album, Joe. At least you can see where you jumped the shark."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Style, Little Substance","review":"What if an aging rock band had an embarrasing post-mid-life crises, and the whole world got to experience it on CD? Turns out many wouldn't buy it. And that's why Aerosmith's last two albums have conjured up disappointing sales figures. Age should never be an issue in music, and artists like Bob Dylan, Neil Young & Tom Petty prove you can still rock with the best of them years after you first make it big. But the key is to not be ashamed of aging, and give up the hope of looking like you're twenty when you're well past 50. Steven Tyler can't do that, and while the band may still be able to produce a hit song here and there, they're slowly becoming the oldest joke in rock'n'roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't push play NO MORE!!!!!!!!!","review":"Just Push play is the sad final of one of the decadent bands of the american commercial circuit.

If you want to hear rock, waste your money in a Rock band...Stones, Stooges, ....In Just Push Play, Aerosmith now experimented adult oriented music like REO o Chicago, and sounds really bad!!!!.

The rest of the albums are below average teeniepoper stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Different","review":"There is not one song on this album that starts off with a straight ahead rock and roll beat. Every song has that techno/industrial rubbish beginning (excluding the power ballads). Not one song grabs you like \\"9 Lives,\\" or \\"Monkey On My Back,\\" or \\"Fever,\\" etc. Why try and be so fancy? Why try to be so unlike their other albums. Why pull a U2?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars is more like it.","review":"What was one of the best American hard rock bands of the seventies has become PURE BUBBLEGUM. As far as I'm concerned, this is Britney Spears, this is Backstreet boys, and yes folks, this is 50 Cent. Aerosmith actually treats us to a rap song on this album. A rap song. From \\"Sweet Emotion\\" and \\"Dream On,\\" and many more legendary songs from when I was a kid to just another Bubblegum band with videos stuck in between Beyonce and (GASP) Eminem."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nice Coaster","review":"The fact that these artifacts are still selling records completely baffles me and leads me to believe that music is at its nadir.

Hell, I'm not even really a fan of anything they've done since they burned out in the late 70's, but I remain a curious observer. They were really rolling in success in the late eighties and the first half of the nineties, but now they are clearly hanging on to mainstream approval by a thread. And reproducing (or trying to reproduce) \\"Pump\\" every four years is definitely not helping...nor is chasing the next big musical trend. Hey Aerosmith, try being yourselves, dropping the hired songwriters, or maybe it's time to just focus on your still razor-sharp live performances. Your latest albums have sounded tired and embarrasing though, mostly due to your desparate need to rule the charts every few years, and perhaps because you've already covered just about all the musical territory you could hope to in your career as a single unit. Give it rest, or focus on your strenghts. All records like this do is cloud up your live act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't STAND THIS","review":"I hate his voice, I hate the melodies, I hate the hype.. ya know, for a group that's been around for so long, you'd think they'd have picked up something along the way, but WHAT IS THIS? Everything from the album cover to the vocals... disgusting. Jeese, you want real music, go try Children of Bodom, at least it has a soul, rather than this geriatric pop-rock album. It's meaningless lyrically and musically there are much better guitarists (Yngwie Malmsteen?). But of course, you are probably 35 years old and listened to this tripe as a kid, and have since long fallen out of the hard rock scene. Fine, I guess you can put this next to your \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" and \\"Garage Inc.\\" albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than their last album!","review":"Since Nine Lives was such a dissapointment it is refreshing to hear Aerosmith sound like a new band. From the opening three tracks, we know that Tyler and Perry are up to their old magic. Standouts are the tile track, Sunshine, and Avant Garden. Always hating their ballads, Cryin, Amazing and the disgusting I don't want to miss a thing, it is nice to hear them rock again. I actually don't mind all the techno influences hear. ti gives them a fresh sound which they desperately needed. Taste of India was the only respectable track off of their last album and there are quite a few here that sound great and show their talent. Not quite a throwback to ROCKS or Toys In The Attic, but this album kicks and I will love to hear it in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Push Play","review":"Easily the worst Aerosmith album ever recorded. Apart from the albums opener Beyond Beautiful the rest of the album is god awful. Ok perhaps Jaded and Light Inside are tolerable, barley, but Aerosmith is not about average music. The rest of the album is so below average, comically bad, overproduced and way too poppy that Aerosmith should be ashamed of ever releasing it. It is just as forgettable as all the other pop music released that JPP was competing with when it was released.

The only track I can bare to listen to is the title track, and that doesn't even sound like aerosmith. Sorry guys, looks like the good music got left behind in the early nineties and got replaced by this noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a huge Aerosmith fan,I 'm very dissapointed in this album","review":"I own every Aerosmith album in their discograhy and I must say this is their worst album since... well its their worst album period. \\"Just Push Play\\" just lacks balls. Its is full of half fast radio friendly songs that will soon be forgotten. Nothing on this album really rocks. (Beyond Beautiful is an exception but this track is wimpy compared to some of the classics).Don't get me wrong, I'm not against radio hits, most of Aerosmiths previous hits are still classics you can enjoy years later. Unfortunatly after a few plays \\"Just Push Play\\" will just gather dust.Instead, spend your money on \\"Rocks\\" or \\"Toys in The Attic\\" or ANY other album in Aerosmith's back catalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashamed...","review":"Steven and the boys must be ashamed when they look back at this CD having their names on it. Just Pure Pop would be a more fitting title for this, totally devoid of anything even close to rock, release. This CD is by far the worst CD ever put out by the original 5 members of Aerosmith. We can only hope that if they ever do another original CD (not covers and greatest hits like they have been spiting out for the last several years) that it the band will leave the pop behind and return to rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerosmith - 'Just Push Play' (Sony)","review":"Review no.275.Have to admit that 'Just Push Play' puts my faith back into Aerosmith.Please note that vocalist Steven Tyler and guitarist Joe Perry had apparently taken control of producing this CD,with some assistance.Never felt this disc was another sell out,like others I've spoken with do.Liked it SO much better than their 'Pump' and 'Get A Grip' efforts.Cuts that more than did it for me were \\"Jaded\\",title track \\"Just Push Play\\",\\"Sunshine\\" and \\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\".A great return to old school style Aerosmith.A should-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The same old style","review":"If you are asking yourself if it is the same Aerosmith or wondering if the disease that caught bands like Guns N Roses and Metallica (which made them change their styles)caught Aerosmith... the answer is no! \\"Just push Play\\" brings the old good Aerosmith we all know. Songs like Jaded, Fly Away from Here and the excellent Sunshine tell it all. They are exploring more the \\"Walk on Water\\" (from \\"Big Ones\\")formula on this record, but you will find Janie's got a Gun and What it Takes cousins here. It's not a five star album like \\"Pump\\"... but it is as good as \\"Get a Grip\\" and \\"Nine Lives\\".If you like Aerosmith, even if you are not a fan, don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always....","review":"If you are looking for something on the lines of \\"pump\\" or \\"get a grip\\" then you won't jump when you hear this.

It has all the aerosmithian touch to it all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Still Rockin..............","review":"I have played this cd out already. I love \\"Trip Hoppin\\" and \\"Just Push Play.\\" These guys are still rocking............ I can remember being being 8 yrs old and listening to Toys in the Attic with my older brothers. It became a favorite of mine then and still is. I can't wait to hear them play this new music in concert. Keep rockin guys.........and I'll be waiting for the next cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Back.....","review":"I found this Aerosmith album great to listen to. This album (in my opinion) has some touches of the 70's Aerosmith but for the most part as the touches of their 80's - 90's formulation. Some of the stand out tracks include \\"Jaded\\", Avante Garden\\" \\"Luv Lies\\" \\" and ...Away from Here\\". It is quite impressive that Aerosmith has remained together for as many years as they have and as long as they continue pumping music like this, I will certainly be listening and buying the music. It certainly is worth the time and the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Comeback!","review":"After the disappointment of Get a Grip and Nine Lives, I'd like to thank whoever gave the boys their nuts back.

How could \\"America's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band\\" sell out and go pop? This is really sad. The music is poor and unoriginal.In addition, it's not just me who believes this CD is no good. I tried to take it to a local used CD store and recoop something from my loss. The guy at the shop wouldn't even take it off my hands. He said, \\"Sorry, it's not worth anything.\\"So Aerosmith pushed this trash on the music world. But now, at least there's one more copy of this CD sitting where it belongs.

I'm giving up on them, because they did the same. Aerosmith is dead.Maybe they're happier being clean and sober. Maybe Steven Tyler has decided that it's time to be a mellow, go-along-to-get-along Top 40, tweeny-pop kind of guy. Maybe they need walkers.Whatever it is, this ain't Aerosmith. Noting ballsy, rude, or raw in this collection of corporate sludge. Avoid it like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good. My compliments to the chef!","review":"Each song has it's own identity and is spectacular. The album gels well together, even though some older Aero fans may not enjoy the tech side, especially the rap-rock \\"Out of Your Head.\\" Steven Tyler must have really reached into his inner Kid Rock for that one! I enjoyed it all, but don't expect it to sound like any past Aero album. It's an eclectic batch of funk, rock, hip hop, and soul. The production side of the album is great too! Wow, this disc makes my speakers come to life! It's VERY well mixed!And I need to tell \\"A music fan from Roseville, MN USA\\" that the \\"out-of-print Autograph album from the mid-80's, 'That's the Stuff'\\" will be reisued on April 24, 2001.

Unfortunately there were only two songs that really stand out (in a good way) to me.Jaded is a great song. The title track is also an outstanding rocker that really gets you ready to enjoy this album. Unfortunately the good ends there.Ok, I understand that the RUN DMC Aerosmith collaboration on Walk the Way in 1986 set the stage for the rap-rock of today, but that is no excuse for Outta My Head. A horrid rap-rock hybrid that is one of the few Aerosmith songs that I actually skip when listening to any of their albums.If you are an Aerosmith completist, you'll want this. If you like pop music only, you might enjoy this one. If you are looking for a great Aerosmith album, you will not find it with Just Push Play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"I would just like to say that Areosmith pulls off another GREAT album.

They are no longer relevant artists. At least they stayed fresh longer than their peers (especially the rolling stones, who became a joke before the eighties began.) The saddest thing is that they recognise this, and you can hear their desparation in this record. They are way old, but they attempt to connect with a young generation of fans that want nothing to do with them. I wish they would have aged gracefully like bob dylan or neil young, but they were always too pop for that.If they really want to matter today, Aerosmith should jump on the garage-rock bandwagon. They could follow madonna's lead and keep changing with the times. They attempt to do that by throwing in a pinch of contemporary influence, but it isn't enough. They just aren't hip or bold enough to make important changes.Avoid this record, but get yourself one an old Aerosmith record you haven't picked up yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Call These Lyrics?","review":"Sorry folks, this one just doesn't cut it. It sounded o.k. on the first few listens, but after that it becomes apparant just how thin this album is, especially when compared to newer efforts such as \\"Pump\\" or \\"Nine Lives.\\" Why do so many of the songs sound forced, almost like the band is trying too hard? Musically, the album is not bad considering the other junk out there today, but lyrically, it's horrible. With the exception of \\"Jaded\\" and one or two other tunes on the album, the lyrics are totally lacking in substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"good album","review":"I listen to it again and again.

In my opinion the top four songs on the album are Just Push Play, Jaded, Fly Away From Here, and Under My Skin. Overall, I like 10 out of the 12 songs, which makes it well worth the five dollars that I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Aerosmith Album","review":"Save you money and see them live - go get a soda when they perform the drecht from this disc. Bad bad BAD! They've needed colaborators in the last few years, but now they've out done themselves in badness - it's like they're trying to keep one imagage while appealing to another. In the mid 70's the band didn't go disco, so why are they leaning towards techno-pop. You like Rock n' Roll? This isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerosmith rocks and I'm proud their from Boston...","review":"Think of any other hard rock band that are still active in their 50's (stones,purple,floyd,tull,who,van halen,sabbath,etc.) Are any of them any more than a shadow of their former selves?

From the first cut off the album (Beyond Beautiful) through the last track (Avant Garden), the band has put together a great, albeit unique album this time around. There are plenty of rockers, and ballads for everyone here. Guitars are loud and proud, and all I have to say is let the music do the talking! If you want relief from all this nonsense pop, then pick up this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Play","review":"Aerosmith has certainly evolved quite a bit when they first came on the scene in the early seventies. The early Aerosmith was noted for ear grabbing guitar riffs, raunchy vocals, and a loud sound. Where the raunchiness is certainly front and center, the guitar playing is buried too much beneath the supporting string arrangement. Gosh let Joe and Barry crank up their amps and play. None the less, the songs for the most part are very catchy. Beyond Beautiful, Outta Your Head, and Fly Away From Here have some very catchy hooks. And I love the scratching effect on the title track and the atmosphere on Drop Dead Goregous. Aerosmith shows the willingness to continue to experiment. This has made them a great success in the changing popular music world. Therefore, Just Push Play and Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read a mystery ,find a clue!","review":"this Adams'Wood mystery has a wonderful Mouse named holmes and his sidekick Watson Mouse and if you look closely the clues are in the wonderfully illustrated pictures, Find a clue and love the wonderful animals ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment!","review":"Ok, I have to agree with some of the other people who read this book: it was a disappoint. I was really looking forward to Francesca's story because in the other books, she did seem witty, funny, and mischievous. As one woman said, I too did not see any of those qualities in this \\"Francesca\\". Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Julia Quinn, she is one of my all time favorite writers. I literally run to the nearest book store whenever one of her books is released, however, this was one time I actually considered going back to the bookstore so that I could return this book and get my money back. To be honest, I didn't even finish reading this book because both Francesca and Michael got on my nerves, I just couldn't enjoy thier story. Take my advice ladies: read the other books in this series, especially Benedict's story (simply the best book i have ever read!) and skip \\"When He Was Wicked\\". i doubt you would miss much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael's Character Will Suck You In!","review":"I was hooked on this book after reading the first few pages! I loved the characters and immediately wanted to learn more about Michael, his cousin, John and John's wife, Francesca. Quinn took on a very challenging way to ultimately bring Francesca and Michael together, but she did it fantastically! WHEN HE WAS WICKED was a very somber tale that brought out an assortment of emotions in the characters and the reader as well.I recommend this whether you read the Bridgerton series or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Words!","review":"This book is a must read for any Julia Quinn or Bridgerton Family fan. It is by far my favorite of the entire Bridgerton series. Though the story isn't as heavily laced with the humor that is so characteristic of the Bridgerton books, it managed to hook me anyway. This installment calls more to the reader's emotions than sense of humor. The main reason behind my love of this book was the hero. I was totally and completely in love with him throughout the entire novel.I must admit that when I first got the book I was not expecting to be impressed. I did not enjoy the previous two Bridgerton novels (Romancing Mister Bridgerton and To Sir Phillip With Love) as much as I had the early ones.

The other books of the series were filled with light, love and laughter. This book is just depressing. It might have been good except for one detail. Like \\"An Offer from a Gentleman,\\" readers had no idea who the main character was. Francesca has always jsut been a sidenote, and Eloise's sidekick. When Quinn decided to give her her own novel, she should have given us a Bridgerton we actually wanted to care about. At least she gave Benedict depth and an interesting view on his life. The only noticeable thing about Francesca is her quietness. The book was bland boring and frankly a waste of any true Bridgerton fans time. I hope Hyacinth's book will be better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Crap!","review":"Oh my....... I usually read all of Julia Quinn's book, especially this series. This book is BORING!!

Usually it takes me only 1 day to finish a book. I would tell you to not waste your money like I did. I think well known authors are sometimes in a rush to just get a book publish that they don't write good books. They think there name alone will sell the book.

Read this if you must to continue the Bridgerton saga, but otherwise, find another author or reread one of her earlier books. BTW, I gave it one star because \\"no stars\\" was not an option.

She kept repeating herself over and over. The author SAID there was chemistry between the two main characters, but I never felt it.

Her dialog was witty; her characters (while certainly not believeable) were entertaining; her grammar and syntax were correct.This book, however, seems like it was tossed off with about as much care as a 9th grader gives to an unwelcome English composition. The dialog is leaden, the character development stale, the story trite.Julia, it's probably time to re-assess your commitments and re-focus on your writing. Otherwise, you're going to fall into producing the same drab drivel as 95% of all other romance writers. You're too good for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"Actually I haven't read this book. I quit reading Quinn after the Benedict book because they were becoming BORING! Well, I did read the Colin and Eloise (I think it was her!) stories but found them incredibly tedious.I loved Quinns earlier books - How to Marry a Marquis, and even the Daphne Bridgerton story. But after Daphne things really went downhill.Julia Quinn needs to bid adieu to the Bridgertons and find some characters we care about. The Bridgertons as a whole were entertaining. As single entities they're rather pale and have not much depth, which in turn makes for a very boring read.I've glanced at this book a couple times in the store, in fact read a few pages and put it down again. I'm saving my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I hate to say this about one of my favorite authors, but I found this book so boring that I really had to force myself to finish it.

Sounds great, but if there isn't some substance to back it up it falls apart, right? That's what happened to this book. It fell apart. Michael falls in love with Fran at first sight. But why? She was boring! She had no zest for life, no quick wit--she was just kinda there. I was left with no idea what Michael fell in love with besides Fran's blue eyes!The first half of the book was tragic and the last half was flat. It was very predictable with no twists or turns to the plot that could have made it memorable.I'm really glad that this was not a hardcover release because I would have bought it and been out $25 instead of $8.I really hope that Quinn's mix of humour and sensuality are back in her next novel.

Where the previous books are more lighthearted and funny, the emotion here runs deep, with plenty of scenes for tears and heartache.

(sigh)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort","review":"This story was a too different from the other Bridgerton novels for my liking. It was hard to believe that Francesca even was a Bridgerton. The story started off well, but it stalled and lost my interest when the story just didn't progress. Lacking a story, Quinn was forced to turn the last third of the book into one sex scene after another. I also felt there were too many loose ends at the end of the book that were not tidied up. All in all, I thought both the hero and the heroine did not measure up. More interaction with the rest of the Bridgerton clan would have helped the tired plot and lack of spirited diaglogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lighten up Julia Quinn!","review":"A lot of previous reviewers have noted that this book seems almost as if it was written by someone else. I agree. If someone handed me this book with no cover to it, I would think Lisa Kleypas wrote it. The characters were moody and the whole tone of the book was darker than her usual light & witty stories. I hope in her next book she writes like her old self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Memorable","review":"I bought this book because I really enjoyed Julia Quinn's previous works. More importantly, I was very intrigued by the storyline of a hero battling not only physical illness, but harboring guilty feelings concerning his love for his cousin's wife. The hero is gorgeous and well developed. Unfortunately, the heroine was underdeveloped and boring. I really tried, but I could not garner any interest or sympathy for Francesca. Her character came off as very flat and this affected the rest of the story. I usually LOVE to keep my books and leaf through them, but I wasn't even interested enough in this one to keep it around. I gave it away as soon as I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"21st Century mind.","review":"Global Frequency is Mission Impossible for the 21st Century. There are 1001 agents on the Frequency, all in contact with each other via satellite link ups through their mobile phones. If a Frequency agent is in NY trying to deactivate a bomb but has no clue how, another agent in, say, Argentina who works in a bomb squad will walk him through the process. They have experts in almost every field and discipline at hand to quell any emergency.This is the second collection of Global Frequency. It collects the last six issues of the series. It is amazing how quickly writer Warren Ellis can set up and pay off the situation and the characters in the limited space each issue affords. There is a different artist every issue and there's no complaint about any of them. The art is well suited to each particular story.This series is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic SF Reader","review":"Detonation Radio takes a slightly different approach.

When ... If they work.","review":"I really do like these clocks when they work. Bought 4 to start for our office. Within a few days the minute hands stopped moving on two clocks (just froze in place) so I ordered 4 more clocks (replace two and wanted two more). Of those new clocks one had a free swinging minute hand out of the box and another had a second hand freeze in place. Sorry guys - you make clocks. It should be simple. They should work at least most of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clock? More like a crock!","review":"I just opened my clock only to find the front rim dented and the back panel cracked in half. Regardless, since it only cost me $30, my wife talked me into putting it up regardless just to see if it worked. We followed the instructions and low and behold, after waiting 5 hours for the clock to set itself, it remains at high noon. I hit the reset button as directed and have decided to wait \\"several days\\" to let it \\"find the Colorado radio signal\\" as recommended on the box, but I presume I will be sending it back regardless. Great job La Crosse - your clock just wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal Service","review":"If you can EVER get through, they just tell you that the battery is bad.

All I care is that now it works just fine and all three clocks keep very accurate time. I am going to buy some more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with La Crosse","review":"This is the 2nd La Crosse clock I have had. BOTH are OFF on the time. There is NO dial to fix or reset the time so you are stuck with whatever shows. The first clock had a problem with the actual hour hand. It NEVER showed on the hour-always between the hours. This clock is OFF 3 minutes. I notified the company and they sent me a list of things to do to re-set the time. This took over 3 days to do-but to no avail-the same problem happened. The company said that if this did not fix the problem-to mail the clock back to them in the original box etc. At this point it was literally cost and time prohibitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crummy Clock, Rotten Experience - Avoid!","review":"I bought this clock to replace a previous La Crosse clock, which I liked very much until it died. This one has a cheaper look and feel. It arrived with one of the two screws that connect the movement having snapped, so that the movement was hanging crooked and the hands did not line up straight at 12:00. I duct taped it back together, only to find that it didn't respond to the radio signal (which was never a problem for the old clock.) It does, however, keep time in manual mode, for which I did not need to spend $35 or the time it took to repair. I hardly ever write reviews, but I hope that this one saves you some trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what My wife wanted","review":"My wife wanted a simple clock for her workshop that she didn't have to reset because of power outages and large enough to be seen from across the room.

The battery compartment is so tight that it's very difficult to insert and remove the batteries -- they don't just snap in as on most electronic equipment that uses such batteries. You need to really force them in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Front Nice, Back is Cheapo","review":"The front of this clock is nice and looks good for the price paid. However, whoever decided to attach the clock to the packaging it comes in with screws was really dumb. The back is a very thin and brittle plastic. Be careful when removing the packaging, I barely pulled on the clock while removing mine and the back shattered. Thankfully it still hangs and no one can see the back but it made me feel the product was very very cheap on the inside. Also the La Crosse technology didn't work (I live in a metro area so I don't think reception was the issue). As a regular clock it works fine and is easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working 2 weeks after warrantee expired","review":"Now it's always off and keeps resetting itself every few hours.

This La Cross clock caught my eye and I was pleased with it when up on the wall. However, it only worked for two weeks. When daylight saving time was changed back to standard time the clock went beserk and would not stop changing the hour. (La Cross Technology WT-3126B)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last","review":"Styling and overall appeal is o.k.Cheap plastic encasing of the clockwork and some wobble of the outside frame gives some hint of the overall quality of this product.The clock sets itself according to the time zone and adjusts to summer and winter time.Would have been good, but the second hand stopped working after 1 year.I suppose that's all you can expect from an electronic product these days.Overall rather disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this clock.","review":"This clock did not work from day one. I could not set it manually and it is always several hours off. Sometimes it is an hour off and then the next day it is 3 or 4 hours off.Don't waste your money on this clock..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally Poor Quality","review":"WHen this clock arrived in the mail, I unboxed it to see that the second hand had fallen off and was just laying there between the clock face and the glass. I shrugged off the defect at first, hoping that the clock would otherwise function well. It didn't.Upon inserting a battery and selecting a time zone, the clock cycled (incorrectly) to 4:00 and stayed there for the next four days. Over the coming week it took several attempts with new batteries and changed timezone settings for it to finally set itself overnight. I've yet to see how it handles a DST change, but I'm less than optimistic.Overall, the product sounds kind of cool, but when you consider how low-hassle it is to just set a clock twice a year, you're way better off just buying a normal analog clock and not having to worry about wrestling with this shoddy product to get it to work as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Hand Stops Moving","review":"This clock does a nice job keeping accurate time, but I have gone through two clocks and both second hands stopped moving. If I pull the batteries and restart in an hour, the second hand works for about a day. One of the reasons I wanted an analog clock was for the second hand movement. La Crosse customer support is horrible...no return calls for any of the three calls that I've placed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foiled by DST","review":"The item itself is handsomely designed and sturdily madeIt forfeits 1 star for its radio controlled setting feature not having been corrected for the revised Daylight Savings Time schedule"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid!","review":"Ordered seven of these for a new public building. 3 failed within a year, one never worked. While they look great, and are precise when working, they eventually just get into a state where they either cannot pick up a signal and just keep spinning the hands forever, or won't set at all. Changing locations doesn't help. These end up being a lot more work than just re-setting the time twice a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I work in a building with 15 of these, and not one will reset itself properly, even if brought outdoors. They just don't communicate with the atomic clock. Some reset to random times. One is still spinning after 2 days.

By typical, I mean that the ingredients and combination of ingredients are well known to me. By unusual, I mean that some of the ingredients are new to me or are combined in ways I was not familiar with. However, none of the recipes are so unusual that I was afraid to try them.So far, I've made about a dozen recipes in this book and have loved them all. My meat-eating husband didn't even mention that he missed the beef, chicken, or pork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegetarian Slow Cooker","review":"I have been using this book for a few years now. I have tried numerous recipes, and they have all turned out well. Of course, I pick the recipes based on my personal tastes, so a level of filtering on my part is taking place that improves a recipe's chances of appealing to my family's tastes. Still, years of experience with cookbooks has shown me that a recipe that sounds good certainly isn't guaranteed to turn out good, and that hasn't been an issue with this book yet. I highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates the convenience of slow cookers and the pleasure of walking into a home permeated with the smell of an excellent meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, Easy and Yummy!","review":"This book is a great way to introduce the crock pot into veggie cooking with wonderful tips, insights and recipes.

I recommend this one for the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland outcomes every time","review":"I've tried three recipes from this book, staying true to ingredients and ratios. Every time the resulting meal was underwhelming and lacking in flavor. Many of the recipes could be improved upon with experimentation, but that's not the reason why I buy cookbooks! I'm used to making slight adjustments and did this when the outcomes were uninspiring...but I'd like a cookbook that promises a tasty meal when it comes out of the pot instead of one which needs to be saved by raiding the spice rack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many Meat Wanna-Be Recipes","review":"Too many of these recipes tried to hard to look like meat dishes (Seitan Pot roast? If I wanted pot roast, I wouldn't be buying a vegan cookbook!). Also, they never tasted good, and I'm no novice in the kitchen!The recipes I tried:--Southwestern Beans (the onions turned rancid; onions shouldn't be in a crockpot for more than a couple of hours)--Very Vegetable Gumbo (SO bland--definitely not a gumbo!)--Corn Chowder (resulted in a separated mass of soggy ingredients that tasted awful)--Brown Rice-Stuffed Squash (resulting textures and flavors made me gag)--Five Layer Vegetable Strata (a soggy, slimy mess. Yuck)--Cornbread-Topped Southwestern Pie (cornbread topping turned to glop because leavening/flour ratio was off as was moisture content)--Lentil Bolognese Sauce (texture of lentils was off, and the sauce tastes more Chef Boyardee than Italian)--Pumpkin-pecan bread (soggy and flavorless. I'm a bread-baker who couldn't believe how bad this recipe was!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and easy","review":"Too many vegatarian cookbooks are difficult using ingediants I don't have on hand. This book, so far, has been simple to use and delicious results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort Food for Vegetarians!","review":"So many vegetarian cookbooks out there have page upon page of salads and vegetable side dishes. The one thing I found myself really craving once I stopped eating meat was warm, hearty comfort food (especially in winter) and this book was a great solution to my problem! It has 3 out of 4 of my ideal cookbook criteria: 1- a description of each recipe, 2- clear, simple ingredient lists 3-step by step instructions - but is missing one of the most important, 4- colour photos (or any kind of photo, for that matter). The recipes I've tried so far have turned out great, but being handy in the kitchen I take a lot of liberty in altering recipes to my liking, so I can't speak to someone who would use the recipe literally.Note - I actually own the French version of this book and am assuming this version is identical (with the exception of language) when reviewing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this cookbook!","review":"Ahhh! The good ol' crock pot. I love this book. I love eating. I love eating healthy. This is great. To throw something in the crock pot in the morning or afternoon (meatless) and have it ready by dinner. All of the recipes I have tried have come out delicious. Not dissapointed yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried About 10 Recipes, All Subpar","review":"I have given this book more than a fair chance. I'm not a novice cook, and I love my slow-cooker, and often eat vegetarian slow-cooked meals made with fresh ingredients. I thought this book would be a winner, but nothing is palatable. It has gotten to the point that when my husband sees this book laying out, his countenance falls, but he's a good sport and eats it anyway. Enough is enough. The lack of flavor, bad textures, and even strange smells can be someone else's problem, as I'm donating this book to a used bookstore.If I may suggest my favorite recipe book for slow-cooking, \\"The Healthy Slow-Cooker,\\" by Judith Finlayson is great. I've tried probably 20 plus recipes from this book, and most have been outstanding: all have been at the very LEAST edible. The majority are vegetarian, and many are vegan-friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appealing concept, unappealing recipes","review":"Recipes for slow cookers tend to be heavy on the meat, so I was excited to find a slow cooker book for vegetarian meals. The idea of prepping my meal in the morning and then enjoying a mellower evening appealed to me, but so far, every recipe I have tried in this cookbook has dissappointed me. Because so many have praised the book, I keep thinking I might try one more recipe, but I fear wasting valuable time and food on another bad tasting/textured meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous recipes!","review":"This book is amazing!

Another book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical, disappointing... mostly useless to me","review":"My husband is more-or-less a vegetarian, so I was hoping for reasonably easy, practical help in making dinners for him. For my purposes, this book is pretty useless. Almost every recipe demands some exotic ingredient, unavailable in my neighborhood (couscous isn't good enough, it must be ISRAELI couscous etc); some are just disappointing, like p88 - the horrible 'Vegetarian pot au feu' that makes you wonder why vegetarians even enjoy food; and p75, a dismal'Indian, cauliflower and kidney bean stew'. p107 'Slow Spanish beans and rice' is OK. But what a basic recipe! And even this one requires that you fry up food in a skillet first.So - nothing is easy or simple with this pretentious book. If you have little time, live in an undistinguished neighborhood with ordinary supermarkets, and just want to cook healthy dinners, this is NOT the book for you. I regret buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vegetarian Haggis??? Puhlease!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"There are just too many strange and frankly unappetizing dishes in this book. It includes a recipe for vegetarian haggis! Haggis, you ask? In a vegetarian crockpot cookbook? No way. Way! Yes, Haggis, the foul Scottish dish made from sheep entrails encased in sheep gut- the bane of carnivores and vegetarians alike-- has been adapted here for the vegetarian crockpot! Yes, the vegetarian crockpot! I'm nauseated just thinking about vegetarian haggis or any haggis for that matter. Other bizarre recipes include \\"Chutney-Topped Tofu Appetizer Cheesecake\\" (in a crockpot? as an appetizer?? yuck). The book's ingredients lean heavily on seitan, vegetarian \\"sausage,\\" and other faux meats, and a medley of uncommon ingredients. I really just wanted some basic, easy, meatless crockpot soups and stews that a busy person could throw together in the morning and forget -- not what I found here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver","review":"I received this book as a gift. At first glance the recipes looked good, but what I was really looking for was easy wholesome veggie recipes. Instead the recipes and take more work than I have time for and use a lot of fake meat (soy) which we do not eat in our house. The 5 or 6 recipes we did make were not even that tasty. I will get my vegetarian slow recipes from internet searches from now on. I will be giving this book away."},{"rating":"2","title":"temperature issues","review":"A good book with lots of interesting ideas, but you should make sure to know what temperatures your own slow cooker reaches. She says that low is 200 degrees F and High is 300 degrees F, but when I couldn't figure out why my potatoes were still underdone after eight hours, I checked the temperature and it turned out that my slow cooker's low is at 175 and high at 205. I understand that that is a fairly standard range though, so it's the book that's off. Anyway I still recommend it, just be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great for the single working man/woman!","review":"After years of slowly putting on the lbs., I needed something to help me make eating healthy easy.

It's perfect comfort food without animal products or heavy fats and oils. Everything is so easy and has fairly common ingredients. And once in a while when I want to splurge, the Lemon-Lime Cheesecake hits the spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting recipes, low on taste. Boring.","review":"I had such high hopes for this book based on all the positive reviews, but I must join the other 1-star reviewers. Many of the recipes are just variations on each other, and not even interesting ones at that. Often they are under-seasoned. Sometimes the author seems to throw in ingredients that don't belong (the olives in the tamale pie are awful).

And I don't think I'd make any of them again. I made the vegetable stock, which wound up just tasting like onions. I used the stock in the Borsht recipe, which then made the borscht taste like onion soup. Also, way too much clove in the recipe. I also made the Dal which was bland and I had to spice it up by adding in hot serrano peppers. The Dal was also NOT anything like Dal in consistency. It was just mush. I cooked both the Dal and the Borsht for the minimum cook time as called for in the book. Both were definitely overcooked, especially the Dal."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy and so delicious!","review":"\\"Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker\\" is becoming one of my favorite cookbooks.

It was good. And so was the second and third I tried. But this cookbook is missing one VERY important thing - there's no nutrition information or quantification of portion size. That may be OK for the person who thinks vegetarian or vegan food is always low fat or carb, but it isn't. I'm eating a balanced diet and losing weight, and a key factor in my success is tracking what I eat and paying attention to portion sizes. If I want to do that with recipes from this book, I have to calculate everything, add it up and then divide by the number of servings, which are given, but the amount of the serving isn't. One recipe of 8 servings filled my crock pot. The next one of 8 servings only filled it half full. Makes no sense.

This book is truly exceptional, are as the women whose stories are told on its pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to reveal if you really worship the God of Heaven.","review":"This book reveals the importance of growing in the knowledge of God. If you do not know Him, you cannot worship Him. If you do not worship Him, who do you worship? This book not only helps you to grow in the knowledge of God, but to focus on Him. It has changed my thinking about God considerably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic for a reason","review":"In Knowledge of the Holy Tozer writes with profundity and yet this is an understandable read. He challenges the reader to do the hard work of knowing and pursuing God. So grateful to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledge of the Holy","review":"Another of Dr. A.W. Tozer's best-known works. This book is a brief overview of the attributes of God. No single attribute can be emphasized to the exclusion of any other. All areimportant and Dr. Tozer touches on all of them. A very readableand valuable resource to show Christians more about the awesomenature of our Heavenly Father. A very useful book for anyone who wants to know more about God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Folks Would Do Best to Start with Scripture","review":"My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank The Lord for this book","review":"I have only gotten to chapter 4 but oh so good. Tozer was one of the churches best thinker. This book has brought me to me knees as well as his other books. One can never go wrong reading a book by Tozer it will enrich your whole walk with our great God and Savior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"Great Book loved the service and I will always use amazon for services. Thank you so much for your business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledge of the Holy","review":"So far I've read two of Tozier's book, this being the second. It's a short read and segmented well in just \\"food for thought\\". The material is applicable to anyone regardless of age or circumstance. Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!","review":"Just like all other Amazon kindle buys, it was a smooth transaction and reader friendly format. I found the content to be a profoundly simple commentary on what the Bible tells us about God. A great aid in helping one draw closer to the Lord through His Word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would We Had This Knowledge!","review":"This book has to be one of the best A.W. Tozer ever wrote. His knowledge of the Holy has certainly put us to shame. We might have all the conveninces of life, better equipment, faster this and faster that, but we LACK the silent time, the place to be along to get to KNOW this Holy One. I highly recommend that you get a copy of this book and READ IT, and REREAD IT and let it soak in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tozer Understands the Character of God","review":"Often our spiritual growth can be described in terms of something new we are learning about the character of God. Although information alone will not transform us, true information which we seek to integrate into our lives can be an excellent starting point for growth. Pound for pound no other book contains such powerful descriptions of the attributes of God. The \\"Insights per Square Inch\\" rating is off the charts on this one!The first chapter \\"Why We Must Think Rightly About God\\" is absolutely amazing. Tozer writes \\"What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.\\" The rest of the book is an application of that principle.Each chapter begins with a profound prayer and ends with an appropriate hymn or poem, making this book abundantly readable. I've used this book on dozens of occasions in my own ministry, and have encouraged (or assigned) many people to read it for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attributes of God","review":"A no nonsense account of who God is and what He is. Truth and knowledge of God and why we trust Him and want to know Him more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such deep insight !","review":"Tozer has such an insight to the things of God. It's refreshing to read about the attributes of God,with such deep thought.I enjoyed every page of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome summary of God's attributes.","review":"Really thought provoking and deep. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to stop and think about what God is like. I also like that most of the chapters are fairly short, making them a little easier to digest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledge of the Holy","review":"Another good Tozer book. All his books make me think. Clearly written from the scriptures. I will read this more than once. Not exactly an easy read but I was not looking for a noval"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Top Book","review":"This is one of those books that you read and reread throughout the years. As a pastor who read a lot, this is on the top ten with its heart warming and clear-headed thinking. Highly suggested to read. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"This book profoundly affected my view of God. For anyone seeking to understand God in a deeper way, Knowledge of the Holy is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Spiritual Classic","review":"A. W. Tozer's Knowledge of the Holy is a modern spiritual and theological classic on the character of God. Written in Tozer's beautiful and eloquent prose, this is a fine book exploring the attributes of God. While not quite as practical as Packer's Knowing God, this book is shorter and perhaps even more worshipful in its flavor. Few books come closer to capturing the beauty of God's majesty than this. This is easily one of Tozer's best books, and a great book for the growing Christian to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok","review":"it seems to be fine it just bored me pretty quick. I couldn't get into it personally, of course it was the holidays and had a lot on my mind. but it seemed to be a lot of fodder and not key point based. seemed to drag on and found myself thinking of other stuff rather than what I was reading.

That is about all that I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, bad version","review":"I can't add anything on top of the great things already said about this book. It is a priceless reminder of the majestic holiness of God, and helps a generation obsessed with the cutting edge to take our eyes off the vain things of the world and keep our vision fixed on our great Lord. It is a must read, and it will help you know what it means to approach God with reverence and fear.That said, the Fig Books Kindle version of this book is filled with typos. I sent in a complaint in January 2013. Maybe they will fix it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking","review":"This book is a must-read. I read this originally in highschool and have since read it several more times. A great reference book on the attributes of God.

I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Knowledge of the Holy","review":"An excellent book for anyone who wished to be more involved with God. Gives great insighs and explains a lot about the Holy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The knowledge of the Holy, a must-read Christian classic","review":"Of all A.W.Tozer's books this may be the one that best expresses the great quest of a heart that hungered and thirsted for most of his life to know the Lord better. The urgent call of the book for the Church to return to a clear vision of the greatness of God is even more relevant today than when Tozer wrote it. In a world where many Christians have an increasingly blurred and diminshed idea of God, Tozer sets out clearly who God is and, perhaps more importantly, who he is not. The perfect unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, three persons in one God is clearly explained. Chapter by chapter the book sets out the God who has no beginning and no end, the God who is infinite, sovereign, almighty, all knowing, and many more. We see that God is fully a God of love and fully a God of justice and God cannot be one without being equally the other. To those who hunger and thirst to know God this book will take them a great leap forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al menos yo lo disfrut�� mucho","review":"Me qued�� muy impresionada con la historia y literalmente me lo devor��.

I simply don't make the time. So, when I do start a book it has to grab me in the first couple of chapters or I'll end up putting it down. I curled up with \\"Cries of the Orchids\\" one evening and by the end of the FIRST chapter I laid the book on my lap, wiped the tears, and sat with my mouth agape for a moment! From that point on I was hooked! Each chapter became more intriguing! It is a story full of mystery and suspicion. After the twists and \\"reveals\\", you'll be amazed where the story leaves you! I 100% recommend this to anyone looking for an excellent, exciting, emotional literary journey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I've just finished reading \\"Cries of the Orchids\\" and have but one response...WOW! I love suspense thrillers and this book rises to the occasion! I've read the reviews and they certainly hold true to me. I couldn't put the book down! Bailey did an incredible job developing the characters. I found myself grieving for Mattie, the mentally retarded mother and kept having to remind myself that she wasn't real. Wow! Wow! Wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Candy for the Brain!","review":"Books of this nature are rare, and I will cherish it forever among my literary gems! The story line solicits intense emotions from both ends of the spectrum and everything in between. At times, I laughed out loud. At other times, I turned each page with chills at the nape of my neck! An avid reader of suspense, \\"Cries of the Orchids\\" is probably the best I've read in two years. I'm looking forward to more work from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"It did the job","review":"Ms. Bailey did what a writer is supposed to do when writing a suspense book--hook the reader at the very beginning, and get that reader to turn the pages to the very end.

I hope I can give her five stars for her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one awesome read!!!!","review":"Very few books have captured my attention from the very first page the way this one has! And the ending blew me away!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice first try...","review":"The author, whom I'd never heard of, solicited this review from me and took the trouble to mail me her book, so I feel compelled to be frank about it. Apparently this is Ms. Bailey's first novel. It's not the worst first novel I've ever read, but it's not great either. Only the lead character has any kind of dimension, and on many occasions the plot begs the reader to suspend any sense of reality. But that is not to say that the book could not also be entertaining at times. Bailey does have a good sense of pace and keeps the story rolling fairly quickly and even creates a few moments of suspense...but the storyline is strictly of the \\"drugstore novel\\" variety. The author can be very descriptive, conjuring up some strong images, but the narrative connecting those images is weak. Though the heroine remains chaste throughout the novel, in no way did I find it to be \\"inspirational.\\" But it wasn't a bad first try at all. I'll give it a C+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Try it, you'll like it!","review":"The performances and sound quality on all four volumes of this complete set of Couperin's keyboard music are exceptional. It's hard to believe these CDs are made from analog recordings done in the early 70s.Those not at all familiar with Couperin will find this volume (#2) and #3 the more accessable place to begin. It is here that he begins that his invdividualistic, even sometimes eccentric twist on the traditional keyboard suite genre comes to complete fruition.Order #8 in b minor, on the one hand, is about as quintessential a specifically \\"French\\" suite as you could imagine.But on the other hand you have the flamboyant, story-telling pieces of the 10th and 11 suites. \\"Les Baricades Misterieuses,\\" from the 6th suite is likely the piece that most listeners recognize if they have only ever heard a single piece by Couperin and it is almost worth the price of admission by itself.The inclusion of the preludes from the composer's Treatise on keyboard playing is a nice bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much violence","review":"I am going to be very unpopular here but I'm okay with it. I could not believe the violence in this story. Also, I never heard of a Maje and it is too incredible to even attempt to believe. People who heal the wounded and take their pain? Leyla made me angry at best during the entire story. How, after seeing how her man was treated by the different people, did she insist their lives be spared! Please! Jarrett has got to be the bigger fool to allow her to sway him. This was too much for me. I like stories that are believable. This was ridiculous. Even the ending didn't make it all worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"This is my second unit and they just don't work.

A Disappointment","review":"After hearing \\"I Wish I Was A Punk Rocker With Flowers In My Hair,\\" I was really looking forward to hearing the rest of Sandi Thom's repertoire.

I tried hard to like it, but... it just isn't very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Exciting","review":"Apparantly I live under a rock because this album and singer who I had never ever even heard of has made a fairly big splash in the UK. First let me say I bought this at Tower for like $2 and only bought it cause 1. It's cheap 2. The Album cover boasted \\"The UK #1 album including the UK #1 single \\"I Wish I Was A Punk Rocker (With Flowers In My Hair) and 3. Umm did you just read the title of that single? So I bought it and listened to it and was only a tad impressed.This Sandi is a good enough singer but the single is nothing like I expected and had she written just a tad bit more clever lyrics perhaps that song could've saved the album for me. Instead it's almost the worst song on the album.She does a lot better on more poppy ballad type of things like \\"Lonely Girl\\" and \\"Sunset Borderline.\\" After listening to the whole album, it occured to me that upon repeat listenings I learn to like it a bit more but right now it's just doing it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, however...","review":"I found this CD on the listening rack and listened to 'I Wish I was a Punk Rocker'. I totally fell in love with the song, but when I listened to the others, I was a little disappointed. The first four songs are wonderful and full of emotion, but it goes downhill from there. After 'Sunset Borderline' she loses the genuine voice and the songs turn into repeats of all the other mediocre songs that are out there... if only she could make more like 'I Wish I was a Punk Rocker'!!!!!In other words, it was worth buying, but it's far from the best CD I've listened to.Also check out: Charlotte Martin (luv it)and the Indigo Girls"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!!","review":"I bought it for the one popular song, btu i can listen through the whole thing over and over at work. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro Rock","review":"For those of you who have read the first series of comments, don't believe them. Sandi is a breath of fresh air.I Wish I Was A Punk Rocker With Flowers In My Hair will have you humming that song for a long time. It isdifferent, fresh, evocative and a flashback to the 60's. In fact if you are tired of the same old same old,take a listen to what Sandi has to say and how she says it. Both the lyrics and melody grab you. It is so refreshinghearing something different. I applaud Sandi on her commitmet to be different. Buy the CD. You will love it.The other comments are not listening to what she has to say. The production is simple, the style is retro, andthe voice is haunting. Buy the CD. One note, the CD is very short, 33 minutes. I ended up purchasing her twomini CDs and adding it all on one CD to make a great assortment of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"PR job of the year so far","review":"Other than street teamers working for Thom's publicists, pretty much everyone in the UK knows that this album is just the latest pop fodder from an industry that is milking the internet for all the PR it's worth.The hyped webcasts didn't draw anywhere near the numbers claimed, the punk rocker song is written by others (not just Thom) and the whole exercise is cynical marketing. With such methods the music hardly matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery did not work. Only one charge and stopped working","review":"Received this battery and never worked correctly.

Going back as far as his portraits of successful women in the San Francisco Bay area, one portrait symbolically blinded the sitter with reflections on the lenses of her glasses. For follow-up, Mr. Schatz attempted to drown the San Francisco Ballet Company, and now he presents us with human beings decapitated, covered in gimmick-ridden colors or worse, and appearing more like teeth than human. While great art often attacks the human figure to reveal frailty and psychological depth (De Kooning, Bacon...), Mr. Schatz's work, in this reviewer's opinion, while occassionaly producing a graphically stunning image, only touches on the human soul with his photographs of young children, whose unrepressable energy for life perhaps could not be covered over, with technique or artifice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps on Tickin'","review":"La Crosse Technology WT-3122J Radio-Controlled Analog Wall Clock, WoodI purchased this analog atomic clock for our office which is located inside a concrete brick building without windows.

I was impressed with the very smooth wood finish, although I was hoping for a warmer honey oak color; it is lighter color oak than pictured but it will work just fine. I suppose I could stain it darker, but I don't want to mess with it. This is not the first time I've purchased an atomic clock.

This was my second attempt at a radio \\"Atomic\\" clock from La Crosse. It ended the same as the first - the clock eventually reset it self to 12 noon and nothing I did convinced it to keep time again. Now the clock does set it self to 12 noon the first time it is turned on. You're supposed to let it sit overnight and it will sync up with the WWVD radio signal and presto, perfect time. It did this the first time I set it up. And then about a month later it reset to 12 again. I tried changing the time, changing the batteries, talking to tech support. Nothing seemed to help.I won't be buying another of these but I still keep an eye out for a good radio clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Crosse Atomic Clock","review":"This is a wonderful clock. You put in the battery, press your time zone and the clock sets itself. Be patient if the time doesn't set immediately. It sometimes takes a couple hours for the clock to find the proper signal to set. Once it starts working it keeps perfect time. When daylight savings time rolls around it automatically sets itself to the proper time. The clock also is a perfect size and look for the area I needed one.

The clock looks elegant and classy, is relatively light, and matched my furniture. Unfortunately, I am having the same problems getting the clock to set itself to the correct time that East Coast users of similar models of the wall clock experienced. I live in Washington, DC.The manual tells you that the clock sets itself overnight so I threw away the packaging and boxes thinking all would be well. But the next day the clock's minute and hour hands were stuck at 4:00, and remained stuck at 4:00 the next day. I used another brand new AA battery, but I received the same result.

Worked reasonably well in New England for several months. Would occasionally forget its time and resync. Seemed to eat batteries. After 6 months or so it would not sync reliably. After multiple resets and battery changes, gave up and sent it back for repair but they returned it saying it worked fine for them. I would guess that it might work better if closer to Colorado and the radio signal source, but I've given up on it in New England. Nice looking clock and I was happy with it when it was working."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO FAR--Couldn't be better","review":"I just received this clock about one week ago. I am pleased with the look and quality. It has a medium nutmeg finish. It synconized within seconds of my putting in the AA battery and setting it to my time zone. It has kept perfect time ever since. Of course I only live about 35 miles from Boulder so I'm sure I would have no problem with the signal. I wanted a clock in my kitchen that was more \\"upscale\\" than the traditional fruit type kitchen clock. This has simple lines and would look nice in the bathroom and perhapes the bedroom as well. Best of all it keeps perfect time and I will never have to reset it for daylight saving time changes. You can, however, not use the \\"daylight-saving-time\\" feature if you live in an area that does not have DST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second hand stopped working after a few days","review":"The clock set itself perfectly overnight. It's a very easy-to-read face and attractive on the wall. LaCrosse clocks tick more quietly than most others, so I use this one in my home recording studio. This is the only genuine wood-framed analog wall clock that La Crosse makes that I've seen. The only drawback, which the instructions fail to mention, is when you change the battery the clock automatically advances to 4:00 and you have to wait overnight for it to sync up to the signal again. For me, that slight inconvenience is worth the accuracy.Addendum: the second hand froze at :51 seconds within the first week and has not moved since. I decided it was not worth the hassle of returning it and swapped it with another clock in a less-used room. The other 2 hands still keep perfect time, but the frozen second hand ruins it for any room where guests would see it. Instant downgrade from 4 stars to 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks OK, But Doesn't Set Itself","review":"Although it says it resets itself every night, it failed to reset when it came time to go off of daylight savings time, and had to be done manually. Another atomic type clock further down on the same wall in the same room had no problem getting a time signal and resetting itself. I would say that the receiver chip in the clock of of poor quality. It does look good and keeps good time so twice a year resetting isn't worth the expense of sending it back. However would NOT purchase another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking analog clock","review":"I am looking for a nice analog clock for basement entertainment room (18' x 25')that is large enough to view from any corner.

If however, you like clocks that actually work... this is not for you.Boo La Crosse, on your poor customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Clock","review":"This clock is attractive and easy to read from across a large room. It took a little patience for it to find the signal to synchronize, but waiting about 1 1/2 days was all it took. It set itself just fine inside a metal building about 20 ft from the nearest window.I also noticed several reviews talking about the clock being 20 minutes slow.

It would like to be erotic but after about the first 50 pages it is not; it would like to be romantic but the most believable romance in the book is between the older characters; it would like to be suspenseful and unpredictable but if you are genuinely surprised by the ending then you obviously don't read much.I truly felt this was an awful book, poorly executed, and obviously written only to satisfy a publisher and not a loyal reader.

That means it does contain steryotypes, exaggerated characters and rascism. If you are offended by this, or the sexual content which does appear, this movie is not for you.Onwards, for those open-minded to this kind of thing, this is a great work of art. It features the Oscar winning Denzel Wasington (Training Day) as a convicted murderer who is released conditionally to please society. Basketball star Ray Allen plays Denzel's son, doing what he does best--play basketball. A profound yet entertaining movie, with a slight tinge of abstraction towards its end.It is one of the few DVD gems I highly recommend for those not offended by the former."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film","review":"I love this movie. Definately one of my all-time favorites. If it isn't then the only thing that comes close is Glory. Also with Denzel Washington. I love the way the story is told about an upcoming basketball star who gets caught up in lots of trouble. It is an all-star movie. Check it out! And if you don't have a stomach for graphic sex, violence, drug abuse, and harsh language, please check out Glory. It is an excellent movie about a black regiment in the Civil War.

He is released on parole, but with one condition - he must persuade his son, genius basketball player Jesus to sign with the governor's alma mater university, Big State. And Jake only has a week to do it. Spike Lee's He Got Game is a beautifully shot and well-executed exploration of the role that the sport of basketball plays in the relationship between a father and his estranged son. The definitive sense of Spike's style that was quite apparent throughout this movie. Denzel, as usual, excellently handles his role as the intense father, and is utterly believable in both his emotion-laden and his violent, angry scenes.

Denzel Washington was superb as always, as the jailed father of a basketball player, who is allowed out of jail to help convince his semi-estranged son to attend a certain university. Washington is convincing. His sexual escapades with the relatively untalented Milla Jovovich are not all that believable, although I guess if I had been in prison for so long I might consider Jovovich also. The real life basketball player who plays the basketball star who has to choose his path is all right. He is no actor, though, and his path to decisionmaking is pretty long and boring and there is just a bit too much sex in it. His conniving girlfriend Lala is trying to make him turn pro and is seeing agents on the side. She also has no qualms about not being loyal to him. Misdirected misfire, this film. It is a shame, but it did serve my immediate purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am pissed ray left the celtics I'm a huge celtics fan and can't believe he want to the heattics","review":"I wouldn't be as mad if he wouldn't of went to the heat there are rival can't believe it wish he would of went tothe clippers that would be great but the heat c'mon ray"},{"rating":"2","title":"lover of basketball","review":"this movie is awesome, i just saw it today, its one of my favorite basketball movies right up there with Above the Rim, Denzel is great in this one, Ray Allen is pretty good in his debut, the only part that bothers me is the end with the ball coming out of nowhere, but anyways, if you like basketball, go see this movie, its great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Denzel Washington is Amazing","review":"This is a terrific movie, despite the fact that Spike Lee lost his way in the meandering plot; the ending doesn't make much sense. And of course, there's a bit of misogny in the portrayal of women. However, Ray Allen is wonderful as Jesus Shuttlesworth and Rick Fox is a tasty treat. I would love to see him in other movies.Denzel Washington is a REVELATION. Of course I've admired his work for years because he's so handsome. But I haven't appreciated his acting ability (aside from his performance in Glory) in quite some time. This performance is nuanced and subtle and complex and brilliant. He's humble and arrogant, noble and low-life, all in one character. It reminds me of his role in Mississippi Masala.If you love NBA basketball, this a great movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie...","review":"This movie is very good, i am a huge spike lee fan.

It comes standard on the Hammer Drill, but it can be ordered via any Makita deal for $2. The part # is 419276-2. I added one to my compact drill and one to my drill driver and got one extra as a spare. I agree, Makita should ship this with the bit holder, though I don't think the belt clip can be attached to this drill with the 1.5Ah battery and be able to stand flat.

I am a helicopter mechanic and this drill is perfect for removing panel screws and things of that nature. Battery life hasn't been a problem at all and charging actually takes only 15 mins, unbelievable! The case could be alittle better I suppose but really doesn't matter all that much to me. I guess the only things I can find wrong with this drill is that it has white on it??? and the chuck doesn't go all the way down to zero, (drilling really small holes,ie; number 60 drill bit).

Wrong, I took the batteries to the local Home Depot who rents tools and they put them on their chargers and receive the same \\"bad battery\\" response. So now, I have a drill with no batteries. It will cost as much for two replacement batteries as it will to purchase the entire drill package again.

It weighed a ton and was incredibly unbalanced, but it was a tough tool. The makita batteries need to be carefully cleaned and maintained to get them to slide in and out of both the drill and charger. Do I have time for this? The chuck looks bad, caked with paints, resins deep scratches. I miss the butt level on the Dewalt. Nice simple visual check guide. I may just go out and find some batteries for my old Dewalt.

I can carry it hanging on my tool belt without feeling the weight. Compact design let's it get into tighter spaces.On the negative side, the speed does not modulate well. It is as if the tool has a few speed steps, as you pull the trigger you can hear and see that the tool shifted into a higher \\"gear\\". In other words, the speed is not increasing in a slow continuous motion. It is making a few minor jumps.Also it is a bit noisier than I would like. It gets noisier as the speed \\"shifts\\" up. It has a higher pitch metalic sound to it as well. It is noisier than Bosch 18v brute for example.Noise and the speed issue however does not impact the usability as much.

In contrast, I have a 9.6 Makita drill with 3 batteries and each have received hundreds of charge cycles and not lost one yet after many years of rugged service.

I was a little concerned about the relatively small battery capacity - it has around half the amp-hour rating of most competitors. However, I have found that this is actually an advantage, as it allows for a battery which is smaller, lighter, and which can be charged very quickly. So far, the battery life has been excellent, and the battery really does charge in 15 minutes or less. While you're using one battery the other one is charging, so by the time the first battery runs down, the second one is ready to go. Torque and speed control are excellent, and I really like the fact that the end of the chuck is metal (many drills have a rubber chuck head which often gets abraded during use).

Batteries should last longer than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"battery issues","review":"One of the two batteries stopped accepting charges within six months of purchase. I'd probably used that battery 8-10 times for 10 or 15 minutes. I never got around to looking up where/when I'd purchased it, and now it's too late. Otherwise I love the drill, but it's a bit of a hassle to operate efficiently with just one battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Battery POS Makita","review":"I bought this drill about eight months ago. I was looking for a more compact, light weight drill for cabinetry work. Initially I was pleased with the drill, it is light, compact, and ergonomic. The problem is about 30% to 40% of the time the battery will be dead when it is left in the charger. The green light will be on indicating that it is completely charge, but it is not. It seems to be getting progressively worse. I'm not a novice, and I know proper battery maintenance protocol. I've owned Dewalts, Panasonics and Milwaukees and have never had this problem. In checking the reviews I see that others have this same problem, and apparently Makita batteries are often troublesome. I'll keep using it despite this flaw, but I'll never buy another MakitaPOS again. Why play Russian roulette with your money and hope you get one that is reliable, there are plenty of good quality tools to choose from, By the way, 10 minutes ago I bought a Bosch cordless drill and grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst batteries EVER","review":"The batteries for this drill wear out really really quickly and are expensive. I have gone through five batteries in less than 4 years and now need another. I like the drill, but it is just too expensive to own if batteries are like ink cartridges and you have to replace them every time you run a print job. So I am about to buy a different drill and not buy any more batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Drill","review":"Great, powerful, light weight drill. Service was prompt, but did not receive any packing slip or receipt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Tool","review":"Just wanted to say that I bought this for my brother. No complaints yet.

I also purchased the little in line 7.2 volt li-ion impact driver from makita and it is great, thank God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Unoriginal","review":"Calne's work is hardly deserving of the description \\"scholarly.\\" Nearly all of his material is found in other introductory works on the subject and receives more detailed treatment elsewhere as well. Perhaps Calne can be forgiven for not familiarizing himself with the current literature and writing a superfluous book - after all, he is just an M.D., not a psychologist or philosopher. This book is not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have used a reasonable editor","review":"The core argument of this book, that reason or rational thinking is a value-free activity, which we can put to whatever use we please, is indisputable. At the same time, I think there is great value in stating the argument as directly as this book does. However, the discussion in the book is often reductive, digressive at best, scattered at worst. In addition, the author's own phobias and neuroses are frequently on display (a rather morbid view of sex is an example). A good editor probably could have done wonders to focus the author's work and eliminate some of the overt weirdness.The subject deserves a more nuanced and better edited discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangely free of useful content","review":"This book is more of a manifesto than an education. Calne sets forth statements with which I largely agree, while giving short shrift to the basis for those statements and even less attention to the consequences of the truth of those statements.This is not a book about why we should agree with Calne, and it is not a book about what people who agree with Calne should do -- it is merely a book explaining what Calne believes. I was in the market for a book that gives his fellow-travellers, like me, some ammunition for argument and discussion, and even some things to think about. But this is not that book. At best, it's preaching to the choir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limitations","review":"It is possible that the unit I received was defective, but the advertised range of 80 feet was not achievable. It could get a signal between the rain collector and the monitor within 10 feet, but at that distance you are standing outside and you can SEE it is raining. When you lose the signal the display reads \\"---\\" and the only way of re-setting it is by taking out the batteries and going through the set up again. I called the non-toll free \\"help\\" line and was on hold for 5 minutes after which the call was transferred to a mailbox that was full and could take no more messages so I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective after 6 months of use.","review":"I like the 6 day or 6 week graph. I just hope it could be better constructed. Mine is about 6 months old. Not been dropped. All of a sudden it just stopped working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"This moniter failed to report the most significant rainfall ever recorded in my area. Tropical depression Gaston roared through on 8/30/04 and the monitor lost signal and failed to report the over 7 inches of rain that fell at my home. Luckily I had the trusty manual gage still outside. I have sent the product back and hope that I get a refund. Oh, by the way, now that it is the next morning it seems to be working fine. I can only conclude that the rain caused the receiver to be unable to receive from the transmitter. Very problamatic for an item that needs to be in the rain in order to do what it claims to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Unreliable","review":"The specs look very good, so I bought my first of these on the recommendation of a friend who had one that had worked for several months. After a few months, mine began measuring intermittently - sometimes it was correct, sometimes it only registered 1/2 the actual rainfall.Since my friend's unit was still working fine, I figured mine was a fluke and bought another one. This one worked for two months and then reported that it had lost the transmitter signal. I could not make it work reliably at any distance - and not at all if the receiver was more than 3 feet from the gauge.I have since learned that my friend's unit quit working with the same symptoms. That's strike 3. I'd say that 0 for 3 is a really lousy record for LaCrosse QC."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY IT!!","review":"I tried 2 of these. The first one jumped up to 40 inches on the display when it lightninged during a thunderstorm. So i sent it back and the 2nd one did the same thing. Also to change the batteries in the gauge you have to take the gauge off the mount. Not good if its mounted on your roof. So i sent it back and got the wired one. They said the wired one tipped at 1/100th of a inch. It tips at 2/100ths. Oh well. Thats better than Oregons that tips at 4/100ths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idea is nice, but only works once and a while","review":"Nice Toy, but that's because that's what it is. If really want a instrument that accurately measures the actual amount of rainfall and history just outside, you best get a glass tube and a pad and pencil. Le Crosse makes some great products, but this one just isn't one of them. Unfortunately, it stops working just when you're most interested in having it do so. Don't confuse this with a weather station that could cost over $500. See the other reviews about battery change design flaw. Other than this, if the price is right the thing could be a nice gadget gift for those that aren't all that serious about the true amount of rain."},{"rating":"1","title":"LaCrosse rain gauge","review":"Mine died in less than a year. I've followed all the directions, those that came with the unit and those online, but the unit is unusable. Would not buy a LaCrosse unit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Great for about 18 Months","review":"If I would have reviewed this rain monitor about four months ago I would have given it four stars with the only downfall being its short range. It would only transmit through one wall of our house. But three months ago the display just quit showing numbers. I replace the batteries in both units, made sure there were no mechanical problems and still nothing. Our replacement unit, made by Oregon Scientific. transmits all the way to the far room in our house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read the reviews","review":"I should have read the reviews before I purchased the WS-7038UF. It does not work and has never worked. IT will establish wireless connectivity, but if the receiver is moved 2\\" or more connection is lost. Connection is lost if I walk within 4 feet, connection is lost if it rains.A unit that turns off when rain begins is not much of a rain guage.G Sadler Bridges"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scriptural accuracy and readability in one version","review":"The New Jerusalem Bible is by far the easiest of all english versions to read and to understand while at the same time maintaining scriptural accuracy. It dares to restore the name of God to the text where other versions capitalize (About 5000 some-odd times) the word \\"LORD\\", furthering the Jewish and Christian superstition that THE NAME is too holy to utter. It transliterates the Hebrew word; \\"Sheol\\" in place of the misunderstood translations of grave, hell, and pit. The New Jerusalem Bible has been my favorite version for many years. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best Study Bible and translation","review":"When I bought this Bible, I was amazed. I have quite a variety of versions from the NIV to the NASB. However, this ranks near the top of my list. The NJB is not too liberal, nor is it too fundamentalist conservative. It is even-handed and the notes, maps, and references are second to none, perhaps only to the NIV study Bible. The translation is clear and fairly poetic. As an evangelical scholarly Christian whose pursuit of God's truth is never finished, the NJB is a treasured Bible indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent translation.","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this translation. I bought it while taking a class on the Bible as Literature at the community college. I own several other Bible translations including NAB, NIV, and KJV. The New Jerusalem Bible was easy to read and understand and only included comments when absolutely necessary. This can be a plus or a minus depending on what you are using it for. I believe on reading multiple translations. This is a fine addition to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it, and I'm not Catholic","review":"I have read it cover to cover several times over the past few years and find it my translation of choice.

Examples of the former include (and I translate from the French): \\"In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. Now the earth was waste and void, darkness covered the abyss, and God's breath was hovering over the waters\\" and \\"the Word was made flesh and camped among us.\\" Examples of the latter include (and again I translate from the French): \\"Rejoice, filled with grace, the Lord is with you\\" and \\"let him be anathema\\"I should note that the French translation also maintains traditional Hebrew, Greek, and Roman units of measurement and monetary nomenclature, which I prefer to the English translation's attempt to approximate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Service too slow","review":"The book arrived nearly a month after the sender promised it.The Jerusalem Bible : New Testament"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment...DON'T buy this if you want NOTES .","review":"A huge disapointment.

This one is a translation of that text BUT this this bible doesn't have ANY notes and that's criminal. What makes LA BIBBIA DI GERUSALEMME great are FOOT NOTES that helps the reader to understand the context, translations,culture of time...and a lot more.

It has a bit of inclusive langauge, but not as much as the NRSV.I like the format (single column) and the notes at the bottom of the page, also near the page edge is referanced where passages is quoted in the other books of the Bible.The format and font is clear and easy read, though the footnotes are a bit small, theres a good hard cover, but not sure if it will stand up to a lot of use!One important thing is to make sure you get the Doubleday, hardback ISBN 0385142641, 2136 page edition if you want all the notes.Personally, I think this Bible compliments the RSV and NAB Bibles I have very well.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for lectio divina","review":"I've been a big fan of the Jerusalem and New Jerusalem for several years, and the readers/study edition has some of the best footnotes I've had the pleasure of reading.It reads much more smoothly than the NRSV, which can sound stilted at times. As other reviewers have noted, the usage of Yahweh and El Shaddai are marvelous and make you look at the OT in new ways.This is, by far, my favorite transation. But I keep having to replace it!

This is truly a translation for both commoner and the scholar...Very rarely does one stumble upon a translation that is both accurate and \\"readable.\\" The NJB manages to accomplish both...The NJB is a translation that renders the New Testament accurately and soundly.

They have no grasp of what an accurate translation is. This is the most accurate, easy to read bible you will ever see. It restores to the text the name of God in the seven some odd thousand times it appeared in the Old Testament (or Hebrew scriptures). This fact can be easily confirmed with the Strong's Concordance. It transliterates the word \\"Sheol\\" in place of the King James words, \\"Grave, Hell, and Pit\\". This lets the reader make up his or her own mind regarding the controversial subject of Hell, avoiding any outside, sectarian bias. It contains few distracting and unnecessary references which would serve only to keep the reader from learning God's word in a natural, undirected way, absent of religious influence. Buy it.

Its presence there helps to see the great difference between the men's work and God's work.

This book contains everything you need to play a werebear character (black, brown, polar, and grizzly only) including history, culture, merits, flaws, abilities, gifts, and fetishes unique to the gurahl. This book contains much more information than the player's guide did on the werebears. It even inludes how to bring a werebear into your werewolf game. The only dissapointment is that this book does not have a greater variety of bears such as the sun bear, or kodiak bear. The gurahl are the Healers of gaia, and are much less violent than the werewolves (but MUCH more strong)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I guess I must have had the same mindset as Adam in the previous review. I too set up the main unit and the remote side by side to see if the readings from both units would agree, along with another very accurate digital thermometer. After six hours, the temperature readings from all of the units were within one degree, but the humidity readings from the remote unit were lower by 4 to 8 percent as compared the humidity reading from the main unit... which is 3 to 7 percent too much IMO since they were side by side. What good is having a relative humidity function if you cannot trust the readings? I will return the unit.Also, on my unit, the front wood bezel apparently had a small defect and it was repaired (from the factory) with a wood filler type material... but the defect was still obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"LaCrosse loses its power","review":"We have had the La Cross WS-7391UG wireless weather station since Christmas.

Try another product."},{"rating":"2","title":"basic functions are great","review":"This was an easy set-up and we find it very useful and attractive. The accuracy of the product as far as temperature and humidity is great. There is no barometer per se and it tries to estimate what's happening in the weather by the barometric pressure. Living in a dessert has proven that you can't always predict weather by barometric pressure only as it hasn't rained ever when the weather station predicted. Also there are only 6 time zones so if you live outside of the United States or England the tide indicator is not going to be correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend a product from this company!","review":"Love the concept, but.... I bought the 9016 model (LaCross Technologies is the mfr) for my wife/family for the holidays. After following the directions included with the unit and an exhaustive look through the FAQ's, etc. at the LaCross Technologies website, I still cannot get the outdoor temperature to read out on the unit - this has nothing to do with distance between the sensor and the unit, etc. -- it does not work. I suspect the transmitter is defective. The company's help desk and email help function on their web site is the worst... it does not ring through and eventually (20 min?) dumps you out of their system all-together. I received no responses from two emails. THIS COMPANY IS THE WORST -- THEIR PRODUCTS DO NOT WORK AND THEY ARE LESS THAN GENUINE ABOUT SERVICE.

It has the new kid in the school who thinks he has made friends with the coolest kid in school but he doesn't realize that he is being used for something absolutly terrible. That is where betrayal comes into play when Charlie Good sells him out for the bomb when it was his idea. The book just takes teen problems to the next level or to what people think about never doing but don't.

Read Alex Flinn's Breaking Point to learn the truth about Paul Richmond, one of \\"those kids\\"---you know, the kind you see profiled on CNN after the latest school disaster. Flinn shows us Paul *before* the disaster, when he is still a shy, likable kid longing for a friend. Is it Paul's fault that the friend he finds is so very evil?

He is picked on until a way out is offered by golden boy Charlie Good. In exchange for homework help, which gradually escales into antisocial acts, he will receive protection from the bullies. Dealing with the pain from his parents' divorce and his father's seeming rejection of him, Paul is unsure whether Charlie's friendship is genuine or simply based on what he can provide. Like \\"Shattering Glass\\" this book exploes what happens when an outcast hooks up with a popular teen with sociopathic tendencies. The language used by the characters is somewhat coarse, but not unusual for a teen novel published today."},{"rating":"2","title":"My most treasured Anime CD","review":"When I was a child, I loved the Speed Racer animation.

He feeds his Ice Age with massive amounts of volcanics, but he does not consider that a byproduct of volcanic activity is carbon dioxide. In reality, instead of causing an Ice Age, Noah and his family would have been roasted alive.This is just one problem of many.

Every item in the package stinks; the clock, the paper instruction book and most especially the small power supply and cord. I think it's the \\"plasticizers\\" in the power supply wire insulation. I bought 4 of these and each one STINKS! In order to have any hope of being able to bring them in the house, I've had to leave them all in the garage to air out. It's been 5 days now, and the smell has diminished considerably, but I still won't have this stench in my house. They'll stay there 'till they have a chance to cure properly.

I followed the initialization routine exactly as outlined and had the remote in the same room as the base unit. The base and remote started off reading similar temps, but over a 24 hour period the remote temp would drift as high as +75F and as low as -20F. With the remote still indoors, obviously something was wrong.I emailed La Crosse technical support (support@lacrossetechnology.com) and received a reply the next day that just outlined several steps for me to try that were already in their manual. They also offered to replace the unit, if I paid to have it shipped it to them.

Since then, I became a big Chicken Soup fan and bought a few other books. Among them I recommend (other than the above) Chicken Soup for the Couple's Soul and the original Chicken Soup book. I feel bad not highly recommending this book either, but I felt utterly disappointed after purchasing this book and really wanted a refund, unfortunately I had spilled a drink on it. It seems as though the publishers were simply trying to push another Chicken Soup book and just slapped a book together using remnant, semi-motivating stories from the editing floor rejects and stories from celebrities that weren't necessarily as inspiring as I would expect. Perhaps if this was my first Chicken soup book, I would have loved it, but it wasn't and I was sorely displeased."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can find this stuff online...","review":"I used to LOVE Cosmo as a teen (eek, it talked about sex!) but then the Internet happened and I could find all my juicy gossip and sex tips online.Back then, I would read it front to back but honestly now as a late 20s person...

I subscribed to Cosmo for a year just to see how terrible their content really is, and I was not disappointed -- shallow, repetitive, and often strange sex advice that you could find online for free (and honestly, what you'd find online is probably more accurate and helpful!).If you're interested in having a good laugh with your friends while you read the absurd tips and tricks aloud, then it's definitely worth the $5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great magazine terrible service","review":"I love cosmo and got this subscription as a gift but I haven't received half of the issues.

They have told me they would renew my subscription for the next year, didn't. said they would extend it an additional 3 months. didn't. It's beyond irritating, doesn't make any since.

I hope young women that read these don't think that their entire lives should revolve around men. I love my husband dearly, but I feel it is a bit insulting they way the mag spends about 80% of it talking about what we can do to please them.

After using the Amazon contact system and emails, 6 weeks later I still didn't have a refund. So, I called the publisher. They said they cancelled the subscription 6 weeks ago! Back to Amazon. Now, if you're an online retailer, you should be able to resolve issues online. However, I had to CALL Amazon and speak to someone in India for 20 minutes to get a refund.

None. If you watch the cover teasers, you will notice they repeat every few months. Old articles are rewritten with new cover teasers. There are more advertisements than articles. You might see 2-3 articles a year that actually have some substance. Cosmo fashion is [.......] at best - Marie Claire would give you better advice for that. Any health tips cosmo gives are outdated and obvious. Despite what the cover says, don't believe that you will any new sex advice either - Cosmo sensationalizes the obvious. The best thing to do before buying any magazine subscription is to purchase a single copy to see if you like it. Many libraries have magazines too, browse through the shelves for free - I've even found new magazines I've liked that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hits The Store Several Weeks Before My Mailbox","review":"Although the price is a little better with a subscription, Cosmopolitan always showed up several weeks late if at all.

Yes they sent me at least 10 copies of the Dec issue. It makes great kindling. I just received the June issue yesterday the 7th of July.

I waited until the date they listed for me to be able to report this, and then it gave me an automatic message that the issue is out of stock.Aside from all of these issues, the absolute worst part by far is that there is not a single way to get in touch with customer service!

Overall, the magazine is very insightful to me and helps me to better understand why women think or say some of the things they do as well as some of the behaviors they exhibit.To a man this is like an all knowing all powerful bible to understanding woman-kind. A must read for any member of the male species."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good mag for single women","review":"Cosmo is one of my favorite magazine.

And I used to like this magazine. When I was younger. However, I am 30 now and whenever I pick up a copy...I feel stupider after I read it. Soooo much sex and stupid \\"love\\" advice. Things they say men want which often they don't, or things you should do to \\"get them\\". I am past the days where I want to try swinging from a chandelier, past the days where I want to play games with the guys I meet, and past the days of trying to be something I'm not. Be warned, this does not seem like a \\"be yourself\\" magazine. It seems like the \\"be the woman you think he wants you to be\\" magazine.However, I like the fashion and beauty sections and luckily know myself well enough to separate the useful from the BS in this magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're over 30, this is not the magazine for you!","review":"Purchased this magazine because I was buying a different magazine for a gift, and this was cheap. Apparently, I am no longer a member of the Cosmo audience. As a married, 34-year old mother of 2, articles about wild and crazy sex in his office with his secretary watching and my bra as handcuffs...no longer appeal to me. I guess its my fault for purchasing and forgetting that my sex life consists of quickies on the couch trying to ignore the dog, who is watching! Almost the entire magazine revolves around sex. Along with trying to hide the sex articles from my daughter's view, I also have to watch the half naked men sprawled throughout the magazine. I know that may not be a negative to some subscribers! In addition, there is not really enough beauty and fashion articles. Apparently, I'm just out of touch.

I felt like I was reading the same stuff all the time. Got bored real quick with this magazine & was very disappointed. After a few issues I could care less about it arriving & even then it was late compared to the stores already having it out. Maybe younger, single ladies might enjoy this but for me it was such a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible Writing","review":"I have just cancelled my subscription after 2 years. Most issues are all the same and I suspect that they make up data for some of their articles. The last straw was when they published an article that seemed to discourage breast feeding.

Recently succumbed to a cheap $5 subscription offer and now I'm regretting it - it's not worth it at that price, either.I'm embarrassed to admit that I get this magazine - the fashion advice is stale, articles on beauty and health are shallow, and the ubiquitous sex articles in every.single.issue and screaming from the cover are of the stuff found in cheap novels.Ugh - I'm sorry for the trees wasted on this magazine and have learned my lesson - will never subscribe again to this useless magazine! Save your money - the covers can look interesting, but when you start comparing them w/ past issues and see that they're virtually identical & look at the poor writing you will probably find that it doesn't deliver. There are better better magazines out there!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Low price, and works great","review":"This weather station works great, and delivers what is advertised about it.

The woman is English but it is obvious she really cares about her horses. She has photos of all the different things she tells you to do as far as your horse's care is concerned. Most of the things are the same in England and in the States except that I don't know what a 'manege' is. But it's an excellent book and well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I don't know who the people are on this interview, even though they are labeled as \\"entertainer\\".

All in all an excellent book, well worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"steveg","review":"I have I.B.S. and Diverticulosis. This supplement is really helping with my symptons. It does what it says. I saw it on The Dr. Oz. Show, so I thought I would give it a try. I've tried so many other things in the past, but this does seem to help the best for me. Price wise, it's cheaper than some other things I've tried, and if less expensive works better, then that's fine with me. I take two in the morning and two at bedtime. I'm not as crampy as I usually am, and I'm more regular, not constipated,that was a big problem. Also solved my problems with diahrea,(yuk). It took about 5 day's to notice it starting to work.

I had great luck with Nature's Way slippery elm. It was amazing. After going through the first bottle, I tried the Solaray brand because it was a little bit cheaper. It didn't help at all and it immediately made me feel bad. I contacted to company by email to see if they are gluten free and they said they couldn't answer that in writing. No company has ever had an issue with that before. I called the number provided just to have the guy quickly tell me that it's not gluten free. The bottle says no additional ingredients are in the product other than those listed, but that is not true. So if you are gluten intolerant and are trying to heal, do not use this brand.

I first learned the \\"Indian Love Song\\" as a generic trail song -- but who says that music can't grow and change and mutate? -- and this album is Country Western meets Native American -- but the results are much nicer in music than they were culturally. Just goes to show that all people face the same problems and come up with so many of the same answers. Not in the notes, it should be mentioned that \\"Song of 49\\" is a Veterans Song -- so that when you hear the code words \\"After the 49\\" you have a clue what the context is. I understand why a person can go through 3 copies of this CD. I concur that \\"To Those Who Dream' should be on the preview.

One reason is because of the richness of information in the content of this book, such as the generous amount of photos offered to enhance your reading and the more-than-average amount of information offered. Another great reason is because of the great detail and precision Mr. Ballard has put into this book. Some of the liners reviewed in this book include the:* Great Eastern* Brittania* Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse* Titanic* Lusitania/Mauretania* Empress of Ireland* Brittanic* Queen Mary/Queen Elizabeth* Normandie* Ile de France* Andrea DoriaIn general, this book is truly one that you will enjoy to read.

I suspected the gentlemen behind the release were from my hometown Nashville, but this really doesn't have the same (somewhat boring) overproduced sound that's dominated some recent releases from our singer-songwriter community.This stuff is way out, man. It really reminds me of Captain Beefheart's younger brother, the bastard son of Tom Waits, if you had snuck him some Drive By Truckers albums for his birthday some year. Which isn't to say it's unlistenable - far from it. Mr. Stubblefield's gravelly voice adds interest but the songwriting is really good, with interesting lyrics and diverse styles - which is another way of saying the songs don't all sound the same.I just bought the new Starlings release which came out this year, so I'll be interested to hear if the sound has evolved in an interesting way.

When I say it didn't work I mean the wind and temerature gauges just stopped and won't work (no inside reading on the main unit). I placed the main unit 10 feet away thru a glass window (still didn't work). The odd part is it worked for one and a half days and then just started malfunctioning.

Sure, its kind of predictable, and some of the more popular scenes from \\"The Jolson Story\\" are redone here, but I could watch this movie every day and not get tired of the music, story, and especially Larry Parks! Would LOVE to have it in DVD if/when that happens!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jolson Sings Again - just sit back and enjoy!","review":"Jolson Sings Again is the excellent sequal of The Jolson Story. Viewers really need to see The Jolson Story first, then Jolson Sings again. These two productions provide a wonderful overview of the exceptional career of Al Jolson. Great music and acting; well directed. Those who have seen these movies remain amazed that Larry Parks does such a wonderful job \\"lip sinking\\" to actual recordings by the infamous Al Jolson. Sit back and enjoy the wonderful story and great old songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Shock! Jolson's voice was not used on all songs!","review":"Columbia Pictures was not happy with at least three of the tracks Jolson sang. He was older and not well so they brought in Jolson \\"sound-a-like\\" singer Norman Brooks to sing them. If you ever heard Mr Brooks you would be amazed! He HAD AL Jolson's voice!!Once source told me that Jolie never knew the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love Jolson","review":"Despite Al Jolson's passing when I was seven or eight, even back then I knew who he was and the style of his singing. Kids used to mimic him and his nasality and antics during his rendering of a song. Some sixty years later I still love listening to and watching his corny, showy style. In each of the Jolson movies, Larry Parks plays the singer, and I still remember my parents telling me he sang exactly like Jolson, except Parks didn't sing. He lip-synched to Jolson's voice. And that voice was fabulous. Both Jolson movies are products of their time, as was Jolson himself. But the man could sing. The crowds loved him and he knew it. Every once in a while I find myself humming an old Jolson melody over and over until my wife tells me \\"Enough!\\" If Jolson ever rapped on stage, I'd become a hip-hop fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jolson Sings Again","review":"I bought this DVD for my husband, a real Jolson fan and he has watched multiple times and loves it. DVD arrived timely and in perfect condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good movie","review":"This movie is almost as good as the first movie about Mr Jolson. It is certainly a must see and definately a must listen. You don't have to be older to truly enjoy this music and the story is definately inspirational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this dvd.","review":"Go for the book. The material in this dvd is very short. There are only 8 examples and you have to print the booklet of tablature. It's not a good buy, I tried to request a refund because on the back it says \\"booklet included\\" and it wasn't realizing later that on the disc it says you have to print the booklet. Looks and sounds very cheaply made and seems thrown together after the book was put out."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"This was a very disappointing product.

In my bedroom, placed in a corner, it cannot pickup the signal required to set itself.The projected display is plenty bright for me however the letters aren't very large. I wear glasses for near sightedness and my old brookstone clock projected large 18 inch digits on my 10 foot ceiling. This one projects digits about 8 inches in height. Fortunately, it is so crisply focused and bright that I can still read the display without glasses.I don't use the alarm feature so I don't know if it works well or not.The remote temperature sensor does work but it too is sensitive to where it is placed. Outside about 40 feet away, it did not pick up the signal. But when I moved it to the wall just outside where the clock is, it began to work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Projection works only in complete darkness","review":"The clock is simple and works fine. It is not fancy or good-looking. The outdoor temperature and clock are synchronized automatically by the outdoor unit. The only problem is the projection, it is not possible to see the projection unless it is 100% dark, even if there is very little light in the room (e.g. even right after sun rise) you cannot see the \\"projected\\" time."},{"rating":"1","title":"WT-5431 Doesn't WORK!","review":"Had problems from the start. The remote sensor did not work. I called and emailed La Crosse, it took days to get a response. They finally got back to me and gave me a long list of detail things to check and do, just crazy. They said it should not be near any other electronic devices, well like most people, my home is loaded with all kinds of electronic stuff. They sent me a new sensor that does not work either.

It's lower priced cousin, the Pixma iP4000, was ranked #2, overall score in the excellent range and designated as a \\"CR best buy\\". The 5000 actually tested slower than the 4000 in both text speed(ppm) and 4x6 time. Admittedly, the superior 9600x2400 res. is impressive as is the 1pl droplet size. The 5 color ink tanks are a bit misleading as 2 of them are black. Canon printers are the best so don't waste money on HP,Epson, & Lexmark.To the reviewer below that stated that everybody uses 20 lb. paper, I use a \\"bright white\\" 24 lb. inkjet paper for everyday use (20 is too thin- better for fax & copy machines). Also, the reviewer incorrectly states the 5000 does not use the two black inks, in fact it uses the same ink tanks with 2 blacks(BCI-3eBK/6BK), just like the 4000."},{"rating":"2","title":"The prints are so good from this printer, I'm selling them!","review":"I wanted to start a business selling dog greeting cards, and was looking for a photo printer so I could do my own printing.

After a lot of reasearch, I bought this printer and COULD NOT BE HAPPIER! The print quality is outstanding, better that what we would expect from the photo lab. It's fast, quiet, and sets up easier. The software included with the printer is easy to use and works very well - options to print flexibly abound, particularly within the print driver itself (an under-rated feature that enables you to get exactly the print you need for a particular task). Downside: no printer cable! All told, I can't recommend this item more highly - and for the price, it's a real bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I bought this printer about a year ago. It worked fabulous at first, great quality. But after about 2 months, the printhead clogged and I've had nothing but problems since. The blue ink continuously clogs. I end up spending hours trying to get it going just to print 1 photo. I contacted canon and they sent me a new printhead as it was still under warranty only to have the same thing happen. Worked great for a couple months and nothing but problems since. I will go back to my HP for all of my printing needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE AWARE: Disappointing unless you use Canon photo paper.","review":"I bought this printer based on very little research (read the reviews here and heard that Canon printers \\"use less ink\\"). The problem is that this printer works, but if you don't use Canon brand photo paper the results are TERRIBLE. Please see my scanned printout in the customer images section above. Other than that it works fine for text printing and also does decent (not amazing) photos if you use Canon paper. It's also pretty loud and pretty big. I had a Canon i960 before and I'd say that printer prints just as well as this one, is cheaper and quieter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Print, Poor Quality","review":"Purchased in November 2005 which makes it less than 16 months old. Was getting orange error code lite that blinked 14 times, not even in the book. Emailed customer service and they were real nice and provided wrong solution via email but were good enough to provide me with a toll free number that costs 9.95 per chat. On to the internet where I found that the orange lite that blinks 14 times says a problem with paper feed cam sensor. Wrote back to customer service asking if a little compressed air would help and they said try it. They also said they would let me purchase another one at discounted price, big of them.

Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"great start, dissappointing finish","review":"Loved the print quality, speed, cost per page.Now my second one has failed with the same problem as the first (both lasted less than a year).Photos all look green, tried replacing all the ink cartridges.

In the first episode you see Major Sinclair Yates leaving for Ireland as Resident Magistrate with hopes his fiancee will come and join him. The first episode shows the major getting settled in his new home (Shrilane)! The second episode is the funniest in the whole series, it involves Flurry's abnoxious grandmother and horse stealing (by none other than the Major)! All the following episodes are of great enjoyment to any audience and I highly recomend a buy! If you like this one there is a follow-up series called the Irish RM II. BUY IT !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely delightful","review":"\\"The Irish R.M.\\" is surely one of the most delightful shows I have happened across. It relies upon absurdity for humor, instead of the coarseness and crudity that have invaded almost every show on television. However, if you are not able to appreciate British humor...please do not waste your time watching this show. It is utterly delightful, but those who are unaccustomed to British humor may not enjoy it. However, my entire family, from my baby-boomer parents to my 11 year old sister love it, in addition to my college roommate. I really hope that seasons 2 & 3 become available on DVD soon. Peter Bowles is fantastic as the poor R.M., but the audience will probably fall in love with Flurry Knox, the R.M.'s rascally landlord."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining and dramatic comedy","review":"After watching this on PBS Masterpiece theatre, it was a most enjoyable comedy that my whole family enjoyed, and I recommended this series to my friends.Hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely one of my all time favorite series.","review":"It is delightful and worthy of watching over and over and over and over.

Just open the book at any page and start reading. Your jaw will drop. In exceedingly strange English Eckstein talks about such things as the wonders of lobotomy, the origin of the universe, a history of philosophy etc. It makes no sense at all but it is very entertaining on a warped level because the whole thing is presented in such a 'straight' way. It just goes to show what rubbish some publishers will put out under the guise of 'academic' writing. If nothing else read the 'About the Author' blurb written by the author himself. If the book is ever reprinted it would become a cult classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music is stronger than death","review":"One of Zappa's greatest creations, after, of course, \\"Burnt Weeny Sandwich\\".

This album has the only full king king set as far as I know, so that is a must for any zappa fan. Plus a few vocalized songs which can be quite catchy, this album is all fantastic except for one thing. The excerpt from the film on disc 2 is over a half hour long, and truthfully, could have been left off the album. that is the only thing keeping this from being a 5 star album.

In \\"On the Nature of Things\\", Lucretius sought to liberate his fellow Romans from their fear of the gods, and their fear of death. Lucretius argued that the gods are not directly involved in life, and therefore there is no need to appease them; he also argued that death is the end of a human being's body and soul, and therefore there is no point in fearing it.

Primeaux and Mike bring something sacred to a cappella recordings, and I thank them for consenting to send their gifts into the world on CDs.If you are searching for new music to meditate to, or music to offset the effects of road rage on your daily commute, or music to transport you to another (inward) realm, treat yourself to the beautiful harmonious voices of Primeaux and Mike.

She uses excerpts from the hundreds of interviews she conducted throughout the United States while preparing this book to prove her theory. Her stages have catchy labels: Tryout Twenties, Turbulent Thirties, Flourishing Forties, Flaming Fifties, Serene Sixties. Sheehy's attempt to make meaning of the mature years is most likely to become an artifact of its era, unable to cross cultures or time. Her passages depend too heavily on life as it is being lived in the 1990s in the United States of America. With the work of Erikson and Jung on developmental aging already on the book shelf and thoughtful contributions by such as Friedan, Schacter-Shalomi and Miller, and others, Sheehy's contribution is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mapping this book against time","review":"Conceptually excellent, but a dismally dreary read.Ever been at a cocktail party where you meet someone who tells an interesting story, but takes half an hour to do it, because of all the needless peripheral information.

The heroine has nothing to offer the reader. She's just plain annoying. The premises for the book was ok to say the least, I just don't know what happened to the book it was just plain boring.

The \\"mystery\\" of Gareth's parentage wasn't much, I guessed it immediately, but that didn't affect my enjoyment of the book at all. I enjoyed the ending as much as the rest of the book.

It touches on some emotional issues, such as Hyacinth expressing how she feels about being raised without knowning her father, which serves as the opposite to Gareth's experiences with his father. I thought the first half of the book was really excellent, but the second half fell short of my expectations. I think the plot searching for the jewels was really weak. While there are cameo's by brothers Gregory and Anthony, I was disappointed at the lack of family interaction in this book. Which given the character of Gareth, I though that the family interaction was an important element.Overall, the book was a fun and quick read. I did love that this book really seemed to stay true to who Hyacinth was in the previous books. And I loved the appearance of Lady Danbury in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"With each book I get a bit more disappointed. The first couple in this series -- esp.

With the drinkable stuff I had, I knew I had the real root when my mouth became numb. About thirty minutes later, I legitimately felt as if I had smoked a small amount of marijuana. Other people's reviews tend to say quite the opposite of my experience, so I don't want to say that Kava root has no effect, because it does. It is like a legal drug, and it's effects are great.

The unicorn that comes along with it isn't really worth a poo but I bought it for its portability and cute design, not the little plastic unicorn. My daughter plays with it for hours and actually uses her Rapunzel figurines and strawberry shortcakes figurines with it. Its a great little toy from imaginative playing.

The unicorn is of poor quality and design. It is posed with its head looking back over its shoulder and the head is not moveable. The legs look like half a leg to a 4 year old... as they are one sided and hollowed out on the side facing inward. She asked if I would turn its head around... which is not possible.

They would stop working in the rain and would work intermittently for several days after getting rained on. It was very frustrating for me. Additionally, they were unreliable in temperatures below 30F.I've since replaced these computers with a similarly priced computer by PlanetBike.I strongly recommend against purchasing the Cateye Strada.

Last week, the odometer said 8.90 miles; this week it said 9.3 miles. There were some \\"zeroed out\\" times last week, I guess I just didn't realize how much.I don't look down at it that often, but it is disconcerting to be going 15 mph one moment and zero the next - at least according to the speedometer.Today, it cut out again. 10.24 miles out. 10.08 back on the same route. I know it cut out on the way back; it might have cut out on the way out as well.The route time was off as well...Updated 8/7/11: Same route, this time it was 20.52 miles roundtrip, compared to 20.32 last week.Time to look for a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and good value for the money","review":"It is my 2nd cateye cycling computer.

It has all of your basic functions, including settings for two different bikes. It was fairly simple to install, and the single push-button design is easily usable when you're barreling down the side of the road, trying not to get squashed by an 18-wheeler. On this model, you can actually see the screen when wearing polarized sunglasses, a plus that many other computers can't claim.

It is packed full of things he needs to learn but which I don't have the time to explain. I later bought a copy for myself as I taught a writing course for high school students this summer. It was not particularly conducive to a classroom environment but is better suited to personal use. It will serve the beginning writer well and will be very useful to the more experienced \\"serious\\" (determined, disciplined) writer, too.

I would definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much of a Mystery","review":"This is a trivial little domestic mystery, part of a series by the same author, set in the fictional Washington State town of Alpine. Although the author depicts the climate and scenery well enough, the characters are stock and the story generates no great suspense. A nasty lady appears in town and begins self-publishing a newsletter that attacks the editor of the town's only paper, the Alpine Advocate, a gal named Emma Lord. Then the newsletter lady is found dead in her hot tub and...the story meanders on til Emma solves the murder. Annoyingly, the author makes her \\"heroine\\" an allegedly practicing Catholic, who goes to Mass after eating a hearty breakfast, and who has an out-of-wedlock child from her long-ago relationship with a married man. But she has the nerve to sneer at women who terminate their pregnancies as somehow being manipulated by the \\"nine old men\\" on the Supreme Court who legalized abortion! Sheesh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good so far","review":"I purchased this book,along with Sue Grafton's latest. I started this one and am enjoying immensely.

Basically you're left to pick apart the samples on the CD, which are irrelevant and out of date. I was very disappointed with it. There was no meat, and a lot of superficial content just pasted together. I guess a good title, thick pages, a CD and a $49 retail price tag means you can sell anything off a bookshelf.

In this case the .dir files (version 4 no less)that are on the CD are a prime example. I too went to the authors site and agree that even after all this time that he did not bother to post the necessary bug fixes. I am concerned that the other viewers have not tried to use the programs on the CD before writing their reviews.

These performances are appropriately exuberant, but the ensemble is scrappy and recording is coarse, and overall it lacks the perceptiveness that so characterised Reiner's legendary recording. Moreover, it is short measure: missing is the \\"Roman Fountains\\" to complete the trilogy. Ironically the most musical of the three, Bernstein never got around to recording it. Without any sort of fill-up, this is very uncompetitive in a crowded field. Even Karajan's account, which includes Fountains but omits the Roman Festivals, includes a suite from Respighi's \\"Ancient Airs and Dances\\" as a makeweight. Reiner is in a class of his own, but Muti (in Philadelphia), Ozawa (in Boston), Toscanini's pioneering NBC account and Gatti (with the Orchestra of St. Cecilia) are to be preferred to Bernstein's account."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money as a reference book.","review":"A major disappointment for the serious kennel builder. Its only merit, perhaps, is as a starting point for further research in kennel design and management. It has very, very few useful tips or practical advice a kennel builder needs to make educated decisions when constructing or modifying a kennel. Management suggestions are simplistic at best and leave the reader with more questions than answers. Provides almost no advice in the most practical and crucial areas such as what kinds of paint and construction materials are best suited for kennels, or how to effectively heat and cool, structure a drainage system, etc. Although there are less than a handful of books on this subject, steer clear or consider this book a starting point for more research.

He identifies three distinct phases according to subsidiary, complementary, and central importance of wrathful deities in images made for and by practitioners. In a few cases South Asian images are cross-referenced with comparable examples from the western Himalaya, Tibet, and China, and Sanskrit and Tibetan texts are joined by select Chinese translations to stage a mutually informative dialogue between text and image.Ruthless Compassion offers a visual history of esoteric Buddhism centered on the changing representations of the wrathful deity.

For example, the author gives statistics on Northern information, but then claims that Southern statistics are unavailable, or missing, or, I suppose, lost to history, which is utter nonsense. The battles are mostly referred to by their Northern names (ex. Bull Run for Manassas), which as a Southerner (I was born in Va, moved back here in 2004, and was raised in Alabama) I find mildly offensive.

After reading suggestions from others for a good surface for candy making, I used it to make chocolate candies. Rather than them just lifting or sliding off, I actually had to peel the candies off the sheet by lifting up and curling the mat. When I ran out of space on the Silpat, I resorted to wax paper and wish I would have saved my money by using that alone, as the candies lifted off of that with ease.Given that this is primarily for baking, I'm still giving it a decent rating, as it does perform well in that regard. It also fits PERFECTLY in the Nordic Ware Bakers Half Sheet, 13 by 18 by 1 Inch pan that I also ordered, so if you're looking for a good cookie pan match, get that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will never go back to foil on a cookie sheet!!","review":"When I received this product I didn't know what to think.

I definitely plan to purchase this item as a stocking stuffer this Christmas (4 for 3 offer, oh yea!!) and spread the word that the Silpat baking mat should be a staple in all kitchens!!The only downside I have found is that the mat has slowly lost its original color due to stains from the food placed on the mat."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!!!","review":"This is so great for baking.

Seems to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demarle Silpat 11-3/4-by-8-1/4-Inch Nonstick Silicone Baking Mat","review":"I like it but it is too small to bake any cookies for the family of 5. I regret to buy such small size of the mat. So I have never used it yet but I will buy a bigger one in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silpat","review":"Nice silicon pad fits perfectly inside my half size cookie sheet. Now I don't have to use oil or grease to keep things from sticking. This also helps prevent burnt bottoms since it absorbs some of the heat and disperses it evenly. It's pretty and it's made in France as it proudly states on the bottom edge so what more could you want? This is the best known of the silicon pads out there. It's sort of a status item for the kitchen. It's thick and substantial and goes in the dishwasher if you want it to. I'm very pleased with this and will be ordering a second one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kitchen Must-Have","review":"The only problem I have with this item is that I only bought one! The Silpat really is great. It makes great cookies, doesn't stick and is a quick cleanup. I made a gluten-free cookie recipe and they spread out really bad on the mat, but my dough was also a little too liquid. I don't know if it was a combo of my mistake + the mat or just me. But everything else I've ever baked on it has come out perfect. Sticky biscuits work great as well as any type of cookie. Will try macarons in it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works great.","review":"It works really well. I baked Almond Crisp on it the first time, and it didn't stick on it.

I saw them on all of the cooking shows but just didn't think that I needed it. Well, for $19.99 (cheaper than anywhere else) What was I waiting for??? This nonstick sheet made my cookies crunchy on the bottom and soft on top. The clean-up was as simple as rinse with warm water and soap! When it arrived at my office, everyone who saw it said \\"I have one and it's great!\\". One of my co-workers said, \\"I have a few!

I use it to roll out biscuits and pie crusts and to knead dough. I use it to bake cookies and pastries and even chicken, fish and pork. Every time the food comes out cooked to perfection with no stuck on mess. For a busy mom this is a real time saving device. It cuts my clean up time in half, because I dont't have to scrub stuck on pans or clean off counters that have been covered in flour, dough, etc when I am baking. Just a quick wash with a cloth and very hot water and it's as good as new. This is now on my list of go to gifts for the women in my family. I know they will be as thrilled as I am with how great the Silpat works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for All Types of Baking!","review":"I received this as a wedding present and I fell in love with it!

Great versatile kitchen utensil that takes up very little space. A must have for the cookie maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional Tool great for home!","review":"As a professional chef in a very busy hotel, I find myself using this product more often than reaching for a can of PAM - if not for the solitary reason that it lasts and lasts through hundreds of cycles in and out of convection and conventional ovens - and never needs more than a wipe with a damp cloth!

It makes it so much easier to knead and roll the dough because it doesn't stick to the surface. And when I'm ready to bake I quickly rinse off the mat, stick in the pan, stick the loaf on top and it comes out of the oven crisp and ready to go on all sides. And it slides off the mat easily, even if its a sticky cinnamon bread or along those lines. A must have for any baker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"My wife loves this mat.

I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE PRODUCT BECAUSE I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO USE IT BUT WOULDN'T BUY IT AGAIN. I'M WRITING THIS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT OR WANT TO PURCHASE IT. BE CAREFUL IF YOU USE IT. I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD CATCH ON FIRE. IF YOU ARE BAKING, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE IT UNATTENDED.

Maybe it is great for baking, but please be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. Interferes with the process.","review":"I was given a pair of these a couple years ago and... I've got to say I don't see why people like them. I've been an avid baker for a couple decades and these just interfere with the process terribly. They insulate SO well, that the bottoms don't cook sufficiently without adjusting your procedure.I see positively zero advantage over a non stick cookie sheet.It's definitely a neat material and I'm sure I'll find some use for them.But it's not going to involve the oven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low temperature only!","review":"Don't exceed 300-350deg or you will get plumes of smoke that will burn your eyes and throat.Or use it as a fog machine - seriously there is that much smoke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing sticks!","review":"This thing is great for any items that you don't want to stick. Seriously, you can burn cheese on this thing and it'll peel right off.The only complaint I have is that after a couple of years, the edges on it have started to flake a little but, and I keep having to trim it to prevent any of the fiberglass weave from breaking off into food.I'm pretty careful with it, making sure to only roll it or lay it flat, it's never been creased or folded - but it is starting to show signs of wear. I guess they're not that expensive so I should probably just replace it, but it's got so many good memories!A great addition to any cook at any level. You don't know what you're missing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saves so much time and effort!","review":"This baking mat is so convenient - it is completely non-stick and cleanup is a breeze.

The quality of the silicone is not like other silicone products I've seen. It is very thin. I sent it back and ordered the Silpat baking mat instead, which is what I should've ordered to begin with. Don't waste your money on this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great kitchen tool for the frequent baker","review":"I love to bake cookies. In the past, it meant that I got out my favorite cookie sheet and used it over and over until I had baked the entire batch of cookies. Well, the last two sheets of cookies were not as nice as the earlier ones. Crumbs stuck to the sheet, cookies began to stick to where their earlier siblings had been, and some cookie residue began to blacken. But no more!With the silpat, I can still use my favorite cookie sheet and make sheet after sheet of perfect cookies with no wear and tear on my pan. Each sheet of cookies looks as good as the first.With simply wiping down the sheet after use, cleanup is definitely a snap.I have also used this for bread, foccacia, and rolls...each with the same uniform results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has its endearing qualities, but.....","review":"I can only go to 2 stars for this. Cookies baked on a Silpat spread out too much and turn out too thin and with edges that are hard. I tried several different varieties thinking perhaps it was just the type of dough, but had the same result for all types. For cookie baking, I am sticking with my Airbake sheets. On the positive side, Silpat performed beautifully when I made glazed almonds, which have a very gooey sticky coating that gets baked on. They didn't burn or stick, and the Silpat sheet cleaned up nicely as promised with only warm water. Since I bought this in hopes of baking phenomenal cookies, I don't think the expense was justified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!! Stay away!!!!","review":"I bought these after seeing many good reviews on them. I did notice a couple bad reviews saying that the mat starts smoking the second you use it, and that unfortunately is true. I put it in the oven, at a temperature well within the guidelines, and after a couple minutes, I walked into my kitchen to smell a burning chemical. I opened my oven, and there was the mat with my pizza on it, just billowing (probably toxic) smoke. I have sent it back for a refund, and unless you want a nice \\"smoke maker\\" I would most definitely stay away from this cooking mat, all it's good for is smelling up your house and ruining your food :(. I am surprised Amazon still sells this, and I wish I could give it 0 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delighted Customer","review":"The Silpat is wonderful!

It will only cover maybe 1/2 of a regulare size cookie sheet lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm one of the few non-fans","review":"I am one of the few people that doesn't think Silpat is the best thing ever. I love homemade cookies and I think the Silpat ruins the texture of a perfect cookie -- crispy edges with a soft center. When I used my Silpat, I found that the very edge of my cookies were crisp, but that's it. In fact it almost makes the bottom undercooked with a hard ring around the edge.I did a comparison and cooked a batch of cookies (sugar-butter cookies) traditionally on parchment paper and then one on the Silpat. I liked the traditional method better so I no longer use mine for baking. I still need to give it a try with other things. It does make sense for candies, but I've yet to try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have item!","review":"Since I bought this Silpat Non-Stick Mat, my baked goods come out perfect.

A little pricey, but a life long item of excellent quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excited to use!","review":"I've been eye-balling these for years and finally got a pair. I got the half sheet size to go in my NordicWare pans. They fit PERFECTLY to the edge. There is no wrapping up the sides or buckling, and if I get a cookie too close to the edge, the bottom is covered without worry. They have a good, sturdy weight to them, and I look forward to baking with them soon.*Having used these several times now, I do have to say that I love them. I'm not sure if it's just my oven (which is completely likely) or if the liners require the addition of a few minutes of cook time, but they work wonderfully. I like how easy they are to clean and that even the gooey cookies never stick. I definitely recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as advertised","review":"Works beautifully for rolling out dough. Be sure to use the proper side, however. I made the mistake of using the underside at first. A nice big size for all kinds of uses.

I don't have any problems reading the display except at night (but I rarely ride my bike at night).I'm only giving it 4 stars because the brackets for holding the computer and sensor seem a little cheap.

The contents proved to be everything but--pages of poorly-and annoyingly--written filler on why we're so consumed by consuming. After slogging through this wasteland of non-information, I gave up and turned with hope to the last chapter, the one that's supposed to offer advice. It does, but it's pathetically shallow and self-evident. Readers, the first step in dematerializing is to not waste money on this book. The next step is to gather your thoughts and come up with your own way to dematerialize. I guarantee you'll do a much better job than Hammerslough. And it won't cost you a penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversimplified and Superficial","review":"Although I had high hopes for this book, I was disappointed by Hammerslough's mediocre analysis of consumerism in America.

I have never worn socks with them so I can't report on how that works. The major pro is the toe protection.

Even though you can cinch the upper and the shoe is secure on your foot, you can't cinch it up so your foot can't slide sideways inside it.

At the conclusion of the trip the stitching on the back strap of the shoes had come undone and was very loose. Not something I would expect for a shoe in this price range.

Backcountry credited the return, but did not notify me that they received/processed the exchange. When I called to ask if the larger size was on the way, they said since it was purchased through Amazon they would not pay the shipping on the way back.

By the look of them you'd think they were well made and rugged... and the soles are, the upper however is not.The nylon webbing that looks as though it crosses at the ankle to provide strength actually stops just under the fake suede and spandex and is only held on by those 2 rows of thread. Because of this my pair lasted less than a week of mixed use on a boat and on land walking 5 miles at most before the heal webbing tore off.If the webbing actually met and crossed in the ankle they'd be perfect, unfortunately they chose not to do that. I'd call this a design flaw but it was clearly done on purpose though I can't imagine saving 1 inch of nylon webbing would make or break the cost of the Sandals.At least the return policy is great, there was absolutely no problem getting my money back, customer service was wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"the only shoes I buy","review":"Shoes are not an easy item for me to purchase.

Especially important around front of arms. This means extra effort = extra time.

There are some interesting aspects including the development of new ballet steps, costume design changes, and gender roles. Many many famous dancers/dance makers are mentioned in the book, and their contributions. I was surprised to see excerpts of writings of famous dancers/dance makers in the book - something I would be interested in.

Now I don't trust amazon to give me the right order or the carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite \\"Young Person's Guide\\"","review":"While it's true that Bernstein's narration is sometimes awkward, I find even the awkwardness appealing - it's like listening to your childless uncle who doesn't know how to talk to kids. \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" brings back childhood memories of acting out the piece with my cousins; the wolf's theme still sounds pleasantly scarey to me. But over the years my favorite piece on this album has become \\"A Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra,\\" which is narrated not by Bernstein but by a young boy. His clear, simple speaking style is perfect, and nicely paced. By the way, this CD is essentially the same as \\"Bernstein's Favorites - Children's Classics.\\" The cover art is less cutesy, and the music has been digitally remastered - but on my modest CD player the difference isn't noticeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music, but slightly annoying naration","review":"I love the three works that are on this CD, and I must say that the music is wonderful and very enjoyable. However, I was rather disappointed to find the narration on this CD. I plan to use this CD for music education purposes, and while in some situations the commentary will be useful, there are certain activities that will not be practical with all the interruptions of the music. While I would wholeheartedly recommend this for the musical content, I would be sure the people knew about the narration so they could decide whether or not that would bother them enough to choose a different CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"grating narration","review":"The music is wonderful, of course. But Bernstein's narration is grating. I can't explain why his voice here seems arrogant, overbearing -- more concerned with his own image as a maestro than with creating a magic world for children. I long for the old Boris Karloff narration we had in my house when I was a kid. I'm going to check out David Bowie's some day soon and see if I like it better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The People's Conductor\\"","review":"Mr. Bernstein was a very personable conductor.

Stephen King turns in a wonderful short story (Which is why he is the king of horror) but most of the others tend to sound as if they are trying to write some sort of high brow kind of horror story.

Kitty did not like the syringe but did very well with a tiny nursing bottle and greedily drank down an ounce or so 4 to 5 times a day. I did try the powdered form but the kitten didn't care for it so we stuck with canned.

She wouldn't touch it! I was surprised because both my cats like to lick the milk out of my cereal bowl when I am done. I asked my Vet what the major difference was between cat milk and people milk, she said they are basically the same but cats milk has taurine added to it, a nutrient that cats need more of. The vet recommended to give the cat regular milk and a taurine supplement if she would eat that. Luckily, after second force feeding she started eating again so I didn't need to go that route. My Vet said that cat milk is way over priced for what you get. This can is also very large and you have to use it very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best paper tray out there...","review":"The plastic attachments that enable stacking the shelves were very hard to put on.I kept them near the heating vent for a minute hoping they would expand and make it easier to pop on.I bought two of these trays and one of the trays has it's set of plastic stand(?) things badly bent out of shape.

The instructions on how to use your new keyboard (throughout the book) refer to the older style keyboards. There are a few chord pictures in the back and after looking up various ones online (c major for example) the fingering the author suggest and keys are not accurate.

Sounds reasonable, but don't let that fool you; it's one of the most dense, awful examples of \\"postmodernspeak\\" I've ever read. Nichols seems to be improvising, writing beauties like \\"The indexical bond of point-for-point correspondence between photograph and source anchors an iconic sense of typicality . . . and a symbolic layer of connotation and ideology.\\" No self-respecting writer--or writer who respects his readers--would spare that sentence the revision it begs for. Chances are you're a film student if you own a copy. DO NOT let it make you feel stupid. Nichols hides his ideas in such Byzantine prose so you can't identify them.

I really haven't listened much to Zappa, so maybe some of the other reviews would be more helpful. All I know is that my grandmother has a synthesizer that plays a demo version of Billy Joel's \\"Just The Way You Are,\\" and it sounds better than this.

Why would anyone record music they like with the timbre of a music box throughout??!?If you want a serious introduction to the TRUE GENIUS that Frank Zappa was, try The Grand Wazoo or One Size Fits All.

The fish seem to love it. My cichlids are colorful and vibrant but it is hard to say which food should get the credit. I do have problems with it disintegrating even in the jar and so instead of all big flakes it comes out with a lot of tiny, borderline powdery pieces. I have found the best thing to do is not put your fingers our anything else in the jar but to very gently poor out flakes into my hand. The flakes are still very fragile but I get less of the super tiny flakes this way. The Tetra flakes I used in the past were stronger, but I think this is a better food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stinky Funk Jamz and Some Polish, Too!","review":"This is the first FZ album I heard, and after 3 listens, I was hooked. The open-jams \\"Willie the Pimp\\" and \\"Gumbo Variations\\" are sweet grooving sweat-sessions. And this album has smooth polished compositions \\"Peaches\\" and \\"Little Umbrellas\\" and \\"It Must Be A Camel\\" making this a well-rounded album for those unfamiliar with the established genius of Frank Zappa.That's Captain Beefheart singing on \\"Willie the Pimp\\" and that's Shugie Otis playing bass on \\"Peaches.\\"After this album, you might check out \\"Apostrophe\\" and \\"Overnight Sensation.\\" Especially if you can get them both on one disk (look around this bargain)!Now, repeat after me...\\"I'm a little pimp with my hair gassed backPair a khaki pants with my shoe shined black..\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest FZ album ever","review":"This is a great CD I recomend it to anyone who likes jazz/rock fusion.

This was a time when it seemed to be fashionable or hip to be \\"into\\" Frank Zappa rather than because it was realistically good music-which it was not, in my opinion. Again, this was Frank Zappa bamboozling legions of fans into feeling that his extraneous music signified something strangely alluring was happening. Unfortunately, for me, his opus proved only to be what amounted to being a musical auditory illusion. He reminds me of another abysmally untalented \\"artist\\" named Andy Warhol, who had many of New York's gullible elite believing that there was something wonderfully artistic about a picture of a Campbell's Soup can. In fact, Frank Zappa should be remebered as the Andy Warhol of the music world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect introduction to Zappa: His best","review":"If you're Zappa-curious, start with this one. Of the dozen or so Zappa/Mothers albums in my collection, this is my favorite. \\"Willie the Pimp\\" is the only track with vocals (and perhaps the least accessible to the uninitiated, but you'll learn to love it too). \\"Peaches En Regalia\\" is a classic for the ages. \\"It Must Be A Camel\\" starts out clever, then sails off into glory. A solid album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The albums which changed my life, are few...this is a good 1","review":"I could vascilate and wax poetic about this album all day. Peaches is a masterpiece, Zappa's heavy solos one 'willie the pimp' on 'son of mr green jeans' made me become serious about being a musician and guitarist. 'Gumbo Variations' is a bit long, but is very focused throughout its 17 minutes, a skill frank had in spades. 'little umbrellas' is proof that to frank jazz (the ever impossible form to crack) was just that, a form. And 'it must be a camel' dips into the fusion which would mark the next two albums, \\"Waka Jawaka\\" and \\"Grand Wazoo.\\" This album is a masterpiece of intellegent psychadelia, jazz, rock, blues...its all here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I see almost no point","review":"in praising this record to the skies, everyone else has beaten me to it. Upon talking to or reading Zappa fans like the ones here, youll note near unanimity in the sentiment that this was a brilliant record. Six songs, one with lyrics, not sung by Zappa.

Budget constraints aside, I found the acting to be downright awful. In one scene, a character is shot in the head. Watch her fight to keep a straight face. Nothing sucks the believability out of a flick quite like someone who can't commit to a role. I got the impression that the audition process went something like, \\"Hey, I'm making a movie! Want to be in it?\\" \\"Yeah!\\" \\"Great, you're hired!\\" Also, there were moments where the story seemed like it'd be promising, but it was hard to follow the plot due to poor audio.Like all other low-budget films, this one carries the same characteristics: so-so makeup, pacing problems and iffy lighting. Please consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't need the bracket or the pipe!!!","review":"Why don't they just sell the check valve by itself? That's all I needed to replace.

The holder that comes with the unit is great, but that's about it. The water turned a little brown, but brown dirt was still in the grooves of the watchband.This cleaner is not powerful enough for real dirt.

However, our second time out to the park yesterday, the stop button broke and let the leash extend to maximum... thank goodness we weren't anywhere near traffic.Honestly, with less than 2 hours of use by a 20 lb. dog before failure, I'd hate to imagine what would happen if you used this on a larger dog.

Same for the feet although they are larger and harder to lose."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cure for the BS politicaly correct post-modern uptights that can't take a joke!","review":"I recommend this album as a FZ self-help for the over-the-top self-righteous evangelical types in the crowd. A cure for ultra-left fundamentalism or perhaps fodder for pissing em off. In any event, this \\"off Broadway\\" audio musical is just the medicine for all of the politically correct people who just can't seem to loosen up, at laugh at themselves for the silly MF's that they are! Anyone acquainted with Frank Zappa's various musical styles will appreciate this album for the juxtaposition of moral values in this play's altered reality that oddly enough parallels today's post-modern society. An album ahead of it's time, and a relevant reminder that often it is the better part of valor to simply bow to the absurd, and enjoy the moment. A definite must have for the ardent FZ fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heard it a hundred times. A personal favorite.","review":"Please everyone, listen to an album more than once before you write your reviews. Maybe, just maybe, when I have listened to 'Make a Jazz Noise Here', 'Jazz from Hell', or 'Roxy and Elsewhere' 150 times or more, I might love them as much as I love 'Thing Fish' and 'Joe's Garage'.This is a great story. It is satirical and sarcastic. Complete with subtle and not so subtle messages. Perfect Zappa form. If you can't laugh at this, you take yourself way too seriously. Lighten up. Mr. Zappa was an equal-opportunity offender. He made fun of the government, whites, blacks, catholics, christians, jews, italians, the rich, the poor, and people in general. He went a long way to remind us that words are just words, and people are ultimately defined by their actions, not their intentions.By the way, don't miss Steve Vai on guitar, Chad Wackerman on drums, and the fantastic vocals of Napolean Murphy Brock."},{"rating":"2","title":"It disturbsme to see this fine album criticized by FZ fans","review":"Yes most of the songs are remakes, but that is true of all of zappa's work; they have evolved to a point of perfection and been rendered into a poignant story in this album.From my experience the people who do not like Thingfish are the people who do not \\"get\\" it. In this case \\"it\\" is satire, and most people seem to be unable to grasp the subtlety of satire, or often lack the knowledge-base to understand more sophisticated satire.If you laugh at dark comedies such as Black Adder, you may like this if you are not overly offended by the content - if not, then not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Ridiculous","review":"Not among Zappa's finest, this is an album that can test your loyalty. Some might say that Frank jumped the (yellow) shark with this release. He never really did anything this ambitious or strange again... okay, sorry. Civilization Phase III.But that was different. It was a continuation of the Lumpy Gravy thing. This album is uh... a Broadway musical, I guess. It's all right. It's fun to listen to, it's never boring, I'll give it that! Don't buy this first or uh... yeah."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rather boring double CD by Zappa, I'm afraid","review":"It's tough when your admired musical idol puts out something that you don't like, no matter how much you give it a try. The Thing-Fish concept may be great but it doesn't help much since the music just doesn't grab me. A couple of the songs are pretty cool but most of them feel like bleek versions of previously released ones. I love the You Are What You Is album but the reworked YAWYI-songs on Thing-Fish are pretty lame. Others aren't even bleek versions, rather low budget filler material that certainly do not keep up with regular Zappa standards. No wonder that many music lovers stopped listening to his music after such releases as Thing-Fish, The Man From Utopia and FZ Meets The Mothers Of Prevention. But I'm glad he came back for a last glorius tour in '88 and the YCDTOSA CD series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zappa meets Firesign Theatre but he didn't get the drift","review":"This isn't one of Zappa's better efforts. It's \\"obnoxious\\" rather than funny--and the music isn't that great, either. Zappa hit a lot more than he missed, and even this is worth a listen or two. It sounds like a Firesign Theatre reject, which is what Zappa should have done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thing-Fish - There is none higher.","review":"I still remember this album as one of the all-time greats from my college days. A dude came back to the dorms with this CD in 1986 when I was a freshman in school and I was simply blown away. I had a couple of stray Zappa tapes I had scored but I wasn't a hard core fan. This Zappa album is addictive, and I still have trouble trying to stop listening to it. We would play it at parties at about 3:00 a.m. to clear away all the human detritus but the most truly hard core.Definitely not your run of the mill stuff. This is musical art at its highest form. Truly amazing stuff. That said, this album has the ability to offend your mother, sister, wife, you name it. Maybe that's why a lot of guys like it. I can't help but try and imitate Ike Willis. His voice is truly astounding on the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am very familiar with all of Zappa's recorded works, and I love satire, humor and strong material. I find this album to be very boring. The ideas are just not that interesting. It makes me yawn when I listen to it. Frank missed the target here, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thing-Flush","review":"I have been hooked on Frank Zappa for twenty-five years. The man could do nothing wrong, until I received the LP of \\"Thing-Fish as a gift some 15-16 years ago.I felt betrayed by what seemed to me a blatant re-hash of previously recorded material with gratuitously foul lyrics. I had never been disappointed in a Zappa LP, nor have I been disappointed since. I gave the twice-played LP away and never looked back.If you want pure shock-rock, you might like \\"Thing-Fish\\". However, \\"Overnight Sensation\\" and \\"Them or Us\\" are far better examples of Zappa's genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much talking","review":"I bought this cd but i just didn't get it. I am a big fan of the song \\"You are What You Is,\\" but having the rest of the tracks laying around unlistened to was not worth it to me. I sold this cd to a used-music store straight away.If you like \\"You Are What You Is,\\" I recommend buying the Persuasions sing Frank Zappa cd. Great version on that one.I just didn't get the humor in the guy's dialect. There was too much play and sitcom on this cd for me and not enough music."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"This CD isnt dead, it just smells funny\\"","review":"Well,This is the worst of all Zappa albums. A badly mixed re-hash of older recordings, overdubbed with the most inane lyrics and voice-overs. I was absolutely embarassed for Frank, for being in the position to have to release a bogus rip off of a CD. He either was bored, or in need of serious cash, to dump this one out.This Zappa recording, I was NOT in a hurry to let my friends hear, hearing the overtly racist comments about blacks and others. (I do have black friends who love and respect Zappa.)Save your money. Or buy \\"Roxy and Elsewhere,\\" or \\"One Size Fits All.\\" Or Freak Out...if you want prime Zappa.This one isnt dead, it just smells funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, what's the big deal?","review":"As a hard-core Zappa fan, I found this album to be tedious, gratuitous and lacking in just about everything that we hard-core Zappa fans love.Thing-Fish is mainly just a re-hash of re-mixes of older material, which so many of the later albums were. Certainly, his bitingly satirical bent is apparent, but lost in all the pointless scatological and sexually depraved rhetoric.There is nothing wrong with scatological and sexually depraved rhetoric, particularly when it comes from Uncle Frank. But when there's no point to it, what's the point?Get Joe's Garage instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dunno how anyone could justify giving this nasty poo more than a star","review":"comes off like a joke on the listener.

Gould makes incredibly cogent arguments as to the fallacies in logic made by IQ testers and those that tried to brand criminals with race or apperances.He is very verbose, but the beautiful language, and multipel tangents, just add to the reader's knowledge, and impress on the read the author's immense authority of the subject at hand.Admittedly, Gould loses the general reader in the chapter on Factor Analysis, but the rest of the book is quite accessible to the layman.If you want to know why the Bell Curve blows, and why conservatives are so wrong, read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mismeasurements of Gould","review":"Stephen Gould is an excellent writer and has a great command of language. His books are generally considered well written and are consistently given excellent reviews by the publishing \\"Establishment\\"--in other words, the New York Review of Books. Although Gould excels in his writing, he is severely deficient in logic and science. The theme of his book is that the science of racial mental ability is flawed due to prejudices and mistakes of scientists of the past. He devotes a large portion of his book to describing the flawed science of 19th century scientists who tried to prove racial supierority of whites over other races and whose science was flawed due to these prejudices. ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mismeasure of Man","review":"This is a great book and I use it as a textbook in my classes at the university. It is really a refute of the Bell Curve and Gould does a great job in presenting the historical facts that make us question the pervasive uses of IQ testing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shows how an articulate person can make rubbish convincing","review":"This book is a perfect example of how anything can be made to sound convincing by a writer that is good enough. Gould uses a lot of smoke and mirrors to obscure his essentially political argument and present it as scientifically valid when it plainly isn't, whatever so many of the readers here represented may think.The techniques of IQ testing that he criticizes have not been used for many years. He is recycling old material. There are many, many studies that show there are real, and therefore measurable, differences in people's intellectual capacity - and why would that be controversial? You meet smart and dumb people every day. Modern IQ tesing is not perfect but it is improving, it is at least based on scientific method and it can prove its results - something that Gould cannot.Gould's book is reassuring to people who want to have their own preconceptions confirmed, but it's certainly not good science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to read this again.","review":"This book exposes the absurdly biased studies of scientists attempting to prove that white people are the superior race. Most of it focuses the 19th and early 20th century, but it also has a good critique of \\"The Bell Curve\\" and the concept of g. I think that every scientist should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numbers, statistics, and more numbers!","review":"This book is great for people that love numbers and statistical analysis. Personally, I felt at times overwhelmed whith their abundance and almost missed the point of the whole book. The author does make some interesting and enlightening points about the fallacies of craniometry and intelligence testing. A great book to read if you want a dense, complete summary of anthropological and psychological thinking past and present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Psychologist","review":"Gould is not a psychologist, nor does he understand statistics.The authors of the particular statistical tests he writes about discredited those approaches long ago see Jensen's g-factor for a detailed explaination and history. The book is still somewhat historically interesting but psychometrically meaningless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous rubbish!","review":"This book is dangerous because it pretends to be science while it is really not. It confuses the history of racism with scientific investigations into different peoples. It is just the sort of thing that gave political correctness a bad name."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye-Opener for Everyone","review":"Yale University's Stephen Jay Gould de-bunks the entire standardized testing industry as he reviews the history of intelligence testing and removes the credibility of the IQ test. It is not difficult to conclude from this eminently readable book that standardized tests are given because they produce numbers that are PRESUMED to have meaning, and because it's easy. It also feeds a money-hungry testing industry, but it hurts all kids and all schools. This is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Required to read","review":"Not worth reading for leisure. This was a required read for an Evolutionary Biology Readings course, and this was the least useful of all of them.It feels like the author is yelling at you throughout the book. Gould seems extremely biased.It is worthwhile to read if you need alternate views on intelligence testing or the bell curve, but the mathematics the author puts such emphasis on seems to just criticize.Take a statistics course, it is much more useful than this book and much more worth the money.Gould must have some sort of vendetta that his never-ending introduction puts you in an angry state about science before you get to the actual science in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest","review":"Gould is a talented writer but not a scientifically impartial one. This book has more factual errors per page than any book I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the soft-minded","review":"Noticing that a book was on the market that rehashed the same, tired old 1960's idocy that there is \\"no difference\\" between races (subspecies) of homo sapiens, my ever-so-PC liberal arts college gobbled up copies of this book and distributed them as required reading for evolutionary psychology classes. Overall, this book was a big waste of time and contributed NOTHING to what is otherwise a fine field of study. Simple, regressive logic such as \\"just because some 19th century racists drew exaggerated pictures of blacks to make them look like apes\\" this means there are no differences between subspecies of human beings that evolved in isolated environments over 100,000's of years. Pure nonsense and totally worthless; not \\"scholarly\\" at all but rather an amateur foray into \\"science\\" for the feminist/ultra-left crowds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Claims Greater than What it Actually Shows","review":"Yes, this is good history of bigotry justifying itself with \\"science\\". However, if you've ever had an older brother, and he's justified himself in not trusting you by throwing up to you something that you did many years ago- say, you're twenty-five, and you want to borrow your brother's Corvette, and he tells you, \\"No; after all, I recall perfectly well how you broke Mama's favorite vase when you were five, you careless lout!\\", then you'll understand my objections to Stephen Jay Gould's book. He knows not the rules of real logic and fair play. Modern psychometric science has little to do with earlier bigotry. Do we refuse to fly modern airlines because of airplane crashes in 1915? No! This book is unfair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A politically correct travesty of the truth.","review":"This attempt to smear sociobiology with ancient statistics, is as dishonest a book as you can find. Read it twice, the first time it will seem convincing, the second you will see the cheap tricks that are used to push through the politically correct untruths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fighting bias with bias","review":"The truth about this book is one that most of it's admirers won't like. Search if you will for it's reviews from those in the scientific community. It has been largely panned.Gould has style no doubt but this is essentially a gleeful beating of several dead horses. Modern researches in the field of psychometrics have little to fear from this book. Gould takes theories that have long since been discredited and from that asserts that the entire field of psychometrics is invalid. One might discredit nearly every scientific field in this way since all sciences begin with many mistakes. The book is merely an ideologically motivated crusade which doesn't attempt to deal honestly with the most current views in the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scientists Find This Book Very Biased and Inaccurate","review":"Read Page 66-67 in the Jan/Fed 2011 issue of Discover. According to this article, it turns out that the only biased person in regards to their research is Gould, not Morton. The article states that several studies in recent times have shown Morton's measurements were accurate, and any bias in his numbers actually favored Indians and Blacks. Gould's work, on the other hand, is filled with errors and what appears to be intentional misrepresentation of facts. If you want to read some biased social commentary that fits your pre-conceived notions, buy Gould's book. If you want un-biased science and facts, read John Michael's work in Current Anthropology, or Jason Lewis Marc Meyer's work in June 2010 \\"PLoS Biology.\\" They found that Morton's measurements were largely accurate...\\"Morton's errors didn't show a pattern of bias...Gould's did.\\" Gould never even attempted to measure Morton's skulls himself, and even falsified some of Morton's results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Review of institutionalized Prejudice","review":"Dr. Gould goes through how science was made to fit the prevailing stereotypes and \\"scientific theories\\" of the day. Gould discusses how scientists often had to create \\"new theories\\" to support large brain verses small brain, and the correlated \\"ranking\\" of races by the results which were often \\"massaged\\" to match up to the scientific understanding of the day. IQ is also discussed, as well as a rebuttal to The Bell Curve which inspired Gould to write this thought provoking book. Anyone in Science and Public Health should read this book...before formulating theories based on common notions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Axe Grinder","review":"Gould is a very interesting speaker and writer. This work systematically beats the absolute living poop out of the practice of intelligence testing. However, me thinks this brilliant author who is said to have sired a disabled child doth have a very serious axe to grind and may not be giving \\"equal air time\\" to the opposing viewpoint. This book reads more like an all out attack than a pro vs. con treatise. Still, the book is worth reading for anyone who contemplates doing a factor analysis and would like to get some broad perspective on the history of same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Correct but Psychologically Incorrect","review":"It is amazing that an expert in a particular domain of science feels expert outside of their domain. Psychologists have been refining IQ and intelligence for many years now....the current theories are reliable and valid and allow highly accurate prediction....a good test of a theory. But this is not the domain of paleontology. For a good current review of intelligence...get Hans Eysenck's \\"Intelligence:A New Look\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Political correctness disguissed as scientific arguments","review":"Gould has utterly dissapointed me by writing this tabloid about how nature \\"ought to be\\" rather than how nature behaves. He knows little about psychology and statistics while leading the reader into flawed arguments about the differences (or otherwise) of various human races.There is no doubt whatsoever that Gould is pushing a typical social engineering, pseuo-academic, political correct agenda. I feel sorry for science for having individuals such as Gould, who, instead of observing nature and fomulatinng theories about it, jumps into left-wind propaganda of how everyone is and has been wronged and exploted by white, middle-class Europeans.I think that Gould has made a fool of himself with the scientific community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read This!!!!!","review":"The book sucks. I mean, the plot is clever but the author goes nowhere with it. His ideas are mostly either isolated or backed by quotes from slaveowners and greeks. The writing rivals the difficult swallowing of 15th century writing. Please purchase another IQ measuring book such as Freakonomics or The Bell Curve. Something with a distinct voice. Reading this book is like eating a flavorless food--unappealling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Content - Must have PHP reference","review":"This book is a must have reference to PHP programming.

This book takes from you from beginning through intermediate level and it does it very well and very clearly without confusing you with endless options and parameters and permutations of every PHP function. It covers the most usefull and basic fucntions and does a very good job. I have three books on PHP, this is the one I start with to learn a concept because it is quick, clear, and to the point.

Briscoe's overuse of the word \\"drat\\" and its derivatives turned me off so much and the use of proper English was just too much for my limited perceptions of slave life. Slaves certainly couldn't use proper English, could they? Anyway, as I continued to read, Briscoe's characters quickly weaved their way into my heart and mind and I couldn't stop reading. I had to know what was going to happen next and that, to me, is the mark of a good book. The lives of Susie, Clara, and Susan became so fascinating that I left my negativity behind and kept turning the pages.

But after hearing Ms Briscoe talk about the book at a recent booksigning I felt better about picking it up. I truly enjoyed this book. Ms Briscoe wrote about what she thought the thoughts of her great aunts would have been based on family history and research. The dilemna of being free or remaining a servant was well thought out.

It has slightly dated from when it was originally released for starters. We knew how much FZ hated Republicans, but considering that throughout the 1988 tour (and the 2 live albums released thereafter) the satire and sarcasm that was very amusing first time round, it had now become too venomous and full of scorn. The songs taking the p**s out of Jimmy Swaggart were funny for a while, but with every release of the '88 live material, it just became too much. All the scaborous lyric-based songs have the sort of mentality of someone repeating a joke to you thinking that you didn't hear it properly first time around (\\"did you get it? well I'll tell it again!\\").

The two stars are for the beautiful rendition of the jazz standard \\"Stolen Moments\\" and the following \\"Murder By Numbers\\" with Sting on guest vocals.

But once I absorbed all of the lyrics and themes expressed in this album, I recognized it for its brilliance and its humor. It mocks its own \\"freakiness\\" by such asides as \\"Think this'll sell in New York?\\" as it covers themes ranging from reaching out to lonely people to the phoniness of society and its politicians to the dullness of everyday life to underage sex.

Not worth to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto-off does not work","review":"This kettle will not automatically shut off when the water is boiling, and there is a leak under the switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, fast kettle","review":"I've owned this kettle for almost a year now and have had no problems. It has travelled to many cubicles and has still worked perfectly.I heat up a standard 12 oz bottle of water and it boils the water faster than I can get up to get my cup and a bag of tea.Be sure when ordering this product. It is pretty, still shiny after all this time, works perfectly even after a year and is fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great and quick!","review":"This works great and it heats up soooo quickly. Like other reviews, it does leave water on the counter, I think it's steam so if you know this in advance, just keep a towel close by. We used it in our concession stand for the cup of soup ramen noodles and hot chocolate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable","review":"We purchased this water kettle to replace an old plastic version that had stopped shutting off when the water boiled. Like so many others, I wanted to get away from plastic for something we use so often to heat water. Initially it appeared well built and heated water quickly with no impact on the taste of the water. Everything was great. Well, 8 months in, the kettle stopped turning off when the water boiled. Unacceptable. That is the reason for 1 star. There were other minor points of concern. The joint between the plastic base and the metal had started to corrode. I can't say if it would fail but it looked bad. Finally, the highly polished finish shows every mark or smudge. sadly, in less than a year, i purchased another kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electric Kettle","review":"I am using the kettle. The first I purchased failed shutting automatically a few days after purchase. Amazon exchanged it and this one works better but I would not purchase it again. It lets the water boil way too long before it shuts off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"If all you care about is heating water quickly, this is your kettle. It gets to boiling point super fast and is easy to clean. My only gripe is how high the minimum fill point is, a lot more than the average drinking container can hold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after six weeks","review":"After just six weeks, no mishandling, the top broke so that it doesn't stay firmly closed while water is boiling, which means steam escapes and it takes longer. I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made and disappointing","review":"I'd been looking for a new kettle for some time, and had been disappointed with each one I had purchased. This one looked as though it would be different, but when I opened the box, and saw it in person, it was just as cheaply made as the others I'd previously bought. I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised, given the low price. I ended up returning it, and getting a whistling (stove top) Kitchenaid kettle, which I'm very happy with. It looks good, is well-made, and will save me money by not eating up loads of electricity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love!","review":"I've had this kettle for several months now, so I feel I can write a review. Anyone who doesn't like this kettle must have gotten a defective one because... how can you not love this thing? I love that it's cordless, it's an excellent size, it heats quickly, it's convenient. I drink a lot of tea and cider, so I use it very regularly. I've read a complaint that the outside gets too hot, but that's silly. Both the handle and the base are a plastic that stays cool to the touch and OBVIOUSLY metal full of boiling water will be hot. If you're silly enough to touch that part, you kind of earned your burn. I've never touched that part by mistake, it's got ample space to grab and hold it safely. I've never used another model or brand of electric kettle, but I can definitely recommend this one. I have had exactly zero problems with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple and works","review":"I like that it's incredibly easy to use, and it doesn't stand out too much. The only drawback is that it only holds 1.5 liters, which means i have to keep refilling it when I have guests over.However, simply put, it is very fast in boiling water, and material is pretty durable and it is easy to handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more burnt plastic!!","review":"I love this kettle, it's great! It even has a little detachable filter to go over the spout so you can brew tea right in the kettle if you want. Mine did come with a little hole in the filter, but it hasn't seemed to make a difference. The shape does make it a little hard to clean if you do decide to brew in it, but it isn't that bad...I just hate doing dishes! Also, I wish it made a sound when it's done because I always seem to forget about it. All in all, I'm more than pleased...it's a great value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good kettle","review":"Heats water quickly but seems to boil too long before cutting off. (apprx. 15 sec. too long). It make you think it's not going to cut off. I'm used to it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"This is a cheap electric kettle. It is made of steel and it boils water. But you get what you pay for.As many others pointed out, it takes *forever* to shut off. It is spewing steam like a geyser for at least a minute unless it is turned off manually. It is so bad that a kitchen cabinet above started splitting (the kettle does not look like a bargain anymore now that the cabinet needs repairing). Thankfully after less than a year it started leaking so I will gladly replace it. The plastic mesh filter disintegrated some time ago. I can only guess where pieces of it went."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kettle","review":"Bought it 6 months ago and its Still works great, no smell, no scale, no nothing. It might takes a bit longer to heat the water (since day 1) but nothing more than that. I recommend it if you need a simple kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a month","review":"Stopped working after a month. You get what you paid for. Don't buy this item or be prepared to return it after a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kettle for the money","review":"I'm very pleased with this water kettle and definitely got my bang for the buck. Water heated quickly and shut off as promised. I don't get the complaints about not being able to see the water level indicator easily--I guess some of the folks have vision challenges. Attracive and practical and it beats heating up water in microwave or using natural gas-so I believe it is probably an energy saver in the long run..Simple function and attractive design--I would definitely encourage others to purchase this if they are looking for an electric water kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"This kettle works really great. Though it is not so easy to clean. But the design is genius and I just love it for this price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!","review":"This is a great kettle. Heats up very quickly to a rolling boil. Base is heavy enough (but not too heavy) that it stays in place when you pick up the kettle. Handle is comfy and stays cool. Easy to clean. We use it every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent kettle for the $$.","review":"For years we've put off buying a counter top kettle...What were we thinking??? This thing is QUICK and when you compare electric cost to Propane/gas in our part of the country, electric wins. For those who have silicone concerns, the handle is held on by two silicone gaskets. At first we were worried too, but we bake with silicone cookware, so now we're ok with the construction. We are VERY VERY pleased, a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Missed having a whistle to let me know when it's boiling. Otherwise a good and solid kettle. A friend recommended it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good water kettle","review":"it works very well, and l did not find any problem with it. but i did not drink the water at first because there was a strange smell of plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aesthetically Pleasing & Practical","review":"I have been using this kettle at work for about 2 weeks now. The (distilled) water that I boil in it tastes great and it boils water very quickly. The kettle is also pleasing to look at and stows safely underneath my desk away from the prying eyes of ISO safety inspectors.I looked at cheaper kettles but most appeared to have aftertaste issues or were just hideous to look at. The inside of this one is basically pure stainless steel which I think explains why the water tastes great. I haven't needed to clean it yet but it looks to be fairly easy to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased!","review":"I did a lot of research on electric kettles, and read a ton of reviews. Finally settled on this one and it's proven to be great. It REALLY boils the water - initially I thought it wasn't going to switch off on its own, but it did, and has every single time I've used it. It's quick too. Much better than when I had the glass kettles on my gas stove. It's also not loud, and I don't find the switch too \\"flimsy\\" as some reviews mention. But I'm not rough on my stuff, so I just flip it down gently. My only criticism would be the difficulty in seeing the water level because the handle is in the way (hence 4 instead of 5 stars). But it's not a major pain, and I'm glad I bought this kettle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing to complain.","review":"Boils water quickly with little fuss, even has a measuring cup on the side.

The first time worked great, after that, the auto-shut off stopped working. It just kept on boiling and boiling till no end....Very unhappy with the quality. It will cost over $10 to send it back for a replacement, and I don't feel confident that the next one would work either... doesn't seem to worth the trouble. And Amazon does not offer \\"A-Z guarantee\\" on item they sell, only on items other vendor sell on Amazon market place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for multiple hot water beverages!","review":"Works beautifully! After the water is heated, I immediately pour it into a carafe so that it stays nice and hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"mind of its own","review":"Received this as a Christmas gift and as big tea drinkers we were looking forward to the ease of use and speed as promised. Instead we have a device with a mind of its own and for no apparent reason shuts off early, mid way or several times through the boiling cycle. We've read the manual, dried the base and kettle each time, ensured it was on a level sturdy surface and still we have the kettle shut off randomly at various stages in the boiling process - very frustrating.Would never recomend this Aroma Kettle to anyone and only wish we had returned it right away instead of giving it more time for us to figure out the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only last a year and 4 months","review":"My pot didn't work today after not even a year and half. The metal isn't that good a quality and gets funny around the openings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kaput Kettle","review":"Kettle was a disappointment for us. We bought it and were thrilled with it at first. Nice action on the depressing lever and handsome chrome. But it started leaking from we know not where. And then it stopped heating the water entirely after just four months of use. Of course the return window has now closed so we're outta luck. I'd avoid this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, rusts?","review":"I thought I was safe with a product with four stars and over a thousand reviews, but should've paid more attention to negative reviews. Like others, my kettle has started leaking and upon close inspection has 'rusty' spots along the bottom where the stainless steel meets the black plastic. I'm not sure if mine shuts off automatically or not either because I usually flip it off myself (usually like my water not quite boiling). Alas, threw away packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kettle leaks and does not turn off automatically.","review":"I have had the kettle for about a month. Like others who have reviewed this product, I also have found that it does not always turn off when the water reaches boiling, so you cannot leave it unattended.I also have noticed in the past week that it has started leaking. The water is coming out near the switch. If you hold the kettle up, I can see it slowly dripping out of that location.With these problems, I do not recommend this product.I subsequently purchased the Adagio Teas 3 UtiliTEA Variable-Temperature 30-Ounce Electric Kettle and found it to be a much more reliable product. The Aroma has been sent to my local electronics recycler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Taste","review":"We needed a new hot water kettle and found the Aroma on sale. The style was perfect and performance was good, however it gave the water a terrible taste and smell, similar to boiled plastic. I followed the directions for cleaning prior to use, however after 5 full boiling cycles with fresh water each time and 2 cups of wasted coffee I gave up and returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after 6 months","review":"It has been a perfect electric kettle for 6 months (water boils quickly, nice design, suitable volume, visible level of water, automatic shut off), but this is over - it stopped working! Normally an electric kettle serves for 2-3 years. It is frustrating - this is 2nd kettle from Amazon in 1 year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty jolly good","review":"We are pleased with the way this kettle works. Having hot water to make tea without having to run into the kitchen to turn off the kettle on the element is a great thing. The lid is a little flimsy so it will be interesting to see how it lasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Water at Work","review":"So I bought this thinking it would be a great way to heat water for tea at work. I tested it out at home. It takes about 6 minutes, when full, to heat the water to a boil, which is slightly longer than I expected. However, I can get 2-3 cups of tea out of one boil(mind you my cups are larger than 8 ounces). It definitely heats the water thoroughly, almost to the point of being too hot. I also get pure water with no unusual tastes from the tea kettle. Also, it doesn't dribble when I pour the water into my cup.This model is also relatively quiet. It sounds just like boiling water. It doesn't whistle or rattle or make any other noises. This is important to me, since I don't need to alert my whole office that I'm heating water.One downside is the kettle shakes a little bit when the water comes to a boil, which concerns me. So far that hasn't caused a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Shut OFF","review":"I purchased one and it's auto shut off didn't work, needless to say it boiled dry. I purchased a second one and it worked for a couple of weeks. Then once again it wouldn't shut off....I'm two for two......Went to Costco and bought a different one, at least it's easier to take this one back if it doesn't work right."},{"rating":"1","title":"auto shut off doesn't work","review":"The reviews looked great yet after the first kettle arrived with the auto shut off feature not working, I tried one more time and ordered a replacement. The second one has the same problem, no auto shut off. The kettle will boil and rock like crazy if you don't turn it off. It steams up the cabinets while it boils away... I would go for another brand if the shut off feature is important to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I did lots of research before purchasing this item. When I received it I was surprised at the quality of construction, the materials used and the way the features were incorporated in the design. It lived up to all that was advertized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great for the 1st 2 weeks....","review":"This is our 2nd Aroma electric kettle. The 1st one we used daily for 2 weeks and it began to leak. So we sent it back for a replacement. The 2nd one worked like a charm for the 1st 2 weeks and then we began to notice rust around the bottom. So 4 weeks and 2 kettles later, we have decided that this kettle is not the one for us. Unfortunately, the return shipping policies mean that we are out nearly $20 as a result. Not impressed with return shipping policies or this kettle. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 out of 2 leaked Immediately. Amazon's returns are amazing","review":"This is the 1st product that I have every had to return to Amazon. Upon receiving the Aroma Water Kettle, I filled it up and did a 1st run through test. After the kettle was to a full boil I started to make some tea. I lifted up the kettle and found a pool of water under the cordless base. I dried everything off and tried again hoping that I had spilled the water somehow. I refilled the kettle carefully and let it sit for 30 minutes. Results were the same, big puddle on and under the base.I then requested a replacement, as there are always bad eggs with any product. Willing to forget this 1st bad experience, I tested the new pot. SAME result, instantly leaked all over the counter.So 2 for 2 leaking pots. Perhaps it was just a bad batch... The packaging was in good order when received, so I doubt it happed in shipping. To Amazon's credit, the return process was painless. They even shipped the 2nd kettle with 2 day shipping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Kettle","review":"This is the second kettle we have had as had to return the first one because it was leaking. thought it was a one off, but no the same thing happened again. water dribbles out of the on off switch . Fortunately Amazon makes returning things very easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old ones of this are great, newer ones leak, quality has gone way down","review":"So, I wanted to get a replacement of this. My first one I got four years ago works great, it is in great shape, so I wanted to get one I could use at work.Second one I bought, leaked from where the plastic and metal meet at the bottom of the kettle. Got a refund. Thought it was a fluke.Third one I bought, IT LEAKS TOO, except it is in an even worse spot, from under the handle, right above the button, so water can potentially leak through the opening around the lever.Stay away unless you want a lot of hassle, one time is a fluke, two times in a row is a trend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stops turning off automatically DANGEROUS","review":"I really liked this kettle, it did exactly what i needed it to do and did it well. My tea was always well steeped in the temperature of the water that came out and i even used the boiled water to put directly onto the stove in pots for faster boiling.However, a month and a half into owning it the automatic shutoff stopped working. When this happens and it goes unnoticed it will boil down to nothing, or in a more dangerous situation the handle and kettle become extremely hot and boiling water starts to spurt out the mouth if you were up to the top water level. This was extremely scary in a home with my toddler son running near the counters.I have emailed Aroma since my return window with amazon has closed and if it goes poorly i will likely update this review. I may try to open a discussion with amazon as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned it the next day","review":"maybe it was just a lemon, but the auto shut-off did not work from the moment I took it out of the box. Plus, there is not a \\"keep hot\\" feature. Although it did not promise that on the description, many of these electric kettles do indeed have \\"stay hot\\" features and I mistakenly assumed this one did also. You can buy the Oster electric kettle -- also from Amazon -- at roughly the same price, it works, and it has a \\"stay hot\\" feature which will keep the water hot for up to 12 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice","review":"In both form and function this is an excellent choice. I have enjoyed mine enough to both recommend or give as gifts to friends and relatives. It does all that is required of a tea kettle and at a great price, being as well made as other more expensive kettles I've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful electric tea kettle","review":"I love this kettle. It is super fast, the water tastes better than heating it in the microwave (although this could be my imagination), and it is attractive enough to sit out on my countertop. I consider it to be one of the best things I've purchased in a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aroma kettle","review":"We bought this kettle to replace one that I loved but was no longer available. This has been a great substitute. My old one had a cool touch surface on the outside, which was a real plus and I was worried about this Aroma model as it didn't have this feature. But our family has been using this one now for about a month and no one has touched the side of when it is hot. I may not have realized that the cool touch feature wasn't very necessary. This kettle heats the water fast. It is entirely stainless steel inside, which was important to me - not wanting any plastic touching my hot water. The opening is large enough to get the water into easily and that is good too. Whatever model you get, find one that is cordless as this makes a huge difference in how you use the kettle. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking kettle that works poorly","review":"The kettle is very nice looking however extremly noisy when it starts boiling the water and when it reaches its boiling point it does not stop automatically.

I first ordered the Proctor Silex K2070H and immediately returned it because I hated the short plug (I had to unplug it every time I filled it with water and then plug it back in). With the Aroma, you just lift the kettle off the base, fill with water, and place it back down on the base. Boils water really fast and makes great-tasting tea, just like the Brits! I love how it shuts itself off automatically after the water boils--no more running to the kitchen to turn off a screaming kettle! There's also a clear strip beside the handle, which makes it easy to see exactly how much water is in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, everything you need!","review":"Works great, 6 cups though my cups are bigger than little tea cups so its like 2-3 cups but it only takes about 3 minutes to boil so its great, especially for the price.

We also found it VERY useful when trying to warm up water quickly for pastas, similar to other comments. This morning was its last functioning day...bummer. I can't complain because we sure got great use from it. I was wondering if there was anything better on the market, but haven't seen anything for this price range with the same capability.

Also, the filter that sits at the mouth of kettle kept falling off, so we have just taken it out completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price.","review":"I wanted electric kettle and chose this one, because it looks not bad and the price is low.It takes good 5 minutes to boil a liter (there are indications for the amount and I pour a bit over 0.9 l; 0.6 l is minimum). Once the water is boiling the kettle doesn't shut off for 10 or more seconds. I could hear the vigorous boiling noise from my living room. That makes kettle super hot and I can smell the plastic when pouring water, mostly from the base, which is plastic.But overall it's ok, it doesn't look cheap. Although I could go with Aroma 7-Cup Electric Water Kettle, look better IMO, I just didin't notice when buying the 1 1/5 liter which is almost the same capacity (200 ml difference=almost 1 cup)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Heats water fast. Turns it's self off after boiling. Looks good. Less plastic than some other models. What more do you need?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks Water","review":"This kettle leaks if you leave water in it between uses. I bought this kettle for use at work so wanted one with a large enough capacity so that I didn't have to go to the water fountain to refill it every time I want to make a cup of tea. Unfortunately, after a few weeks of use, I have confirmed it leaks. I originally wondered if the leaking was condensation-related, so I filled the kettle about 1/2 way, placed it on a tray, and left it alone over the weekend. On Monday, there was considerable water on the tray, so much so that I couldn't wipe it away and had to carry the tray to a sink.Unfortunately, once I knew the heating mechanism worked properly I threw away the packaging so I can't return it. The kettle heats water just fine but fails when it comes to containing the water properly. I bought this model becuase it seemed a good value for the price but I now regret it. If you do purchase this product, I suggest keeping the packaging for the 30-day return window, just in case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in <3 months","review":"I bought this kettle in March 2011.

Will likely purchase one for my mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"thermostat failed","review":"I had this for only 2 weeks when I noticed it was not shutting off after the water was heated. The thermostat must have quit working. It just kept boiling and boiling until I would shut it off. I waited too long to be able to send it back without paying the postage. I ordered it in September and this is October- a little over a month since I got it. Now I am stuck with it unless I pay return postage. I like the way it heats the water and it is pretty looking, too bad the thermostat is broke.

I thought this was a flaw in the one I had ordered, so I exchanged it for the same model. I have the same problem. I'm afraid that if I leave the kitchen the water will boil away and a fire could start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I wanted","review":"After searching local retailers in Port Charlotte, Florida for a while, where all I could find was a sorry excuse for an electric kettle, I was pleased to locate this gem on Amazon. The price seemed fair, it had all of the features that we were looking for and, best of all, buyers rated it very high on the scale. I ordered it at once and within fewer days than I expected, it arrived. Now this is a fine looking unit, it has enough capacity to fill my texas tea pot and still have enough hot water for my wife's herbal tea. It's fast, it shuts off when it's supposed to and with it's stationary base, it's convenient too. And another thing....it doesn't drip or leak when you pour. I'm pleased with the price, service, quality and value. How often does that happen these days? Let's hope it stands the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This is a replacement for the same item purchased quite a few years ago - the old one ( after much daily use) just started cutting off before boiling.

I can get my hot water within 5 minutes of using this. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, love it!","review":"Have been using this for about a month. It works very well for what it is. Water heats to boiling amazingly quickly (much quicker than possible on the stove top) and it turns itself off reliably when it reaches boiling. The construction seems reasonably solid, though certainly not top quality materials - but it seems solid enough for the price it is offered at!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in the beginning","review":"This electric kettle worked great to start with, however, 3 weeks into it the automatic shutoff button stopped working.

When I first bought it, I tested it on my first day. It was fine and quick. An hour later, we tried again but the symtons happen. It was only a few hours after buying it. The kettle did not automatically turn off after a long time. When I went to check on it, the light was still on. I quickly the turn it off and when I try to pour the hot water, but the handle burnt me. I returned the kettle that night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Form and Function","review":"Don't confuse the electric tea kettle with waffle irons, bread makers, esspresso machines, and veg-a-matics--this is a vital kitchen appliance. This unit, the Aroma 1.5L, is a great plus for tea drinkers. It is quick, safe, very user friendly, and has visual appeal. The methodology is far superior to a stove-top kettle for the following reasons: you're able heat the appropriate quantity of water--no more, no less--thanks to the water level marker on the side; the unit heats water much faster than the stove top; the unit shuts off once the water comes to a boil--no more head-splitting whistle, no more desperate calls to the Fire Department after you have forgotten about the back burner. Get one, you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but loud","review":"I'm not sure if I missed comments from other consumers but this kettle is loud. It works just like others I've used in the past and heats water up quickly but it sounds like a jet plane taking off as soon as you start it. In the morning when everyone in the house is sleeping I have to use the old stove top kettle as to not wake the entire house. I'd give it 5 stars if it were quieter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rubbish","review":"Positively the worst kitchen appliance we have ever bought. We bought this because it was recommended on this site, and compared with our old kettle (left behind in the UK), this is a complete waste of money. It takes ages to boil - I am surprised by the reviews suggesting this is quick, and the thermostat takes ages to switch off once the water is boiling, which is an unnecessary waste of electricity. Our thermostat is now not shutting off at all(in a 5 month old kettle), meaning the kettle is now an electrical hazard, and like the previous reviewer, I have discovered that the warranty is almost worthless. It requires the kettle to be posted at our expense, including a further $10.00 for return postage (a third of the value of the item!), and allowing 2-4 weeks for return shipping! I suspect that these sort of provisions, which make the warranty without value, are probably not valid as a matter of law, but I don't really want a replacement so we are not pursuing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto switch off doesn't work","review":"Auto switch off doesn't work.

YES, it sprung a leak after only 1 week!! I don't even use it everyday, just on the weekends, so this was basically after 2 uses!!! I only notice leakage after it sits with water in it for a few minutes- I don't see any leaking while the kettle is heating the water. Defective, no doubt, but I'll put up with it for now because shipping it back is just too much trouble at this price point. I'll eventually just go back to my stove top kettle. :-/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted only 6 months!","review":"Once my two GE kettles (purchased from a giant chain) called it quits after each of them worked fine for one or two years, I thought it was time to turn elsewhere. I decided to buy this model as it was one of the top selling brands in its class. Despite warnings given by some buyers about the poorly designed switch, I went ahead with purchase. At that time I noticed that the brand new kettle will not turn off automatically after the water is fully boiled at times, leading to the drying of the chamber. Six months down the road, the switch cannot be pushed down to the \\"on\\" position any more rendering the kettle useless. The manufacturer should redesign the switch to make it a fine product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Electric Tea Kettle","review":"I am very happy with my electric tea kettle!!!

But after a visit at Walmart or Costco, I found that a competitive kettle was sold with $10 less than this one. If I knew this before, I will not make the order.

I use it in my office to make tea throughout the day. It heats up very quickly, even when completely full it only takes about a minute to reach boiling. I did not notice a plastic taste and generally I am sensitive to these things. I have owned my kettle for almost a year now and its still going strong.My only gripe (and it's a big one) is the ridiculously short cord!!! It's only about a foot and a half long, which is ridiculous if you use the kettle anywhere other than your kitchen counter top. I use the kettle on my desk and all of my outlets are on the floor or at floor height. I had to buy an extension cord specifically for this little guy, but at only $15, I guess you get what you pay for.All in all a good, effective, inexpensive product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Unfortunately, this kettle came stained...not sure what it is, almost looks like a coffee dribble all the way down the side from top to bottom - won't rub off.

However, after using it 3 times, it started to leak. The base of the kettle isn't sealed well and water would leak out. I tried to return the product but it says it's not eligible for return. I would like to have the product replaced at least!!! I can't use it anymore. What am I supposed to do with a defective product?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great electric kettle","review":"Pros: The power cord is on the base so kettle is cordless. Stainless Steel is in internal side as well so that water is boiled with stainless steel directly. A full kettle of water can reach boiling point within a couple of minutes and the electric circuit is automatically shut down to avoid any overheating and drying, which is much faster and safer than a regular kettle. There is no resistance coil in the kettle like some of the kettles.Cons: There is no insulation so the surface of the kettle can be as hot as the boiling water! The kettle must be placed from where children are reachable. Even for adults, you must be careful. If you forget or are not aware it has just been used, and you touch the outer surface of the kettle, you'll get burned! Also, the shiny surface is much easier to get scrached and oil stained. A brushed nickle surface could be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks out of the bottom seam","review":"When my last kettle of 5+ years began showing that it was dying, I began looking for a replacement. When I found this kettle the Aroma AWK-115S, I was really looking forward to this because I was excited about being about to put it on its base at any angle. I have an injured tendon in my dominant hand and as silly as it might sound my last kettle sometimes made my wrist hurt getting it on and off the base at the right angle.Once it arrived I did a test run with the automatic shut off and everything worked fine. So the next morning I made my tea with it and everything was fine until the day after. I noticed that it leaked out the bottom near the on off switch. At first I thought maybe I had overfilled it but I didn't even have it filled much more than half way. So basically I used this kettle five or six times and now it is dangerous to use. I am not happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity works","review":"This electric tea kettle just plain works. It's brainless, painless, reliable, and much faster than my old tea kettle on a gas stove. While I'll admit that a temperature setting (for brewing, say, green tea at a lower temp than black) would be nice, I really don't mind cutting the heating time short -- or waiting for the kettle to cool down a bit -- when appropriate. The stainless steel in this unit is of obviously high quality showing zero corrosion and shines like a mirror more than a year after purchase. For the money, I doubt you can do any better. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought it for my baby...but","review":"I bought it for my baby.There are two things that I don't like it.First, it is too noisy.

It does heat the water quickly, but it does not turn itself off, at least mine doesn't, so it boils until the water runs out. The other thing is that within one month of use the bottom of the pot is so scorched that it is a dark brown, which I assume is happening because the heating element is too hot. The only reason I gave this pot even one star is because it does in fact boil the water quickly. But, buy a different tea kettle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Attempts.

The indicator light was not working at all.The third kettle I received has a leak from the shut off button.With the hassle of shipping back by carrying a big box to USPS every exchange (with 6 month baby), I just gave up. I will throw away the third one. Yes, it is a waste of money and my time! Totally worthless! And, choosing a stainless kettle is nothing different from plastic kettle.

I've had this kettle nearly a month now, and it works fine. I like that it's incredibly easy to use, and it doesn't stand out too much. The only drawback is that it only holds 1.5 liters, which means if I want to make a pitcher of iced tea, I have to make two sets of boiling water. Another glitch: You have to make sure the lid is snapped all the way shut, or the water will just keep on boiling. The lid has to be fully closed for the automatic switch-off to work. If you leave it in this state and aren't around to notice, you could burn out your kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works better than exppected!","review":"It's really pretty.

My only criticism is that occasionally (and for no apparent reason) the button will not pop up and stop the kettle. I've never had the kettle boil dry, even when I've gone in another room and forgotten about it, so maybe it eventually pops up. When this happens, I just hit the button up and the kettle stops.

Also, it automatically switches off when the water boils and you can hear the switch-off click if you are not far away. The kettle is generally quiet. There is a cord attached to it. Comes across as a much better substitute for whistling kettles that are slow and use up so much energy on the hot-plates they are laid upon. The plate on which the \\"AROMA\\" lies is not that wide in circumference; so does not take up much space. The kettle is also attractively shiny and does not easily get stained. Any stains accrued are easy to wipe off. I bought this kettle at a much lower price that it now costs--testimony to its quality and the rising demand. Certainly one of the most excellent in my arsenal of appliancesJonathan Musere"},{"rating":"2","title":"a dandy tea kettle","review":"The Aroma Water Kettle is exactly as described in their ad, and boils water quickly. It replaces a Braun electric kettle that lasted only two years and I've high hopes for this one. The Braun was larger with a larger opening at the top which was slightly more convenient, but this is just fine. The only cavil is that it's on-light is apparently designed to be clearly visible only at eye level. It's pretty much invisible at counter-top level in daylight. But all in all, it's a dandy little kettle and well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I had no idea what I was missing. Recently visted a friend in Australia and everywhere we went, people had an electric kettle. I must be hanging with the wrong crowd here in the states, because it was something new to me. So I have been using it daily for a few weeks now. I make coffee, tea, and today...hot chocolate. The water heats up really fast and shuts off when it hits the max temp. No more having to remember I have water boiling on the stove. Haven't had any problems.Many are saying this kettle doesn't turn off once the water boils. I saw one person mention they can hear it boiling and it doesn't shut off. The boiling sound you hear is not the water boiling yet. Some probably need to wait, and it will shut off as designed. I have been using mine daily for a month now and it turns off every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"I bought this electric kettle for my mother, who is origionally from England so knows how to make a proper cup of tea! We have used electric kettles in England that are very durable, quick and so handy. I thought it would be great for my mother who lives here in the US. Unfortunately, the kettle didn't last but a few months then broke... It looked really lovely, but it's cheap. Spend more money and get a quality kettle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto-off does not work - fire & burn hazard","review":"Very disappointing, good reviews but this did not work for us. The Auto-off was broken and it just kept boiling. The construction was not very solid, the lid was not connected very tightly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased With This","review":"I wanted an electric stainless steel tea kettle with a completely enclosed element, no plastic parts touching the water. This one fits my criteria. It heats the water quickly, is very attractive and easy to clean. The water level area is plastic, but it is ingeniously located in the handle, where it does not come in contact with the water. That feature really impressed me. I'm thrilled with this and would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasts!","review":"I bought one for my office, attracted to good reviews and the nice finish with minimal plastic contacting the water. This latter feature is good for tea. It's not 100% but close. It worked great for a few months (about 3). Then the auto-off switch began to be unreliable. When the switch fails to shut off the heat, the water leaks out of that area of the pot and the water in the pot boils until I manually shut it off. I have never let it get to dryness. Luckily, I live in my office so no great harm done, but auto-off is a safety feature and if it starts a fire, that's a big, big problem. Aroma needs to make the switch reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets burning hot from the outside, be careful.","review":"We got this product but once we got it going it got really hot from the outside. It was dangerously hot, I wouldn't hot recommend this product if you have children. The product does look nice and heats water fast but very HOT to touch the outside,"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this one","review":"We like this Teapot even better than our previous one by Chef's choice. It looks Great and works great. I highly reccomend this teapot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I never knew I needed one these. Bought this on a wimb to make some green tea and it essentially changed our lives. Now we eat more oatmeal, drink more tea, and switched to starbucks coffee. This thing is amazing, easy to use and heats water super fast. Every now and again we have to clean it though cause we have hard water and a sediment starts to form, but I cant fault the pot for out water situation. If I lost this, I would pay double to get it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for tea lovers","review":"I've used this product about 10 times, consistent results. It brings water to a near boil very very quickly and automatically shuts itself off. Very large capacity, great for a family. If you are making tea for just one person then you'll have to boil about double what you actually need every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Became not functional within 4 months - go garbage","review":"The kettle broke within 4 months in use. A friend at work tried to fix it but found that the heating element was corroded. It had to go garbage. The Aroma brand does not have good quality control and we would not buy from this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"heats water, but shorts out and turns EVERYTHING on circuit off when the water is hot!","review":"Purchased this pot a little over a month ago (past the amazon return policy, so I guess I'll contact the manufacturer and play that game awhile) and noticed that the auto shutoff does not work when the water boils most of the time. That wasn't a huge deal, but it also sometimes trips the breaker on the circuit it's on and has to be reset. Not terribly convenient. Maybe I just got a lemon?"},{"rating":"2","title":"High style and boils water quickly. What else do you need?","review":"I ordered this kettle for my wife. Her old one had corroded around the element and took a long time to heat. This new kettle is stainless steel throughout and no exposed elements. It boiled the water in 3 minutes or less. I plugged it in and left the room for a couple of minutes and came back to boiling water. The art deco style is a bonus.We would buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 out of 3 leaked","review":"It's really a pity, because it could be a great kettle: Nice design, the heating element is covered for easy cleaning, it is cordless and has a small-holed sieve which comes in very handy if there is a lot of calcium in the water. BUT: Two out of three leaked when left with water in them. This means that the base ends up standing in a puddle of water - DANGEROUS! I could replace them without problem, and the third one works as it ought to. But it was quite a lot of hassle, which I didn't bargain for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started leaking after two days","review":"The design and features are awesome, however, it started leaking from the bottom (where the black plastic meets the steel) after using it for two days. Now we have hot water super fast all over the counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with this kettle!","review":"Pleased with this kettle! Heats water very quickly. Appreciate being able to remove the kettle from the base for pouring. Appealing design and seems to be well made. Thoughts of how to improve - increase length of cord a foot or so, and fashion so other liquids can be heated in the kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice item without overcharge.","review":"It is a kettle great for two to three person living in a dorm. It is not overcharged, and the quality is good enough. With stainless steel body, and heating through a stand separated from the body, it's also safe to use and you don't have to worry about the smell from heated plastic material. Amazon also provides good-quality of customer service, for immediately sending me a second one due to non-delivery of the original order by the local post office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was great until it died...","review":"I loved this kettle...but it lasted (with light use)for less than a year. Spend more and get something that will last. Or heck, I had a plastic $10 electric kettle that we used for almost 10 years. This is just shiny garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just got it, won't turn on","review":"That's it, I just took it out of the box and it won't turn on, power light won't come on. The outlet is working fine, and the manual just says call costumer service... wonder if costumer service will make me some tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for two years, then broke!","review":"It worked great for two years, but within two days it kind of self destructed. The pins on the bottom of the kettle, or the metal piece that depresses on the base when the kettle is placed upon it broke. The next day, the on/off switch became faulty. Now it does not work at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water tastes terrible - metallic and just spoils the tea","review":"I have washed this kettle many times to try and get the boiled water to not taste metallic, but nothing worksThis is a terrible kettlePlease avoid if you want your tea, or any other food or drink to taste like it should. My oatmeal tastes like metal, as does my tea & coffee. Gonna return this. Fail"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Excellent","review":"Works very well for my intended use of jubt boiling water. heats up quick and easy to use"},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention black tea drinkers","review":"As other reviewers wrote, this kettle is slow to turn itself off. With mine it takes maybe two minutes of boiling before it does; however, I wonder if that's intentional. Years ago, my mother (from Ireland) said that to make a good cup of tea (black tea only), you need to boil the water for two full minutes. The main reason tea tastes so bad in many diners and restaurants in the U.S. is that they fail to use water just off the boil.What I love about this kettle is that it boils water in the blink of an eye. No kidding, this is the fastest of any method I've tried in 30 years.I'm taking one star off because of the uncertainty around the auto-off function. I don't completely trust it. Also, the on/off switch is flimsy. It wouldn't take much to break this, as happened to one commentator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"The Aroma water kettle is simple and just what I needed for my morning tea :) and it quickly heats water.The only problem I noticed is that you cannot open the lid with the same hand you hold the handle with...

My husband keeps one at work, we have one in the kitchen and I just purchased one for my son's college dorm room. We make a lot of tea and also like to use a French press so this kettle works great for us. Easy to use and easy to clean. It also looks nice sitting on the counter.

A fatal flaw and a fire hazard, so we sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"It's a nice looking kettle, but has a huge quality drawback: This kettle often runs for minutes after the boiling temperature has been reached, before it turns itself off. I don't know if this is such a bad design in general of this product series or perhaps I just got a bad one out of the series. Nevertheless I read about other people having the same issue, so it can't be just me alone. If you care for another fine piece of chinese quality, then go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've had the Aroma water kettle about a week. At first it seemed to work fine but then problems started. First, I discovered that the automatic shutoff, which works fine when the kettle is full, doesn't always work when the water level is near (but not below) the \\"minimum\\" mark. This is exactly when you need it most! Next, I found a piece of the plastic retainer (that holds the spout filter in place) lying at the bottom of the kettle after boiling some water, even though I hadn't touched the filter. Now the filter is loose. I plan to return this unit and buy another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"boils water but never turns off","review":"i bought this to replace an old kettle that stopped working. the expectations are pretty low: boil water, stop when water is boiling. this thing accomplished half of that. i'm throwing it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be nice except it does not shut itself off","review":"Seems like a lot of folks have had problems recently with these not shutting off (at all, or quickly) once the water boils, wonder if there was a bad batch of these?The pot itself is nice, holds a decent amount of water and does boil it fast. The baseplate is kind of flimsy, it doesn't sit flat on the counter until the pot is resting on it.The fact that it doesn't turn off relatively quickly after boiling is enough for me to return it. Gotta love Amazon - I already stupidly pitched the box it came in, but they'll accept it back no problem regardless.I would not buy one of these again, what I am going to buy instead is the Kalorik JK23431, which I already have one of and it works as expected and it a bit sturdier feeling and more attractive to look at in the kitchen (hence the bigger price tag). In this case you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto off function is not working : (","review":"I just bought this kettle and thought it's a good deal with many good reviews.

If water is left in the kettle for a couple hours, a pool of water will form around the kettle. I would guess water collects in the base, because when I lift and tilt the kettle for pouring, water drips out of the base. I am very disappointed - leaking began after the first use and hasn't let up since.TL;DR: It leaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after two years","review":"This kettle has worked flawlessly for exactly two years. We use it just once a day for morning beverages and a few other, occasional, water heating needs, like poached eggs. So it hasn't been pushed in terms of endurance. Last week it started acting up. After using it in the coffee press, I refilled with cold water and hit the switch - nothing. After a couple of minutes, I heard the water starting to heat, it ran for a few seconds then stopped heating (switch remained on). A minute or two later, another cycle - on for a while then off etc. until 15 minutes later the water was boiling. Fast forward to this week, first filling in the AM, no heat at first then 2 - 3 minutes cycles, until boiling is reached. It's a good looking unit at a great price but 2 years with only limited use is not acceptable. Buying the next kettle from Costco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent water kettle!","review":"This is an awesome water ketlle!

It heats a full kettle (6 cups) in about 90 -120 sec. Its noisy but nothing ridiculous. I notice it builds up calcium pretty fast if I use tap water, so I tend to use filtered water.

BUT this thermos would NEVER shut off. The auto off switch function never worked. At first I thought I'd just live with it, but then realized it might cause a fire someday if I forgot I turned it on.

The kettle does a great job of boiling water, but the kettle's design is not optimal. The window on the kettle body that shows how much water is inside is located underneath the handle, so if you are holding the kettle under a faucet it is difficult to look around your hand to see what the current water level is. And the flimsy plastic filter located just inside of the pour spout is difficult to properly align with its plastic housing, especially for someone who does not have strength in their fingers. After seeing this kettle being used by the person whom I purchased it for, I'd opt for a different kettle with a more thoughtful design and higher-quality materials if I were going to make this purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has plastic inside","review":"I had high hopes for this kettle. I loved the size and the looks. I've researched until I'm half-crazy for a plastic free electric kettle and I thought this was going to be it.
