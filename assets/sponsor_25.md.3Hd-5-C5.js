I forgot just how much until I recently purchased it for my daughter...on my way to aquiring all the great disney movies. We watched it together and it was so great that I have watched it several times since!!! Although some of the scenes may be a bit much for a young one most of the scenes are cute and give great lessons.All the actors did such a great job that the movie really does move you....you just get sucked in. The animation is beautiful and the colors are vibrant. The music is inspirational! I would recommend this movie to anyone...young and old. I loved the new scene \\"The Morning Report\\" and the second disc with all the history and information. It is well worth the cost to have this great classic.Now I can't wait to see the lion king 2....which I didn't even know existed....gees where have I been? It's a good thing I had my daughter to introduce me to the world of animation again....I love it! You will too..buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Walt Disney movies","review":"I chose this VHS not only because I'm a Disney fan but, also as a gift for sombody else. She loved it because it's a VHS she's not a fan of DVD's so it was the perfect choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Delay","review":"Only problem with this version is that it takes a couple of minutes to get to the menu.

The extras are good but I seriously hate the fact that you MUST be connected to internet to enjoy the classic DVD bonus features via BDlive. I mean, the blu ray has a HUGE capacity, and they do this? C'mon! And those special features are the best! I hope Disney will not apply this on future Diamond Editions. Despite this, everything is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok DVD","review":"This DVD does work but skips at times. We are able to watch it, but I am very dissapointed in AMazon for allowing people to sell things that don't work correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Well Done DVD","review":"Although the movie itself only has one song added into it which is rather out of place, the digital mastering and added crispness of the sound and animation make this DVD great. Having only seen a few of the special features they were rather intriguing. Lots of previews in here for a failing Disney, but this is Disney back in top form with a DVD definitely worth grabbing. They even went back and took out the ah, \\"dirty words\\" that had made their way into the original movie and VHS. Great quality in picture and sound for one of the best animated films to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Absolute Best Animated Film of All Time.","review":"Disney's best film achievment, The Lion King truely is the king of all animated films. The movie is awe-inspiring and touching. It teaches valuable lessons that anyone can foreward into their own life. The movie itself is beautiful. Hans Zimmer's score is one of the most brilliant that I have heard. The animation is goregous, I do not see how anyone could have done it in just three years. Everything about it is awesome. It may be a little violent for kids, but it isn't overwhelming. I highly reccomend this film for anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have for any family","review":"This movie is sooo well known that my review will probably not make a difference in the decision for someone to purchase and own this video.

The movies good points is that its got lots of music in two catagories background and songs. The animation also plays a vital role in this movie for it simbolises things that real life characters and scenes cannot create. The dialog was funny and comical sometimes a little bit dull. In some stages the movie can be a drag and you dont have a clue wats going on! The story is also so well written and put into animation that you can truly bear all the emotion with Simba that he is going through. The animation in this film is there for childrens delight but I think children might not follow and understand the story line so well,I would rather say an adult would enjoy this movie better. All in all Disney outdid themselfs.I can give them a rating of 5 stars with a smile on my face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Family movie!!","review":"I have a 6 and a 2 year old. They love this movie. I've been looking all over trying to locate it for our movie library. The quality of this movie is awesome. The sound effects are great. I notice they've added a few more songs to the movie since it was first viewed in 1994. I was pleased to see that my two year old was not afraid of the hyenas. He thinks that scar is mean. Moreover, he insist on watching it every weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Disney Film Of Them All","review":"Forget Snow White and Cinderella. This is Disney\`s true masterpiece: the story is both funny and touching, the characters lovable, and spectacular animation. There is no Disney film better than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is by far one of the best movies of all time! Disney produced a really funny and heartfelt movie. The movie is about a young lion prince who grows up to be the king. But it isn't that easy, he must go through many obstacles on his way there including his awful uncle Scar(Jeremy Irons) Nathan Lane throws in some laughs as well as Ernie Sabella. This is an impressive cast, and the movie is directed to perfection. Lion King can be watched and enjoyed in any age group.

The lead character dies a horrible death and there are fights to the death. This is not a children's movie. See the first \\"Editors\\" comments. Compared to NEMO, artistically the animation is simply not that great. The background scenes are repetitious. Disk 2 is basically an advertisement for the musical.

I don't rate this as a classic. I typically give the benefit of the doubt to movies and I typically rate them higher than they deserve. Actually, I'm doing that here too by not giving it ONE star.

The movie is quite obnoxious, with its vulgar characters and its violence.(...) I can't believe it received a G rating. Should be more like PG, I think.

I think the special features with the amazingly sensuous Elton John, the wonderfully effervescent Nathan Lane, and the titillating Whoopi(there's no whoopi on this DVD - pun intended) Goldberg approach the sublime world of cartoons - a world where few cartoonists in their lifetime dare venture.My partner, Tony Muser, and I, at The Stop the Violence in Cartoons Foundation, find this new special edition to be of a magnificently splendid variety suitable for all ages. However, I must issue a mild admonition(and this is the reason it gets 4 stars) when I say watch out for certain racy innuendos targeted at an adult audience(eg Simba's comments - you know what I'm sayin) that prove to be of a somewhat debaucherous, and crude I might add, attempt at corrupting our innocent youth of America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for Disney's \\"The Lion King\\"","review":"Before purchasing this DVD, I was searching for a reliable seller with an acceptable price.This DVD I bought, was in excellent state (new) and the price was reasonable.The only (not significant) disadvantage, is that my DVD player cannot play it, so I can see it only on my laptop.

The cubs are just like kids, going where the adults tell them not to. Always wanting to go have fun and play in the mud instead of getting a bath or lounging around. They learn the circle of life, how we all come and go. The lion is just like any other human father: Protective, wise, teaches the cubs things, fun, yet lays his life on the to save Simba.

He takes an adventure with his friend Nala.Simba's father tells them not to go to the elephant graveyard but they do any ways Anyways this is a very funny movie. I usually don't act like this but I still watch the movie. My brother relates to Simba. Simba gets into a fight with his uncle named Scar. Scar wants to take over Pride Rock. But Simba gets Pride Rock. And every one is happy!This is a dramatic, funny movie. You might cry in this movie but you will laugh to. A lot of movies don't make you cry like this one will. You really need to go buy this movie! (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney...Greedy Genius","review":"Ok, I love Disney. I am a 22 year-old male. I have no shame about the fact that I love these movies. They were a part of my childhood, so now I am buying them. It's just too bad I can't buy the Lion King brand-new because of that STUPID vault!!! Sure, Disney has some genius minds that realize if they withhold something, people will pay more for it. But do they really need to? If my company had the money and assets like Disney does (considering they own ESPN) i believe that i would not lock up my greatest films just so I can sell them for 30 or 40 dollars five years from now.

Then we tasted it- there was way too much salt and spice on the shrimp- to the point that it was completely inedible. And we are spice lovers in this house -we eat tons of spicy curry on a regular basis. We even tried rinsing the shrimp off but the salt was infused completely through the shrimp.

The Author never really gave much depth to the characters.....maybe they just didn't have any depth. We never find out the reason for Kristen Rossum's raging drug abuse (although it was hinted that an injury ending her chances at becoming a ballerina did it). So what she comes off as, is a spoiled child (which is probably the real reason for her drug abuse)who marries a man, who helps her (for awhile), get off drugs -- which she repays by killing him -- so she could be with her married lover.

Intertwined in the love story are subplots of drug addiction, infidelity. deceit, manic behavior, and murder. These negative behaviors are attributable to the woman in this love story, Kristin Rossum.Portrayed by her family and some friends as the ALL AMERICAN GIRL, with high expectations for success; Kristin is just the opposite. She lacks morals, the ability to tell the truth, and to truly love anyone except herself.I found it interesting to read that she and Scott Peterson are corresponding back and forth from prison.

The author is repetitive a few times, but nothing too bad. The things Kristin to get her \\"way\\" were really, out of control. Besides what her husbands brothers thought of her, her husband Greg stood by her. He believed in the good in her. Meanwhile, she manipulated everyone she knew with her beauty and sexuality.

That's fine and all as it's more convenient to have all of them together, BUT...if you're going to do that, why not put these episodes into anamorphic widescreen and/or remaster the video images as well? Some of these episodes look like they were transfered to DVD straight from a VHS source.But this should not take away from the fact that these are extremely well-made histories - informative, educational and obviously produced by and with the assistance of those with a distinct passion for the Civil War.Definitely worth your time and attention!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"The first 2 discs (4 episodes) were exactly what i was expecting.

Most of the problem with it is not its quality or production that is quite good.

I mean, the plot doesn't seem so stunning at first. But there are again some little things that make this movie so brilliant. It can be seen as a critisation for the over-commecilaity, but more than anything iti is a fars. and a dam funny movie.

There are few surprises here -- it is nor secret that prisons to nothing to deter crime in the least -- quite the opposite, in fact -- and that most people who are incarcerated could be much more effectively rehabilitated using other means, except for the minority of violent offenders.

This is a nice thin lubricant for one's firearm that will not turn into gunk and gum up the works. You can use it for about everything in the gun cleaning process. You can spray it directly onto your weapon, or do as I do and spray it onto a rag or bore cleaning patch, and then apply. The product comes with a spray tube so that you can spray it very precisely, without making a mess.Guns require frequent cleaning and lubrication. This product does the job, lubricates the moving parts, and really acts as a cleaner as well--apply and wipe off and the dirt and carbon is gone. I will apply with a rag, or spray into difficult to reach areas such as slide rails, and then wipe with a Q-Tip to ensure that everything is clean. Leave a little in the movement areas such as the slide rails to lubricate and reduce the wear on your semi-automatic. Highly recommended.

In particular, I like her idea of 'access without entertaining'. I also think that she deals very well with sibling rivalry. We have put many of her theories into practice to great effect. She is also very clear about boundaries, which I find useful to reread every so often. I highly recommend Parachutes for Parents. It is written from the heart with lots of insight.

One piece is the single mat, the other piece has the part attached that crosses the \\"hump.\\" This is where the fit is less than custom. I may simply end up trimming off the \\"center\\" piece and placing each end under the other two mats. The problem is that you cannot position the mat that is attached to the center piece so that it fits neatly in all areas. Regardless, after some customizing, I'm sure I'll be very happy with these.

Rappers such as E-40 and Ice t are sprinkled throughout the album. One rapper stands out from the rest when you listen through the cd. He goes by the name of Sicx and is found in tracks 10 & 14.

Unfortunately this book doesn't come close. Paul Dini has taken a huge stubject and over-simplified it into a five minute read that doesn't really grab your attention for those five minutes.The art, being Alex Ross is extremely professional, but it lacks acertain spark that you see in most of his work, and it just serves as a reminder of why the quality of a good painter is not just down to realism - Realism alone can be quite dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truimph of the Human spirit!

Overall the book is a compliment to the human spirit, and an agonizing glance at world hunger.

What can I say, the artwork AND the writing doesn't get any better than this. I don't know of any book that has captured the fundamental essence and decency of the character better. Here is a man whose one reason to exist is to help those who need his help. Whose one real defeat is to be thwarted in giving that help. Superman never for one moment doubts that the reason for his great gifts is to help others. This is largely due to the down to earth teachings of Pa Kent: \\"As far back as we go, we've always had problems with sharing.

I highly recomend this book to anyone who likes Superman but wouldn't mind seeing a little less of the Lex Luthor stuff.Although I didn't give this book 5 stars, I still think it's a great book.

Superman does go through some internal and external struggles, but what was told in some 64-odd pages could have been told in 20! It just goes on and on about the same issues and frankly bores.

Tal Farlow had dazzling speed and bebop chops;Joe Pass played guitar like Bill Evans played piano and Johnny Smith played beautiful sounds.What Joe Puma has in spades is class.

It has such beautiful intimacy.I will say that you have to be very careful because the preamps are not noise free. They will add some hiss and I do not know if that is how they are, being tube, or if that is a defect. I need to call ART and find out. In spite of that I would not take this back. It's not noticeable when instruments or vocals are playing so can be edited out in the final mix. I edit out the silent parts anyway. It gives my recordings a warmth that feels like the 70's.

This book appears to be about Ms. Toews own struggle with depression and her lack of any kind of resolution to the problems that have plagued her and her family. I think we were given a glimpse into her own unfinished personal analysis, an analysis that has not reached any positive conclusions or coping skills to survive in the world. If writing this book was cathartic, then I hope the next will be based on the cumlination of all this self examination and be life affirming in some way.

Funny and sweet, the \\"Menno\\" teenage author is falling, falling, falling out of grace with her strict Mennonite community; stoned half the time, confused the other half, she takes us into the world of a small-town religious town girl yearning for something more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"While the main character in the book, Nomi, has a more difficult life than many, her story has a universal quality to it. It is beautifully told, beautifully written, sometimes excruciatingly real.Her family and her community leave her to grow up by her own wits - they love her but they are too self-involved and oblivious to notice her, and they simply don't have the tools to help young people cope in the world. So she goes about figuring it out on her own, primarily in search of someone who will just pay attention to her.Toews has created in Nomi a painfully real character, one who is a victim of circumstances but also recognizes that she would be free to make choices if she had it in her to do so.I highly recommend this story to both readers and writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read this before","review":"On the plus side this book shows how devastating a fundamentalist mentality can be. As a philosopher I have argued in print that fundmentalism is the greatest of all moral evils.The main character is trapped, which creates the angst, but, while I was able to sympathize with her situation, Toews did not get me to care for her.The father is a much more interesting character. Why he stays is the real mystery.On the negative side I found the writing style to be formal and distancing. It was like reading an essay, not a novel.There are all the traditional Canadian prairie themes in this book: The outsider, the clash of cultures, the landscape, the yearning to be elsewhere.As I read this book, I kept thinking, Margaret Laurence, where are you now that we need you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complicated indeed","review":"After finishing this novel, you may ask yourself: \\"where on earth is the kindness in this story?\\"It is a complicated tale about the mennonite teenage girl Nomi, who lives in a strict religious community in Canada. All members of the community has to follow the rules of the founder of the mennonite religion, but Nomi cannot accept that. All through the book there is a feeling of Nomi not knowing herself, that she does many things against the religious rules.The story is full of 'weird' characters, but they are never describes as weird, it seems like 'weird' characters in the small town are pretty normal.The kindness part does materialize itself after giving the book's ending a few thoughts, and I strongly recommend this book. It is a very interesting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, great writing style, disappointing narrative arc","review":"The premise of this book really excited me -- I know very little about Mennonite culture and was curious to see how the format of a teen novel would frame it. Toews' writing style was perfect for the character -- very believable and natural. Unfortunately, the story itself simply didn't move enough to keep me engaged. While I applaud Toews' resistance to go for easy answers, the lack of revelation or insight into made it tough for me to get engaged in the story arc. I was disappointed by the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't finish it..","review":"I have to admit it.. I didn't finish the book. Perhaps if I had I would have been let in on a secret about why it won an award. For me a book has to propel me forward to read it with SOME sort of plot. I was waiting the entire time for something to *happen* to the main character other than just eluding to the things happening around her and how it all sucked. I'm not much for teen angst ."},{"rating":"2","title":"GORGEOUS shoes but a KILLER on the feet","review":"I LOVE LOUBOUTIN! These shoes have a beautiful silhouette and are absolutely gorgeous.

But then, I always like books that have kids half-embarassedly playing games they know they're too old for.I can't believe I called a book \\"really sweet,\\" but I'm going to pretend it never happened and quickly post this before I can change it.

The Maryland setting is lovingly rendered, and the characters are truly believable people. In spite of their imperfections, Daphne and Jessica forge a special bond as they grapple with tough real-world problems. The story gives kids plenty of opportunities to think about how others think and feel.

This is definitely a book every one should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Was Depressing, Yet Full of Many Strong Emtions","review":"Daphne's Book is a depressing book in a way, yet it is full of emtion. It is sad to think that people such as the character Daphne have to live in horrid conditions. It is also depressing to think and to actually know that people will make fun of people that they have no idea about! Jessica was a brave character who risked a reputaion for a hearts sake.

The album has Ant's great production on it and every single song on this album is tight as f***!! The only problem with is that it's got only 10 tracks and the rest is interludes by some great rappers.

Mia is a beautiful name, Mia X is a beautiful woman, and Mia-Nichole is a beautiful girl, so what now? Mia X easily held her own against any MC in the game, let alone the females.You can pick any track off this cd, it's all good. \\"4ever Tru\\" is my favorite track off the disc with banging verses by P, C, Silkk and Mama Mia. The only thing that held Mia back was her weight, because she was way better than Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown, that's right! She was just as cute, just as sexy, was more original, more versatile, and when she lost that weight she was just as fine!

The \\"biggest momma of 'em all's\\" release UNLADYLIKE is a different pace for No Limit records. As we see, Mia has a gangster side (pretty much tracks 1-13) and a much softer side (14-20) that we enjoy. Covers both genres of gangster rap and R&B nicely. Guest appearences include the rest of the No Limit soldiers as well as a memorable one from FOXY BROWN. If you're a God fanatic, you might want to skip track 15. Just a warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mama Mia!","review":"I just want to respond to the reviewer that named his daughter after Mia X. I agree with you, homes. I love her whole steelo too.

It was great -- a very nice addition to my afternoon or evening tea. Only problem was that it was about $16 for 8 ounces AND you had to buy three other flavors of sugar with it, making it even more ridiculously expensive.That's why, when I found this 3 pound jar of India Tree Vanilla Sugar here for only $26.15, I ordered it immediately. I have never regretted it. I'm now on my second jar, in fact. I'm also an Amazon Prime member, so I didn't have to pay shipping, but the real advantage is that while the other vanilla sugar would have cost me around $96 for 3 pounds, this one is clearly significantly less. And -- NOW HEAR THIS -- it really is just as good. It's the exact same thing, just a different brand.Get it now! You never know when they 'll wise up and raise the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks can be deceiving (on the internet)","review":"I know now why this vanilla sugar was so much less money then most, the vanilla beans are not ground.

Mr McMurtry I love the rest of your woorks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage McMurtry","review":"This is a classic Larry McMurtry/non Lonesome Dove book. McMurty is, in my opinion, the best character author of all time. After reading one of his books, it is hard to believe that these people didn't really exist. I feel like every one is a personal aquaintance. This is a hilarious and tragic story, with a shock at the end. One of McMurtry's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cheat","review":"McMurtry never backs away from being a brutal narrator when he has to be -- death stalks many of his books from Horseman Pass By to Lonesome Dove, Streets of Laredo and Duane's Depressed, and death can come suddenly and shockingly, without respect for what readers have come to expect are \\"the rules\\" of storytelling. That being said, this is the one McMurtry book where the shock feels like a cheap device, instead of like pitiless but honest storytelling. Some Can Whistle meanders about, with Danny Deck trying to find common ground with his hell-on-wheels daughter, and then the book's big surprise comes, and then it's over. But that's about it -- the book just ends, and unlike, say, Streets of Laredo, you haven't learned anything. You've just been surprised, and that's not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was extremely dissappointed","review":"Some can whistle was from beginning to end, depressing beyond words. Usually, even with books that are inately sad there is some culmination or resolution of events, there is something that gives us hope, not so in this book. It begins sadly and ends even sadder with the death of the daughter that he has just come to know. I put this book down feeling extremely depressed and had to engross myself in a good murder mystery to ease the pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gift for words with a preposterous plot.","review":"Although this is the first of McMurtry's books I have read, his name is familiar through films made from his books. His gift for verbal illustration is quite enjoyable and his descriptions are vivd. The problem with the book is that not one of the characters is likeable except for T.R.'s children and even that is questionable. I was actually happy when they were murdered by T.R.'s ex-lover. After her death and that of Godwin, the book spirals downward in a series of narratives of promising lives cut short as one after another of the characters dies. The narrator, Danny Deck, comes off as a spoiled and spoiling multi-millionaire without any sense of discipline for himself or the others. The entire narrative comes off as pointless and after finishing the book my feeling was one of time wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product bad advertising","review":"The image of the three cakes makes one think they are purchasing three cakes or that they can choose which flavor they wish to receive since all three packages shown are of different colors and presumably different flavors (and I know panforte comes in different flavors).

I was looking for a supplemental practice that incorporated dance which is why I bought these. I have NO IDEA why they are titled Yoga Dance.

It's the story of a straight photographer (Til Schweiger) who is initiated into the Cologne gay scene after he is tossed out of his apartment by his girlfriend, who discovers him cheating on her at the restaurant where they both work. Our hero ends up sharing a flat with a gay man, who then plots to seduce him. There are a lot of hokey plot contrivances to keep this one afloat, but they only serve to underscore the charm of the film's remarkably adept cast--with empashis here on Herr Schweiger. The film is punctuated throughout by camp musical interludes courtesy of Max Raabe and the incredible Palast Orchester, whom some of you may know from their \\"Charming Weill\\" album. \\"Kein Schwein ruft mich an\\" is just one gem among many. See it, if only for the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A german comedy","review":"My sister in law brought the movie from Germany.

The book consists of the characteristics of sharks IN GENERAL. Unfortunately, not all sharks are the same, so a lot is left out. The pictures are at best average, and are mainly of sharks that you could see at Ripley's aquarium. This book DOES NOT describe the different kinds of sharks. It is a basic, vague overview of sharks.

It contains lots of color photographs and has some great information.It provides a general insight to the anatomy of the shark, our relationships with them, the classification of all of the shark species, and some handy info on where you can best find sharks in the wild. The book lacked some of the more indepth information that i was looking for, being a more general introduction to sharks rather than a more detailed book. However, what you are looking for in a shark book may be different from what i was, and this book would suit your needs well. I would highly recommend it too any person who is just getting in to sharks (well worth your money), but for other people who already know more than the general info about sharks, there are better books out there. Your money would not be poorly spent, as this is a good book for all, but there are more informational books (Sharks in Question is one of the best i have read)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate information","review":"At first glance this book seems to be a great overview of sharks with lots of great pictures.

Then, each type is broken down into subjects, with numerous examples and fill-in-the-blank games. For example, the chapter on metaphors defines the term. Then it explores some basic examples. Following this, the author examines some themes: for example, building metaphors, food metaphors, etc. The reader then has the opportunity to fill-in-the-blanks for many metaphor \\"exercises.\\" And so on for each chapter.The writing is fresh and friendly, with a definitely playful tone.

The author should count how many times the word \\"intent\\" was used in the first 100 pages. It's a lot.

If you are looking for a movie of this sort, please, stay FAR AWAY from this one, and rent \\"Mafia\\" instead.Rodney Dangerfield and Dom Deluise need better material to work with. They were desperate for money. This movie is so dumb that I cannot believe it was allowed to be filmed and sent out to the public! Who wrote this filth? A second grader?

In fact, I don't even want it taking up space on my shelf. The authors have hardly covered any of the programs in any depth whatsoever. Something as simple as the concept of Macros isn't even listed in the index.(It may be covered in the book, but without a mention in the index, what good is it?) I bought this book because the manual is so bad. But this book is even worse than the manual. Even the Visual Quickstart for Word 6 covers more than this book. Worse than the utter simplicity in the book is the fact that the authors actually give some bad information. Not only that but the layout and graphics of the book are horrible. No callouts for the figures. No good captions. And they manage to put a rather distracting grey texture behind too much of the text. I am actually going to spend more of my own money to ship this book back to amazon.com. I don't care.

It was a small enough leak that I kept putting off replacing it for over a year, only leaking maybe a quart every 2,000 miles. Lately though it started leaking much faster so I finally got around to replacing it with an AC Delco water pump. After removing the Bosch pump I could feel some play and roughness in the shaft; the pump was shot after 15 months and 13,000 miles.

I find it strange that it can be shipped TO me in all it's incendiary glory, but cannot be shipped back because it contains a solution that may be flamable. Most importantly the device cleans disks in a manner which is opposed to every disk cleaning convention ever recommended. It works in a circular manner rather than from the inside of the disk outward. The manufacturer isn't interested in returns, a fact I take to indicate their disdain for customers.

It works, but has poor print quality -- prints too light, drum is scratched so there is toner \\"fogging\\" on printed sheets, spotting, etc. I'm not one to send things back -- because I don't want to waste my time or endure the hassle.

The evidence against UNICEF's involvement in abortion was so overwhelming that the Catholic Church ceased all donations in 1996! UNICEF has only gotten worse since then from a pro-life perspective.

I suppose this doesn't really make any difference, but I can't help feeling that I paid a huge premium for having someone in China stamp \\"Rosle\\" on this.And how much special effort is required to \\"engineer\\" a jigger, anyway?

Oh sure they have a few clips of his matches but that's all they are clips, most of the DVD is spent answering innane questions. I would have liked to see at least one complete match, but all you'll see is the same moves over and over. The clips don't even contain the original commentary by the announcers, so it's great if you like uncomfortable silences.The people who put this out seem more concerned with singing Mistico's praises than with displaying good Lucha Libre.

I was bored rigid by Once upon a time in Mumbai, another film that blatantly steals from other movies, but is excruciating due to the fact that the makers think they have created a work of art.In short: if it is between this and OUATIM, then I would much rather sit through this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved Dabangg!!!","review":"Funny, Salman is such a good actor.

Compared to some of Simak's earlier work the ensemble character development is quite good but the piece lacks much of the exuberance and rapid layering of big concepts that Simak does so well.The gist of the story is that 5 humans and one robot from different alternate history earths are brought together on a different but empty earth that contains a series of way stations that act as clues. Ala Pilgrim's Progress each characters represents different archetypes but the analogies are rather blunt.The writing is OK, but taken as a whole it feels like the premise of an RPG.

The obligatory Clash music is there, but so is a lot of other music that Joe Strummer liked or considered influential, and his own voice DJ-ing his \\"London Calling\\" satellite radio show provides occasional narration, talking directly to his listeners and to us watching this film. For a guy who was filled with alot of anger early in his career, he had a very calming presence near the end and Julian Temple did a good job building that story line. Another technique that was really original and refreshing was how all of the \\"celebrity\\" interviews were mixed in with friends and neighbors and fellow musicians and none of them were identified when they spoke. Everyone just sat around the campfire--different campfires around the world--talking music and telling stories about Joe Strummer and The Clash. Turn this one up LOUD, sit back and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This wasnt born so much as it fell out","review":"This plays more like somebody passed a video camera around at a wake. All the excellent concert footage was talked over by someone saying something that mattered to only two people, Joe and who ever was talking. Nothing new was revealed if you were already a fan. This was an hour plus of Joe Strummers friends giving him verbal fellatio."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Revolution Rock\\"","review":"Documentary biopic, 'The Future Is Unwritten' is a thorough examination of the talented lead singer/songwriter of British punk band, The Clash. Resourceful, the film fuses together early home movies, group footage, interviews of surviving members, relatives, and loved ones, as well as interviews when they were at their apex. Also featured are thoughtful words by Bono and short reflections by John Cusack, Martin Scorsese, and Steve Buscemi. All of the posthumous interviews are done by a bonfire to allude to Strummer's illustrated vision of heaven on earth. The highlights, however, focus on casual and candid talk by Strummer himself. His words both spoken and sung should be final proof that punk rock isn't and wasn't primarily right wing. The composite is a fascinating and penetrating work that is cohesive and satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but one quibble...","review":"This is a terrific documentary about the life and times of the late Joe Strummer, a fascinating artist who left us much too soon. The quality of the archival material is excellent (who knew there were home movies of a very young Joe?)and the interviews are top-notch. This is highly recommended for Clash fans and fans of Strummer's post-Clash work with the Mescaleros. My only quibble is that none of the interview subjects are identified as they talk about Joe. We can pick out Bono and Johnny Depp, yes, and longtime fans can spot Palmolive and Pearl Harbour, but there are family members and friends who talk about Joe, but without giving us context of who they are. It gets to be annoying later in the film when musicians who played with Joe post-Clash talk about his later years. The candor of those being interviewed and the footage make up for that, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Overly-Long Look at the Life of Joe Strummer","review":"The Future is Unwritten is a documentary focusing on the life of Joe Strummer, the deceased leader of The Clash. The film has its fans, but it didn't do much for me. For most of the film, celebrities talk about how much they liked The Clash. Few of the celebs have anything insightful to say and many of them are stoned out of their gourds. The film also depresses the viewer by detailing Strummer's post-Clash life, which was a long slide into obscurity. Finally, at two hours, it is far too long.To be fair, the film does have some good clips of The Clash performing and some good information about Strummer's early life.Passionate Clash fans will want to see this one, but everyone else should skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"History of Fayette County Indiana:Her People, Industries and Institutions","review":"When the Library is closed and its 2AM, having my own copy, to mark up, put in place holders, is golden!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly ahistorical","review":"The author clearly is no student of Middle East history.

Told in the words of the surviving veterans of this famous battle, Foxtrot Ridge will be remembered as one of the great battle histories to emerge from that war.The author has seemlessly integrated naratives from over twenty people interviewed to create a fast-paced, highly readable story that can be appreciated as much by those who love a good action adventure as military historians and veterans. At times hilarious in their candour, the veterans recount their experiences with an honesty and level of rapport that could not have been acheived had the author not been a survivor of Foxtrot Ridge himself.Recommended reading for anyone with an interest in the Vietnam War and anyone who thought Mel Gibson's movie was the last word on the matter.

After reviewing the Command Chronology of 3rd Recon Battalion/3rd Force, I discovered that 3rd Force was in fact not in Quang Tri but was still in Dong Ha during this time period and that the commanding officer was not the one stated in the book.

Not pleasant.This shampoo is animal cruelty-free, which is a necessity for me. It smells a bit herbal and mediciney, but I think that makes the shampoo seem that much more effective.

I was careful to gently massage my scalp and leave it on for the sufficient time in the shower. Maybe I didn't give it enough time, however, I noticed that several reviews said that it worked quickly for them. The smell is quite strong but it did not put me off, and I am picky about smell of products I wear. It just smells like tea tree oil to me, not too medicinal.

I can tell you with certainty that NONE of the major-label products in the local stores worked for me. I don't get dandruff really bad, but I do get it regularly - especially in colder weather.

It just drives me CRAZY that I wasted enough money on this toner alone that I could have bought a whole new printer. So, why did I spend so much on toner - because I've only had to replace the toner TWICE over the life of the printer and have gotten hundreds, if not thousands of prints out of each cartridge. So, naturally I'm thoroughly disappointed that I only got a dozen prints out of this one before it has started to go bad - thats an average of $9 per page. Time for this printer to go to the grave.

The first part of the series seemed a bit stretched, and a few loose ends never got tied by the end.There is some romance between the two main characters that is somewhat graphic (nudity), so I wouldn't suggest this for under 17. The action and effects are awesome. Full out.All in all, the $50 is worth the cost of this series.

It does not come in separate packeged DVDs with an art box, instead it comes in like a book or album form. It has 5 pages, first 4 contain the 26 episode DVDs (8DVDs) and last one has the movie Worrior (9th DVD). The art cover itself is beutiful. Its a collector's item, laminated and everything.

I used my postal scale to compare the weight of a genuine \\"HP - 40\\" with these. My \\"used-up\\" one was only 3-4 grams lighter than brand-new and the new one was spot-on the same weight.

It is a white box special \\"compatible\\" cartridge. It is NOT a genuine HP cartridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"The best part of the book is the forward written by Walter Cronkite - in itself is of important to journalism and our first amendment rights.If you're going to by this book for the two audio CDs in order to \\"Relive the Events That Stopped Our Lives. . .,\\" don't. The audio CDs are mostly a narrative, read a bit over dramatically by Bill Kurtis. The actual news broadcasts and historical audio has been edited down to modern-day 30-second sound bites, as if we're too dumb to listen to anything longer. It would have been far better to provide *at least* five minutes of uninterrupted audio so we could experience some of the tension and awe of the first moon landing, the assassination of a president or the launch of an invasion. I can hear Bill Kurtis just about any day of the week on TV. We are of an age where technology can help us re-present history in significant chunks. Too bad this book and audio CDs don't do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept, Poor Realization","review":"The book itself contains the expected photos from the events. The accompanying text seemed appropriate for someone with little or no knowledge of 20th century history. While this is not necessarily a fault, it reduces the value of the book to those of us familiar with at least the broad outlines and major events.But the CDs are seriously annoying. Since these accompany a book, I expected that the book would provide the context (date/time/source of the broadcast, and perhaps some historical background) and the CDs themselves would contain minimal narration. Instead, I'd estimate there's five minutes of narration-blather for every minute of historical recording. And blather it is-- often irritatingly banal, platitudinous, and cliched.Did I mention that the narrator sometimes actually talks OVER the historical recordings? This book/recording package could have been so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Although purchased a a gift for Christmas 1998 for my Mother, she was hard pressed to even get a glimse of the book with all my sibblings there ages 35-45!

They played a particular excerpt to let the audience get a feel for what the book was about. The one they happened to choose was the Oklahoma City Bombing. This broadcast brought tears to my eyes yet again as I remembered where I was when I heard this terrible news and exactly how it hit me and affected me. I know the many \\"We Interrupt this Broadcasts\\" will make others feel this way too. It isn't just a tearjerker; it's a remembrance and a memorial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, would recommend strongly","review":"This book is a wonderful collection of time stoping events in both the US and the world. I have used this resource in my 5th grade class a number of times and highly recommend it for anyone's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth borrowing from a library","review":"If you like the sound of A&E copyreader Bill Kurtis's voice, you'll love this CD collection. If you want to experience the drama of a historical broadcast firsthand, you'll be very frustrated by it. You just get interested in the 15-second beginning of a Pearl Harbor report, for example, when the historic voice fades out and a DIFFERENT 15-second soundbite from a later report fades in. Then it's back to Kurtis, who actually makes the U.S. entry into WWII melodramatic. Nice idea, poorly executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Keep True to the Title","review":"I have a previous edition of this book. It covered the Diana death, and I believe that is where it stopped. My complaint with the book is only that, as the topics progresses closer to current times, the interruptions became less \\"spontaneous.\\"The book's premise was to provide the first live broadcast interruption that the public heard, to create the same chills that people felt, to relive the first realization of the shocking event just as it happened. By the time the book got to Dianna's death, the news clips became more general, more like an end of the year re-cap of what had happened, instead of the first terror-filled report that something had gone wrong.But a great book, other than that! Perhaps the problem has been fixed in this newer edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, not great!","review":"Not as spectacular as I hoped. the writing is a bit choppy at times, and disjointed.

Also, the photo of the Apollo 11 launch is glaringly wrong. Coupled with the interminable lead-ins by Bill Kurtis, this is a disappoinment for $35+.

Compiling them all creates practically an entire album's worth of additional material. These b-sides are mostly a mixture of Flaming Pie era songs and older 80s songs that didn't make it to completion at the time for various reasons. Young Boy Pt.2 contains not only the excellent title track, but also another Steve Miller/McCartney composition that is FAR superior to the Used To Be Bad track on the album. The other track contained in part 2 of the Oobu Joobu series is Atlantic Ocean, an updated version of a recording from the post-Press To Play unreleased recording sessions. It isn't the greatest of the collection of 80s songs that appears on Flaming Pie's singles, but it is interesting to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very solid product","review":"I've read some folks who say this is difficult to set up.

Knowing a little about communist influence and tactics is essential to be able to read between the lines of the author's anti-communism and his resort to one sided propaganda. If you can sort out the facts from the unfortunate anti-communist babel it is a helpful book. For every criticism of the Communist it is easy to point out the exact kind of tactic used by the supporters of the anti-communists on every issue. I am no sympathizer with Communist tactics as Stalin ruined any chance of the United States having a left-wing party to counteract American imperialism.

So I know that people who consider themselves purists will say \\"why did you tamper with it? We want the original version.\\" Well, the version that was on the show was not the original version, you know - that's the version that MTV tampered with.

And then, well, something went horribly, horribly wrong. The end result? AEon Flux: The Complete Animated Series.The great thing about those initial episodes was their complete lack of context. The viewer was thrust into a world entirely different than ours, but still recognizable. We were given some characters, a plot, and no dialogue whatsoever; we had to figure out what was going on for ourselves. The big mistake, of course, is giving the characters context, giving them dialogue. Suddenly the mystery, the challenge, of the series is gone, and we're left with nothing more than another cartoon-- and not one that's in any way interesting. I gave it my best shot, but I couldn't even manage to finish watching it.

The story itself is loaded with symbolism - from a scale model of one character's life, to a stone wall constructed in a meadow, to classical music played by the main character - all of which add necessary depth and personality to an otherwise convoluted plot, not unlike life.At length the story makes one question one's own reality. This is definitely not a book to impart a \\"warm fuzzy,\\" but rather to push the reader to consider his or her own free will and circumstance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"Someone gave me this book alonf with Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS, telling me that both were part of a group of talented young writers. Let me tell you, Paul Auster couldn't be Michael Cunningham's copy editor. There are more cliches in the first 5 pages of this book than you could find in a dime store mystery novel. The characters are flat, the story ludicrous. It tries hard to be some kind of masonic allegory but is so obvious it becomes aggravating. I read the NY Times review that praises the book for it's series of \\"ricocheting\\" coincidences, and I kept waiting for that to happen. IN fact, nothing ricochets. Everything thuds. IF you are a lover of language, don't bother with Auster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary Crap","review":"I must be getting old. I have no patience for literary works of fiction anymore. They suck; they're slow and boring and so unentertaining that I want to throw them in the fireplace. What makes this one so bad is that I'm not sure its even literary. I've never read Auster before but got a recommendation to start with this one. It's hard to find any enjoyment in a novel where the main character runs away from society, is tasked to do a hard, endless job, doesn't accomplish it and then kills himself. Oops, I gave away the ending. Believe me, read this book and you'd wish the guy would have done it 100 pages ago and saved you all the trouble. It's not like you're going to learn anything about him, you or life in general--you're just going to be wasting your time. This one is a real stinker and it doesn't hold up over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange but full of supense","review":"At first glance the book seems to have no real point but the more you read the more you get a feeling of a deeper meaning the novel reveals. The unlogical structure and the unreal plot is meant to show how much one's life can depend on fate, how much it is influenced by chance. In any case it is a thrilling book that you shouldn't start reading at night because you won't be able to put it down until you have read it to the very last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Played me for a sucker to the very end.","review":"It's a fast read and doesn't require much energy, which is a good thing. An unsatisfying end reduces the whole to pretentious kitsch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleak, Bleak, Bleak....","review":"This book is very bleak. The first forty pages are the usual Auster dilema (letting oneself somehow slip into a transient and insubstantial existence...without knowing why). But things pick up and a very imaginative plot ensues. Everybody is in control of their own destiny? Whoever that was, I hope they realize that people die every day (and I don't think their deaths are all suicides). This book is bleak. Very, very bleak. But in its bleakness underlies wild imaginative textures, and in that contrast it has a certain charm that is...ineffable. A tip of the hat to Auster. Fiction as fiction should probably be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"The outline: A lost soul spends the first ten percent of this book driving aimlessly across the US. He meets a young gambler with whom he then is forced into indentured servitude after losing at poker to a pair of rich eccentrics. I won't divulge the entirely predictable ending because there would then be no reason for reading the book. Auster explains and connects nothing, not the genesis of his protaganist's aimlessness, not the scenery or atmosphere of his automotive trip, not the what or why of his imprisonment nor the reason or mechanism by which his friend came to the end that he did. His style is pedantic and his reluctance or inability to conclude any theme bespeaks a writer not long remembered."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it a 1 star because there was no 0-star option.","review":"There is nothing original about this book. It seems to be just an extension of some junior high dream that Auster once had, before he was allowed to drive and before he learned that we are all in control of our own destiny. The plot is completely unrealistic, absurd, and downright uninteresting. The only reason I read to the end was because, fortunately he had the sense to keep it short. The only good part of this book was when Nashe and Pozzi were staying at the Plaza in NYC. There was a certain anticipation that kept stringing you along. Anticipation of the card game and of the inevitable, trite class clash. Both of which end up to be major disappointments. I wouldn't recommend this inane book to anyone but the most morally inept individuals who may derive from the book that all wrongs must be accounted for in the end, or more simply that gambling is dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've read","review":"This book steams. It is boring, poorly written, the characterisation is almost non-existent and the underlying metaphor bizarre and barely comprehensible. It sets itself up as some kind of existential fable but more or less fails on all counts.I'd heard Auster was worth a read, but whoever told me that was very wrong. This could have been written by a grade school student. Extremely shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auster is not a writer.","review":"This book got a snide, lukewarm review in the November 22, 2010 New Yorker magazine and probably deserved it.

He is not a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality, does the job","review":"We have the Rolbak for a basketball hoop but we also have a wash full of Saguaros and other cacti, which means one Oops and you have a dead ball.

Does not stay closed. Looked to send it in for warranty fix or new clasp but that would cost $28 for S&H...inexpensive watch, I guess you DO get what you pay for. Disappointed with their warranty service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive, but a poor performer","review":"True to it's design as a Rolex knock-off, this is an attractive watch. Mine was the blue dial with the blue bezel. Substantial, but not overly large/heavy. I wore it quite often for the 9 months I owned it, but it took the wear & tear quite well.Unfortunately, the watch simply would not keep accurate time. Either it was running too fast (gaining something like 5 minutes a day) or it would stop no matter how regularly it was worn. It was frustrating enough when the automatic feature wouldn't keep it running when it was taken off over night. But when it wouldn't keep runnning even after I began wearing it 24 hours a day, I gave it away.As others have said, beware Invictas with automatic movements. This is a very nice looking watch (disregardig the hokey magnifying window over the date), but I bought it to be a watch, not just a piece of jewelry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invicta 8929","review":"Invicta makes a great watch and the 8929 follows suit in great style.

Ha.","review":"What a horrible disappointment this book was. Maurice had visions of an honorable life in the legion, it was not as he expected. I had expectations of a realistic gritty portrayal of life as a legionnaire. Instead what I got was a tale of a perfumed prince, a rich boy, who whines unceasingly through the entire book. He never fires his weapon, he never serves on the front, the farthest he ever has to road-march is 15 miles, and he gets to sleep under a roof most of the time. Still, he complains. At three months he decides to run away. That's right after only three months he decides to split. If you are interested in hearing about a rich boy whine about how mean everyone is to him this is the book for you. I frankly wouldn't use it to wipe my ass, and not just because I read the Kindle version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plantronics USB STEREO HEADSET ( 64603-03 )","review":"Yes its USB, but you have to use the Plantronics software that you have to download from their site since you are not plugging directly into your soundcard. Their application is horrible and not user friendy. Chatting sounded very tinny and I couldn't get my volume high enough to hear people. The headphones are a little bit better for listening to stereo music then their Audio 60 headset. For the price and inconvenience, this headset isn't worth the money. Buy the non USB Stereo 60!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money.","review":"The manual sent with my handset mentions that a PIN # needs to be entered before registering with the base unit.

Two lights lit-up for a bit than went off. I than released the button on the base unit and the handset was than registered.Other than that, this is a great additional handset.

If you don't use one it's not that big of a deal but I use a wired ear jack because it's just easier and I consider it a must have. Anyway, once you plug that in, there's a good chance the phone will NOT sit in the cradle as it should. Which means it won't be recharging. You'll have to pick it up and plug in the ear jack each time the phone rings. Such a design flaw is unforgivable. I've experienced drop calls as well but that may be more of a skype thing than the phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philips DECT/VOIP additional handset","review":"The Philips DECT/VOIP additional handset complements the VOIP 841 system and is a certified Skype phone. This is a beautifully crafted little phone with a nice clear screen and a huge speaker on the back. you really need the speaker when you make a telephone call,or I do anyway, because I can't hear out of the receiver very well. This must be considered last year's model now because I can't find it in the stores anywhere. This phone makes Skype seem like any other phone service and allows you to keep track of your Skype account at a glance. Its menus are easy for even me to follow. Installation of the phone is easy except when the instructions tell you to press the button to search for a signal. The instructions are misleading. I had to call Philips helpline to finally get it going. You press the button until the lights flash and then you let go immediately and it comes right on.

I'm running linux on my powerbook and it works fine with that and it's possible to get most of the buttons working using xmodmap and imwheel with an appropriate X config of course.The power saving feature of the mouse is slightly annoying, but I can live with that.My major gripe with this mouse is that there is no on/off switch. It would seem to me that producing a bluetooth mouse is targeted at people using an external mouse on the move (As all the ibook and powerbook users in the above reviews testifies). The fact that the mouse works with any bluetooth hub/dongle/etc is additional weight to this argument in my opinion. However, the lack of an on/off switch is ridiculous in this situation as it means that you have to take the batteries out when your on the move because any small movement will make the mouse think its being used and hence not be in powersave mode.Puggy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with WinXP SP2","review":"Avoid Logitech products if you have Windows XP Service Pack 2 installed.

Connected it to my router, and I have a 4mbps cable connection.... works perfectly with skype....in brazil skype isn't so popular... and skype doesn't have skypein numbers for my city! I use skypeout credits only.... have nothing to complain, considering the price of the calls. About the landline.... works perfectly too.... as any normal dect phone! Many reviewers said about the volume level... and it is adjustable... don't worry... and you can configure the phone for you favorite line (landline or skypeout) for outgoing calls, so you don't need to choose every time!!!!!I sure recommend this product for everyone... and have to say that amazon was excelent either!!!See ya!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product!!!","review":"The Skype phone have made using Skype so much easier.

This message has stayed their for almost two years and I still have found no solution. Please google Philips VOIP841 The system is starting up and you will see many blogs from people like me that can't seem to find a solution. I hope this review gets to somebody at Philips who can address the issue and solve the problem.With regards to buying or not buying, it is a risk game, red or black, pair or impair .... if you are lucky and it works you will enjoy the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad it is poorly made","review":"The phone is actually a good phone and rarely requires a reboot, which is a real challenge for a Skype phone. But the handset quickly start to show electric issues. To the point where it does not charge any more, or when it charges, kills any kind of rechargeable batteries in a day. After 8 months this phone was totally unusable. Too bad was not a cheap phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Skype","review":"I work from home and spend a lot of time on the phone. This phone works great! It handles Skype better then any other phone I have seen and also takes care of your land line in one nice package.The phone works very well with Skype. When you get a voice mail in Skype, it flashes and lets you know. The reason I have not given in 5 star is that it is somewhat buggy. I'm not sure if its Skype or the phone. Sometime you will punch in a number and it just comes back and say \\"call failed\\". I then have to use my land line to complete the call. I have also gotten the phone to lock up before too. Its not perfect but it does the job.As far a land lines go, its a good phone too. It is able to tell when I have a voice mail on land line and notifies me of this.The best phone for Skype that I have ever seen. I wanted to buy the extra phones for this system but they are very hard to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple solution","review":"Excellent skype phone.Very easy to install ,took just 2 mins.I bought this phone from the U.S ,to use it in Kuwait ,i had to but a seperate step down voltage converter (220 v to 110 v).Voice clarity is very good.Battery has to be constantly recharged"},{"rating":"1","title":"The phone died on me.","review":"Bought this unit for my parents in India and less than 1 week and the handset died.

It ended up an expensive purchase for a so so service... to call someone I actually need to try several times until it gets the call through... Even the actual box skype put a notice saying that this is not a replacement for a regular phone then I guess it's my mistake to think that a vOIP phone costing over $100 could be as good as a \\"real one\\". The good side if you can establish a call the sound is clear and no interruptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"skype phone","review":"this phone only works when you call out; sometimes when a person has had an old cordless phone calls, there is an annoying echo; and the phone only rings once. It is great to use after my computer is shut down; I can still use skype; it needs to have a better system for audio; the volume is not loud at all and if there is echoing, forget hearing anything; the worst is that I bought it and opened the package; the buyer would not take it back because I thought it was defective; I would have to send a brand new phone to the manufacturer instead of getting a refund for a not so good product. very disappointed in both product and the seller. Now I am stuck with an expensive phone that works some of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone if you're not physically disabled","review":"Nice phone with great sound quality but I do not recommend it to anyone with a physical disability. When a call comes in, you have just over 10 seconds to answer or it goes to voice mail. This cannot be changed. I haven't successfully answered a single call in the month I've had it. I am really surprised that Philips did not have the disabled in mind on a modern product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to use with Skype, drops calls","review":"With so many rave reviews, you'd think it's easy to use this phone, and you'd get your bang for the buck. But you just don't.This phone makes it super hard to even see your contacts from Skype. You have to enter ALL of them, one by one, all over again. Very un-userfriendly. Once you manage to have entered everyone, and you pray it's correct, you make a call. First 3-4 calls were OK, even though echo cancelation wasn't the best out there (see my review of the IPEVO FREE1 USB PHONE). And then it started dropping calls. As in 80% of calls.Verdict: not good for Skype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned as defective","review":"Returned this product to Amazon because the handset could never find the base.

I've rechecked all connections to cable modem, skype modem, router. Still have this issue.Without skype modem connected to my router, I get download speeds of 13MB to 17MB.

Even though this is the slowest DVD of the set so far, it is an awesome show and I will have every DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm giving this dvd a 1 star not because all three episodes are crappy but because 15 is such a let down. Don't get me wrong, 13 and 14 are a must see but in 15 way too much is changed within the personalities of the charachcters it just seems like there are totally different writers this time.

I read it on a weekend when the weather was a bit out of sorts so that might have added to the effect of the book. But nevertheless, it was thrilling. All the characters were written well, as was the setting of the island and surrounding areas. Made me want to move there. At any rate, the action never really stops through then entire novel. Its hard for me to find a great adventure, other than Clive Cussler or some of Koontz's latest work. So when I found this, it was perfect for the weekend. I have read both Relic and the sequel and loved them as well, and this work was no less thrilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book because it kept my interest right from the start.

I highly recommend this as a fun summer read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very thrilling, edge of your seat book","review":"I liked this book very much. This is the first time I've read a book by these authors but I was very impressed. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, a masterpiece of suspense, I couldn't put it down","review":"Lincoln Child and Douglas J. Preston are two fine authors in peek condition. This book covers multiple genres. Malin Hatch returns to a treasure ridden island his father owned. Malin falls in love with a french diver, discovers the body of his brother and learns the true nature of the awesome treasure hidden in the island. This tome dives into the deep recesses of greed, and insanity as the expedition falls out of Malin's hands and into the hands of the captain, obsessed with 'Saint Micheal's sword'. It's a gripping story that keeps you guessing until the horrible thruth of the island, and the treasure is slowly revealed."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Fun!","review":"I've read other books by Child/Preston (Relic and Reliquary) and found them fun but the writing just a little rough.But Riptide, now--Wow! They have really hit their stride on this one. The pacing is great and the thought they put into how to approach the diabolically clever puzzle of the treasure pit is impressive.I thoroughly enjoyed this book right to the end, even sneaking out to sit in my car at work to finish it!In the first few pages of the book, we are introduced to the main character, Malin Hatch, as a boy, and see the gruesome tragedy that shadows the rest of his life, but that will not be fully explained until the end of the book. Then we skip forward 30 years. Ladies and gentlemen, THAT's what I call a \\"hook!\\" I was certainly hooked until the very end.I'm certain you will enjoy this roller coaster ride of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes I can give this book 5 stars.....","review":"When a book is as exciting and it's all based on something real....how can you not enjoy it 5 stars worth..The wonderful thing about Childs and Preston is that they take the time to research something real like the Oak Island Treasure Pit and then they weave the story..and the story is great...I read the book out loud to my husband I loved it that much...The experience and the setting of the book Riptide is something to be savored more than once...You will wonder if anyone will get to the \\"bottom\\" of the mystery...and you will be there to cheer when a new level is reached...enjoy...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read albeit you knew the outcome","review":"Love these authors together, always a great little read that will keep you going back for more. Still have to say the Pendergast novels are the very best...so more of them if you please! You'll enjoy it...take it to the beach or on an airplane...you won't be bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fictional Story, but very similar to real-world island!","review":"I found the story of Riptide fascinating. The island described by the authors is fictional, but immediately reminded me of Oak Island, Nova Scotia where there is an actual pit called the 'Money Pit' where pirate treasure is supposed to be buried. To date, it has never been successfully uncovered, and there is a trap built into this actual pit where it fills with seawater, thus keeping people out of it. So far, it has been excavated to 150', and has been responsible for 6 deaths. After learning about the actual pit located on Oak Island, and knowing about the possibility of true Pirate treasure located there, reading RIPTIDE was all the more exciting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean Koontz and \\"The Goonies\\" Meet!","review":"Have you ever wondered what suspense/terror could do to a really great pirate story? Well, here it is. Treasure Island is tame in comparison. Although it isn't a \\"horror\\" novel per se, I often found my mouth hanging open at the imagery this book conveyed, especially with Hatch's dead brother. Although the ending was not the most original ever for a story of this genre, I nevertheless felt very satisfied by the technological details and the storyline development. Amazingly, I read the last 200 pages in one sitting. That does not happen often:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rip Roaring Good","review":"Very good book. This story was a story of brothers mixed with mystery, horror and action. Recommended. Better than Mount Dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read almost all of the Pendergast novels and really liked them. I purchased this book mainly based on the reviews on Amazon and because I like the authors others works. However, I must say this book was pretty boring. The first chapter hooks you, but then not much exciting happens for the next 300 pages or so. Once I got to the climax of the book it got a little more exciting but still I was pretty disappointed. I'll keep reading Preston/Child and look forward to their new works, but I cannot recommend this one as an exciting adventure/thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Back Pendergast!","review":"I seem to be in the minority here, but I didn't like it! I absolutely loved Relic and Reliquary, but this book completely lost my interest. I didn't like any of the characters, there was no spark that I could see between the two love interests, and the story just wasn't what I expected. I'm eagerly awaiting the new book in July and even more so the next one in which Pendergast is supposed to come back. At least that's what I'm told!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WATER PIT - WHO CARES!?!?!?","review":"I've read all of Preston and Childs books and I have to say this was the least interesting. Characters were hard to like, the dangers with the water pit, boring. The book's set up took to long, I only finished it because I wanted to know what happened and frankly when I did ... I didn't care. Not one of their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardy Boys Mysteries for Adults","review":"I was humming the tv show theme the whole time. If you enjoy GI Joe book and records, or Hardy/Nancy Drew books, grab this book. It's got PIRATES \\"Arrrg!\\", TREASURE \\"Oooh\\", BOOBYTRAPS \\"Yikes!\\" But man, it let's you down. Great setup, and the the whole damn souffle falls flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up . . .","review":"Sorry to say I'm giving up on reading Riptide. I slogged about halfway through, begrudgingly, over a couple months. The story's premise is good: a mysterious island where people have disappeared or been killed and the promise of hidden treasure. And I've read a lot of Preston-Child novels, but Riptide just isn't holding my interest. The pace seems incredibly slow and the characters just so-so. No one stands out as someone to root for. To this point there's no romance to speak of and not a lot of action. I gave the book one star because I had to rate it. Sorry, guys. This one goes into the donation box. Glad I picked up the hardcover at resale . . . Sharon"},{"rating":"1","title":"what's with all the good reviews","review":"Seen Jurassic Park. Done DaVinci Code. This book steals from both. Complete with big storm. Nerd who gets killed. A Monster in the form of a pit instead of a Raptor. History lessons to keep us intrigued.... Do we really need to read this rehash? Better to weed the garden. This genre has run its course. Total waste of time....very skimmable and without any merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ripping yarn!","review":"A thrilling, old-fashioned mystery with suitable assortment of characters (troubled & emotionally scarred heroes, female figures hovering on the borders of love-interest and important characters, treasure, history & legends, a momomaniac villain, others esp. from the heroe's past), interesting themes (a rather pseudo-scientific mystery at the core, and several major & minor adventures), and an open ending! Recommended for a fresh reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining/Fun read - not life changing!","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a simple, entertaining, adventurous read. While I would not rate this book as one of the 'best ever', I did enjoy it. The story is based, somewhat, on the Legend of Oak Island and the infamous Money Pit and the fact that we would finally find out what was at the bottom of that pit, at least fictionally speaking. There was a good mix of characters, although they lacked depth, a good mix of adventure, mystery, and action. I would have rated the book higher if the ending was not so anticlamitic. I had hoped that everything was leading to a big WOW for and ending, but instead all I got was an Oh!?! The ending was not what I had expected for a Child/Preston book. With that said, I would still encourage everyone who enjoys the action/adventure style of writting to check this book out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun...Just Fun","review":"The only way to describe Riptide is fun - no deep meaning, no literary significance. Just fun. Preston and Child team up to deliver an action-packed, entertaining tale of lost treasure and greed. Unlike many adventure novelists, Preston and Child create fully realized characters and intricate plot lines. Many novelists in this genre (Crichton, Cussler) have been writing for years but haven't come up with anything as well written and entertaining as Riptide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story ends up goofy","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed the first half of Riptide. A great setup for a rollicking adventure story. Complete with pirates and hidden treasure. But towards the middle it starts to lag. The Preacher is a very shallow character as is his wife our hereos first love. It picks up again for a while but there are just too many shallow characters to keep track of. I had to read the last paragraph several times to believe they could end the book in such a Beavis and Butthead fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I was skeptical about reading this one. A book about pirates and a treasure hunt seemed like more of a kid's book. But this book has a very good storyline. And I like how it brings together all these otherwise bizarre, unexplainable mysteries throughout the book to one very believable cause. Action, adventure, science and even romance. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and smooth!!","review":"A good read for readers who like fast and smooth plots.

This is the most incredibly BAD audio experience you'll ever have. Dialogue is near-impossible to hear. Music suddenly swells and threatens the life of your speakers. Shrill sounds fade away into near-silence, as you lean-in to the screen/stereo, hoping to catch a word or two.....It's brain-numbingly bad. I've never heard anything so awful in my life before, and hope never to again.I'm not trying to steer anyone away from the film, it's a wonderful black comedy, and certainly one of the most influential horror films of all time (setting the stage for the now-common 'slasher film'). As well, the picture on this DVD is excellent, nice and crisp, wonderful colours, and a few great trailers which are icing on the cake.Just... be warned about the audio.Hopefully"},{"rating":"1","title":"An early gory slasher flick with a mediocre DVD transfer","review":"This is one of the first gory slasher films from the early seventies, which inspired the many films of this type in the eighties. It's a tale of a group of people after a precious land development in a bay, who kill one another for control of it. There are some good effects from that era, especially an axe in a face scene. The ending is surprising, and the film generally has a unique feel to it. The DVD is below average. The picture is not good, and the extras are just factoids on the film. A good horror film with an below average DVD transfer, but it is fairly cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could hardly hear a full sentence","review":"I usually interpret criticisms of sound quality as coming from people who are hard-core audiophiles with unreasonably high expectations. In this case, the criticisms are absolutely valid. I can't even really tell you the plot of this movie (at least based on the dialogue), because I could hardly hear a complete sentence. It was an abyssmal experience to say the least, by the end I had a headache from turning the volume up and down so many times.I agree with the reviewer who felt betrayed by Image for releasing this DVD.

HOWEVER! The soundtrack is abominable. As others have said, you have to constantly turn the volume up and down to hear what's going on. But in way too many scenes, the volume doesn't matter because the sound is so choppy and distorted you can't hear it at any level. Image should've eaten the loss and passed on releasing this DVD to its loyal fan base. As a consumer, my faith in Image is now shaken and who knows what crap they may push in the future? I know it's only one disappointment in a history of prestige, but I remember the first time I saw commercials on cable channel AMC. Twas the beginning of the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bava, lousy sound","review":"I don't really consider myself a really big fan of Italian horror, seeing as how, for an example, I feel Lucio Fulci is supremely overrated. But this one has a special place in my heart simply because it's so different plot-wise. Sure, everyone dies a grisly death (it's gory even by today's standards, and this was 1971!), but it's all driven by greed, as people knock others off to try to get the rights to a bayside mansion. We get to learn about each character and why they might be a killer (save for the prerequisite doomed teens) and Bava peppers the film with neat cut-aways and lead-ins that intersperse perfectly with the next scene. Very fun, and very different. Too bad we can't get any decent sound on the DVD, and the picture isn't that good either. Pick it up anyway!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much for the money!","review":"I loved this DVD, and wish Reader's Digest would make many more like it.

There does come a time when eye cream is no longer a take-it-or-leave-it indulgence but a really-must-use-it. When that time comes depends a great deal on genes, climate and, yes, friends, age.So, if you've reached the point where those lovely creases are about to become more than traces of a smile better get serious about some moisturizer for around those peepers. Often, you'll use one eye cream for day and another for night. A lighter cream that absorbs quickly is preferable for day wear as one can easily and quickly apply makeup over it. If the skin around your eyes truly needs TLC you might consider a heavier cream for night.With the percentage of beeswax in this cream it's a tad heavy for day use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flavored Water","review":"Lime flavored Hint is my favorite of all the varieties.

You won't find any in this book. What you will find is a protagonist whose mantra might come from Marlowe's \\"Dr. Faustus\\": \\"Why, this is Hell, nor am I out of it.\\"Grim stuff, to be sure, but brilliantly done. There is a great deal of white space in this book, because there are scores of short chapters, and because Didion has a rare quality: she doesn't write one word more than necessary. And what she writes will go straight to the core of your being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with Kenneth Ryan","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with Kenneth Ryan's review. This book was \\"recommended\\" reading in one of my English classes at UCLA several years ago, and I bought it, but just now picked it up for a read. The problem is that the main character is so vapid that I simply did not CARE what happened to her. It has always been my firm belief that one must identify with, care about, or even despise a main character to care enough to keep reading. This novel was painful to finish; who cares what happens to these people? I agree that whatever \\"splash\\" the book made in its day came from the shock value it would have had because of the amorality of its characters. It's hard to shock us these days, and the book is now just plain uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obscure and bleak....an unpleasant reading experience","review":"I should have heeded the warning at the back of the book. \\"Play It As It Lays\\" didn't sound like something I would enjoy. But I thought, \\"What the heck.....Joan Didion is a celebrated writer and PIAIL was after all shortlisted for the National Book Award\\". Having slogged through it and some USD11 poorer, I only regret not having gone with my gut. I was bored to death with Maria Wyeth and her decadent family and friends. They're an unsympathetic lot and deserve everything they get. The message may be biting and stark, but I found Didion's prose, with their \\"quick cross cuts and rapid dissolves\\", irritating and obscure. It's like watching a bad Robert Altman movie that's shot with a hand-held camera. It gave me a bad headache. Stay away......unless you're a Didion fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first 2 lines reek of the english department","review":"The first 2 lines are: \\"What makes Iago evil? some people ask.

The woman walked in small mincing steps and kept raising her hand to shield her eyes from the vacant sunlight. As if in trance Maria watched the woman, for it seemed to her then that she was watching the dead still center of the world, the quintessential intersection of nothing.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The same dream, always in color","review":"This book illustrates the difference between important and merely influential. It virtually invented the vague/portentious prose style that signifies boredom and alienation, and appeared as late as 1996 on the liner notes of Rage Against the Machine's \\"Evil Empire\\".But it isn't very good. The dimestore existentialism aged, badly. Didion's spare writing now seems phony and juvenile. The same characters experiencing the same emotions have been rehashed so many times, often in superior forms, that what was innovative in the seventies doesn't really cut it anymore. Not that it was very original in its time, coming as it did after thirty years of Sartre and ten of Antonioni. Not to mention Horace McCoy's terrific 1935 novel \\"They Shoot Horses Don't They\\", popularized in a Hollywood film (coincidentally?) only a year before \\"Play It\\"'s publication.A minor footnote to a still-evolving trend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much There, There","review":"I bought this novel since it was listed on Time Magazine's list of the Best 100 Novels written in English since 1923. I have no idea why Time Magazine selected it for that esteemed honor. It was mercifully short (easily finished in a couple of hours, if that), but otherwise provided modest rewards for those looking for high-quality literature. Proving a sketch of the morally-bankrupt Los Angeles drug and sex scene of the 1960s, primarily through the internal mental narrative of 31-year-old would-be actress Maria Wyeth, Play It As It Lays doesn't seem to plow any new ground in 20th century literature. Its description of Maria's poorly-performed illegal abortion is the most memorable scene in an otherwise forgettable pastiche of characters and settings.

There is no question. This book and Less Than Zero are like estranged cousins living similarly damaged lives in the same city. This book is arguably more subdued, as it takes place in the 60s and doesn't end with the kind of horrific imagery that the Zero does. It is brisk, semi-brutal (not really compared to Ellis) and more than a little harrowing. A woman is confounded, side-lined, and generally made to feel the pain of a male-dominated, coldly hedonistic culture. She must have an abortion, gets harangued on movie sets, wanders aimlessly, lies around in bed a lot feeling blue. It is depressing, for sure, but well written with a kind of needle-point clarity Ellis surely must have found intriguing, as he pilfered it for his own. If Less than Zero was too much for you, you might find something to \\"enjoy\\" here. It is pretty ennui-ridden, but is over quickly. A kind of void of a novel.

Maybe it's a very good book, but only one star due to the deceptive title under which the book is being advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Candlelight music from diverse torches......","review":"Ok, now what instrumental aggregation would choose to create a work with two cover recordings each by Neil Young, Tom Waits, Django Reinhart and Radiohead? Then round off with a little Ornette Coleman, Leonard Cohen, Billy Strayhorn and Horace Silver?The music is cleanly and beautifully recorded. The timbre of the instruments is conveyed so clearly you will swear you can hear the placing of fingers on the fretboards. Crystalline. A calm lake surface is indeed the perfect metaphor.Unlike their eponymous CD, there is no percussion here and, perhaps correspondingly, the pace is more relaxed. The likelihood that any given listener will be familiar enough with ALL the authors to \\"pick up\\" on many of these melodies is rather remote. For example, this is not \\"Southern Man\\" or \\"Heart of Gold\\" era Neil Young. So you will perhaps be enticed to seek out the originals, to see where the inspiration in these tunes came from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, terrible study aid","review":"Walton and Rockoff do a great job of describing American economic history. Unfortunately, the textbook reads more like a novel than a college textbook. There are very few study aids throughout the book which makes studying for tests very difficult. There are no 'key words' or margin points, and there is no highlighting of key points by bold font or italics.Additionally, if you have the masochistic pleasure of taking a test based on the publisher's 'instructor's test bank', you will soon realize that the tests are simply recollection and factoid exams, as opposed to a well developed 'principles' and 'concepts' exam that other textbooks use.This textbook is poor college class material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love was in Bloom","review":"What can you say about any book whose subject is one of the top five performers in show business history? And written by his wife and brother-in-law. It's a love story providing episodes and incidents that others never publicized. A welcome tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economic analysis essays excellent","review":"The essays dealing with economics were excellent. The writers pointed out that the US was holding much of the allies' treasury bills, especially England's; in fact, the Federal Reserve Board warned US banks in 1918 of holding too many of the Allies' securites. The discussion on the peace negotiations and treaties was also excellent, pointing out the problem was not placing harsh terms on the Germans, but not enforcing the treaty. The writers also correctly linked both World Wars together into a 30 year war, and pointed out that Germany never accepted that it had lost the War. I also agreed with the book's premise that the US retreating into isolationism was the first domino sending the world to the 2nd world war. They logically portrayed how the belligerents' ending positioned set up World War II."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Historical Work","review":"This book does a horrible job of documenting the history of World War I. It has multiple errors, and none of the authors cite any of the works that their essays were developed from, or provide evidence to support their conclusions. There is a selection of works for further reading but there is not a works cited, or footnotes. The problem with this work is that someone who picks up this book to learn about World War I is going to get a lot of poor information, and information that is completely wrong. For a book that carries the tag of Oxford, this is unexceptable. Do not purchase this book, there are many more books out there that properly cite their research and comprehensively explore the causes and effects of the events of World War I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel with Dr. Sterling on an Inspirational Journey","review":"Dr. Anthony Sterling's short story autobiography brings you directly to the center of trauma and the surrealism of being a New York City orthopaedic surgeon...In the face of insurmountable tragedy, Dr. Sterling's compassionate personality and hopefulness are profoundly interwoven throughout his professional and personal endeavors.

Lawanna Blackwell is a gifted author who spends the requisite time to craft novels that are encouraging, heart warming and true to life. Unlike so many authors who write in this genre, Ms. Blackwell's work does not assault/insult the intelligence of her readership.I have read every book of hers published to date and each leaves me waiting with bated breath for the next. If the reader of this review seeks trashy and poorly written romances published under the guise of \\"christian, inspirational romance\\", then Ms. Blackwell wouldn't be the author of choice.

The book introduces each step under the traditional 4-step transportation planning process in a separate chapter, in addition to topics such as discrete choice analysis. The way the topics are treated is perfect for someone with previous familiarity with the subject; it would be extremely difficult to hammer out all the details of transportation planning in a single 500 page volume. I would not recommend this book to the more inquisitive reader new to the subject as -in most cases- it may not explain why things are done the way they are. That said, I would strongly recommend it as a desktop reference for someone that may need a refresher on some of these topics from time to time.

As usual, he was great. It is just too bad that he wasn't singing to something that sounded like music.I admit being an old coot way down in the chaparral country of Texas who just doesn't care much for opera written since Verdi, Puccini, or even Wagner.

(2) To buy as a gift for someone you truly despise. The total lack of melody . . . the endless to the point of nausea recitative . . . negated any glimmer of praise for the creator's sticking to the story line. In fact, fans of Rostand couldn't care less about Cyrano by the time the first act had ended. Come to think of it, was there more than one act? Ultimately, who cares.

There were no videos of Martin kicking dirt or screaming at Reggie Jackson nor were there any of his early playing days with Mantle or Ford. It was basically just him talking about teamwork and how he admired Casey Stengal. All well and good but as far as this being a 'must' have for Martin fans this is a 'I can miss it'.

A comparable L lens would cost at least 2x as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Quite a fascinating look into some of the \\"secret groups\\" that some believe rule the world, also shedding light on the mind of the conspiracy theorist.

That's the same here. Tom DeFalco must have been planning a marvel comic book story rather then a Marvel novel because here he takes the X-Men and Spider-Man, The Guardians of the Galaxy, some of the 2099 heroes, and the rest of Marvel's future heroes and puts all into one book where there is little character development and too many things happening all at once which serves only to confuse the reader as to what's really going on.

In the late 1990s this is even more the case. The text should have been at least been updated as some of the route descriptions were wrong originally. Still, this book has inspired more climbing trips than any single climbing book/guide in the United States. People have thronged to these routes in the last two decades, causing them to be dubbed \\"Fifty Crowded Climbs.\\" I imagine this will not change for a long time. Though I feel the selections are not the best, but until someone does a better job it is a classic book, well worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the shelf and lore, don't use it as a guide","review":"I love this book. Bought it in Seattle when I started climbing 15 years ago. Many of the routes are really not that crowded. I spent days on end without seeing anyone on several of the routes.

Amazon was fantastic in getting them to me in 2 days...ground. Once they were installed, they sounded \\"fine\\" at a VERY low volume. Once you decide to crank it up, you have noise all over the place. Gaming? Solitaire might be ok....MOHAA or the like is another story. A couple explosions and it sounds like you've blown up the \\"sub\\".If you just want speakers to replace the PC speaker, these are for you. But if you want something with great sound and decent power, look elsewhere. I ended up with some Altec Lansing 641's, and I can tell you that I can't be happier.

Easy to set up, excellent sound. The main problem area is in the wired remote volume control, which is poorly made and prone to failure. Worse than that, Creative Labs no longer (2010) supports the product, so you can't get replacement parts. Also, the system will not work at all when the volume control is unplugged, so the whole system goes in the trash whenever the volume control fails.

This is the most pop album Graham has ever made, but for a power pop fan such as myself, that's great. Another GP album that didn't really get the attention it deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power Soul and Surreality","review":"This disc is really two sets.The first half of the disc - and I miss saying Side 1 - are note-for-note so of GP's most solid writing. Great pop tunes from the anti-pop himself - especially Little Miss Understanding, My Love's Strong, Call Me Your Doctor, and Dancing For Money.The second half (the surreal side) is one long is a hodge-podge of short, short songs woven together dealing with the headlines, AIDS, et. al. It won't appeal to everyone all the time. The only weak track in this group is I Was Wrong.I think if the momentum of the first six or seven tracks had been carried though to the whole disc, it could have bene big. But, that, in a nutshell, is a summary of GP's often brilliant career."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I had this book when I was little and I absolutely love it!

When I first got the doll, I pushed the button to hear it sing, and I assumed that once I opened the package and activated the doll, she would sing the whole song. A friend of mine who bought this doll assumed the same thing. I thought this should have been written on the outside of the box.However, this may be a good thing, otherwise I would have to listen to the song forever. I also thought the song was a bit too loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced toy that doesn't do a whole lot!","review":"My daughter asked for this at Christmas and I ordered it!

Sometimes only a spark of noise comes out and other times it gets out a few words. It made noise during the poor mailman's entire route, which doesn't make sense because it isn't supposed to play the song unless the button on her stomach is pushed. Her boots don't stay on and the microphone has been banished from the play room since it is a choking hazard for my 1 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor manufacturing of Hannah Montana doll","review":"My girls love Hannah Montana and as parents, her show is OK with us. We bought the doll knowing the girls would be too excited at Christmas. Well, one doll worked that morning but the other didn't so we switched batteries to check and then it worked. We bought new batteries, which are expensive by the way at $5 each and the doll needs 4. Now, the doll that worked initially, isn't working correctly - you have to squeeze her middle and back tight to keep the battery connection - and the one that didn't work, works only partially now. It sings about 1 line. I will be writing the manufacturer. Who knows, maybe we'll get something out of it. At least the girls still get enjoyment pretending and playing with the dolls."},{"rating":"2","title":"EAT FIRST, then watch.","review":"Or have food on hand.... Once your munchies are subdued, you'll be able to enjoy the people in this movie, which has been well described by the other reviewers.

But you can relate to them easily, even if you're not Asian (I'm not).The music is excellent too; I've been hunting for the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a foodie, you will love this movie.","review":"The food scenes in this movie are eye candy for us foodies. I love cooking and I have never seen food displayed or prepared in a movie as it is in this one.The story line is charming in its concept of how food relates to our lives and our relationships. The fact that this is a subtitled movie did not bother me at all, because the scenes with the food were so tremendous that I couldn't stop staring.If you love food you will thoroughly enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"very unusual piece of work","review":"Ang Lee's movie \\"Eat Drink Man Woman\\" is a unique story of a Taiwanese chef, who is a widower, and his three daughters who are struggling to find love while discovering themselves and connecting to each other in different ways.

However, it is quite different from the version I saw on a big theater screen. This DVD has speeded up the action and the English translation dialogue is presented in such rapid changes that it is virtually impossible to read and follow the dialogue. I was very disapointed in this DVD version and would not recommend it to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Crouching Tiger\\"","review":"This is an enjoyable movie about a real family in an intriguing, Chinese setting. Nobody can fly. There are no pretty women who can beat up an army of men. Just a real story about interesting people in an interesting place.Very funny at times, very somber at times, and engaging always. It'll also leave you wishing you were a better cook, especially if you're a man.Money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat, Drink My Kind of Movie","review":"I really enjoyed this movie for several reasons. First, I could watch a skilled cook for hours. The technique just fascinates me.The second reason is that the actors created such a variety of personalities. I guess partly that's a product of the screenplay, but the actors had to have the skills and they do. Because the family is so close, the personality differences really charge the interactions. You become fascinated by watching how they will react to the situations and each other.When the movie came out in the theaters, I admit I shied away because Asia sent all these \\"sensuality\\" movies out with the same hype. So, I just shrugged it off. But I've been renting a lot of Asian movies in the last year, and the number of choices at my video store is getting smaller. That is what made me give this movie a chance. And I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered and received this DVD. It was supposed to have English Sub-titles. It even said that it did. I arranged to send it back to get one that did have the sub-titles. I asked the Amazon person if there was a way to be sure that the new one had them. She said that they could not, but would send the new one. It came and was exactly the same as the first, no sub-titles. It was all Chinese language. I did not want to go through the hassle of asking for a third one. I gave it as a gift to one of my Chinese friends. I was disappointed that I did not end up with the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Foodies","review":"If you've seen Tortilla Soup, there is no need to watch this movie.

It had it's own twist..the actors in this are very emotional and real. I can only let this movie speak for itself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and surprising","review":"This is one of my favorite Chinese films. It centers around a retired master chef and his 3 very different daughters. Each of them is struggling in some way to balance concerns like career, family, romance, faith, self-actualization, or simply being a good person; each of them is finding some of these easy and some of them hard to impossible. The characters are well-presented, and we get drawn into their struggles with a wonderful blend of comedy and seriousness, hoping that they all reach some degree of enlightenment and happiness. Which they mostly do, but in unexpected ways that make the latter part of the film surprising and delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the cooking","review":"This movie has the same story and is the basis for the film \\"Tortilla Soup.\\" If you want to see the more accesible and entertaining of the two, see \\"Tortilla Soup\\" in which the Chinese culture is swapped for Hispanic-American culture. The culture differences and dry sense of humor in \\"Eat Drink Man Woman\\" kept me from identifying with the characters. It was still a wonderful movie and is worth watching for the cooking sequences alone. It was also interesting as a Chinese cultural study."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wolf in sheep's clothing?","review":"This very clever series of books portrays the universe (over and over again) as a thoughtful, deliberate creative force.How is this any different than creationism / intelligent design?If you don't want your child's earliest impressions of the universe to be slanted toward one in which there must be some kind of a Designer involved, these books are NOT a good choice.Also, many of the illustrations are not even very reflective of what is being described."},{"rating":"1","title":"An opportunity missed","review":"What looks like one of the few good non-supertitious explanations available to young readers turns out to be a gaia-infused sloppy mish-mash of facts and (unfortunately) somewhat uncritical folklore written by authors probably lost somewhere between science and crystal-gazing.Still has some value if your intention is to read this to your kids while filtering fact from fiction. The graphics are probably useful for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much intelligent design","review":"I bought this book as it was recommended in my teacher's manual for fourth grade science.

Pictures are interesting and the timeline tracker is useful. My son likes to tell the story to his nanny using the timeline tracker and the pictures. The author has two more science books for kids, which I would also recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but difficult","review":"John Jr (below) obviously has a little chip on his shoulder about writing theory and probably about academia.No, this is not a how-to book filled with exercises and tips and explanations of different techniques. It is a book for the advanced student or writer, and discusses issues involved with the short story, placing the form in assorted contexts and dissecting it from those positions. It is not easy reading, but neither is it impregnable to the thoughtful reader. It will not tell you how to write short stories, but it will provide you with intelligent ways of thinking about them, and hence, being more disciplined and perhaps original in your work."},{"rating":"2","title":"stays in tune, i prefer grovers","review":"It stays in tune well but i still prefer grovers personally.

He is without a doubt the best product of the No Limit Camp. My Balls and My Word is a title that exemplifies the neccessites of a true player. Take away the expensive cars, flashy women, golden teeth, and green Gators, and what is a man left with. That's right, his courage and his word. The beats groove, but the lyrics are the draw. More than simple rhymes, the songs on this album promote thought. Young Bleed Corleone, as he calls himself, speaks of the world in all its glory and ugliness. In the end one feels as though a portrait of not only ghetto lifestyle, but the lifestyle of anyone who has worked hard to get ahead, has been vividly protrayed right in front of them. This album is not for the weak. Only the real should listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is full of errie beats and spacious rhymes.","review":"Young Bleed has a unique talent for flowing to any beat. His southern beats accompany his errie voice well. Some of the tracks are exceptional, while others just the opposite. This is the type of release that grows on you, chances are the more you listen to it, the more you appreciate it. His style is not for everyone, but he has a talent for writing songs that flow incredibly well at times. \\"How Ya Do Dat\\" is a great party song, while \\"The Day Dey Make Me Boss\\" is a trip into the mind of Young Bleed. There is a little bit of something for everyone on this CD, yet not versitile for everyone's taste.

And though it doesn't measure up to Exile on Main Street or Sticky Fingers, it's a pretty solid record. This DVD, which finds the Stones in Texas during their '78 tour, is a nice companion piece to the album.

There's no absence of local color here as his protagonists prance from Beacon Hill to the market place at Faneuil Hall, stopping unceasingly at historic watering holes along the way. His main picaresque character alternates between Irish charm and disgusting, disillusioning existence.But Lentz, amidst the revelry in a good story, manages to ask some poignant questions about love and friendship,family, profession, and historic burdens in this Boston of the 21st century with its ever-present 17th, 18th and 19th century overhang.If you've ever been to Boston or even if you haven't you'll enjoy this romp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, precise, nice design","review":"After looking for digital scales, this is the best model I found.

Feinstein is also a well- known biographer, and translator who helped bring the work of the Russian poets Akhmatova and Tsevetayava to public notice in the West.She writes movingly of her father , of her academic husband and of her children. She writes of the various worlds she knows .She writes of people with insight and real feeling and sympathy. She is an understandable poet and one whose richness of language does not lose itself in obscurity or hidden meanings. She also has an inquisitive questioning mind not only about the world and the people she meets but about herself and her own life. It was a great pleasure to read these poems . My sense is that they should have many many more readers than they have had to this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems like a good set to my untrained eye","review":"I don't know much about binoculars except that the price can vary greatly, so I assumed purchasing a less expensive set was a risk, but I am quite pleased with the quality from what I know about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"obviously a blunder","review":"I read somewhere that this self-titled album contains selections from *It's About Time* and big band recordings, that it features Phil Woods & Gary Burton and was originally released in 1961.

I teach Intuition classes [...]. Part of what I teach includes understanding natural life cycles. I use Demetra George's book to show my students all the aspects of a moon cycle and to remind them that all parts of the cycle, including the time of the Void (Dark Moon) are important in life. This book also provides excellent information about the Goddess Hecate, the old wise women who helps us in the night. George's book is very empowering for women and attaches the female spirit to ancient women's knowledge before it was changed and distorted by conflicting religions and societal influences. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"term paper","review":"I bought this book after reading all the glowing reviews. It read like a term paper to me. It describes a number of myths in a more or less engaging style, and incorporates a very interesting section on the overlap of astrological, historical, and cosmic lunar cycles, but the author fails to get past description to insight and meaning. She cycles around to the same two or three conclusions about the three part goddess and patriarchy, again and again, without ever saying anything I haven't heard elsewhere. There is, however, an extensive biography of her sources, which should make a good reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysteries Of The Dark Moon","review":"I was and am very pleased with this book..

Meanwhile the state of Banks' marriage is going from bad to worse as is his relationship with his boss Chief Constable Jimmy Riddle.

Huh. Snuck up on me.Gotta hand it to first-timer Scott Caan: not only does he do a good acting job here, but he has written this story in such a way that, although there are no big action scenes (keeping the budget tight) the excellent dialogue is punctuated with enough events (usually both violent and funny) that the movie flows nicely from front to back.

MS Project is a beast. You have helped to tame it by sharing your lessons learned from the real world. As I read this book many things are finally clicking (after years of just making due). Though the index is not a strong as I like, the very detailed and well-planned TOC seems to compensate.

However, I was VERY disappointed to see a large number of grammatical errors in the book. It appears that the book has not been edited at all and a number of basic errors such as fragmented sentences, run on sentences etc were missed. I am hardly an english major and normally do not pay close attention to such details, but it was very difficult to ignore the basic errors in this book.

It does a terrible job of explaining how to build a class, so look else where for instruction in this area.The database section could have been much better, and it did not help that at the time I bought the book, one of the databases was structured incorrectly, making it impossible to finish one of the case studies unless you knew how to change the db schema.Avoid this book at all costs and if it is required for a course, I would see if there are other instructors in the same subject that use a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clive is never wrong - See \\"Vindication\\"","review":"VindicationIf you are a true horror movie lover than you must see this film! Bart Mastronardi's innovative direction and stunning images and Keith Fraser's raw, powerful performance will draw you in. I don't want to reveal too much about the story but it is basically about a man who attempts suicide and what happens to him mentally after the attempt. This film is sheer psychological terror of the very best kind. I always trust the advice of one of the true masters of horror, Clive Barker, so when he says see it - you see it! We have an upcoming master of horror in Bart Mastronardi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VINDICATION - A Gem","review":"Bart Mastronardi's disturbing horror story follows a deeply troubled young man (nicely played by Keith Fraser) who is literally visited by Guilt after a failed suicide attempt. The story builds slowly but surely, allowing the audience to empathize with the characters. So, by the time the gory mayhem begins, it is all the more shocking and, ultimately, heartbreaking. There are a few limitations with the very low budget, but Mastronardi's skillful writing, directing, and cinematography impresses as much as (if not more than) a Hollywood filmmaker. In fact, he is able to show us a passion for visuals and storytelling that very few big-budget directors possess. So, if you are only looking for the standard slice-and-dice, don't bother. But if you are interested in viewing a challenging and memorable piece of work, then this is a must-see. Kudos must also go to actors Alan Rowe Kelly and Jerry Murdock, who give excellent supporting performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, overdrawn, & self indulgent","review":"In short this film takes a simple concept of making a coming out movie into a blood soaked self indulgent boring story.

Not only for networking, but great tips to enhance your overall professional image and career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi-useful, but nothing new","review":"If you've read at least one networking book, you most likely will find little, if anything, useful from this one. I must admit there are some helpful hints such as: 1) Avoid the Lone Ranger mentality, 2) Give without expecting anything in return, 3) Gain value from every contact, 4) Become an active and perceptive listener, & 5) The 3 Foot Rule.These(like most of the 59 \\"secrets\\") present a somewhat hackneyed approach to networking. Although worth a look-see, I would recommend a check out from the library for this title, rather than wasting your mula."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the are those reviews talking abt? ( bk for simpletons)","review":"This book is the most useless , non substantive peace of literature on social networking I've ever read. First of all it reads like a children's book with bold large fonts, and only gives a paragraph full of advice each chapter. The advice wouldn't be different from what your mother would say. The authors clearly extended this to make it seem longer, and more substantive. Truly a super disappointment. The reviews on top make me question who really wrote those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor order service","review":"I had my press ready and was waiting for this product.

I probably not buy this book if you are looking for something very detailed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridgman's Complete Guide to Drawing From Life","review":"I read one other review that was critical of this book. I think most opinions are swayed by Bridgman's reputation. It is hard to agrue with his credentials. But for me this book lacks the clarity to help my students learn to draw the human form. The sketches are interesting to look at in their own right, but the text is confusing and isn't tied to the visuals.I feel there are other more helpful reference books such as \\"Drawing the Human Anatomy\\", by Civardi. I still prefer my original anatomy book by Peck.At best this could be a good companion, but shouldn't be someone's first or only anatomy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of Money","review":"I have bought many drawing books and have been able to gleam at least something from each that I thought warranted me keeping the book. After going through this book, I can find nothing useful. Before buying the book I read the reviews and after reading and trying to use the book, I can't imagine what the reviewers who had anything good to say, were talking about. Save your money. In this book the author just gives you a bunch of disassociated illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is an important step.","review":"I love this book. I was drawing from photos when I realized the reason I've been so miserably scribally is 'cause I don't know how to express and articulate the contrast in light an shadow and shape in line forms.

It does seem a bit dated and some of the drawings are not clear. BUT OTOH...it repeatedly fills in blanks and offers insights not found in my other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Detailed","review":"This book has almost everything you need to know about anatomy, however it is over 400 pages. You would need to go through whole chapters just to master one part of the body such as the hand or arms. That being said it is a good book, but it is not for someone looking to learn anatomy quickly. It would take you a long time to go through all the material in the book let alone digest it.Another gripe I have with the book is that sometimes it references muscles by their latin name and you have no idea what muscle the author is talking about. That tends to confuse you and you have to spend time to find out which muscles Bridgman is actually talking about. If you are serious about portraying anatomy realistically then this is the book for you- however if you want to learn the basics of anatomy quickly, another book will probably benefit you better."},{"rating":"2","title":"An anatomy reference","review":"Think of this as a reference for people who are already good at drawing anatomy. The book goes into details on the form, connections, and movement of every part of the body. But you can't learn to draw from the illustrations, so this didn't help me much.I gave it five stars because it does what I think it's meant to do (act as a reference) effectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I am glad I chose this Study Bible.

Throughout the book it references page numbers so that if you are interested in reading something you should go to that page. If you are not an experienced Bible reader, it would take you FOREVER to figure out where that particular book was in the Bible.

The music is great, different styles such as eastern, western, Celtic, etc. all with strong beats & some lyrics.The workout themselves are not complicated, they are very watered down, very basic version of popular dances, etc., that I barely recognized them. Some of the dances seemed a little silly like just doing an airplane like a little kid does, but she encourages you to dance how you want to, just feel the beat & go free.I didn't get much of a workout at all, even at the 3rd style workout (I didn't do all 3 at once.) The third one was only a little different from the first one so I was disapointed by that, but not really suprised. I like the idea of combining dances & more of a freedom, but I, unfortunately, really didn't get into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"MANUFACTURER ERROR!","review":"I ordered Yoga dance fire, and received the Yoga dance fire cd case, as well as a cd that is marked as Yoga dance fire, but the workout that is recorded on the dvd is actually yoga dance; water!I was very dissapointed that I did not recieve what I ordered, if I wanted Yoga dance:WATER I would have ordered it. It makes me wonder if I do go ahead and order Yoga: Dance water, will I get the Water workout on the actual disc, or maybe I will recieve the Earth or Fire workout instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a happy buyer","review":"I just got this book and will give it more work and perhaps come back and upgrade my rating but my initial reaction is extremely negative. There are essentially no instructions or descriptions of any of the exercises.The instructions consisted of (paraphrased for brevity) but this is all of them.Use a metronomeStart slow then increaseCurve fingersSit low..RelaxEnjoyThere were few fingering suggestions and none for the bass.I ran through the first 2 measures of most (which was enough to get the idea since each covers all keys basically by repeating the same thing 1/2 step up) and until the very end they seemed all to be variations on the same thing. The bass is non-standard and though he mentions using others there are no suggestions. The notation is 16th notes and no mention is made of perhaps swinging them.I'm on my way to order the other one of the same title, hopefully it will meet my needs better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Helps","review":"After regular practice of the first 15 exercises I noticed that elements of the exercises started to become part of my playing without having to think about it. The exercises also have really helped with fingering and technique. Lastly the exercises build skills in all keys. So far well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great gerard schwarz cornet album","review":"Once again I am amazed by a great Gerrard Schwarz album. I own all of his albums and bought this one right away. I think he is quite possibly the most musical trumpet/cornet player ever to play alongside Maurice Andre.

Nontheless this album is a must pickup for any music enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but...","review":"As another said, it is somewhat a misnomer to call it \\"Turn of the Century\\" Cornet Favorites. More accurately, it should say \\"In the Style of Turn of the Century\\" as 6 of the 19 pieces were composed by the conductor, Gunther Schuller, who conceived and produced the CD - pretty sure he did not compose his selections back at the turn of the century, but they sounded as if they could have been. Never the less, I am very happy to have it in my collection. Schuller and Schwarz - one terrific combination.

The foam insert makes jumping much easier on the ankels and knees. The mat does tend to move around during play, but I don't think it's any worse than the bundeled mat. I woudn't know whether the game play more closely resembles that of the arcade game, since I never really seriously played the arcade.

I did not know anything about proper food combining, detoxification, natural hygiene, or the proper intake of fruit. However, Harvey and Marilyn Diamond have convinced me that this program works! I started \\"Fit for Life\\" in late January. I weighed 283 lbs, felt lethargic all the time, and had indigestion frequently.

Although I sometimes struggle with the proper food consumption, I am constant with the fruit consumption.I've told countless numbers of people about this change in eating habits and probably should be on the payroll.

We all agree with the fruit for breakfast plan, because its easy and because you can eat as much of it as you want (without overdoing it), you don't go hungry. Lunch feels light, and so does dinner. (We are hispanic so its been fun following the recipes in the book to learn a \\"different\\" way of cooking).

I now know I lost lean body mass because I was not assimilating enough protein and fat to rebuild cells so the building materials were being taken from existing muscle. This book, although seductive in its mantra of returning to a totally natural state, is not based upon any science at all. None of the theories propogated by the Diamonds concerning food combining have any CLINICAL basis in fact, and a high-school level understanding of human physioliogy and cellular transport blows holes in their reasoning. This is a diet which consumes all of your time and energy, and leaves you either fat and bloated from consuming food willy-nilly out of frustration, or skeletal and weak from insufficient amounts of protein."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's more to health than....","review":"After reading Fit For Life, you'll understand that there's more to health than simply knowing WHAT to eat, there's also the when, why and how...Fit for life gives you great insights into understanding the whole picture.

I'd ascribe that to gullibility - or possibly the power of suggestion. I say this because the authors' \\"scientific\\" assertions about how the body functions and the how foods are digested are laughable at best. Perhaps the unaccredited shool where Harvey Diamond earned his PHD in nutritional science stopped doing medical research after the 15th century. My own experience with this diet (yes, I was gullible enough myself to give it a try a few years ago) was quite different from those I see in some of the other reviews. I seemed to be hungry most of the time, and I finally gave it up after I began to feel weak and light-headed.I believe that a vegetarian diet or diets including meat can be healthy.

And I felt wonderful the whole time, and was never -- and I mean absolutely never -- hungry when I finished eating or while running around all day, and I didn't and still don't limit portions.The food is good, the program makes sense, and I recommend it without reservation. Do I lapse occasionally? Yeah, unfortunately. If I didn't have an eating problem, I wouldn't have been sixty pounds overweight to begin with.

There's far too much to correct here, but a few gross misconceptions are the following: citrus fruits are not basic. They are acidic. Hence, citric and ascorbic acid. Finding \\"basic\\" or \\"acidic\\" foods is pretty pointless in the first place, as stomach juices are such strong acid it doesn't matter, and bases can harm as well (lye?). Also, protein does not leech calcium from bones. This is based on a study done in the 80's using protein _extracts_. They were, incidentally, reconstituted with milk - a calcium rich substance.

Then the choices you get to choose from, well it is hard to combine and really eat, especially when I also have to cut down on cholesterol and on a few meds.

I found it WAY too restrictive. I have researched this kind of diet and there is no proof that consuming a certain combination of food will be healthier than a diet that doesn't have those restrictions. It's all about the calories and exercise, baby! I lost some weight but I am sick and tired of highly restrictive diet books, the preachy tone of the book, as if it performs miracles. People that I know who use this diet are almost cult-like in their devotion. It also costs a LOT of money to \\"eat naturally\\". I just don't have the money to buy free range chicken not to mention organic food. If organic food cost less I'd be eating it, but it doesn't.

The author spends much of the book over-praising the genius of Buckminster Fuller, which should lead suspicious people to question what exactly is going on. It's possible that Mr. Fuller is the greatest genius of our time; but the author should simply show us his accomplishments, rather than say it. This style of over-inflated hype was so grating to me that I began to doubt whether Mr. Fuller had accomplished much of anything, a feeling re-inforced by the ridiculous jargon that he uses to obscure his ideas. I had hoped that this book would give me a glimpse of genius, but it ended up diminishing my view of Buckminster Fuller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction for a Non-Technical Reader","review":"I've tried to dive into some of the books actually written by Buckminster Fuller without success. His ideas have always intrigued me, but I found his writing style to be rambling and confusing. This book, however, is an excellent introduction to Fuller's life and ideas, without the confusing detritus. I don't have a strong math or science background, so I appreciated the fact that the author was able to explain Fuller's ideas without resorting to complex equations or formulas. The biographical aspects of this book are also quite interesting. It is chronologically arranged so that the reader can track the evolution of Fuller's thoughts as he progressed through life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterful interlinking of psychology and art.","review":"Gombrich is able to draw clear links and connections between human psychology and the artistic expression over time. His insights open windows to new ideas that can be read easily by laymen with only a little foreknowledge of art history. The breadth of his knowledge is startling and his careful and witty presentation is a pleasure to read. He never talks down to the reader. The only criticism is that some of the illustrations are too small, especially those in the chapter on Raphael's Stanza.

Danny eyes Nigel's wife Eden (Kenya Moore) and as our sympathy builds for Nigel, only then he destroys it by showing us he is a thug also. The movie escalates until it becomes stupid.The movie is low budget. It uses the same song for the soundtrack over and over again. The acting needed help as did the dialouge.

The writing plodded at the speed of a glacier, and yet slammed rough-shod over the more interesting scenes. Perhaps by removing it from the glistening waters of the Mediterranean, the sparkle of the writing went with it.Character point of view slipped sloppily, making it difficult to understand through whose non-wry mental commentary the tale was coming.

The book takes place in the cold Norse lands and for those with no knowledge of the mythology or the places it is weaved into the plot so you discover it with Cair as he goes along.An incredible solo novel in the midst of collaborations with powerhouses Eric Flint and Mercedes Lackey, it is a must read for those who have enjoyed the first two novels in the series as well as for those who haven't but are fans of mythology and/or alternate history.The only thing wrong with the book is that it ended, which just leaves me wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical fantasy at its best","review":"After reading A Mankind Witch, I felt the need to write my first review of a book since high school.

While the ship renditions are fairly good, the only thing they got right was the Falcon -- there weren't any TIEs in the novel, and those little fighters in the comic aren't Z-95s.The art is too childish, and the words are too big, and the coloring and detail is a bit dull.

Most of the movies I see rerun on the classic film channels are the duo's later films and are pretty flat. In this one, they blow in like the life of the party and race through routines that makes you feel like they're trying to fit in as much as they can.The slapstick is cartoonishly funny and the verbal bits are fun (\\"You're not here!

Man was I wrong! There is only 1 video input and its composite! Who uses composite inputs anymore? I was hoping for at least an S-Video input jack. I tried recording with the composite input and the picture quality was only average. The only way to record anything with this unit is through the singular composite input. Also, this unit WILL NOT record any premium cable channels whatsoever. It will only record basic cable channels. So this unit is totally useless to me. Sony was once a premier electronics company but now they are just cranking out low level inferior electronics. There is also no HDMI cable included.

About 90 minutes into the movie it starts to pause and break up because it is over heating inside or somehting. It sets on a shelf with nothing under it or on top of it. You have to take a thirty minute break with the player turned off to finished the movie again. Recording is horrible also. When you get a disk to work, you end up with a copy protection error.

I guess my research was not proper. This model does not accept (and output) anything other than NTSC signal, hence, it will not work out-of-the-box in countries like India. Fact that it only accepts NTSC signal was not highlighted in the product literature/brochure available online.However, as a DVD player it is excellent- outputs very good video (NTSC only and US region/universal DVDs).Bottomline:Pros:Similar Sony model available in India (RDRGX330) is priced about 18000/- INR in white market. For ~150 USD it was good saving.Picture quality of output videoCons:Could not really test the recording feature yet.

The authors write clearly and are generally very fair in presenting their opponents' views (cf. William Abraham's essay on Assurance as a good example). Although the authors challenge many theological sacred cows, they write from the perspective of a sound and vibrant evangelical faith. One criticism I have is that it does not consider the perspectives of Karl Barth on election and how they challenge the Arminian worldview while avoiding the errors of Calvinism. Of course, Karl Barth's doctrine is not the book's target here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad!","review":"These essays attempt to refute Calvinism without providing a consistent alternative. Many of the essays attack one point of Calvinism with the unstated assumption that the other four points are false. Most of the rest of the essays use \\"that's not fair!\\" reasoning and ignore scripture.Some of the highly-questionable claims made in the book are: - Omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence must be redefined. - The future hasn't happened yet, so it doesn't exist to be known. Therefore, God does not know the future. As a result, prophecy is not a foretelling of the future. Instead, prophecies are predictions or warnings based on exhaustive knowledge of the present and the past. - If God has the power to grant salvation, then ALL humans are entitled to salvation. - Universal salvation is a possibility. (Proverbs 16:4 and Romans 9 are not discussed.) - God is unable or unwilling to irresistibly change a human's will. (Paul's conversion is not discussed.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A major challenge to Calvinism","review":"For the most part I found this book to be quite intellectually stimulating and a major challenge to the Calvinist point of view. The editor did a good job of assembling articles that represent the spectrum of opinions within the Arminian camp.A few of the extreme positions I don't agree with. But most of the book is very good. I. Howard Marshall's article on the pastoral epistles and William L. Craig's piece on middle-knowledge are both excellent. But I was particularly impressed with Terry Miethe's article, \\"The Universal Power of the Atonement.\\" This is a major personal interest of mine. For a book-length work on this issue (written by a British Puritan Arminian theologian) I recommend \\"Redemption Redeemed: A Puritan Defense of Unlimited Atonement\\" by John Goodwin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much emotionalism for my liking.","review":"Too much emotionalism, too little Bible is why I give this book only 2 stars. The problem is that Pinnock and others have gone off the deep end in their loathing of Calvinism and have denied to God some of His basic attributes as given in the Bible. I agree that God does change His mind, but this does not have to imply that He is not omniscient. But as I said, this book presents a glut of emotionalism when it should be presenting a glut of Bible.

Unlike the other books in the series, it is set during conteporary times when England is threatened by an evil so great that only a revitalized monarchy can save it. Enter James Arthur Stuart, an army officer, who is told by an old man named Merlin that he is the legitimate heir to the throne. It turned out that he was conceived in secret and his existence hidden, raised by a foster family, in much the same way as King Arthur was. Lawhead adds contemporary versions of Arthur's knights and advisors as well as his enemies. Sometimes this book gets lost in Lawhead's rather grandiosse style which fits much better with the ancient rather than the contemporary, but overall, this is an enjoyable and interesting novel. A fitting conclusion to the King Arthur story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have done better","review":"I really enjoy Mr. Lawhead's books but this was was not nearly as good as any of his other books. The characters were cardboard and the plot limps along the first half then takes off for a while then limps again. I kept waiting for the PM Waring to show a really evil side or Merlin to do something special. Even worse is the last few pages smack of sequel then suddenly ends. It's not a satisfying book, great idea that wasn't fully realized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, Good","review":"There is no question that this book is quite a bit different than the rest of the Pendragon series. But like Lawhead's other reecent books (Iron Lance, Byzantium) this book is staightforward engaging and not bogged down by the pretentiousness of the 5 previous Arthurian books. It is actually extremely similar to Tom Clancy's \\"Executive Orders,\\" except this is the British version of the story. Dont expect to return to the world of Saxons and Britons, as this should be enjoyed for its own merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but start elsewhere","review":"This is the sixth book in the series, and although it is a good stand alone, I suggest people new to Stephen Lawhead start at Taliesin, or Byzantium, because it is these two books that have the most critical acclaim, and that have made Stephen Lawhead the leader in modern Arthurian and historical fiction. This book is good, and would you believe there are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS THIS YEAR","review":"I have been a Stephen Lawhead fan for about ten years now. I think that he is a very under-rated author. Time after time, with the now acknowledged classic Pendragon Cycle, Song Of Albion, and the soon to be classic Byzantium, Lawhead proves himself as one of the best authors around, able to contend with the best of them. I read almost all John Grisham, Steven King, Tom Clancy etc. While all good too, they all seem to lack the flair and insight that Stephen Lawhead does.Avalon, about Arthur in modern day Britain, deserves to be a top ten best-seller. It is gripping, emotional, intelligent and written in Lawhead's unimitable witty style.My only regret now was to read it in two days, because now I have to wait several months before his next book! A great stand alone novel. Get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Read from Lawhead","review":"Stephen Lawhead is one of my favorite fantasy / fiction writers - but Avalon is a plodding read that, unfortunately, felt like he was fulfilling a publishing contract rather than writing from his heart. There's little characterzation or drama - and I kept reading page after page waiting for the story to kick in...which it never did. For \\"classic\\" Lawhead, start the Song of Albion trilogy (The Paradise Wars is book one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This is actually the best book I have read by Lawhead, and I don't care what the other reviews say. There isn't much fantasy stuff in this book though, but hey, it was much better than I expected. It's always hard to write a book where two very different ages clash. I tried. My novel seems to be stuck, though.I also like that the plot is quite complicated. You don't expect the twist and turn of events.But some people I know don't find this a good read because of the political topics, said it was too heavy. Anyway, it really depends on the reader, doesn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A fun romp","review":"A somewhat isolated book of the Pendragon Series which borrows a few key personalities from the series and brings them ~1500 years ahead to the current time. The characters are transparent, the plot is fairly predicable, and the climax was not. No sword clashing or epic battles, and a small and shallow romance thrown in for spice.With all that in mind, read it for purely entertainment purposes. Set your mind in the same mood as when you watch an action movie, with no real expectations beyond that, and it is an enjoyable read that you'll devour fairly fast, then put it away and forget within a few days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arthur doesn't translate well to modern times","review":"This book is probably fun for Lawhead fans. Lawhead keeps the suspense going until the end, although the constant dustups with Morgan Le Fay are a bit predictable. The thesis of the book is pretty bizarre, however. The book goes on and on about how the solution to the problems of modern society (bad government, immorality, just plain evil) are to be found in the divine right of kings. This part is pretty hard to swallow and kind of ruined the book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the Four Seasons","review":"This set of concertos, along with the concertos for two violins (e.g. Archive 4777466) and the concertos for oboe, clarinet and bassoon (e.g. Naive 30409) reflect what Vivaldi really was all about. The \\"famous\\" and terribly over worked Four Seasons concertos are very simplistic compared to these wonderful works. Carmignola has a perfect touch for the life and enthusiasm that truly are at the core of Vivaldi's important contributions to the Baroque repertoire and the Venice Baroque Orchestra compliments the music and the violinist wonderfully. One can easily imagine this entorage playing in the very special small churches and other venues in Venice that surround the Ospedale della Pieta (the orphanage where Vivaldi was employed for most of his composing lifetime). We know that J.S. Bach transcribed many of Vivaldf's works and that his exposure to Vivaldi's concertos for violin had a profound influence on his approach to melody and structure.

In that certain period of time, early seventies, it was difficult to get a major starring role in a Hollywood production when you were a Chinese.Bruce Lee also wrote the concept for the Kung Fu series. Originaly it was titled 'The Warrior', but the producers thaught that Bruce was 'too' Chinese to play half an American! It is a shame that Bruce never got credits for the fact that he wrote the concept of the series.For reference material read the books from the Bruce Lee Library's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nostolga not always a good thing","review":"Saw this movie as a kid and loved it.

Furthermore: the authors's questions and remarks, printed in full lenght, which makes readings boring, give a \\"me too\\"-impression: \\"Me too, I've had deep insights, me too, I've already found wisdom, me too\\"...I recommend the very honest and captivatingly written book by Paula Marvelly: partly the same teachers but a very different quality.

Only a short amount of Young's biography was dedicated to her math research and publications. I found this very disturbing,and, honestly quite an insult to these outstanding and courageous women.

What a better way to have them appreciate the old school scholastic books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge variety and well received by my kids","review":"I have a 3 1/2 year old boy and a 1 1/2 year old girl and they both love the videos in the set. If you're expecting Disney, buy a Disney video which are great in their own regard. These take the stories and the images from the books and build upon them so it's like expanding on the visual experience from the books.Both of my kids LOVE books and reading and staring at the images. These videos captured that experience for times when reading isn't practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading","review":"I watched the excerpts of the videos, but I must say that it is important to read to the children and we have our own \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" reading rituals that would be changed by getting these videos. I guess I will just remain an old curmudgeon and believe that the best books should remain books to be read and enjoyed by me and my children. Not another of the endless videos watched and turning the kids into videodrones.\\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" is one of the greatest children's books ever written. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtual Parenting","review":"At first, it seemed as if this was a wonderful collection of stories for children, stories that parents might read with their children. That there might be a time before i-pods and i-phones and game-boys and other electronic distractions. That there might be an opportunity to share learning, and wonder, and discovery in those first few years together. But no; it's just another passive device to cram into a machine and distract the children with noise and pictures. No opportunity to learn, to share, to grow - just sit there kid and stay out of the way - mom and dad have more important things to do Let the television distract you for a while. Pathetic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A healthy way to entertain children","review":"As a Reading Specialist and grandmother, I enthusiastically endorse the Scholastic Treasure of 100 Storybook Classics. First of all, they selected excellent books for children. Secondly, they utilized the illustration style of the originals, so the aesthetics of the books are clearly presented and preserved. Thirdly, the animation is well-done though not overdone. The pacing is slow, as when a book is read aloud. This gives the listener a chance to absorb the story, just as he or she would if the story were being read aloud. It even has the option to include the text on each page, if you have a blossoming reader. In fact, this is just about the equivalent of having someone read aloud great picture books for your child, while you do -- whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the kids","review":"Our 3 children ( age 4) love these DVD's.

A lot of the classics my own children loved when they were young are included in this set, and I'm sure the next generation will enjoy them just as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok....I guess.","review":"Overall, not quite as good as I had hoped. My son (3) has always loved reading stories together; regrettably he doesn't much care for this dvd collection. There certainly are a lot of stories in this collection.... just not a lot of good stories. Less than 20% of the stories consistently hold his attention for the whole feature when we watch them together. I picked these up for my son when the item was on sale - (paid roughly 40 cents per story)- I would not recommend paying much more than that for the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional value","review":"These stories turned out to be a perfect gift for overseas grandchildren who don't have access to public libraries. They were so much fun that their mom had to make a trash truck birthday cake as a theme for the 3 year old party. The story and song from the video were adorable! The cake was reported to be excellent. We all loved the way they were done and the way they were animated art from the actual books.

No more extraordinarily loud purple dinosaurs screaming out of my tiny DVD player.

I gave one early for a four year old's birthday. I took it in the car along with my laptop so she could watch a story on a car ride into NYC.

They watch them over and over. The stories are diverse, well-illustrated, and most have engaging music. The only disappointment for my older nephew was that the Curious George story featured an older version of the story versus the \\"new\\" monkey character currently seen on PBS. One thing to keep in mind when purchasing these dvd's are that if your child currently enjoys Star Wars, Spiderman, etc. he/she may find these stories a little boring, as the pacing is much slower than alot of what is currently on television for kids. My nephews really enjoy the scholastic stories at the ages of 2 and 4 but they are not allowed to watch most regular childrens television shows or cartoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different brand than listed","review":"Works fine, all specs are what were listed, but I did not receive an Arri brand lamp. Instead I got one made by Ushio. I specifically ordered the Arri because I wanted precise color temperature and recognize Arri as a manufacturer of professional photo/film equipment.

My wife is very particular about the taste of her mouthwash, which had already ruled out Biotene.In the intervening years, it seems Dr. Ken keeps diddling with the formula. The first twist was not bad, as it \\"lighened\\" the wash somewhat (you will note that this mouthwash will stain your porcelain sinks, unless you diligently rinse and wipe the sink each time after rinsing).But the last batch we bought from Amazon has not only new packaging (a white bottle), but has a completely different balance of ingredients, and it tastes TERRIBLE! I don't mind as much, but my wife can no longer stand the stuff, so it's back to the drawing board to find a new mouthwash.Wish I knew why you had to spoil a good thing, Dr. Ken."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must\\" for all students and practitioners of Feng Shui.","review":"Ancient Taoists developed feng shui from an understanding of universal energies, and this guide traces its history and how its knowledge has evolved in conjunction with basic Taoist beliefs.

The nature coverage is top-notch and I'd highly recommend it for that content. However, I was greatly disapponted to find that there was no coverage of Austalia's cities and people.

I was surprised that he or she had the same feelings about the book as I had. This is a shocking book. On the one hand, it is excellent and teaches people a lot about how to think about a problem. On the other hand, the author is so self-conceited that sometimes I asked myself: if he is so creative, why didn't he invent ANYTHING apart from his own way of making money?The funny thing is, that I still recommend this book!Peter Fabri, Budapest, Hungary"},{"rating":"1","title":"Least creative book on creativity I've ever read.","review":"While I think De Bono had some great points, you could read the summary and the appendices at the end of the book, and have gotten most likely more information than reading the book, which was basically a 330 page advertisement for De Bono's consulting company. So, one star for tricking Harper Collins to publish the longest advertisement ever published, and one more star for successfully writing a book.Honestly, everything in this book steams from common sense. None of his techniques stem too far outside of putting two things together that don't belong. His made up word Po is interesting and intriguing, and probably the most you'll gain from reading 'Serious Creativity'. All Po is is a link to place two words together that would otherwise be out of context, ie 'Planes Po Landing upside down'.Is it worth reading the last 18 pages? Yes. Should you buy this book? No."},{"rating":"2","title":"The place to start","review":"This was the first book I read on Symposium, and I was glad.

Well, it beats buying tapes over and over again. And, just get rechargeable batteries (AAAs) and it will cost even less over time!!!!!!!!!!!!The voice quality is quite superb even if I am in the back of an albeit microphoned lecture hall.

Charlie is on a quest to save her brother who has been taken captive by the malitia and gains the reluctant help from her long lost uncle Miles.At times the story can get a little cheesy, especially some of the sword fights, but it is only the first season and most sci fi shows dont tend to find their feet until the 2nd series and this show has plenty of potential and has cult following written all over it.At the very least for the male population Tracy Spiridakos is captivating enough to give this show a go, fingers crossed it blossoms into its full potential"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Get Past First Episode","review":"And, I can watch it \\"free\\" on cable.

They've \\"borrowed\\" so many ideas from at least four other series (Jericho, in particular) or movies that even I recognize right-off, and I'm not a FANatic who remembers all details. They should be paying royalties to them, but ideas can't be copyrighted, and they're just taking bits from each show. The premise is intriguing, so too bad if they're going to waste it.

I do love the cast and I always give shows five episodes or so before I really make a chose on whether or not i like the character's chemistry just because of the fact that a lot of actors are just kind of put together and have to find out how they work together. The girl is kind of annoying. She keeps going on about finding Danny(her brother) and than the one time that Miles is like okay lets just go and then she's like no lets stay. : / ah okay, but i guess that's more an issue with the writer rather than the actor.

Decent enough plot and acting on par with most of the drivel on TV these days. I have a fondness for post apocalyptic stories like Jericho and the Walking Dead, so I was interested in this show from the start. So far I have been pleased with the direction the show has taken with the addition of new characters and the removal of other characters. I do like the reality of the lack of modern weapons, and the return to pre-industrial society. While some post apocalyptic writers have imagined such a society as some kind of agrarian nirvana, the Revolution correctly imagines that such life will be short, brutal and full of hard work. People lacking skills to survive in such world such as lawyers, philosophers and other \\"eaters\\" (I.E. - people who consume food but have no worthwhile skills) are going to die quickly. I am looking forward to the new episodes as they are released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"I didn't even finish the first episode.

How is it, with so much time to tell a story on a television show, they can be so lazy as to completely disregard logic? At least TRY to get things to make a little sense. And the fact that the world is in this condition, but everyone has perfectly clean and pressed clothes bugs me too. If the story was good I could ignore these things, but since it isn't, I can not forgive this show for the crappiness it is.

It wasn't worth the wait, with a couple of exceptions. Most of this album is \\"carnavalesque\\"--party beats, in other words, without much at all in the form of lyrical or musical depth. I guess the title \\"Candyall Beat\\" is truth in advertising.

Not much on Vescos personal life, which is understandable. I am traveling around Latin America, spent months in Costa Rica. He is legend there among local people.

Our living room is probably about 200 sq. ft. and I had to empty the dirty water tank at least 4 times and refill the water/carpet solution tank about the same number of times.

The only difference is the full size machines cost over 200 and this cost 69.99.Actually, the only advantage the full size machines had, was bigger tanks.

It is about 1/4 of the size of cleaners that you rent from the store. I thought that I wouldn't be too upset if it didn't work as expected, although now that I have it, I definitely am!

I had to leave the house that night and it was still there the next day. Unacceptible!!I returned it and am getting the 1770. Like I said, it's only $10 more, and I don't have to worry about what the previous owner used it for.

It has a medicore performance. However there's a design flop with the unit (wonder why Bissell sells a lot of remanufactured?). The clean water unit will tilt toward you when you engage the paddle to start the vacumming (the clean water unit is attached on the handle of the vacuum so when you engage the unit to start to vacuum, the handle will not stand 90 degree anymore and so does the clean water unit). When the clean water unit tilt toward you, the unit will not spray the cleaning solution. This is easily to fix such by putting the velcro/wire so the clean water unit will not tilt toward you when you engage the paddle to start vacuuming. But I am surprised a big company such as Bissell will create such a design flop.

With this compact and very lightweight version I can get the whole house done before naptime is over...the carpet is even dry by then! Yes, I do have to refill the tank about 7 times, but this keeps the water very hot and effective. The tank empty and refill is so quick and easy, it's not really a big deal.

Use boiling hot water, if you use hot tap water by the time you start to spray the water is cold. When I used it on my living room which was realy bad from 3 children with drinks, food, and so on ,it removed all of the stained areas and the dirty water was awful. I went slow when removing the water and went over it atleast twice removing the water and my carpet was dry in less then an hour.

Having been involved in real estate sales for 18 years, I can honestly say she paints an unfair picture of the people that I have known who do the best they can to help people through one of the most stressful and trying times of their lives, moving their families into a new home, their biggest investment. Just an awful book that gets a lot wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo!","review":"Not worth it. I was expecting a book about Systems Analysis from a unique perspective.

I usually think it's worth the extra few dollars...but with this particular item \\"XT Gripper Jam\\", the leg openings were way too small for me. Tight enough around my lower thighs to cut-off circulation. I bought an XL, and if I got an XXL it would'nt've fit me anywhere-else, so it's not just that I needed a larger size.I wanted the longer legs to avoid the riding up of the legs and chaffing, but these grab much too tight.If you have big muscular legs these will not fit you.

The basic strategy of the book totally deviates from the basic strategy, which computers work out. As a result, players can not reduce disadvantages as possible by playing basic strategy that is introduced by the author. In addition, the betting strategy that the author recommends is very similar to progressive system. I have not heard that blackjack game can be beaten consistently by using progressive system. The author said that he has won blackjack by using his system.I believe that he might have beaten the game. The reason is he might be just lucky and has good run (positive fluctuation). Even some gamblers (not card counters) can win the game thirty days in a row.In conclusion, I do not think the book is worth for blackjack players who are willing to beat the game consistently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voodoo nonsense","review":"One clue that a book is bad is when the author claims that everyone else is wrong. Well, everyone else isn't wrong. Harvey uses poor methodologies, invalid math and superstitions to come to conclusions long proved to be false.

He tends to be finicky about the fit of sports equipment but there have been no complaints about the fit. The shape of the glove, which falls a bit between a traditional adult catchers mitt and a first baseman's mitt, seems to give him a lot more wrist control at his size/age.

If the color change was all it would be O.K., but it's not. They are now made much cheaper and wear out much faster. It is alright for occasional use or maybe just cutting the tape on a box, but not for cutting the actual cardboard. The casing is very thin and the inside starts to pull into it while cutting. The inside is also not as strong and the retaining end is a little bit narrower. This gives the blade too much room to wiggle up and down and wear through the end much faster. The blue ones used to last me 2 to 3 weeks of hard work. The new design maybe a week if not cutting to many hard cases, otherwise I can wear one out in 1 day.

The watch is heavy and rugged and does everything I need - and yes, the bezel can get stiff, but that can be addressed with silicone grease - just as the accuracy can be adjusted by a jeweler.

The formula and structure is strikingly similar: Allen and Keaton star as a couple who have come to something of a stalemate in their marriage. She is adventurous; he, a neurotic (unsurprisingly), is patently not. When she becomes convinced that a neighbour is responsible for the death of his wife (\\"Who?\\" asks Woody, \\"You mean our next-door widower?\\"), she sets off on a daring Hitchcockian quest to uncover the truth, ending in the solution of a puzzling mystery that brings the two opposites back together.For wit and brilliance, Woody Allen is on top form. This is laugh-a-minute stuff. Along with Deconstructing Harry, this may well be one of Allen's best films of the '90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Woody's Best","review":"Having seen the majority of all of Woody Allen's films, Manhattan Murder Mystery continues to remain near the top of my list. It's a great murder caper about a bored housewife who suspects a neighbor of foul play. Her suspicions get the best of her, and soon she has a whole cast of friends and family trying to confirm her beliefs. It's funny and suspenseful and is filled with plenty of neurotic criticism from the husband, who could be played by no one other than the Woodman himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest living american film maker","review":"i have followed his films and his career for most of my life. manhattan, annie hall,interiors, and for simple pleasure, manhattan murder mystery are among my TOP 5 favorite films.

Woody is brilliant once again and the jokes keep coming at a furious pace.I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight Allen, but still worth seeing","review":"Light and insubstantial - the thinnest movie Allen made since \`Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy', but still breezy and fun entertainment, and still manages to have a deeper emotional resonance about working through mid-life crises and relationships. The camerawork is a mix. The first half is annoyingly handheld much of the time, for no particularly good reason, but the second half has some very nice lighting, and a fun \`Lady From Shanghi' homage at the climax. A flawed film, that one can pick at if you're in a cranky mood, but also one with wit and panache that you can enjoy if you let go of your own inner film critic and just watch a master humorist simply tell a good yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery, NY, Jazz","review":"A loyal fan of Allen and Keaton (especially together). The setting is NY of course and the neuroses is on uber drive while the twisted mystery unravels before you. Alda and Huston were fantastic in their own rights.

I laughed some more.This script had been laying around for quite some time, and when Allen decided to resurrect it, I'm SO glad he got Diane Keaton to join him for the filming. Their chemistry is still there, and so is Allen's wonderful neurotic schtick. The elevator scene is priceless. I also greatly enjoyed the tape-player skit with Allen's inimitable bumbling.I think the film hiccups a bit when it abruptly switches to a film-noir ending. Mind you, I enjoyed the ending, especially the Welles homage, but I think this decidedly dark ending causes the whole vehicle to lose momentum.All in all this great fun with plenty of zany suspense and the fabulous interplay of Allen and Keaton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"I liked this movie. Allen's writing is \\"tip top\\" and his interaction with Keaton is great. As I watched this movie, I kept thinking about Annie Hall. The two leads play well off each other and the co-stars are just as great. Alan Alda and Anjelica Houston are fabulous. It was a romp and I am going to buy this video for my Woody Allen collection.

In my opinion, had this been Woody Allen's first movie, it would have also been his last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Effort","review":"Everything about this film says laziness: an inane script, laissez-faire direction, ad-libbed dialogue. Woody apparently thinks anything that comes out of his mouth is funny, and whereas that may once have been true, here most of his lines are trivial palaver. By the end of the film you're even sick of the soundtrack, an incongruent jazz standard played ad nauseum.This is chasms away from Allen's best work. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, Lighthearted Mystery","review":"Woody Allen plays a book editor (Larry Lipton) married to Carol (Diane Keaton) who is much more of a free spirit than Larry. Carol is eager to investigate the possible murder of a neighbor, Larry isn't, and she starts to drift away towards divorced friend Ted (Alan Alda) who is more interested. Meanwhile, a female writer (Anjelica Huston) is attracted to Larry. Turns out the 'victim' wasn't killed until after the supposed murder (her sister, it turns out, who dies of a heart attack). Lots of loose ends, danger, and silliness. The crime is solve, Larry and Carol's relationship is strengthened, and Ted ends up with Angelica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed like mad, and loved it","review":"How can someone (I ask myself) give this movie a one-star review?

I've always enjoyed detective mysteries and I've always loved a good laugh: the combination is irresistable.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The plot of this 1993 film is pretty interesting but the characters are so annoying it is almost painful to sit through. I thought that this would be a suspenseful comedy and it wasn't funny at all (the comedy is really just the same cliche paranoid Allen character). Also, the movie was presented in 4:3 aspect ratio which is really annoying on a widescreen tv (come on, Amazon, you can do better). Even the music score seems like it was just a rehashed old score. Even if you like the actors or the director, there are far better movie choices, so don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Unfunny Woody Allen","review":"This is a truly pathetic excuse for a movie. The dialogue is rambling and often incoherent (Keaton looks high much of the time and moves a hand constantly toward her nose), the story is confusing and unconvincing (and has to be explained, twice), the camera work is labored, and the artisie illusions and music are oh, so obviously \\"in\\". Worst of all, the film isn't funny. It should be no surprise that Woody Allen soon moved into a much darker genre of film making to occupy his later years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allen's style of mystery","review":"Manhattan Murder Mystery - however, nothing is mysterious. The movie does not create an atmosphere of suspense, but it swells with Woody Allen's style of neurotic representation of dialogues.

And unusual for Allen films, the photography is undistinguished. Ms. Keaton is lit to resemble a leper.The beginning of THE END for Woody, creatively. At least Crimes and Misdemeanors (which I loathed) had a germ of an idea behind it, stale as it was. MMM was the first real indication that the well had run dry; Allen's uninterrupted string of awful recent films only confirms this. Failing miserably even as a pastiche, MMM apparently doesn't seem like such an insult to younger, immature viewers who've never seen the Welles and Hitchcock films that Woody deigns to pilfer.I enjoyed Anjelica Huston --she gets to show some SASS --and she was all I enjoyed in this thin visit to the glue factory.Is Woody's latter-day post-Mia career \\"the horror, the horror\\" that Colonel Kurtz was talking about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is my book??","review":"Ordered one little book over a month ago ....was told I should have my book by 11/03/08, and as of today 11/12/08 I have yet to see my book.

There is very little \\"steam\\" in this movie. Not a bad plot, but let's be honest, that's not why we watch these direct to video / cinemax softcore movies. Joan Severance does look good as usual. However, the erotica scenes are few and far between and there is virtually nothing more revealing in the unrated version so don't spend your $ here.

Not only does Ms. Nelson tell you what colors to use, but what direction to make your painting strokes, how to hold the brush, what brushes to use..how much easier can you get?! I am currently working on my first bird from the book. My family can't get over how life-like my painting is. I am even surprised at the results!

Last night I watched it on DVD. It starts slow, but after the first 30 minutes just about every scene sucks you in deeper in caring about the characters. Four spirits who died together are stuck acting as unofficial guardian angels for the kid who was being born at the time of their crash. They don't know why for 30 years, and when they find out, the film really takes off. Part \\"Ghost\\" and part \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" and a hint of \\"The Bishop's Wife\\" can be discovered here, but if your eyes are dry by the time it ends, then your heart is the hardness of a diamond but with none of the gem's sparkle.

Until now, even though I have watched this movie a thousand times, it still makes me cry. Robert was very good for this part as the mortal who helped the four souls he befriended. The four souls, from the time Robert was a baby, they were his best friends. When they came back when Robert grew up, they found out that they can finish their unfinished businesses on their time here on earth.

Robert Downey Jr plays a man inextricably linked with four people who all died at the very moment he was born. This is a great springboard for Downey Jr's talents, as he is taken over by each personality in turn, in their search to find the one thing they missed when alive. This is a funny, sweet and romantic film that is well worth checking out. It's the kind of movie guaranteed to cheer you up and leave a slight lump in your throat.

Downey Jr is as always a treat to watch. The cast are great. And yes it's such emotional puppet-work, you can almost see the strings being pulled as each setting is put together, Like a lot of movies you watch them go through the steps. 1/ When the dog or horse or cat or whatever is in danger of dying. 2/ The two lovers keeping missing each other by minutes as they trace their steps. etc. But I'm a cynic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect But Do Not Put Glass in Dishwasher","review":"I have been terribly pleased with this Boston Shaker.

One warning: the handy (never tested for accuracy) gradations on the glass were washed off when I put it in the dishwasher. I rarely dishwash my barware, but did so with this.

Granted that the rating should actually be better than the 1 star I am giving it, but I have never read a book rated 5 stars that is as bad as this book. Consequently, the purpose of this rating is to reduce the overall score.Gripes with the book- Its more about why one should network, rather than specific methods of how to network- The book alludes to all these famous personalities but one somehow gets the feel that quite a few passages are deliberately inserted not for their relevance but so the individual's name can be inserted on the front cover.- The marketing of this book is overzealous"},{"rating":"1","title":"More like 2.5 Stars","review":"I was a little surprised that most of the chapters were about how successful networking has been for people.

Vasari writes about artists who were, for the most part, his contemporaries. He knew of their work and their lives, if not first-hand then by reputation or by association. The little stories he weaves into their lives give insight into each artist's personality. Though Vasari does try to make them all fit the mold of the Renaissance man, he shows us the chinks in the facade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Time for Tom Waits","review":"Having seen the great performance of Waits in Florence, I started to see if some videos were available.

I'm a big fan of Olivier Gruner and I liked him in Nemesis, but Automatic is nowhere near the film that Nemesis is. Yes, Gruner plays the man/machine character very well, but even he can't save this film. I'm not real finicky about film details but this one is definitely not a 4 star film by ANY stretch of the imagination. The film's imagery consisted mainly of closeup shots of prop machine guns going off and sequences of bad guys' hands pulling grenade pins. The film's dialog was about as engaging as it's imagery. Even when playing the man/machine guy in other films, Gruner is still able to add depth and humanness to the character. However, he was not able to achieve this in Automatic. Blame it on poor writing, poor directing, or whatever.

Given that, I think Kopfschuss is a letdown follow-up to Eins (aka Wer Bist Du), which delivers more guitar-driven songs with attitude and some variety, and I think really excellent. I also prefer Himmelfahrt because there is a bit more variation in the songs - not quite so repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to Rammstein","review":"Unlike Rammstein, Megaherz is much more guitar driven and uses much less electronics. Except for the first song, it really isn't that hard of a cd when you compare it to Sehnsucht. If you are looking for somthing harder than Rammstein, keep looking. It's not a bad cd, but it is not as hard as people make it sound. The cd does have 3 or 4 good songs, but nothing that rocks like Das Model, B��ch dich, or Du Hast.

(The price of the only available copy of the book would tend to steer off the general reader anyway).My objection to the book is its tongue-in-cheek theme, kind of a hokey machismo carried by the text, of an erotic female archtype personified as Eve. Also demeaning, in this case to tribal society, is the juxtaposition of scenes of tribal life, which are woven into the theme.

Despite what another review wrote, this is NOT one of Boulez' best efforts. I just don't think he likes or understands this searingly romantic work. DG should be ashamed of the PR blurb on the back and the producer of this should be replaced. Gimme Blomstedt, Bernstein or Stokowski any day. Even Bruno Walter is more exciting that this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boulez' crappy interpretation...","review":"Yes. Boulez' CRAPPY interpretation... As in: NOT AN INTERPRETATION AT ALL! As has been stated, it's just an emotionless \\"reading\\" of the score! The symphony was otherwise fine, except when the final chorus comes along, I almost grabbed the CD from the player and threw it into the wall, screaming: \\"Damn you, Boulez, for recording such a TOTALLY EMOTIONLESS AND FLAT coda!\\" I cannot even begin to comprehend HOW that is possible, unless you ignore 95% of the dynamic indications in the score! The Choir was half asleep! They are supposed to sing \\"MIT H?CHSTER KRAFT\\"! ARGH! I want to destroy this disc, but I think I'll sell it instead, so I can get some of my wasted money back! I repeat, WASTED MONEY! I will NEVER again buy a CD with Boulez!

It's a reading. All the notes are played rhythmically and precisely, without any emotional involvment in the score. The VPO is a great orchestra that produces the results its conductor wants.

I was very disappointed because the growing conditions in places like Minnesota, Wisconson, Iowa and Illinois are not represented. I would also conclude if you live in places like Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky, you may also be disappointed because those climates and growing conditions are also not represented. While one could follow the regional guides for the Plains, Mid South or the Northest in these areas, omiting these regions really is not acceptable.

Amongst random thinking-horror elements, that is elements which are horror in that they make your skin crawl just enough, but not horror so much that our girl friends won't want. Thinking enough that you won't just predict what the story will resolve to, yet planned enough that you can try to guess.I would rate this film amongst such films as Old Boy, with it's explicit direction, yet lack of prediction (the ending isn't completely obvious), and Dark Water or Ringu for it's skin-crawly elements that we all love.I am happy with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immersive ghost story.","review":"Good movie. Mis-marketed a bit perhaps... its more of a ghost mystery than a horror or shocker. Even the music in the movie menus is inappropriate in that regard. I went into it with the expectation that it was more of a story & less of a shocker (as others have written in their reviews here) and I left happy.The first 20 minute of the film are a little under refined, leaving you wondering if you actually want to watch it, but it picks up and grabs you pretty well after that.

I am a raw foodist, and I own many many raw cookbooks. This is the one I use the most. I have tried several of her recipes, and have yet to find one that isn't amazing. Renee offers a little bit for everyone, including several dressings, salads and soups that take no time at all and very few prep tools. She also has some more challenging entree recipes for those who are looking to impress.The thing I like most about this book is how much of it she dedicates to the lifestyle of a rawfoodist, describing unusual foods, connecting food to spirituality and yoga, and bringing a wonderful uplifting flow of energy to the reader. This one is definitely a must have among raw foodists and an enjoyable read for anyone interested in the wellbeing of themselves and the wellbeing of the planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm giving the book to Goodwill","review":"I bought the book becuase I like to try new and varied dishes. The first (and only!) thing I made was the Ginger-Curried Pumpkin Soup. It sounds delicious but it's the only thing I've ever made that almost made my husband throw up! In retrospect, it does seem questionable that the recipe calls for 4 cups of pumpkin and 1 cup of onion. Raw onion is really potent! There must be a typo with the quantities but a lot of the recipes are complex and I don't want to take my chances again. So I'm giving this to goodwill.On a more positive note, I do have to admit that I found some of the information on the raw foods diet quite interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Pics, LONG ingredients list, disappointed.","review":"Was very hopeful this book would be a good starting point for vegan, vegetarian recipes. After reading other reviews I thought I'd be happy with this book. I was wrong, no pictures at all, I like pics to see what the dish is supposed to look like, ingredients list for many recipes is very long and time consuming methods, You would think raw food wouldn't take that long to prepare! The first half of the book has no recipes at all, just an explanation of the different foods. Pretty disappointed to be honest, i'm already looking for a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of Filler","review":"Got this one for a gift...recipes look good but fairly complex..OK or the occasional gourmet meal but nothing I would use daily. What I mostly object to is all of the pointless information about each and every kind of possible ingredient that fills the first half of the book. Useless tidbits like: \\"Lemon: This fruit has yellow skin and flesh\\". No kidding! Then the author goes on with each and every variation of each kind of fruit. Do you really need the description for 12 different varieties of apple? I guess if you want to be a gourmet raw chef this might be useful information, but for the average aspiring raw foodist there are far better books out there with much more information that you can actually use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid investment for anyone concerned with their health","review":"You can find this book in the bigger bookstores.

It is set during the Napoleonic wars. It follows the careers of two officers in Napoleon's army. They become involved in a duel over a ridiculous point of honor and proceed to fight numerous duels over the next couple of decades. The duels are portrayed in wonderfully accurate detail, no Errol Flynn mincing around with a foil here. The duels are bloody and brutal, but neither duellist ever achieves a clear cut victory. Harvey Keitel and David Carradine are great. Based on a Joseph Conrad short story (I think)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savagely beautiful!","review":"This movie is so extensively & extremely faithfully reviewed below there seems little more to be said. However, whilst I have nothing to add to the storyline opinions, I do want to add my own endorsement of perhaps the most striking & stunningly beautiful cinema I have ever seen. From the awe-filled, haunting images of frozen dead soldiers during Napolean's retreat from Moscow to a delightful early, misty morning in the countryside of France; every scene is an absolute perfection.

Barbara Holloway and the other ongoing characters in this series are engaging, believable and people you'd like to know. Wilhelm develops their character and lives in each book in this series and in her other novels, but each book can certainly be a stand-alone read. The plot in this book offered many twists and turns, as well as the journey of discovering the emotional and psychological insights into how the characters deal with the circumstances they find themselves in.

It draws attention to the book, and if you leave it on the coffee table, visitors are drawn to it. Then their reaction is priceless.

But if you really need this book you should rent the book for class from Chegg (that's what I did).I started HTML in 1998, the only thing I saw useful was using CSS to make your pages uniform.

Common job descriptions were included in the first book; those included in this work are additional and not what I needed to develop descriptions for employees in my company. For example, I need a complete description for our company financial controller. It was in the first volume. I wish that would have been explained in the editorial material for the book. I am unable to use this book and feel that I wasted money purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has made a Jack London fan out of me.","review":"This is a fascinating, fast-paced story about Man just before he became Man. I loved being taken back to our origins by the totally plausible \\"time-machine\\" of genetic memory as presented by Jack London. The story literally shows us the stuff our dreams and we ourselves are made of. This is the first Jack London I've ever read and I'm looking forward to more. I somehow missed having to read Call of the Wild in my school days. I find the style crisp and concrete, and the \\"far out\\" premise of the story very believable. I would recommend this to any thoughtful junior high school student and to all adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Sleep, Perchance to Remember","review":"Nightmares plague the narrator's childhood. In these dreams he relives the pre-stoneage life of one of his proto-human ancestors. Each night is a different episode from his ancestor's life, and the episodes are lived and relived in a jumbled, non-chronological order. The narrator places the episodes in chronological order and tells his ancestor's biography. What emerges is an action-packed, engaging saga of adventure and romance at the dawn of humanity.London got the science of genetics wrong as he tried to explain how the narrator could have such memories, but he seems to have gotten one thing right. Modern paleo-anthropology posits that for most of prehistory, the earth contained several coexisting species of hominids. London peoples his world with three hominid species. His description of the interaction between these species probably gives an accurate depiction of ancient man's inter-species interaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for parents and kids","review":"This very simple first reader will have your young child identifying the words rapidly.

I loved it. It planted in me a strong desire to visit Kyoto and climb Mount Kurama (and Mount Hiei) and find the tengu for myself.

Through some kind of magic voodo, the Dave Thomas has written a book that is accessable and enjoyable to read for both novices and experts alike.For its tiny footprint, it covers everything you could need to know about Ruby, and the Rails framework. Its style is light and has just enough humor to make it fun without overdoing or making it hard to follow it like some other books (*cough*Programming Perl*cough*.) I really liked that their running example was a \\"real world\\" shopping cart rather then something very abstract like a \\"Gilligans Island\\" or some other silly nonsense.Even if you have no interest in Ruby or Rails, and even if you think the whole platform is a bunch of overhyped rubbish (it is not by the way), you should still buy this book just to know what a good technical book should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction, hard for reference","review":"I enjoyed Dave Thomas' \\"Programming Ruby\\" which provided a great tutorial of the Ruby language and and excellent rundown of the language itself, topped off by a useful API reference section.His \\"Rails\\" book is light by comparison. Its a great tutorial, but rather incomplete about the Rails framework in general. I have difficulty using the book as a reference for my particular project and problems. The API is available on-line, but doesn't give the insight for someone still learning Rails.I wish the book had more information and advice on developing more robust applications, and working with more complex data."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playing with Rails? Get this book!","review":"I've played with web development in PHP, and though I enjoy it, the time required to develop the structure and functionality of a website takes a while. After hearing a presentation on Ruby on Rails, I decided that I would check it out. After perusing many websites, I found it to be very quick in developing the structure, but I had minor trouble with the functionality, mainly because of my unfamiliarity with Ruby.After acquiring experience with Ruby, this book is a great way to understand the Rails methodology. Don't expect it to teach you Ruby, though; the main focus of the book is the Rails framework and the Agile development process. Be ready to invest in a good Ruby reference along with purchasing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"second edition expected for fall 2006","review":"Would have been 5 stars, but ...Wait for the second edition.

I think what I was really looking for was more like a Rails reference book, which this is not -- This is more like a \\"learn rails in 24 hours\\" except the difference is you actually CAN!Well written and a good collection of issues addressed. Basically its a must-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Material in a New World","review":"This book goes back to essays written thousands of years ago.

Not worth the purchase but was required by an \\"instructor\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb organization awful content","review":"The range of story and poetry selections is so limited, the materials bore students to death. The issues the texts are obsessed with--morbid existential guilt, death of a spouse or a parent ala Joyce, O'Connor, Cather, etc.,--no longer have the spell-binding effect they once had on the adult sensibility. We now live in an age where more dramatic problems occur. There has got to be some good literature that covers issues of our day, such as mass murder, rape, school-shootings, hysteria, incest, money problems, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, religious intolerance, etc. This textbook is totally out of touch with the current realities of our lives in the 21st century."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Too boring for my taste. Yes, there's lots of male nudity, but .... You know how nudists say that there's nothing sexy about their gatherings? That's how this film was shot.

I didn't find the guys all that hot, and there weren't enough closeup shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ever","review":"The rating should not even be 1 star - it should be 0. This is the absolute worst book I have ever read. The title is \\"Haunted Chicago\\". However, the book talks very little about \\"Haunted Chicago\\". Ninety-nine percent of the book is devoted to the history of Chicago and not the hauntings of Chicago. That would not be so bad as I love the city and read everything I can about it; but, much of the history reported in this book has conflicting details with the other material I have read on the history of Chicago. The grammatical and spelling errors in this book are so prevalant that it is actually unpleasant to read and sometimes you are left trying to figure out what he is trying to say. A very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"history not haunting","review":"This book is very interesting from a historical viewpoint--lots of background about the founding and growth of the city of Chicago. But hauntings? Not so much.It's really about 80% history and 20% hauntings and none of the photos are remotely paranormal.Throw in dozens of typos and grammatical errors (did anyone proofread this book?)and the author's love of exclamation points, and it's a hard book to like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double yuck.","review":"I bought this with \\"Bloody Chicago\\" by the same author and am now thoroughly disgusted. The author's books lack any theory, any journalistic savvy, any insight. I felt like I was reading a high school paper that had been lifted from the internet. After half the book, I gave up. A friend had taken me on the author's tour in Decatur (in central Illinois--decidedly not Chicago, though charming in a different way and in its own right). The tour was not led by him but another guide, and it was fascinating. Unlike this book. Perhaps the author's book on Decatur is better, as our guide on the tour told us Taylor grew up there. I won't be finding out, though! Again, try Ursula Bielski's \\"Chicago Haunts\\" series for everything anyone will ever need to know about haunted Chicago. I'm off ghost books for awhile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long overdue!","review":"I'm glad to see a book on this subject reach the market.

We do NOT need to have them all gathered up and thrown on the same disc. If you like Jefferson Starship, pick up the Dragon Fly and Red Octopus albums. Don't settle for \\"Miracles\\" when the band is clearly capable of more than just that song played over and over.Foreigner is a major disappointment as well. Pick up their very first album to find some lost classics. The Steve Miller Band was much better in the late 60's and early 70's when they were experimenting with ideas, such as on the Children of the Future album.People buy these comps to remember the past, but I have a better idea- start making some NEW memories by ignoring this compilation and by checking out the bands regular studio albums. I already gave you some advice for Jefferson Starship and Steve Miller. Don't settle for just the big hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tracks","review":"While this 90's disc sounds a bit dated today, it is still a disc with some great tunes.

I would recomended to people who study genetics and know their material well to use it as a quick reference.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a tutorial book for beginners","review":"That's right. If you are looking for step by step learning in this text, forget it. What the author does is present several game models on the CD. You examine the game and the code. He does some explanation at a high level of what the code does. There is some basic treatment of explaining what function, variable, and other programming elements are. But not enough for a novis. This may be a good reference text that shows project examples, but it is far from a solid instructional work. If you learn from picking apart examples, then this book is for you. If you want step-by-step explanation with support, then I can not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawkins 2 ltr pressure cooker","review":"I am glad to find hawkins on Amazon.

This little pot is a real time saver in addition to being a wonderful tenderizer. I have cooked round steak and chuck roast and a fork slides through both of them - no knife required. Pork chops, pork ribs - perfect. Green beans and potatoes in no time, and the texture of the potatoes beats boiling any day. Brown rice comes out chewy and tender, but not gummy. And dried beans - I've done pintos and great northerns, as well as black-eyed peas (and hoppin' john). I have never been successful cooking beans the way I wanted them - until now. Buy this pot - it cleans up like a dream and purrs along at just a notch below medium without using up all the liquid - no sticking of meat, grain, or vegetable. Why did I wait so long?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaker Cooker","review":"I wasnt very happy with the size of the product but then that was my fault in ordering this 2 litre cooker. The worse part is it just leaks water and whatever you have put inside if the water level is more than 1/4 of the volume of the cooker, ie, 500 ml water. So, basically i cannot cook for more than 1 person in this and whenever i tried to, it took me hours of refilling water and cooking to finally end up with non-edible food with a lot of waste and a lot of cleaning to do.

Suddenly, without warning... Someone decided to go crazy on me and spliced up scenes that make zero sense, an out-of-control story line and... was that romance they were trying? Where did THAT come from?This looks like a picture where the Director didn't have a clear path to an end, ran outta money and couldn't film the transitions between scenes he'd already shot. The result is a great first half followed by something that'll make you wonder if you drink was spiked. Also out of place are some great effects in the first half, then something that resembles 1969 effects in the later half. So bad you won't know to whether to laugh, or cringe and feel sorry for someone.Can't recommend buying, but if you get the chance to see it for free it's worth watching just for the historical aspect of how a good movie idea turns stupid in the wrong hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginning - lousy end","review":"The movie had a lot of action and suspense thoughout until you got to the very end.

I don't know where to start, but some of the camera work early in parts of the movie where terrible; with camera angles changing every two seconds or so, making it extremely difficult to follow the action. The peculiar mannerisms of Aurora (Melanie Thierry) were maddening to the point that you wished Vin Diesel, as Toorop or Michelle Yeoh, as Sister Rebekah would put some tape over her mouth to shut her up. Speaking of Michelle Yeoh. She was mis-cast in this thing of a movie. Terrible job on her part. She may have been added only to spice up the action scenes with her Martial Arts. Other than that, she wasn't very interesting. And Gerard Depardieu's part was useless and laughable. I can't be subjective about a movie that was too fragmented to make any sense.

Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility.

If you are looking for a Casablanca, or some other film of that ilk, you will not like this movie at all.I love all of Vin Diesel's films, as a whole they are the types of movies I can watch again and again.

There are some interesting action scenes, like flying missile drones chasing snowmobiles, but it seems to swing from expensive FX scenes, to grim, urban, post apocalypse scenes, which would be fine, except there are no zombies. If you're going to have monochrome gray post-apocalypse scenes you need zombies, unless you're doing a Eastern European love story, in which case, you need zombies shagging. The whole thing could have been shot in black and white and you'd have never noticed the difference.The upside is that you do get to see Vin Diesel growl at people and blow stuff up, which I think we've all missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok....?","review":"I know by know that I should not get to excited about a movie from the trailers. I like Vin Deisel when it comes to action. Complete dissapiontment. Action, she can fight? Ending, what ending? Ok, so if you think that this review is incoherent and disjointed you are right. I decided to write a review that reflects the movie (in my opinion) instead of pointing out its many flaws. My head hurt at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Babbling And Drear\\" would be a better title","review":"Combine a wooden, uninspiring performance by Vin Diesel, which happens to be the best performance in the film, with a confusing surrealistic plot that takes apostate bits and parts of Christianity and twists them together for its \\"religious\\" theme and you end up with ... nothing. It relies on special effects and glitz to try to put some life into the film, but fails at that miserably. My copy is going in the circular file."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad.","review":"I really wanted to see this in a theater but at the last minute chickened out as a barrage of poor reviews came out. Boy am I glad I waited to use a free rental Redbox coupon to see this one. It starts out very cool. And to be honest about 85% of the movie is pretty good. The fx are good and the locations are very cool. Vin D is what you'd expect. But there are some very confusing parts, and the ending possibly one of the all-time worst ever! As far as I can tell, and I think a lot of others will agree, it doesn't make ANY sense, even in the context of this strange movie. If you can see this for a $1 or for free, and are still interested even after reading all the bad reviews, then go for it. But you have to be nuts to pay good money to buy this on DVD without seeing it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok","review":"Love SciFi But this one was a let down. i am not sure where it was going.

Sure more could have been explained ... but as far as action movies go ... this had more plot than some! Makes me want to read the book that it is based on ... we'll see. It's defo not Vin's worst movie ... I'd watch it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Buying It","review":"Nope,I'm not buying it--either the movie itself or the premise that deep inside this is a really good movie ruined by bad editing, inattentive audiences, or the evil designs of the Tooth Fairy. Babylon AD is an almost incomprehensible set of action sequences set mostly in a Mad Max post-apocalyptic future, and nothing more. Vin hits people, Vin shoots people, people hit and shoot Vin, and stuff blows up all over the place, and nothing else in the movie is anything more than a thinly disguised way to get from one action sequence to another. Does that make it a bad movie? Depends on your criteria, I guess. I thought my time had been wasted, but then, you might not. Just don't expect more than things going boom."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the problem here?","review":"You can't go into this with high expectations. It's a Vin Diesel, cyberpunk action flick. It's got action, a decent plot, straightforward characters, and a bit of substance, especially at the end. You want art, angst, or profound nihilism, look elsewhere.

It's a fairly interesting book if you're a Rod Serling fan. It just suffers from a common ailment among biographies: It's insulting to its subject.

Also, the sections on the Twilight Zone and Night Gallery seemed rather terse, considering those were his two biggest shows.

In acting, the more silent Kevin Smith is, the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfamiliar with Degrassi","review":"I'll be the first to admit, I saw \\"Jay and Silent Bob\\" and bought the disc, however I didn't really know much about Degrassi the next generation. But it's OK, because the disc is pretty self explanitory when it comes to stories from other episodes that were carried over. One thing You'll have to keep in mind is that this was just a guest spot by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith on 3 episodes, the episodes were about Kevin Smith wanting to shoot his new Jay and Silent bob movie there(in Canada). One thing i didn't like was how Kevin kept throwing in anti Bush jabs into the show. I'm not a Bush supporter, but Bush bashing really had no place in this show.As for the show(s), they were very entertaining. I could definetly see getting into this show on a regular basis, even if it was a little Cheezey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly but fun","review":"This is great for me because I am a big Degrassi and Kevin Smith fan.

For $1.95, I am not returning them because my intended use is to put them under flower pots on my patio for decoration there; they will probably end up bent anyway under heavy flower pots. However, to use these as burner covers, know that the metal is very thin, and they will probably bend if you set a heavy pot on them while they are on your range.

Come on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"When I saw that The Pearl had been made into a movie I was hopeful that it would follow the beautifully-written story. Unfortunately, using \\"based on\\" in the credits means that Hollywood decided to stray from the original. I work with ESL students and believed that seeing the story in movie form might make it easier for them to understand but I had to do too much censoring to make it acceptable for my 8th graders.The cinematography was very good but the characters did not fit the physical appearance of the people in John Steinbeck's timeless story. The actress who played Juana was the most authentic character in the film.If you need something to watch to make you fall asleep at night, try this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pearl","review":"This movie is based on the book by John Steinbeck.

Imagine my shock and horror when I discovered this film has a HAPPY ending! Hollywood has totally changed the impact of Steinbeck's original work to satisfy those who need to walk out of a movie experience with a smile on their faces...unfortunately, a smile isn't what people will walk out with after viewing this film. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sincere apologies to John Steinbeck!","review":"There is no way you can ever compare this d-grade movie to one of the best classics ever, Steinbeck's The Pearl. For one, Kino, as a young boy starts out \\"white\\", then grown up, he becomes Mexican/Indian with a bad looking tan. The actors are all white, with tanned makeup, the language is way off-key, without a hint of true accent. The plot is not memorable, nor sincere to the book. But for the whitewashing of Hollywood, ironically, the Director is Mexican. What happened there??!!If you have read this wonderful book, you can see that watching this movie is no reflection. And it is easy to understand that the \\"book version\\" of many movies doesn't compare, but this is simply a different story. Don't even try it. Steinbeck would not only turn over in his grave, he would jump out!! .....Rizzo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Just saw this in the theatre...what a waste of good money! Except for Richard Harris the acting was terrible, the actors are horribly miscast...an altogether forgettable experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teachers Beware","review":"If you plan on using this to accompany the reading, it is terrible and does not follow Steinbeck's novella.

But other than that, it's a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid Scenery","review":"Vivid scenery. Excellent picture.

The frequent errors ruin the author's credability. The author fails to provide adequate information in his examples and the data seems to mysteriously appear. Integration of the CD-ROM program diminishes a proper foundation of the material presented. The CD-ROM also requires Excel '97, and has no usable directory.

After spending many hours and staring at formulas that did not make any sense, we found out that the book is full of fundamental errors (this fact was confirmed by my Professor). The impression I got from the publisher and the author was that this book has been written for the soul purpose of revenue generation and not for educational purposes.

I've never actually hated a book, but this one makes my head hurt every time I have use it.

By far, it is not an easy book to read, and even after re-reading chapters there are still parts that do not make sense.I have had to use this book for two machine element courses, and both professors admitted this book is not very good and we'd be better off using Mott's Machine Elements book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can not trust this book -","review":"I am a current Engineering Tech. student who is currently taking the Design of Machine Elements course at my school, and I feel that I am losing all of the hard work I have done in trying to understand the fundamentals of Engineering Mechanics with this book.

It was OK, i.e., very average, period. Several years into my engineering career, I purchased a used copy of Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design. My copy of Spott's text (the author must be about 118 years old by now) now gathers dust and pigeon excrement. Shigley's text is a much superior reference for machine elements and machine design applications.

I have also used the Schaum's outline on several projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Deathlands novel for quite some time.","review":"This book fills in some gaps very nicely, even going back to the first novel as well. The whole Doc Tanner storyline is written so damn well, it rings true and sorta stays faithful to what has been written before. It's what really stands out about this book, it's almost like coming full circle.The tie-in bit with Outlanders brought a smile to my face, it's good to see some attempt at continuity both within, and between, the two series. It was well executed and unexpected too.If you've lost your faith in the Deathlands series lately then get this book, you won't be disappointed.

So far, we have not been able to get the software to bring the pictures up on the computer from our camera. We don't know if that's not possible with our 1998 computer or if we're doing it wrong.

And a resort would be equally upset in knowing one of it's better attractions were not mentioned at all, and thus could possibly cause them a loss of a sale.It had good descriptions of the beaches, and adequate descriptions of the restaurants.

This is one of the worst movies EVER! It gets old and boring very quickly. There are way too much politics in the movie. All the fun guest stars were wasted in this horrible movie. I'm not above watching low brow comedies in fact I love them however this movie is simply not funny. Worst Sandler comedy ever. I usually like his movies but he really tortured me this time. It's a shame that it had the potential to be funny but it just had a really horrible script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross","review":"I thought this film was pretty gross. Lots of potty jokes and sexual jokes involving Zohan. I stopped watching when he started working at the beauty parlor and began to do more than hair with the willing clients. It was crude, lewd, and offensive and just plain not funny. I don't mind the occasional crass joke. But there needs to be more going on to make a film funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific","review":"I know this movie was intended to be silly, and I like Adam Sandler's silly roles and movies for the most part, but COME ON! This was terrible. There is not one good part about this movie..oh wait..the end credits were a god send! The jokes were overplayed and lame at best and Sandler's accent was horrible, and you are forced to endure the torture for all of those jokes. The only reason I even watched the whole thing through was because we were at the movies on a very crowded night, stuck in between a hundred people and it would have been a huge hassle to try to get out. All in all-huge waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, even for an Adam Sandler movie","review":"Horrible. I won't even waste my time writing any more than that.

My whole family watched it & not one of us liked it (not even the teenagers)The humor so was crude & childish it bordered on criminal. If fact I can not believe I lost two hours of my life watching this garbage. I would not have this movie if it was given to me for free. Save your time & money skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is sick","review":"This movie clearly a \\"public toilet grafitti\\" type with more and more perversive action as it goes on.I am wandering what was the message that the producers of this movie wanted to give...Canot see any value in it, except for that it is plain crude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on people, This movie was pretty decent","review":"The movie is a little deeper then just a slapstick comedy. While it is slapstick it makes you think of how silly the conflict in the middle east is especially at the end of the movie when what happens happens. What is really funny was when you had the two sets of people comparing each others skins and deciding that yeah, they do look alike and some of them even look Hispanic. This scene was the highlight of the movie for me. See it for more then just a comedy about what it is about. It is a political commentary on a part of the world that for the most part is pretty messed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I find the movie childish and rather annoying in the end. The humor is badly done and when it finished, I was sorry to have spent the money to see it.It's not one I'll add to my DVD or Blu Ray library."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T mess with the Zohan movie!!!","review":"I was SO disappointed with this movie!!! I LOVE Adam Sandler, but this movie is just stupid! I won't mess with the story line...It's been written by others already. Adam Sandler is another of those FUNNY guys who got a crappy script. It COULD have been funny...IF they hadn't went SO over board trying to make you laugh. I am sure kids would find this funny, except for all the sexual stuff. I am SO glad I didn't buy this movie. I watched it on t.v. Just my luck that I didn't have the extra money to buy this when it came out. It is bent!! It's just like the movie people did with funny man Jim Carrey, gave him STUPID stuff. They are both VERY FUNNY, but in stupid roles. I DO realize, they (the actors) chose to do these movies, but I wonder if they realize AT THE TIME, of the scripts that they will come out SO STUPID. Makes me angry. DON'T bother buying this movie! Rent it FIRST. Some may find this really funny, not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, very Sad","review":"A very sad, sad movie.

I always think of giving Adam Sandler a second chance...and then I regret it.I am never giving him any money ever again.This film is an embarrasment to humanity.

But this movie is just an insult to my intelligence. To enjoy the movie, I had to be a 5 year old, but some of the \\"humor\\" is for adults only. His movies such as waterboy, 50 1st dates, etc, have a lot of dumb but fun jokes. This movie lacked those jokes, the humor in this movie is just plain dumb, not funny at all.Avoid buying, at most rent it if you must watch all Adam Sandler movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grade School Humor","review":"Usually I do not care if a comedy movie is historically or culturally accurate, but this film was so off that it became annoying (specifically details about Israel, the Palestinians, and the conflict.)I was impressed at the number of actors who were willing to appear throughout this production, though I suspect they did it for the money or because Adam Sandler wrote them some I.O.U.s.Basically, this film relied on grade school humor. Actually, let me retract that statement because grade school humor has more depth than this script. Does Adam Sandler have a buttock/anal fetish? If you see the film, you'll know why I asked this question.Avoid \\"Zohan\\" if you can..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didn't Think He Could Do It","review":"I have been an Adam Sandler fan since I was about six years old and have fond memories of seeing his movies like Billy Madison, Big Daddy, The Waterboy, Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds, and Anger Management throughout my childhood. I'm also familiar with Happy Gilmore, Eight Crazy Nights, Spanglish, The Longest Yard, 50 First Dates and Click. I'd have to say that Sandler is one of my all time favorite actors, but this movie was shockingly horrible. I can't believe that he could make such a terrible mistake in being part of this train wreck. It was in plain bad taste, and there was nothing funny about it. About half way through I lost interest in even trying to finish the movie. My four year old cousin finds it hilarious though, so that should tell you something. Before this, I never thought Adam Sandler could possibly make a flop of a comedy, but here he has proven me wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zionist garbage","review":"Creepy, Judeocentric farce that manages to stereotype Arabs and humorize violence against whites while completely glossing over the Jews' ethnic cleansing of Palestine. Nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOME FUNNY MOMENTS, BUT............! 2 1/2 STARS!","review":"I like Adam Sandler and most of his films, but every once and a while he makes a film that just doesn't have the magic. 'You Don't Mess With Zohan' is one from the latter category. The film is not without it's funny moments and the formula plot will keep most viewers happy, but it's a little long for such nonsense and not well paced.The potty humor didn't bother me, nor the racial humor, because I realize this is all done for fun. It's about time we all grew thicker skin and stopped criticizing a film every time they use a humorous stereotype.We all came from other countries at one time in our families history and we've all been the [...] of a joke, so lighten up folks....it's only a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"funny show","review":"I think this is the funniest movie ever! I know it got some poor reviews for High School Humor. I guess i must be stuck in high school, because I thought it was hilarious! If you look at it for entertainment purposes which is why most people see shows, I think you will enjoy it. if you tend to over analyze and try to find philisophical reasoning behind everything,this may not be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the 99 cent rental but no more.","review":"Very surprised that this movie was soo poorly done. Rented it for 99 cents but it was barely worth that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not At All What I Expected","review":"When I first saw the trailer for Adam Sandler's \\"You Don't Mess with the Zohan,\\" I thought it would be a hilarious movie. Fortunately, I did not have the opportunity to see it in the theaters and recently rented it. I soon found out that all of the funny parts of the movie were in the trailer.\\"You Don't Mess with the Zohan\\" tells the story of Zohan, the perfect killing machine who dreams of becoming a Paul Mitchell hair stylist. Upon leaving his homeland, he ventures New York City to fulfill his dreams. After that, the film is filled with a lot of pelvic thrusting, nudity, and crudeness. I found myself fast-forwarding through much of the movie because I lost interest so quickly. The excessive bathroom humor may be fine for some people, but after a while, it just became annoying.My suggestion would be skip this movie altogether. You'll be happy you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Movie. Ever.","review":"Not sure what's going on with Adam Sandler these days. It seems as if whatever freshness he brought to the tasble early on is gone. Now, its as if he's pursuing what he thinks is comedy. This wasn't justa bad Sandler movie, it was a bad movie period."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Swing And A Miss","review":"Adam Sandler is like a nearly washed-up pro baseball slugger; he either hits one out of the ballpark or looks absolutely ridiculous striking out on three curve balls in the dirt. This one is the latter.With bits that oftentimes give a wink and a nod to old Saturday Night Live skits and a heavy dose of unsettling sexual \\"humor,\\" this ultimately proves to be a very weak attempt by Sandler to deliver a comedic twist on the Arab-Israeli conflict.Die-hard fans will enjoy the breeze from the swings, but Sandler fails miserably in the clutch."},{"rating":"2","title":"beating cows and Kitty hacky sack","review":"This movie really has no shame. totally silly, but it's all in fun. There isn't anything really side spiltting, but the silliness is even from the start to the end. Loaded with cameos from all types of stars from Mrs. Garret from the Facts Of Life to Mariah Carey. One of the better comedies out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I laughed","review":"The silliness was over the top, I couldn't help it. SNL alumni and middle eastern comics and Chris Rock keep the viewer entertained even when Zohan is present. Not tasteful or incisive but this is Sandler the comic. What did you expect?"},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away, unless you like a 10 crotch jokes per hour","review":"let me get this straight, I have never ever written a movie review. What drove me to invest my time in reviewing this one is the hope that God may erase a large chunk of my sins for the service I am about to provide you. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!! Go spend your money on something classier, like any Mel Brooks movie. I literally felt like puking and had to abandon my wife in the TV room when I took shelter in my bed. Needless to say, after a disturbed night involving screaming, sweating and a hasty message that I left on a therapist's answering machine, I finally came to grips that the 45 or odd minutes I spent watching the movie, will require a regular regimen of diet, exercise, yoga and as mentioned before, a costly therapy session or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worthwhile","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and commend the author for presenting his research in such an accessible form. I've incidentally come to a better understanding of the abiding interest in Jacobean politics by present-day descendants of the Scottish families involved. Perhaps I've also come to an appreciation of the self-identification, stemming from this fascinating history, of some Protestant neighbours from my childhood.Lomas has included an extensive bibliography but apparently at the time of writing was oblivious to the even more far-reaching account of the principle actors' philosophical roots, as detailed in M. Baigent and R. Leigh's The Elixir and the Stone (Penquin 1998; available at Amazon.ca and Amazon.co.uk)In summary, the book lives up to all of its claims and is excellent value, particularly in the paperback Fair Winds Press edition or the Headline Mass Market edition, the latter available through Amazon.ca as \\"The Invisible College."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Never Realised this about Freemasony","review":"Before readiung this book I was inclined to think that Freemasonry was just a slightly spooky charitable dinning club. Lomas's study of the formation of the Royal Society of London made me realise just how important a society freeemasonry is.This book shows Sir Robert Moray. Charles I and II and Oliver Cromwell in a new light for me. I hadn't realised how Freemasonic ideas had influenced both the growth of science and of American democracy.Keep up the good work Robert.

I first heard Runnin' Round the World on my Pandora mix, and fell deeply in love with the honesty and simpleness of the music and the sincerity of the lyrics. There is a nice variety of playful melodies in this freshman grouping. Pete and J create songs that are are beautiful in a youthfully simple way, akin to the great fore fathers of folksy rock harmonic partnerings such as Simon and Garfunkle and Peter Paul and Mary, with the fine instumental abilities of James Taylor. Note the rhythms, the funny little pauses; cherish them like those awkward first kisses. Enjoy this intriguing first effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book deals with Quantum cosmology, time (most contributors think that god is not eternal), the laws of nature, the problem of mind (they have a reductionist and evolutionary view) and the anthropic principle. The overall view of the book is neotheist. The authors are scientist or theologians.It is incredible that there is no contribution and no consideration of the many works of the philosopher William Craig, who is the authority in the matter. Many of his articles can be found at leaderu.com, and his book is more serious than this one (the debate with Smith: \\"Theism, Atheism and Big Bang Cosmology\\"). Concerning the mind, Moreland's \\"Immortality\\" or Swinburne's \\"The Evolution of the Soul\\" are better works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the Most Practical Book on Psychic Phenomena","review":"This book comprise 41 chapters, covering topics like Telepathy, Personal Magnetism, Trance, Spirtualism and Mediumship, Hypnotism and Mesmerism, Psychometry, Clairvoyance, Automatic Writing, Apparitions, Reincarnation, What Happens After Death, Crystal Gazing, etc. There are also exercises to try out.Some books on developing psychic skills also cover chakras. This topic is not covered in this book, though. However, it is a very complex topic and deserve a treatment on its own in a separate book.A index (which it doesn't have) at the end of the book would be useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"Excellent book for beginners looking to develop their psychic powers, or advanced psychics that would like to hone in on their goals.

I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Diving???","review":"Being relatively new this sport I enjoy all the information that I can get. This however was not enjoyable. The title itself seems to be a marketing gimmick to get people to buy this book, at no time were any \\"extreme\\" aspects of diving mentioned, unless you count the ancient rebreather that is featured.

Saw this sequel (Marque and Reprisal) in the bookshop and picked it up for a bit of light reading. Was pleasantly surprised - far better than the first book in the series, not much by away of plot but lots of good action, well-written, all in all it delivers what it promises.

Accelerating quickly, you are breathlessly taken through a series of jarring, thrilling events. A wide variety of science fiction fans should enjoy this book. This series and setting hold great future promise.So, why four stars instead of five? This book had the action and plot to grab and keep your attention. What it seemed to lack a bit was the depth of characterization and development that I have come to expect from Moon's incredible talent. Her masterful work in other series has set high expectations. Then again, this is certainly a personal preference. Some may find too much depth gets in the way of the story for them. Another minor disappointment is a couple of the situations seemed a bit too contrived. Again, these are minor disappointments in an overall excellent book. I fully recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marque and Reprisal","review":"As I have always enjoyed most of the Elizabeth Moon books, I thought that this one is a slight \\"let-down\\". It is so similar to the previous book \\"Trading in Danger\\", book 1 of the \\"Vatta's War\\" series. I expected it to be written like \\"The Serrano Legacy\\" 7 book series, which I throughly enjoyed. I do however recommend that if anyone enjoys a good story line in the science-fiction/fantasy line, Read this book as it can only be the fore-runner to another mind-blowing sequel to the next book in \\"The Vatta's War\\" Series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very informative book, for people at all levels","review":"This is one of the best books I have read on crystals.

And clearly more people should consider the benefits of renting versus ownership, especially in a highly mobile world which seems to be getting more so. My personal belief is that more people have trouble on the spending side than they do on the income side. This book is for them. Once you have your income and spending in balance, you're free from a lot of debt related headaches. I'm now retired so I gave this book to my daughter to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This book contains little new information and a lot of \\"victim-thinking\\". If you are looking for a way to make changes in your financial life, including more free time or early retirement, I recommend, Your Money or Life, or The Energy of Money, or even the somewhat more radical, but useful, How to Survive Without a Salary.The last half of this book seems to be an extended rant, finger pointing at all the bad guys out there: advertisers. salesman, employers and the government. For a book that supposedly advocates thinking for oneself, there is an awful lot of blaming going on here.I recommend not buying this book and reviewing instead some of the above-mentioned titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work Less and Play More","review":"If you want to retire early or take more time off work, this is the book for you.This book is a quick read. There are very few boring spots. The author is funny.I understand now why the retire early home page gave this book five stars - this book delivers.This book doesn't talk much about investments. But it does talk a lot about basic personal finance, simple living, and how to build a personal treasury.This book was written in the 1990's, so its a bit dated. But Work Less and Play More is a great read anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A piece of Art in itself!","review":"This book is beautifully photographed and written with great detail.

There are a bit fewer \\"great\\" projects in it than I had hoped for and a few things more basic than I would have liked, but the bulk of the book is great. It's very inspirational and just plain fun to look at. The book shows a lot of pretty piles of found objects without showcasing an actual project made from said items in most cases but there are tons of other examples to look at. There are also several tips on how to do things, such as solvent transfers, which are nice. I would recommend this more to a newcomer to altered art or someone who doesn't mind spending the money to look at things they likely already know how to do.

The re-enactors have very little to do, it got tiresome seeing Robin and Marion walking past the same tree over and over. There was very little about the film versions of Robin Hood which is more what I was looking for. If you want the story of Robin Hood's springing from mythologies and religions of different cultures then you might enjoy this but I would advise you to borrow it from the library or someplace else first.The True Story of Robin Hoodis more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have!!!!","review":"Anyone who loves the Legend of King Arthor stories will love this story.

I also know 4 other people who read this book and they also loved it. I hope you will enjoy the book as much as I. Also, the arthur is going to be making a sequal to this book and I can't wait.

If you are a Christian, and you have a secret love of lurid romance novels, you might give this a 5 star rating.But for the rest of us, this story is, well...shockingly awful. I love fantasy novels, and as a Christian I like try to find books that are acceptable for a Christian mind. This one had a nice name, and the cover looked interesting. It wasn't. The charecters were flat, with a horrible tendancy to make the strong minded main female charecter something to be \\"tamed\\" (which, by the way, she was.) And for a Christian book, I found the overt and unnecessary sexual references out of place. I don't mind sex scenes in a book if they are part of the story, but this book seemed to throw them in haphazardly.Please, support the cause of intelligent Christian readers everywhere and skip this book. If you want fantasy with a Christian perspective, try Stephen Lawhead or Tolkien."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but...","review":"This is an interesting book and a harrowing tale.

One of them even tore during installation even after being greased up and dismantling more of the brake lever than usual for these types of hoods. After getting them on they fit poorly, having a much boxier shape than is comfortable for any distance of riding, creating odd pressure points in your hands. Maybe they'll mold more to my grip in time, but at the moment I cannot give these more than two stars for being unreasonably stiff, easily tearable, and uncomfortable, with the only pro being that they're cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dia compe brake lever hoods black non aero from Niagra Cycle","review":"Dia Compe Brake Lever Hoods Black Pair Non AeroThis product is the best non aero hood for the price available to consumers.

I will probably end up storing these or throwing them out. Again, if they were the right wire gauge, I would have given at least four stars. :(UPDATE:I contacted company and they were quick to respond. They apologized for any misunderstanding and sounded like they wanted to set things straight. Although they said they sent me the correct 10gauge holders, the sizes are larger than those at my local store.

The parts are definitely greater than the whole, with outstanding contributions by Laurel & Hardy (who don't show up until the last 20 minutes or so), Lupe Velez, Jimmy Durante (as a would-be movie Tarzan), Charles Butterworth (as a droll tycoon), and George Givot (as a dialect-challenged lover). Don't look for a plot, and you'll enjoy this crazy-quilt of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dull \\"Party\\" With Few Highlights","review":"Every MGM director worked on this ill-conceived musical-comedy hodgepodge, but no one wanted to take credit - or blame - for the final product. Therefore, it's not surprising that \\"Hollywood Party\\" (1934) emerges as a rather dull affair. Among the few highlights are Laurel and Hardy's classic egg-breaking routine with Lupe Velez, a guest appearance by Mickey Mouse, and Walt Disney's Technicolor cartoon \\"The Hot Choc-late Soldiers.\\" The rest is VERY heavy going."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the 2005 Update and not a Full Architects Handbook - Make sure this is what you want before you buy it","review":"I was very disappointed.

Please make sure you actually want the 2005 update if you are purchasing this book. Having the year 2005 update was of no use to me; I wanted a full Architect's Handbook. Knowing this before the purchase will help both you and the seller. The book came to me with a note from a previous purchaser indicating he was returning it due to it being just an update as well.

Now, 25 years later, I am thrilled to have found it again! Not many movies stick with a person that long, but this one is one of those movies for me. An intriguing and touching look into the lives of a family of northern foxes, The Glacier Fox is one of the best movies of its type I've watched. Narrated by a resident oak tree, the story follows Flep, the patriarchal fox, through his meeting with Leila, his mate, and their trials of raising five frisky kits through the hazards of living wild. Although the soundtrack is dated (very 70-ish), some of the songs are absolutely beautiful, albeit sad. All in all, I found this movie every bit as enjoyable now as I did 25 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAITING FOR IT IN DVD","review":"I don't even have a VHS so hopefully it'll come out in DVD soon.

In spite of that, it was one of those movies that rang my bell, and still remember after all these years. I'd love to see it again. Fans of this movie might also like the book Sasha, My Friend (My Wolf, My Friend), 1969.

If only more films were released like this we all would be happy little campers. 3 of the 4 films are in glorious black & white. The 4th one is in color. The 3 black & white films also come in a colorized version that fit the time period of these films. Watching the colorized version reminds me of watching the films back in the 70's on TV. While I usually can't stand colorization, the technique used for the 3 film seems to work. I also think that young children, and adults well over 30 years old will be the only ones who really enjoy this box set. If you grew up watching these films on TV, then you must get them. Sometimes there is something to be said for nostalgia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Surprisingly good transfer to Blu-Ray. Thought I'd like the original B&W versions, but even the colorized ones are very good. Especially considering the age of these films and the low technology available then. Pure nostalgia only.

Brendel is not affraid to play this music the way that the original composer meant for the music to be played. Mozart's intentions and the intentions of many of the composers of that time frame was for the written music to be a frame wrok for one to improvise upon. This is almost impossible to find. The current attitude of stunch unbending reproduction of the printed page can lead to head aches if iven enough time. this is where Brendel shines. He is not affraid to leave the printed page.I highly recomend purchasing a copy of the pronted music to follow along wih any recordings of Mozart as performed by Brendel.

The twin protagonists, the unworldly editor and the worldly yet also idealistic printer, are wonderful. But the story isn't very tight. Short as it is, it reads as if written in installments. Interesting that it was published in London several years before India. I think that this book influenced Naipaul's House for Mr. Biswas -- Naipaul recognized his own father in Narayan's thwarted editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for a book...","review":"This book reads more like a prototype to what White Wolf was aiming to do with Midnight Roads.

Hopefully, Dr.Battery LHP200-GS will work better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Questionable Origins","review":"First, let's consider the negative. This battery came wrapped in a plastic bag (as a new one would) but had no other packaging. I cannot be sure if it's new, remanufactured, used, sat on, played with, sung to, or otherwise. Additionally, the battery capacity is closer to that of the standard battery's claims -- four hours on a full charge.Now, let's look at the positive. This battery is made available at a reasonable price point. It's clearly labeled as an original HP battery and appears to be in physically new condition. While the capacity falls pretty significantly short of the full claim, it does work better than the factory provided battery's 2 1/2 typical performance.In the end, if you're not so concerned about your battery possibly being serenaded before being shipped to you and the original packaging isn't a big issue, this isn't a bad buy.

Gives the reader a sense of people and places.Bad - As mentioned earlier, 60% of the book are pictures. And the pictures are not even in color, they're in black and white, which I don't mind, but they're not of the best quality.

There is no other explanation for his relentless, cold-hearted pursuit of justice as the Batman. But he isn't insane.Darwyn Cooke, in \\"Ego,\\" gives us a Bruce Wayne who is still new in his role as vigilante. He is insecure, which is a side of Wayne rarely seen anywhere in his long history. And he is haunted by a giant shadowy Batman caricature, visually reminiscent of Oogie Boogie from \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas.\\" Wayne has long conversations and arguments with his brooding alter ego, evidence that Batman is a separate personality rather than a mask. I'll admit, it's a take on the hero I don't like.Although the Batman entity is grotesque, the remainder of the art is fine.

In the first film, Campion is a mysterious benefactor and crime fighter who seems to come out of nowhere when needed and uses different names. The Scarlet Pimpernel or something close to it. Thereafter, however, the stories are conventional, Campion has only one name, has roots within the British class system, and he lives in a town where everyone knows him. Discs two, three, and four are conventional mysteries. And they are not well done. Disc four, Death of a Ghost, is the worst. I thought I was watching high school actors at times. And the character of Campion, who seems feckless and gets beaten up, makes little sense. Peter Davison made a wonderful Trisan in \\"All Creatures.\\" But his transformation into a detective does not come off.

The Turbie Twist is supposed to dry you hair quickly and conveniently. It is made up of a towel like material with an elastic bow at the top to twist the towel into. It comes in various colors such as white and pink. But it is not as lovely as it sounds. First, the Turbie Twist doesn't even dry your hair. The material is so thin that it can soak up only some of the water from your hair after taking a shower. Second, you can forget walking around while wearing the Turbie Twist. It slides if you your head when you just staying still. Lastly, the Turbie Twist is extremely uncomfortable. It pulls your hair back so tight that you feel like it's going to rip your hair off. In conclusion, the Turbie Twist will only cause you pain and inconvience and I strongly recommend you don't purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these!","review":"Have been using these for years - needed more for self and a gift.

As a bonus this collection contains video clips of interviews with the magazine's writers and the Spy vs. Spy animated shorts from the early days of the late-night comedy series Mad TV.The downside to this DVD-ROM set is minimal.

Us Baby Boomers grew up with it. It was our first taste of satire and critical thinking. And Mad Magazine has not outlived it's usefulness as did the National Lampoon. Mad still satires today as good as it did yesterday, although most of the original cartoonists and editors have died.Years ago, Broderbund came out with a 7 CD ROM package of all the Mad Magazines printed. It had a superior user interface which quickly located every article and cartoon in the collection. It even had every fold in and sticker collection. And it had the infamous MAD songs included.This DVD collection is a poor substitute. It claims also to have all the stickers- I've yet to find them in the collection.

I knew the click-wheel would be exposed, but there is no reason not to have a screen cover. And third, it's not a molded fit, as someone wrote in an earlier review. In fact, the fit is quite loose and given the openings for the screen and clickwheel, there is full potential for stuff like dust or crumbs to get inside.

In the process, she ignores her other daugther, at one point even forgetting that she has one. Of course, it was easy to hate her missing daughter by page 10. But, by the end I found myself thinking I don't like the mother much either. I have never wished that a character was in my living room so that I could shake her as much as I did in this book. The bottom line is that this book is extremely forgettable. If you are a true fan of Joy Fielding pick it up from the library if you must.

Maybe that's what makes a good book when you really get involved with the characters - not being a writer I don't know. How can people be so insensitive and selfish.

Basically it was hashing and rehashing of the relationship between an overly worried mother and an overly self-centered daughter. If you like Joy Fielding, stick with her other books.

A guilty pleasure, and a way to get through a long plane journey. But, my God, the ending made all the effort to get through to the explanation at the end a total waste of time. It was truly the worst ending of a book I have ever read. \\"Dallas\\" did the it-was-just-a-dream trick that negated a whole season of tv.

I just had to know more, I was furiously reading trying to find out what happened to Julia, where was she??? In my mind, I couldn't wait to give this book 5 stars!! Then BAM! That horrible ending! I felt so manipulated, cheated and angry I just wanted to sling that book across the room. I was so angry at the author for all that build-up and suspense, buidling up our emotions like that only to cheat us out of a realistic ending.

There are no mysteries to this book...the mother is obsesses with a selfish self centered daughter [and we all know where she is 'lost' to based on her personality] overlooking her other daughter. The mother character faints and buckles and whines about the disappearance of a daughter that appears from the beginning to be a social-path with no feelings for other humans. The last few discs, I only listened to the first few lines of each track...one whole chapter lamented babysitting the neighbor's baby which was just a waste of time.What is really LOST is your money if you buy the book...luckily I only borrowed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mom is a hopeless twit","review":"I kept waiting for the mom, Cindy, to stop being a hysterical, hopeless twit, or at least to start being a good mom.

This Is Love was also released as a single. Other strong cuts include Cloud 9, If That's What It Takes, Devil's Radio, and Wreck of the Hesperas (sp?). There really isn't a bad song on the album.

George was always in the shadow of Lennon/McCartney, but is a fine musician all his own (his slide work is unmatched).

The two songs just mentioned sound as if they could of been on Georges first true solo album All Things Must Pass. All the songs are strong on this one.

Yes, it is a good cardio but half the time I'm rewinding just to figure out what the heck she just did! There is not explanation of the moves just Amy calling out names that mean basically nothing to me. I usually just get so frustrated because I get lost or thrown off and by the time I've got it down she's moved on to something else. Do NOT buy this if you are not a dance/move EXPERT.

Some of the songs are a bit too bland, but the harmonies and instrumentation are rich and complex and Sascha has a fine,gentle, directly emotive voice. I find myself listening to this whole album much more than others I was more turned on by at first -- it has grown on me, even though I feel a bit embarrassed by its easy-listening vibe. Hold On, Hold On, the single, is a more dynamic cut (fun, kind-of-flamenco-sounding percussion and guitars) and probably the best place to start. There is also a gorgeous Thief song (The Siren's Call) on Jazzanova's Belle and Fou -- another very good album, much more mixed in terms of genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"The five previous customer reviewers offered lengthy discussions of Mariss Jansons and the PSO's latest CD of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 8.

For the less expert classical music listeners and/or non-diehard Shostakovich listeners, I can admit to being a classical music fan who knows what I do or don't like to hear. Therefore, I will simply say this CD is STUNNING and I love listening to it.Mr. Jansons and the PSO are marvelous together. Their work reveals the powerful emotions involved in this symphony and their CD leaves me wanting to learn more about Shostakovich's music and his world.Congratulations to Mr. Jansons and the musicians of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra for making this momentous piece a joy for the novice as well as the expert listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I'm not a big Shostakovich fan, but I bought this recording because I love Mariss Jansons and the PSO.

However, finding a decent 6\\" chef's kife was a bit harder.This knife is a good size, takes a shapening very well, and is comfortable to use and grip - as you would expect from Good Grips.Is it a $150 knife? No. Does it deserve a place in kitchen? Yes. For the budding gormand, it is perfect. Like all knives, it should be sharpened and honed regularly. That being said, I am happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good book","review":"This story really blew me away. I've always been curious about people who feel compelled to kill celebrities, particularly those they claim to love. When I began the book, I never expected to feel sympathetic toward Lillian, but I found myself caught up in the whirlwind of her life. The writing is vivid and rich, and the characters very real. I particularly liked the juxtaposition between Lillian's side of the story and Brooke's mother's side.Though Lillian never met Brooke, she fell in love with the superstar in her magazines and on her television much the same way millions of teenaged girls do. While the premise sounds fantastical, the events of the novel play out in such a way as to make perfect sense. I was left with an immense feeling of sadness for Lillian. The fangirl in me could imagine playing her role all too well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slight slip from the last 3 albums, but still worth a listen","review":"Herbie's last HEADHUNTERS-era disc that is still a fairly rewarding one for those open to his mid-'70's fusion of jazz with progressive funk/r&b. As with the previous few discs, Hancock and Maupin in particular get ample solo space, with Herbie still trying to integrate his talent for improvisation with his vision for genre-hopping. The music is a bit lighter in texture than the prior three albums in this style, and the repetitive semi-vocal track DOIN' IT hints at the rapid musical decline to come.

The remake of his own \\"Canteloupe Island\\" lacks the creativity of his re-made \\"Watermelon Man\\", sounding a lot like TV background music. \\"People Music\\" saves this record from a one-star rating, it seems it would be much more at home on \\"Mr. Hands\\" than this collection of forgettable music.Unless you're a Herbie completist, pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this","review":"I thought I would buy this knock-off item and save a few bucks.

Since none of the branches have a diameter greater than 5 inches I thought they would work. Turns out I was right, they were able to walk through the limbs fairly well IF I supplied pressure to the branch to widen the kerf as I cut. The teeth need to be offset from each other to widen the cut as you go. Otherwise, the blade gets really hot, smokes and I would imagine hurts any tempering the blade may have started with.

Human and spiritual experiences and relationships are interwoven such that at times you're not sure what's what. The descriptions of his encounters with creatures from the woods are vivid and the results are often surprising and unexpected.As the warlock loses direction in his life, so does the book and the last 100 pages seem forced - without the magic of early chapters.

The disk even has a DVD-R mark in the center of it! Unwatchable, sound is horrible too, the subtitles can't be seen most of the time. Bootleg copied from an old VHS tape for sure! I'm appalled that Amazon is selling this. Very disapponting.After returning this, I went ahead and ordered the Criterion Collection edition of this movie. That's the official high quality version and also comes with some extras and interviews. The real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guitar Joke","review":"The box title may sound appealing: 500 years of guitar compositions; in fact, an anthology like this could be the dream box not only for the guitar players but also for anyone who loves the guitar repertoire. Unfortunately, Kurt Schneeweiss perpetrates 7CDs (recorded with hall-like reverb) with \\"arrangements\\" or impressions on the traditional guitar literature along with modern and contemporary compositions (Schneeweiss' opus included); let's face it, the originals are far better than the Schneedeiss' \\"arrangements\\"; the other unbelievable fact is that all this rubbish is played (and recorded) on an out-of-tune guitar! Please,don't waste your money and time! Just forget it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Guitar Music","review":"Well if you are a classical guitar student chances are every peice you have played is included in this set. the recording is very nice. the playing is alright. this guy plays kind of sketchy. he's definately no Andres Segovia or Manuel Barrueco, but he is pretty damn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the watch!","review":"This movie is not like the book, but it is still very interesting. Patrick Swayze does a wonderful job as Allan. The rest of the cast do a good job as well, but Swayze really makes the movie. Beautiful scenery, and it has some funny parts. The movie is kind of long, almost 3 hours. Over all it is a great family movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP NOTCH VERSION OF THIS CLASSIC","review":"I just rented this movie on the weekend. I didn't even know that it had been made/released. The only other version I have seen is the one with Richard Chamberlain/Sharon Stone, which was also excellent. This version really got to me and I think Patrick Swayze was perfect as Allan Quatermaine. The only criticism I have is for the writers of this movie and the other version (even League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) where they always refer to him as Allan Quartermaine when, if you have read the book, you know it should be Allan Quatermaine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something diffirent","review":"I have to admit. I bought this movie by mistake! But oh well why not give it a try. Its a preaty good movie. I like the stories of Allan Quatermain. As I said its something diffirent.

We spent the first two thirds of this film waiting for it to start, the last third wishing it would finish.It took absolutely ages to introduce the far too many important-role actors into the very simplist plot in which just about everyone had an occasional lead role to play, as if they were taking it in turns to have a go.The whole thing was very \\"correct\\" and the costumes were nice and clean throughout. The presence of the bleached-hair, ridiculously overdressed blond who was supposedly reading a book as she rode along on a horse was awful. Even the man with the poorly faked Scots(?) accent was polite and nice when killed in a very slow and predictible heroic gesture.I gave it a second star only for the nice (and easy) landscape photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gawdawful, with gastly production values.

I don't feel that this one got enough publicity, though, because it was overshadowed by \\"La Femme Musketeer\\" airing a week later.Anytime you think of Patrick Swayze, you think of either \\"Ghost\\" ot \\"Dirty Dancing\\", but he does quite a good job in this film as Allan Quartermain. Allison Doody (Elizabeth Matiland) also did a great job, and it doesn't hurt that she's beautiful. My personal favortite is Keketso Semoko (Momma Tuussee). Any scene that she's in, she steals.Hallmark used some beautiful scenery in this film; Going from the forest to the desert, it all looks wonderful. This is another Hallmark movie that you don't want to miss.

I have now been through Two easy share docks and two NiCad batteries and still cannot get a prolonged recharge on the batteries. Yes I followed the recommended full charge/discharge/recharge sequence in the beginning and still get a low battery signal when the dock says that it is fully charged. Apparently the battery itself is charged but the camera,for some reason, doesn't recognise this. (I took the battery to a camera shop and they tested the charge on the batteries.) Sometimes if I turn the camera off and then on after a few minutes, it will be OK. The unreliability is about to get me to give up and get another. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't take returns after 30 days ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with Kodak","review":"I have a different model Kodak camera, however they all use the same EasyShare software. Running Windows XP, I could not get the software to work properly. After several hours on the phone with Kodak tech support, they couldn't get it working either. They said they are aware of the problem. It is now several weeks later and they still don't have a fix. They don't really seem to care either.It might not be a bad idea to consider other brands, instead of Kodak. Since, if the software won't work properly, then what good is the camera?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Graduating into Digital","review":"I took my first leap into Digital photography and am extremely happy with the DX4900. The camera arrived as we were leaving for Europe, so naturally went along. I purchaed a 256MB card for it and found I can get in excess of 600 photos on it (at the lower resolution setting). On the highest resolution, I get 260. Quite a roll of film. The photos are first class, just like film. The camera is easy to use, and has a multitude of great features. Only thing I would like is a higher optical zoom (2X + a 3X digital). Took many pictures inside dark builings without flash which came out unbelievable well. This 4.0 Megapixel gem may not have ALL the bells and whistles, but it sure has more than enough to keep me happy. As a sidenote, I was surprised to see that the camera was engineered in Japan and built in China. Doesn't Kokak design and build anything anymore????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 4MP Camera for price","review":"I bought this camera 3 weeks ago from Amazon (new) with the travel kit. Initially I was looking for a good 3 MP camera but when I looked at this one with great price tag, I couldn't resist. I must say I am impressed with various features it offers for the price. Ok, if you compare with other higher priced 4 MP cameras, it may not offer some of the advanced features but ask yourself if you are ever going to use those features. Todate I have taken more than 100 pictures, with various settings & I must say they are amazing. Camera is easy to operate & LCD, although relatively small, is very clear. Also, I still have not changed batteries even after using LCD screen for most of my pictures, so I don't understand the fuss about digital cameras eating too much battery. I would highly recommend it to anybody looking for camera with more megapixels for less price and easy to operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I picked this book up thinking that it would be in the vain of McKillip's other works. What I discovered was a confusing, un-engaging, and overly \\"literary\\" novel about a psychologically and emotionally disturbed girl with two distinct internal personae. If you're looking for more of the enchanting fantasy/sci-fi writing that I love from McKillip, this book is NOT for you. If you like early 20th century existentialist literature, you'll probably love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vikings!","review":"This DVD is great to have if your doing some research on the Vikings!

However, it is still viable in all those methods and certainly will help the user get a better grasp on estimates, even if the full blown function point analysis (FPA) is not used.

It was all of those things and more such as great dialogue and even better love scenes. Jeremy's happy resignation at the thought of having to wed a compromised Mags was topped in comedic effect only by his dismay at the idea that Edward wasn't going to force them to be married. Maggie's attempts to disuade Jeremy's pursuit were very entertaining to see. Ms.Cabot has a real talent for creating stories that are a delight read and cause an appetite for more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"PASS ON THIS BOOK","review":"This book was passable. I thought the two characters were very immature and did not merit their own story. They were playing at being in love and I did not find it entertaining. I have read Cabot's other 2 books and highly recommend those, but save your money and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it....","review":"Simply put-the story opens on the \\"hero\\" letting his Uncle know he's been kicked out of Oxford, for killing another student in a duel. This is after he'd already been kicked out of Eton and Harrow as well. He procedes to blame the Uncle-\\"because you've made me take the title of Duke\\". UGH-what a spoiled jerk.If you like your characters with a bit or moral fortitude then I suggest you skip this-no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A KEEPER...","review":"I really enjoyed Cabot's first book-Where Roses Grow Wild. My enjoyment led me to buying An Improper Proposal and this one. I really did not enjoy this book as much as I did the other two. The characters in this book seemed pretty young and the plot was kind of slow. I liked the idea that the hero was so much in love with the heroine and for such a long period, but I didn't understand why she was such an idiot for playing games and getting engaged to someone else. That pretty much is the plot. I guess this wasn't a terrible book, but it is not one that I am planning to keep or read over. It was already difficult enough to finish this book the first time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of her best","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cabot's books and found this one the least entertaining.

Ever since that first sensual awakening, Natalie knew Mack was the only man for her. Trouble was, the rough-edged loner had sworn off marriage - especially to an innocent rose like her - and told her so on more than one occasion. But Natalie wasn't giving up. For Mack had taught her the best was worth fighting for ... and Natalie would not settle for anything less than all his love!* This was my first Diana Palmer book & I really enjoyed it. This book will hook you right from the start. It gave me many laughs & a few tears along the way. I did find some of the phrase & expressions to be very repetitive. She used some of the sayings over & over again. That's my only real complaint. I would certainly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vegetarian? No. Healthy? No.","review":"First of all, I would like to say that I am not biased against this book because I am vegan. I was vegetarian for 2 years before going vegan, so that has nothing to do with it.Having said that, I would like to express my opinions.First, it offends me to no end that the author uses fish in the Puttanesca sauce. She also uses the term \\"strict, not even fish vegetarian\\", which is ignorant. Vegetarians DO NOT EAT FISH! By definition, vegetarianism is abstaining from eating the flesh of any animals or eating anything that results from the death of an animal. FISH IS MEAT! Period!Secondly, I can't put my support behind any book claiming over and over to be healthful that includes dairy and eggs in almost every recipe. From a health standpoint, you can include eggs and dairy in a well balanced diet and still be okay. But not in the LARGE amounts used in these recipes.Frankly, I detest this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"mooswood cookbook","review":"what a let down.

The recipes are healthy and pretty well laid out, but like most cookbooks, it often has buried in the instructions something that should've been highlighted at the beginning as a prerequisite needing some prep ahead of time, like \\"now add the special sauce (see recipe page xx)\\". Always good to read through a recipe completely before trying to make it or you may find some ingredient or preparatory step that you lack! That said, the recipes are generally easy to follow and most are tasty. The macaroni and cheese and the lasagne recipes are very mainstream and our family loves them. Not all the recipes sound as appetizing or are a little more complicated than I'd like to tackle, but certainly most are good and the book is a great value if you like to cook healthy dishes. I have two daughters who are vegetarian and I'm about 92% there, so it works for us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Very good book to have when you want to entertain friends at home.

I have both the old (\\"more butter\\")version as well as the new version.Recipes to try (IMHO) would be the chilled soup, Cascadilla, the swiss cheese & mushroom quiche, Baba Ganouj, Kristina's Potato Salad, Mushroom Barley Soup, Brazilian Black Bean Soup, Guacamole, and Lentil Soup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Create the Moosewood at home!

Being I am not a Michelin Star chef, the end result is not always as good as I would have hoped. The recipes are pretty easy to follow.The issue I have, (and this is not indicative of everyone) is I need a photo, preferably a color photo for me to cook to. Without one I have no idea of the presentation or color of the sauce or whatever. This book is just text and that makes it difficult for me ( a visual learner).Other than that the recipes are vegetarian or vegan and are easy, which is refreshing because so often our food can be difficult to taste unique and interesting.Try it out, it is totally worth the price, just be ready to be creative!Thank you for reading my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"You can have this cookbook when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers.

I was looking forward to some new veg recipe ideas. Not only could I not find a *single recipe* that sounded even remotely appetizing, I was put off by the author's extensive suggestions to talk to your vegetables before you eat them. A little odd I felt. It may be because this book was originally written in the 70's, but with so many delicious veggies out there, I was surprised that most of the recipes called for simple combos such as beets and rutabaga. There was hardly a mention of some of our delicious exotic and far tastier veggies.A true vegan may enjoy this, but someone who is new to a vegan lifestyle would probably prefer that their meals taste good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!! and Not Just for Vegetarians","review":"I have been using this cookbook on a regular basis for more than 25 years.

I've tried nearly all of the recipes over the past four years (excepting the desserts), and just about everything works: good-tasting, simple ingredients, easy to prepare, clear non-fussy instructions, and FAST. There is still the whiff of 70s Birkenstock, Berkeley, Earth Shoe, and prairie skirt to these recipes, but who cares. It's obvious that Ms. Katzen has tried and refined everything and can relate to the ordinary, good-faith cook. Brava and thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipes!","review":"Great recipes but where are the pictures? In today's day and age a cookbook like this should have been republished properly with gorgeous photos for each recipe and properly type set on a computer.

This began my collection of vegetarian cookbooks, namely those from this author (Mollie Katzen) and the Moosewood Collective. I highly recommend it--it is easy to follow, has a lot of great information about ingredients, and the recipes all are delicious! The only drawback is that some of the recipes are time-consuming, but each recipe has an estimated time for its preparation and cooking. This is very helpful, especially if you are cooking for company. If you are vegetarian, this is a MUST for your collection. If you are not, it's a great cookbook to have anyway. Treating non-vegetarian friends to these recipes has often resulted in their reconsidering their eating habits!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I've had this cook book for about 9 years now and have cooked nearly every recipe in it. It's easy to follow and the recipes are delicious. Each recipe has an estimated preparation and cooking time which is a great way to gauge the intensity of what you're in for before you start. I'd highly reccomend this book for beginers as well as more advanced cooks. Katzan explains each step in clear and easy langauge and also adds hints for where to obtain some of the more exotic ingredients. I've gotten so used to cooking some of the dishes that I've begun experimenting by substituting ingredients and seasonings. This cookbook includes dairy and eggs so it's not for vegans, but if you are ok with dairy and eggs then it's a good source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I love this cookbook! Mollie Katzen has a way of presenting a recipe that makes it easy to follow and fun to do. If I had to give up all but my top 5 favorite cookbooks, this would be a keeper.My favorite recipe in the book is Hot & Sour soup. I moved to a rural area that does not have any good Chinese restaurants (I'm very spoiled to have grown up in the NYC area where the food is always excellent and you have many choices). The few that I could find that have reasonably decent food would not make the soup without meat for me, so I was forced to learn how to make it on my own. Fortunately Mollie Katzen has a great recipe that was so simple to follow. I can once again have my vegetarian Hot & Sour soup!!The only thing that would make this book better is if it had full color pictures of all the dishes (but still is wonderful even without). The drawings are very charming, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"Speaking as a non-vegetarian who was looking for a good vegetarian cookbook in order to cook healthier meals every so often, I can say this is an excellent cookbook (as are the other Moosewood cookbooks).

The New Moosewood Cookbook has flavorful recipes that are easy to make and taste delicious.This cookbook has the recipes all written out by hand which is kind of neat - like a family cookbook - including small doodles here and there that give it some extra character.

The only real differences between the Gator and this one are that (a) the lock comes preinstalled on the Odyssey (the lock has to be installed into the Gator), and (b) that the Gator has holes drilled in the back for cable management while the Odyssey does not. I don't use my rack drawers for cabling/connected equipment so having the holes drilled is not helpful. I do like the locks being preinstalled. In terms of \\"build quality\\", I would give the edge to the Gator just because I think that the rack drawer/pullout mechanisms are better made and more solid in the Gator. I don't think the Odyssey will fall apart or anything but, if we are \\"splitting hairs\\", then that's why the Gator is my pick. But, the Gator is perhaps another $10-$30 more so maybe that makes up the difference.The bottom line is that both the Odyssey and the Gator rack units are quality pieces of gear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"From claiming that no Queen of England had a drop of English blood and failing to identify Mathilda (Edith) of Scotland as the daughter of Margaret of England, grand-daughter of Edmund II Ironside to saying that Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick and Kingmaker was his father's younger son and married twice proves a lack of research that is damning and makes this book absolutely worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The SACD version is better","review":"Despite what \\"Musicman\\" says in his review, it is definitely worth it for all music lovers get the SACD version of this disc....Not only do you get more music, but the sound of ALL of the music is considerably improved, even if you haven't gotten around to acquiring a SACD-capable CD player yet. For now, this SACD version plays wonderfully on all machines, and when you eventually get around to buying one which can reproduce the full potential of SACD recordings, you won't have to worry about buying yet another version of this recording, because you've already got it right here.As a general rule, buy hybrid SACD recordings when they're available, and then you can be confident you've got the \\"best\\" for the foreseeable future.

Vol. 8 is expected to come out some time in March 2006, since it's about every month and three quarters a new one is released.

Portman plays Novalee Nation, a soon-to-be mother that is forced to fend for herself when she is abandoned at an Oklahoma Wal-Mart by her deadbeat boyfriend Willy Jack, who flees the scene and is later arrested. Back at the Wal-Mart, Novalee gives birth with the help of Forney, the local librarian, who breaks through the pane glass at Wal-Mart to deliver the child. You then watch as Novalee and her daughter Americus grow and the budding love developing between Forney and Novalee. Tragedies occur when Americus is kidnapped, and again when Novalee's surrogate mother, 'Sister' Husband is killed in a tornado. Learn that home is where you make it, as Novalee ends up where she least expects, but seemingly where she was meant to be all along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictability almost saved by strong acting.","review":"Ah, I love the smell of white trash in the morning...smells like Hollywood contrivance.\\"Where the Heart Is\\" seems to be ambivalent: it's either a commercial for Walmart, or a poster film for the sterilization of uneducated southern women.The film's few strong moments are overshadowed by a plethora of disasters both natural and script-related. (I exaggerate not when I say that I predicted the line \\"There's nothing better than you Novalee\\" verbatim, a good half hour before the film's conclusion.)The only shining moments come from the lead roles Portman and Judd, both of whom don't receive the roles their talents deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchered Lesbian Flick","review":"This movie is just awful.

I've never read such a heart-warming story that really makes you think about life and how much there is to appreciate. But, after I read the book I was curious as to how the movie measured up, and I'm sorry to say that the movie didn't. The book has so much more going for it and really explains what goes on, not to mention, things that seem almost and completely different from the movie. For an example, in the book there's a tragedy involving the local library, and the movie, well, nothing remotely compared to that happened.

In my opinon I think that this would be a good family movie. In an R rated movie its usally a dirty comedy with lots of cursing or comic mischeif but this movie had neither.

The most inane subplot of the year in which the a**hole boyfriend tries to make it as a sangin' star. Horrible misuse of the wonderful Joan Cusack--this should be a hanging crime, friends. Worst of all, there doesn't really seem to be much of a relationship between Natalie Portman and her daughter... every note rings false in this movie. I hated it.

The story is very down home and touching. A pregnant girl hiding out in a Walmart after being abandoned by her boyfriend is certainly a grabbing way to start a story. How that girl survives with little education and no money and how folks in the Oklahoma town come to her aid--well, it all makes a good tale.

When The girl goes into a Wal-Mart store, Her boyfriend leaves her, and she must live their without letting anyone know.

Well, there truly was too much talk of religion...not exactly something you'd think of reading about in a murder mystery. The actual mystery part itself wasn't so bad. The main character was well written. And no, you definitely don't suspect who the actual killer is until the end. But I still wasn't thrilled with the end. It didn't really go into much explanation oh how the murder actually took place and that was disappointing. I only kept reading it to find out who did it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but not very realistic","review":"I really enjoyed this book but it kind of stretched the limits on being realistic.

Absolutely nothing about this book was believable. The plot was very, very thin, and the who-dunnit is absolutely absurd. Poor character building. I mean really....a young woman, presumably in her 20's, who has no friends other than old people? Hardly. This has the feeling that it was written by a woman in her 90's who is completely out of touch with today's society and how people interact in real life.

There were so many implausible moments and leaps of faith (pun nut intended) as a reader that I literally couldn't wait for it to end. This book seemed more as a vehicle for the author to let us know what she knows about martial arts and decorating rather than her ability to create a story or develop characters. I also got the feeling that she was coming to her page allotment and had to end the story as fast as possible. It's a shame. The premise was good... maybe it just needs some balance.

Even though the plot could be better, it's still interesting to find out who did it. What annoyed me a lot though is the religion that is thrown in, sometimes page after page. It doesn't start right away, so if you want to finish the book you have to stick with the religious aspects of it. Had I known this I wouldn't have downloaded the book. Why don't you mention it in the general description so people can make an informed choice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful","review":"This book wasn't really that bad; it had room to be a really good mystery but it dragged on for far too long, and the heroine came across as nave, childish and annoying too many times to count.

The plot itself had promise and I really tried to continue reading the book, but I ended up stopping mid way (which is not something I do!) I found the book predictable and difficult to really get into. I didn't care for the characters and their relationships weren't built enough to care.

This book was a struggle. There was no real mystery, and the killer was so unbelievable that it took ALOT away from the book. Not only was the main character very wishy-washy, and confusing but it took so long to get to the point of her history that when you got there you no longer cared. She is a 20 something with no friends her age, a therapist that meets her in McDonald's, and spends all her time with 60 something ladies, or in the gym. The premise was so unrealistic and the book is poorly written. On top of all that this book was riddled with SO MUCH religion it should have been billed as religious fiction, not a mystery. The best part of the book was the first chapter after that it pretty much tanked. I am very glad i didn't pay for the others in the series, because I would have been very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read","review":"This book reads like a too-long advertisement for Starbucks and God (in that order). I'm greatly annoyed by books that have a decidedly proselytizing bent and do not clearly identify themselves as such in the product description. Beyond this though, the book wasn't really enjoyable. The main character was a self-absorbed doormat and the people around her were caricatures. There really wasn't a mystery to solve along the way to keep the reader's interest. Just a lot of whining from the main character and then the wrap up. Definitely won't be picking up anything else in this series or by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

That's how it's set up, but the authors provide a great deal to think about, and if you read the whole book in one sitting or two, the reader might miss some important points.As it is, Arterburn and company has delivered what I'd considered a potentially explosive encourager to a man's walk with Christ. With many chapters dealing with intimacy, marriage, our walk with Christ, and temptation in its many forms, the questions at the end of each chapter are designed to provoke more than thought. More like action!!It's a fine book and highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"This is one of those psuedo-religious books that trys to take self-help, weak-mindedness and God's will and then throw it all together in a brew.I give it to the author that he is very straight forward and actually goes deep into the problems that plague men.

I found if I wanted to use it to it's fullest potential which is playing High Definition Blue Ray discs or watching the games in High Definition that I had to purchase a switch as there is only one DVI connection on my HDTV. The only thing is I had to purchase a DVI/HDMI adapter because you have to have two HDMI inputs going in or two DVI going in. You cannot have a DVI in on one side and an HDMI on the other as it will not work. It sounds like it can by the description but it does not. I have noticed just recently when switching back over to my HDTV tuner which is source 2 on the switch that the picture is not always there and I have to switch back and forth a couple of times. That's the only issue I have with it so far. It works well and the picture is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easiest Switcher for two HDMIs","review":"At low price and ease of use, this was a smart buy. My TV only had one HDMI input and with two outputs (Hi-Def cable digital box and upconverting DVD player) I needed a solution.

I only wish it was accessable by remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for the buck.","review":"Purchased the switcher on 8/31/06. I use it to switch between 2 HDMI sources, an upscaling DVD player (all output is 1080i) and a HD satellite receiver (various output >480,720,1080i< NEVER has a problem switching.No delays, no glitches, NO PROBLEMS! 100% reliable, period.

The Switch did not work with my two HDMI inputs (Samsung Blu-Ray Player and Comcast HD DVR Cable Box). Only one of the inputs would feed through the box. And then on top of that, neither Amazon nor Presentation Concepts Corporation replied to my e-mails about a return. So, I basically threw away the $54.95. This experience left a bad taste in my mouth with both companies. I will never deal with Presentation Concepts Corporation again; piss poor customer service.

I actually purchased them because blue's my favorite color and I like the rather unusual style on the sides. I hoped they would fit over my regular glasses and they do. That's a big plus for me.Another plus is that they're lightweight and the rubber tips at the temples and rubber nose piece make them very comfortable.My eyes are light sensitive and these aren't dark enough for bright sun, but they're perfect for reading on the patio...or when outdoors on shady days, working with my plants.I highly recommend these Dewalts!

Since I was ordering several products from different sellers, the charges got by me until I was reviewing specific package tracking. It was 30 minutes after I ordered and they refused to stop the order, shipped it anyway, so I'm out the shipping charge.

I prefer the indoor/outdoor lenses, but some of my people prefer the clear or smoke lenses.

It is almost as if I were not wearing any goggles sometimes. I would recomend these as a good value for students who want to be confotable during labs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff!","review":"I really like these bars. They are bigger than most bars and quite dense. They're basically like large, rectangular, dense cookies. For me, they are great for traveling because it truly is a meal replacement (and since there's no bogus \\"chocolate\\" covering, there's no melting). There are a few different flavors. So far, S'mores is my favorite flavor. They have this note on the wrapper that says \\"For Oven-Fresh taste: remove wrapper and microwave for 10 seconds\\" which I thought sounded pretty hokey but I tried and it's actually pretty tasty.

And it didn't automatically reverse at the end of the tape, either --- it just sat there and ground and ground till it finally shut off, and then it wouldn't do a thing (rewind, fast-forward, play, etc.) till I actually ejected the cassette (and I saw that the end of the tape had been scratched and creased by the machine while it was sitting there grinding instead of automatically reversing and rewinding as it was supposed to) and then re-inserted it.

Sure, he gives you all of that necessary information (prices, best value, etc.) but the true worth of this book lies in the pleasure reading it. Let's face it: If you're not planning on visiting a certain destination, you'd never pick up, much less buy, a guidebook on that locale. But Mark writes very well, with a sure-handed knowledge of the history and cultures that he comes across, and effortlessly works it into his background descriptions. The book is actually fun to read, and I suspect that if Richard Burton (not the actor!) were alive today, he'd pretty much be writing the same sort of thing.

At the time, I found it disconcerting for its view that religion and traditional values are futile, and that humanity will eventually become God-like in its ability to surmount nature. Looking back now from the perspective of another ten years of education - I can see that this book is a late 20th century manifestation of the deterministic narrative of perpetual progress through reason alone that was perfected by Hegel, Toynbee and Marx in the last century. History has shown that human progress is not always inevitable, and that both traditional values and religion are resilient in the face of change. Jefferson believed we would all be Unitarians by the second American century. Evangelicalism is on the rise in America in the early 21st century. All in all, this book is interesting but frightening - if only for what it says about the \\"progressive\\" movement's grand design for humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Book but","review":"Nice book for children but the print is Way too small.

I liked the smaller size which made storage in my garage easier. And it seemed to do the job for my small yard. My favorable opinon changed for two reasons: First it proved to be underpowered for longer or wet grass. Even mowing once a week, I ended up mowing some areas twice because it had trouble cutting the grass. But the bigger concern was the battery gradually lost its ability to hold a charge the first summer I owned it. It takes about 40 minutes or so to mow my small yard. Halfway through the summer I couldn't mow my entire yard with one charge. But the end of the summer I would have to recharge my mower twice to in order to mow my lawn.

The grass is not very long, the grass is not wet, the key is fully inserted, the battery is fully charged. In short, the thing should work but it does not.

The most recent piece that fell off held the handle together, which made for an awkward cutting of the grass. I am REALLY hoping Bully is telling the truth about how the battery builds up power after multiple chargings, as right now I am barely able to get my small front yard cut before the battery dies.

To our surprise it was extremely quiet.So, we started mowing.We started in the back yard, a flat surface of grass and it took it out in 6 minutes like no one's buisiness.We were stunned. So, we moved to the front yard.Our front yard has a very steep, short hill. We were intrigued to see what this little thing could do. We mowed the front yard and it cut great. It cut the grass as well if not better than a gas mower.The whole mowing process took about 45 minutes of motor time, and the motor didnt even slow down.

I can mow the tight corners of the yard where my old, gas driven mower could not get to.

We cut about 2/3 of our small yard (after charging for DAYS). This second mower died and never would charge again. We called the number on the mower (different number than was on the first mower!) and never received a call back. We have had to cancel payment via our credit card company. THE BULLY IS A RIP OFF.

It was a gift from my son for our little lot, and so I had to give the bully a go. It's simply brilliant for a city parcel. 16\\" is large enough to do the job, but small enough to stash right out of the way. And it is quiet so I can mow in early morning without offending. The fashionable wheel caps fell off, so I used a spot of tack to keep them in place. Other than that, I am very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"gutless","review":"nice and light but just bogs down with the slightest resistance. Haven't noticed that the battery has improved after many uses, in fact seems to be holding its charge for shorter and shorter. My lawn isn't huge or particularly thick. Kind of bummed that i have to by a back up battery just to finish one small section of grass. In my opinion, they need to look at some different battery types (ie: lithium ion) and perhaps boost the voltage as well. I would happily try some kind of retrofit if and when they offer it, but I think I will be in the market for a more powerful mower and chalk this up to a losing bet..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this mower","review":"After going through 2 of these mowers (one was a replacement for the first), I would not recommend it to anyone. The first mower stopped working after a couple of uses. Even with the few times I used it, my entire lawn (and it's not big) was not mowed. OMyGarden sent me a replacement and after charging, it went on and turned off. I couldn't get it to work again. OMyGarden offered to replace it again, claiming it was a faulty motherboard. I declined and received a refund from Amazon (which was not all that easy either). The concept is great but the mower needs some work before it can be worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not suggest this item","review":"Received the product as described. Great job Amazon. I purchased this for the lightness and versatility, as I was using it to maintain the cemetary. I wanted something that was lightweight for easy loading into an SUV. On the first use, the wheel fell off. I put that back on, and putting it away, folding the handle down, the bolt broke. I was sent a replacement bold with no problem. The number listed on the mower itself did not work. Another number located, put me in touch with \\"O My Garden\\", who sent me the bolt. On the second use, it now will not turn off. The handle controls no longer work. Once the switch is turned on, on the side of the battery area, it is running. This is going back to Amazon. They are excellenat to deal with, but they should get rid of this line. It is not equal to their way of doing business..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little mower","review":"The Bully is a nice little mower. Perfect for my small yard. It starts right up with the pull of a squeeze-switch and mows along for about half an hour. Does a nice job of cutting grass.

Mix in kids and horror, and you could possibly end up with a muddled mess. In Dekker and Black's hands though, this recipe paid off in a classic adventure film that may not have been a hit when first released, but, like many cult films, it's grown on people and been rediscovered on videotape and cable. Unfortunately, the best chance to relish the film came and went in 2009 with the out-of-print Lionsgate release, but it's nice to still have the option to pick up the film for those who missed out. The thing is, as of this writing, you can still pick up the previous Blu-Ray used for the same price or less, which makes it very hard to give this one anything more than a 2 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a complete success with a few lapses...","review":"In the accompanying documentary, the director says that he loved \\"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\\" and wanted to do his own version but with kids -- a sort of \\"Little Rascals Meet Frankenstein.\\" A great idea, of course, and thankfully it was mostly successful on screen. You get all the classic Universal monsters here -- slightly altered due to licensing reasons -- and a great cast of talented young actors (esp. \\"fat kid\\" -- sadly the actor who plays him died young in real life). The monsters are great and for the most part, it's extremely entertaining with lots of memorable lines. If I can complain about anything, it's that the movie occasionally forgets its audience and goes full adult in tone (the \\"bitch\\" line is a good example of this) but for the most part, it's all spot-on right. Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great 80's classic","review":"This Blu-Ray of The Monster Squad is fantastic great special features all the actors talk like they were on set only yesterday and the film has really nice transfer also.The movie itself is great the main thing I remember as a kid was Count Dracula calling the little girl a \\"Bitch\\" still makes me laugh each time I watch it, sad the movie didnt do that well at the box office back in the day.This movie is great for people who love 80's movies and horror this is like the lost boys meets all the classic monsters such as wolfman, the mummy, dracula, frankenstien & the creature from the black lagoon.The film is suitable for kids from 8 years up but there is some swearing in the special features.."},{"rating":"2","title":"great kid's movie","review":"I like to revisit my childhood from time to time and this is one of the movies that help me do that very thing.

This was the kind of movie that made my imagination soar and influenced me to be creative and imagine my own stories.MONSTER SQUAD is a gem of a film that sort of came out of nowhere in 1987.

Dracula and his minions set up \\"shop\\" in a old run down house to retrieve a powerful amulet.

It is the epitome of a classic 80's movie, complete with montage and montage song, one liners, a group of kids out to stop the bad guys, stereotypical bad guys, one liners and surprisingly good special effects that make you pine for the days where they used to actually make monsters instead of just computer generating them.

It gets clogged up very easily.Also, do you have small hands? - it is a big instrument. If your hands are small like mine are, you will probably find yourself avoiding middle Cs, C#s, and Fs (or suffering the consequences, as I am currently... ouch).

I never expected a plastic recorder to have such a rich tone. The reach for the third and fourth right hand fingers is difficult, but that's not a fault of the instrument; it's the size of my hands. Also, being plastic, it clogs up very quickly with saliva, so I need to clean it out constantly. But I'm having a lot of fun with this recorder playing all sorts of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price, a good first recorder","review":"I bought my Yamaha 304B in 2003 because I heard a friend's and absolutely loved the low tones of a tenor. I didn't know how to play it when I first bought it, I can't really read music either. In spite of this, within 10 months of purchase, I was able to play almost any song I heard by ear. The Tenor recorder is a great instrument because it is easy to learn, pleasant to hear, and is much more portable than other common instruments such as a guitar. The Yamaha has fairly good sound, is easy to clean, and is durable. I will say that it tends to get clogged with moisture fairly easy, but I can't be too picky for the price. Any time I play my tenor people always are entranced by it's smooth and haunting sound, it surprises people who believe that a recorder is some shrill and screechy child's toy. I do hope to get a wood recorder when I can afford it, but the Yamaha is a good place to start for a person who wants to give it a try without investing a week's pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I enjoy the tone and low price of this instrument.

After purchasing the YRA-302B and The YRS-302B from Amazon, I couldn't resist the YRT-304B. Of the three, this is the easiest to play and has the best tone.I wear L/XL gloves and the dreaded stretch of the Tenor Recorder is no problem. Don't be afraid to purchase this recorder, it is easy to play.If Amazon delivers this recorder in the same time frame as the others I ordered, you will not only be satisfied with the recorder, but also the delivery time.Yamaha produces quality recorders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable","review":"I am a professional musician. This item is not even minimally useable. The low notes below E will barely sound. The instrument is out of tune. Yamaha has agreed to evaluate the instrument. Results pending.

Unfortunately, the low D and C remain problematic. I recommend that purchasers evaluate this recorder upon receipt so that return is possible if you find it problematic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"This is a very amateurish recorder, not even suitable for kids.

I use them both really. I like how they hold an edge, the balance and weight in my hand. I've never used the really expensive brands so can't compare but I thought these were surprisingly good quality for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Knife ... Sadly, Not Quite","review":"I love this knife. It is the perfect size for cutting vegetables which it does beautifully. I use a rocking motion and this knife rocks (no pun intended) nicely. I especially like the way the grip is shaped to conform to my hand, and its heft.Now that I see how nice this one is, I am going to order the 6-1/2 inch version: http://www.amazon.com/Oxo-Grips-Professional-2-Inch-Santoku/dp/B000A13OES/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&s;=home-garden&qid;=1242591257&sr;=1-13May 26, 2010I originally rated this knife with * * * * * (5 stars) but sadly must lower my rating. Since writing my review, I purchased the 6-1/2\\" knife and am happy with it so far.

The one I had been using required frequent sharpening. While looking for a ceramic blade knife, I came across several positive reviews for Santoku style knives. This one seemed to be a good value. Since receiving this knife several weeks ago, I've used it daily - it's razor sharp and has yet to require re-sharpening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife for the right price","review":"I purchased this knife based on the reviews and I have not been disappointed. It quickly replaced my other knives and is my #1 go to knife. It is very sharp and the grip handle is perfect. In all honesty, I have purchased expensive knives in the past and they have not lived up to their reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real, deep (and fun) understanding of Monk's music.","review":"You may have not heard of Joe Temperly (baritone sax), but this live, co-operative date with jazz pianist and bop stall-worth, Jr. Mance, featuring T.

This book focuses on Medicaid issues. It's expensive, but I thought it was worth it because it was pretty current and aimed at Oklahoma law.Another good book is Elder Law in a Nutshell, by Lawrence A. Frolik and Ricahrd L. Kaplan. This book is written with law students in mind and so covers most aspects of elder law. It is not focused just on Medicaid as is the above book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story","review":"I liked the plot a lot, which deserved a four star. But I did not quite care for the heroine, Mattie. While I thought she was portrayed as a innocent-orphan-turned-into-a-genteel duchess, her character was too weak and indecisive for my liking. Although she did grow into a more matured woman, but it was not until the last three pages of the book. I found I was getting frustrated with her forever \\"fear of been ridiculed by the society\\", and sincerely admired this \\"quite-a-catch\\" hero's patience and love for her, it was more than I thought of her--three stars there.

The DVD quality is exceptionally good for the film's vintage, which means there is no barrier to a modern viewer's full enjoyment of a cinema masterpiece. Bernard and his cast demonstrate a commitment to Victor Hugo's themes and a faith in story-telling that make other filmed versions of the novel seem watered down and fake by comparison. It is long, but the power is magnified, not diminished, by virtue of that. It is another proof of how far the art of cinema came by the 1930s and how far, in most cases, it has fallen short since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Les Miserables","review":"I absolutely love this movie.

Many of the examples presented in the chapters are simplistic and have no relation to the difficulty of the application examples. It's unfortunate that the solutions manual while containing the solutions to the examples does not go into more detail in how to solve these type of problems.

This version was not released theatrically, and it's a good example of a Director's Cut that really does make a difference.

Steely direction by director Lizzie Bordon. Well worth the watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positive message, yet it contradicts itself.","review":"Here we get to see Sean Young, as usual, with Patrick Bergin, give a bad performance. In this film Young plays a Georgia DA who tries to track sex maniac Bergin. The film promotes a good message, and what it's trying to say is that women are not mindless sex objects to be manipulated by men. However, this message got lost in the final edit of the film. Instead, it comes off as looking like a back alley soft-core flick, with endless scenes of female nudity and S&M poses, and spankings. Trust me, save your money and don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean Young at her -- and everyone else's -- worst","review":"Sean Young in this movie gives the worst performance by a big (at the time) star in a Hollywood movie.

See it if only for this historic low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing erotic thriller","review":"There are erotic thrillers that succeed in their genre (e.g. Basic Instinct, Jade), but this one felt awkward and contrived. I think its producers were trying to ride on the coat tails of the immensely popular Basic Instinct by attracting some of that audience. I know that's why I and friends went to see it in theatres. But we were disappointed, both in the story and the acting.I think Sean Young is very attractive, from the first time I saw her in Dune and then in No Way Out, but her nude scenes in this film were embarrassing. I agree with someone else who said her proportions were much better in Ace Ventura and, I might add, Dr. Jeckyll and Ms. Hyde.

Twisting my very long, thick hair into a high bun, then pulling on the cap, my ears are still covered and just my hairline (all around) gets wet; the bulk of my hair stays dry. This is after swimming any stroke for a 45 minute work out. I haven't tried diving to the bottom of the pool, yet. The silicone material seems thicker than any other silicon cap I've owned and should last a long time. Fair price, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literally for long thick hair","review":"I purchase this for my outdoor swimming class, since I have colored treated hair, it protected my hair from the sun and harsh fading and discoloration.

I bought two of these, one in white and one in black. I have worn the black three times and each time when I take the cap off my hair is as wet as if I had never worn the cap. What is the point of the cap if it doesn't keep your hair dry? All my hair does fit into the cap, comfortably. Many of the cheaper silicone caps keep my hair perfectly dry but break after 2-3 uses because they can't take the amount of hair I have.

Then when we landed I'd detach and discreetly put it back in my purse, no one the wiser. I was great! I will use this on every trip I take in the future. The only issue I had was the size to order. I'm a 3X and I had ordered a Large which was way too big. I just cut 1/2 of the belt off, and ended up only using a small amount of the amount that was left. When selling the seatbelt it might make it easier for the purchaser if the size indicated went more along with the size of the person. For instance, I'm thinking a person 2X to 3X would use a small(?) I'm not sure how it would work. But it would definitely make it much easier to purchase.

The first hole was one whole section on the side (so they kept on playing) but the second hole, both in a seam, was in the top section so it would not stay up. The last hole was in the base of the unit so we had to throw it away. The first one we bought last year I had inadvertantly created a hole in it so we thought we would try again.

How could the editor have let the book go through as it is? Yes, it's a beautiful package and well-enough written (though hardly an Edith Wharton novel as one reviewer said, as quoted on the back cover). The book's title is completely deceptive. A good third of the book is not about the Gilded Age at all, but goes back to the 1800-1850 period and sometimes in tedious detail. It does not help me at all to know the customs involved in women making calls upon other women in 1800 when those customs had changed by the late 19th century. While one can make a case that the roots of the Gilded Age need to be exposed, you don't have to go that far back and into that much detail. The First Four Hundred, which this author sneers at in a footnote, is far more focused and helpful, and a much better source of information, though this book's opening chapter was fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally sexist!","review":"I love the concept of this book (the two stories colliding mid-book) but the message totally offends me as a woman and as a mother of a young son and a baby girl. While the editorial review claims that both kids are afraid, that's not the message that comes through most loudly in the book. The little boy may be a bit afraid of the dark but his blanket is a magic carpet that takes him on several adventures, even if he does use it to escape the scary \\"polar bear\\" at the end of his story. Meanwhile, the little girl is explicitly afraid of everything and the blanket becomes a polar bear that protects her from everything. And while I don't mind the idea of a blanket offering a feeling of security, I do mind, very much, the idea that the boy uses his blanket to have bold adventures while the little girl hides from the world behind her blanket. And it's such a shame, because this book would be wonderful without that double standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"A painful reading experience, unless perhaps you've been there or a relative of yours has been there.

Barrett Tillman does a wonderful job of not only giving the reader an idea of what it was like to be there, but also gives a glimpse into the stories of the major players involved.What was it like for the FDO's directing Hellcats into the incoming raids? What was going through the pilots' minds as they searched for their carriers in the dark of night? This book answers those questions and more without getting too caught up in the minutia.If you have an interest in World War Two, the naval war in particular, this book would make an excellent addition to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical play by play","review":"While the author provides us with some interesting new information about this action, it is presented like a sports announcer's play by play. If you like sound bites, you will love this book. Some might appreciate the frequent use of naval slang; but the constant reference to the graduation class of every naval officer mentioned, no matter how briefly, is annoying and distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair and Balanced","review":"This book is a fantastic read. There are two points that make it very interesting. The first is that you can see the agony of decision at every level. The second is the fair portrayal of the courage and determination of the Japanese Navy. As names and equipment parade thru the book, it is loaded with details. You will enjoy this book from front to back. Remember, this book is not simply a recitation of facts. It's a picture of a time and place where carriers clashed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book if all you want is facts, but it was a chore to finish.","review":"Maybe I went in with unrealistic expectations. Tillman's writing style is very dry and dare I say it, boring. That may be due to his subject matter. I can't fault the awesome compilation of facts and detailed information here. It's obvious he researched the subject thoroughly, but I wish his writing was more kinetic and lively in nature. For example, I like the presentation of 'Flags of our Fathers' and 'A Bridge Too Far' much better than this. And, as other reviewers have suggested, battle maps would have been a huge plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not even read the first half of the book","review":"Mr. Tillman, I feel is the Daniel Steele of world war two books. Please Mr Tillman if have only been able to finish one of your books and then it was only because it was so bad it was like not being able to look away from a car accident. I feel that I would walk away with a better understanding watching the History channel, which is what I feel he based this book on and it is merely a novelization of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not finish this book.","review":"It read like an accident report. It had too many details of which pilot did what, with what, to whom. There were many phrases that were not explained enough for the less informed reader. I was looking more for the theory of the battle, rather than how many bullets plane A shot into plane B before it crashed. I made it two-thirds of the way through the book and gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Having participated in the \\"Turkey Shoot\\" I find this book the worst written document I have ever read. It wanders from one war front to the other. It comes up with a lot of uninteresting details about the various commanders. It is a bunch of useleess Trivia. Many of the so called facts are incorrect and many have no bearing on the battle. I feel that I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"History? Or Traffic Report?","review":"Amazon presented an interesting juxtaposition by offering this book and Shattered Sword together. The latter is serious history. Clash of the Carriers seems to be lightweight vignettes in comparison. Tillman is obviously not a historian. His trying to count each kill by each American pilot doesn't count as history. Maybe as traffic or weather reporting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent story ruined by author's biases.","review":"This is an adequate description of the famous battle; especially interesting is the story of the aftermath - all the pilots trying to get back to their ships. The author's obvious status as a Navy groupie, however, leads him to make silly and undocumented statements that detract mightily from his book. Two examples of throwaway lines will suffice - \\"Harry Truman was the most anti-navy president of the twentieth century\\", thus maligning a president who tried to end rivalries and bring some order to our defense establishment by making it sound as if he was \\"against\\" the navy. The second example refers to the Tailhook \\"withhunt\\", as if there were not legitimate reasons to discipline those yahoos. The index is totally inadequate (the words Truman and tailhook are not to be found). There must be better histories of the Marianas battle available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Macho man","review":"This book was written by Barret Tillman with a short forward by Coonts. Tillman has a writing style that makes him seem like he's trying to be a macho literary. He uses phrases like \\"on the morrow\\" in an attempt to add drama but it ends up sounding lame. The way he puts things seem to trivialize the sacrifices on both sides. He wrote that some Japanese pilots were spared the trouble of a return flight. Oooh... clever!If you can get past Tillman's style, it's a good story but it has been better told within other books. If I remember correctly, both Clash of Titans and Clash of Wings cover this action pretty thoroughly and without the lame writing style and title stealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Planes have two wings for balance","review":"This book covers all the basics of a little-known but important battle, but it fails to take the reader beyond the facts and provide a useful interpretation. This is a two-dimensional nuts and bolts popular history for those fascinated by WWII aircraft. The prose is over-wrought and unashamedly politically partisan, which may be OK for an American audience, but undoubtedly will only serve to confuse foreign readers. This is especially apparent in Stephen Coonts foreward, which verges on jingoism. In many ways this book informs us more about the world view of 21st century American warhawks than about World War II. In sum, Tillman's politically partisan approach forgets a fundamental fact of aviation: carrier aircraft have two wings for balance, not just a right wing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harrowing","review":"This is the story of Soyinka's 27 month period of imprisonment at the hands of the Nigerian government. Unlike, say, Nelson Mandela's autobiography, which generally casts a similar subject in its wider political and social contexts, this is fundamentally a personal account, painfully private at times. Essentially, Soyinka found refuge from the brutality inflicted upon him by retreating into and living within his own mind. At times he drifted about the frontiers of madness, hanging on to his self by a thread. At others he pondered, listened, watched, like only the truly otherwise unoccupied can. And, importantly, he also managed to scrounge paper and a pencil from time to time and record his journey of motionlessness. For those interested in the human mind, this is a rewarding book, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest collection of Irish folklore information out there","review":"Whether you are Irish by blood, or just wish you were, A Treasury of Irish Folklore is the book for you.

Whatever is in that collar is so strong that it hurt my cat's nervous system. About 2 hours after I placed the collar around his neck he started to foam at his mouth and shake uncontrollably. It looked like an epileptic attack. The vet confirmed that the seizures were caused by the chemicals in the collar and that he's not sure if my cat is going to make it.........Please if you care about your pets, don't let them suffer and don't buy anything from this company.Check this company's reviews!!!!

We were having flea issues and thought this might help, since our cat likes to go outside. About 3 hours after we put the collar on her, she lied down on the couch and didn't get back up for almost 20 hours. She became very aggressive and hostile toward our kittens (which she has never done)and would not allow anyone to touch her (which she is normally very cuddly). Finally, she had a seizure and we called the vet. He informed us that we needed to take the collar off (which we did) and within 5 minutes she was up and running around. I will never put a flea collar on her again.

The 1st and last quarter of the book has good battle scenes and descriptions. The rest was character development, personal interactions between characters, and the political turmoil created on the planet. I skipped many pages just to get through the novel. If you are a diehard Bolo fan, than add this novel to your collection. For the casual reader who bought this book because of the authors' reputations..I would skip it. This collaboration just didn't gel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow - absolutely unreadable, even for Bolo lovers.","review":"Gosh...I love me some Bolos. Have read 5 or 10 other Bolo books, and liked them all. Absolutely could not get through this one. I can't even think of another book that I couldn't stand long enough to finish...usually am able to plow through to the end \\"just to see what happens,\\" but I just couldn't stomach this.The authors convinced me right away that the bad guys were really bad. Super bad. Like, Darth Vader bad. But the book is 750 pages long. 750 pages that do nothing bad hammer in that point, over and over again, while the only \\"normal\\" characters try to understand \\"How can they be so bad?

Additionally, the battery is much easier to change out, as with the 'Soft Strap' you have to remove 4 small screws to do so: you have to have a very small Phillips head screw driver, and if you're not careful you could easily lose one of the tiny screws. I just don't understand why Garmin had to change to this type of battery compartment, as it is a step backwards in design."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying","review":"Probably the worst phrasebook available.

The price didn't hurt either.Update: It's two years later and this knife is still the best and most reliable knife in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great foray into the world of santoku knives","review":"This was the first santoku that I have ever used, and it has been a wonderful experience thus far. The grip is nice and wide, fitting my fairly large hands easily. The heft of the knife leaves a bit to be desired, though this may be alleviated if I had purchased a longer blade. The metal itself feels sturdy in my fingertips and is slightly flexible on the x-axis, though only with a fair amount of pressure applied. The blade itself is well honed and cut through meats with ease. The spine of the knife has a bit of a bite on either edge, but you are able to apply pressure with your palm without hurting yourself. The blade won't generate enough force to cut through anything terribly thick in a single stroke, but with constant and firm pressure, even the toughest meats will be cleft in twain. I can't give a 5, as this does feel like a beginner's knife (and rightfully so), though for the price it is a must have. Oxo has satisfied me once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Knife","review":"I like this knife a lot,it's sharp, sleek, and easy to use.The one thing I didn't like is that ususally with Santoku knives the product that you're cutting doesn't stick to the knife, which allows you to cut faster, but I find that potatoes stick to this knife.Still very much worth the inexpensive price for a reliable knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larger Santoku Knife","review":"Bought this knife because I was looking for a larger Santoku to chop through larger, harder vegetables. I have four of the small ones I use daily for most of my chopping. But, I needed a larger one and the large chef's knife I have is slightly awkward as I have small hands. This is a perfect size for a larger utility knife and it is a great price for the knife. I was looking for something to use everyday without spending a fortune on a knife and this one works well for what I use it for. Good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed that this knife was not sharp enough to easily cut through a tomato when it arrived.

And, despite the somewhat negative review above, the Postmil view espoused in this book cannot be fairly labeled as merely utopian, and certainly the victory and hope found in Postmil does not deny the teachings of Christ concerning the poor in spirit or those who mourn. Instead, the hope is a final hope. Christ will indeed be vicotrious. That is what is interpreted by Postmils. In fact, Postmil teaching is more often criticized for suggesting GREATER trials instore than it is for offering some type of Utopian bliss. Give it a fair read.

Did Mr.Pratchett mould Death in his image?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Terry Pratchett here came up with one his three best characters. Ok, he didn't make him up, but the earnest deadpan characterisation, and the use of capitalisation to signify Death speaking works wonderfully well, and is a lot of fun.Throw in one of his other best characters, the Librarian, and guaranteed to be decent.A seemingly useless young boy becomes Death's apprentice. Silliness and adventure ensue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discworld is a hoot!","review":"This was my first exposure to Discworld as conceived by Terry Pratchett. As you know (?), Discworld is THE world, a flat disc-shaped world held on the shoulders of four elephants standing on the carapace of a large turtle traveling through space.The laws of physics behave somewhat improperly near the edge.In Mort, Mort is apprenticed to DEATH. Mort is very stoic about the experience, and quite a fast learner.
